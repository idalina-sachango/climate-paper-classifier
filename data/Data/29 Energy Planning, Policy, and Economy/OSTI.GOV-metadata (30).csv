"Cost and Life Cycle Analysis for Deep CO <sub>2</sub> Emissions Reduction for Steel Making: Direct Reduced Iron Technologies","Zang, Guiyan; Sun, Pingping; Elgowainy, Amgad; Bobba, Pallavi; McMillan, Colin; Ma, Ookie; Podkaminer, Kara; Rustagi, Neha; Melaina, Marc; Koleva, Mariya","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; CO2 emissions; direct reduced iron; energy switching; life cycle analysis; steelmaking; techno-economic analysis","We report that among heavy industrial sectors worldwide, the steel industry ranks first in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Technologies that produce direct reduced iron (DRI) enable the industry to reduce emissions or even approach net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for steel production. This study uses comprehensive cradle to gate (CTG) life cycle analysis (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) to evaluate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of three DRI technologies. Compared to the baseline of blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) technology for steel making, using NG to produce DRI has the potential to reduce CTG CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 33%. When 83% or 100% renewable H<sub>2</sub> is used for DRI production, DRI technologies can potentially reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 57% and 67%, respectively, compared to baseline BF-BOF technology. However, the renewable H<sub>2</sub> application for DRI increases the levelized cost of steel (LCOS). When renewable natural gas (RNG) and clean electricity are used for steel production, the CTG CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of all the DRI technologies can potentially be reduced by more than 90% compared to the baseline BF-BOF technology, although the LCOS depends largely on the cost of RNG and clean electricity.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The interaction of wholesale electricity market structures under futures with decarbonization policy goals: A complexity conundrum","Frew, Bethany; Bashar Anwar, Muhammad; Dalvi, Sourabh; Brooks, Adria","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; competitive wholesale electricity markets; market design; decarbonization; capacity expansion modeling; production cost modeling; renewable energy","Competitive wholesale electricity markets can help facilitate energy system decarbonization by incentivizing investments in clean energy technologies that meet evolving system needs. We explore market structure impacts on generator operations and deployment by risk-averse, heterogeneous investor firms using the Electricity Markets and Investment Suite - Agent-based Simulation (EMIS-AS) model. Here we apply clean energy targets of 45%-100% by 2035 considering energy, ancillary services, capacity, and clean energy credit products and pricing and eligibility rules. Results highlight a complexity conundrum, whereby finding the ""right"" market design to achieve decarbonization goals and avoid unintended consequences can be a highly-nuanced, non-incremental challenge. Carefully designed energy-only markets can achieve the same clean energy targets as capacity market structures but with different revenue and profitability outcomes. Operating reserve demand curve-based scarcity pricing can substitute capacity markets for similar deployment outcomes. Carbon pricing alone is most effective at achieving decarbonization levels at low clean energy targets, and clean energy credit markets and carbon pricing are substitutionary at high clean energy targets. Restricting technology participation in capacity and operating reserve markets can impact deployment and operations, even for nonrestricted technologies. Adding an inertia product with fast frequency response yields insufficient provision at high clean energy targets, but work is needed to understand frequency requirements and capabilities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Non-parametric projections of national income distribution consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Narayan, Kanishka B.; O’Neill, Brian C.; Waldhoff, Stephanie T.; Tebaldi, Claudia","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Income distributions; Data science; PCA","Understanding and projecting income distributions within countries and regions is important to understanding consumption trends and the distributional consequences of climate impacts and responses. Several global, country-level projections of income distribution are available but most project only the Gini coefficient (a summary statistic of the distribution) or utilize the Gini along with the assumption of a lognormal distribution. We test the lognormal assumption and find that it typically underestimates income in the highest deciles and over-estimates it in others. We find that a new model based on two principal components of national time series data for income distribution provides a better fit to the data for all deciles, especially for the highest and lowest. We also construct a projection model in which the first principal component is driven by the Gini coefficient and the second captures deviations from this relationship. We use the model to project income distribution by decile for all countries for the five shared socioeconomic pathways. We find that inequality is consistently higher than projections based on the Gini and the lognormal functional form, with some countries reaching ratios of the highest to lowest income deciles that are almost three times their value using the lognormal assumption.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We exercise an existing dispatch optimization model to estimate the profitability of a concentrating solar power plant by incorporating the sale of spinning reserves in the ancillary service market using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model to simulate operations within a 72-h rolling horizon framework. Assuming a price-taker approach with day-ahead energy and spinning reserve prices from both the California Independent System Operator and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, we find that selling spinning reserves in addition to electric energy increases plant profitability by up to 7% with perfect knowledge of day-ahead pricing and solar resource availability. Here, this finding suggests that spinning reserve markets provide significant value streams to concentrating solar power plants that can leverage thermal energy storage to offer reliable production in the short-to-medium term.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A stochastic model of future extreme temperature events for infrastructure analysis","Villa, Daniel L.; Schostek, Tyler; Govertsen, Krissy; Macmillan, Madeline","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Stochastic modeling; Climate change; Extreme temperatures; Heat waves; Shifts in frequency; Duration and intensity; Infrastructure; Building energy modeling; Resilience Stochastic models","Applying extreme temperature events for future conditions is not straightforward for infrastructure resilience analyses. This work introduces a stochastic model that fills this gap. The model uses at least 50 years of daily extreme temperature records, climate normals with 10%-90% confidence intervals, and shifts/offsets for increased frequency and intensity of heat wave events. Intensity and frequency are shifted based on surface temperature anomaly from 1850-1900 for 32 models from CMIP6. A case study for Worcester, Massachusetts passed 85% of cases using the two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov -value test with 95% confidence for both temperature and duration. Future shifts for several climate scenarios to 2020, 2040, 2060, and 2080 had acceptable errors between the shifted model and 10- and 50-year extreme temperature event thresholds with the largest error being 2.67 degrees C. The model is likely to be flexible enough for other patterns of extreme weather such as extreme precipitation and hurricanes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet while wind, solar, and—more recently—storage have all seen significant U.S. deployment in recent years, deployment of new geothermal plants has barely budged over the same period. We explain this disparity in historical deployment by analyzing empirical price data from power purchase agreements (PPAs) and wholesale energy and capacity markets, which demonstrate that geothermal has historically offered a lower “net value” (i.e., wholesale market value minus PPA price) than these other resources. Looking ahead through 2026, continued growth in the market share of wind, solar, and storage should improve geothermal's relative market value, yet likely not by enough to overcome the persistent cost gap between geothermal and these other, lower-cost resources. In the face of this challenging market outlook, policy intervention and continued R&D investments may be warranted to sustain a vibrant geothermal industry that stands ready to contribute to the late stages of decarbonization.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Nuclear energy deployment is highest with combinations of stringent emissions policies, nuclear cost reductions, and constraints on the deployment of other technologies, which underscores model dimensions related to these areas.

"<strong>JUST-R</strong> metrics for considering energy justice in early-stage energy research","Dutta, Nikita S.; Gill, Elizabeth; Arkhurst, Bettina K.; Hallisey, Mary; Fu, Katherine; Anderson, Kate","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; decarbonization; energy justice; energy system; social inequity","We report achieving sustainable decarbonization of the energy sector requires implementing and improving energy technologies while simultaneously managing sources of social inequity in the energy system. Centering energy justice, which has ""the goal of achieving equity in both the social and economic participation in the energy system, while also remediating social, economic, and health burdens on those historically harmed by the energy system,"" in the transition to clean energy has become an increasingly urgent priority for social scientists, policymakers, and community activists alike. However, late-stage consideration of social impacts of energy technologies may result in identifying inequities only after substantial time, money, and effort have been expended on research and development (R&D). This issue is exemplified by concerns over environmental and human health impacts related to cobalt in lithium-ion batteries, which has spurred research into alternatives only after decades of R&D and the establishment of supply chains, infrastructure, and markets for cobalt-containing chemistries. Other examples include issues with land use and resource consumption related to first-generation biofuel feedstocks as well as occupational hazards and pollution associated with photovoltaics manufacturing. In all these cases, subsequent R&D to improve technologies or processes cannot undo the effects already experienced. Incorporating energy justice from the earliest stage of R&D will enable more just technology implementation, but integrating justice considerations into early-stage research is a challenge due to a lack of tools to assess and manage them. To fill this gap, we center early-stage research to develop the Justice Underpinning Science and Technology Research (JUST-R) metrics framework - energy justice metrics specifically targeted at early-stage researchers to assess their work on an immediate timescale. By applying these metrics to a case study focused on materials for next-generation photovoltaics, we highlight potential benefits and barriers to implementing this framework in early-stage research and discuss necessary institutional and individual actions needed for researchers to effectively leverage the tool to incorporate justice-focused criteria into R&D decision making.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, market mechanisms are being introduced to reduce generation costs and improve system reliability. Here, we quantify the climate and human health impacts brought about by this transition, modeling China’s power system operations under economic dispatch. We find that significant reductions in mortality related to air pollution (11%) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (3%) from the power sector can be attained by economic dispatch, relative to the equal-share approach, through more efficient coal-powered generation. Additional health and climate benefits can be achieved by incorporating emission externalities in electricity generation costs. However, the benefits of the transition to economic dispatch will be unevenly distributed across China and may lead to increased health damage in some regions. Our results show the potential of dispatch decision-making in electricity generation to mitigate the negative impacts of power plant emissions with existing facilities in China.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This work lays out the process of developing such a model while relying primarily on publicly available data and highlighting critical partnerships necessary for model development success. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of the process used to develop an accurate energy model for a disadvantaged community when minimal building and energy use data is available. The heart of the model is the physics-based community scale energy modeling platform URBANopt. Using a bottom-up load modeling approach, energy simulated energy use falls within 3% or less of aggregate annual utility data, and within 10% or less aggregate monthly utility data. The demonstrated model development and tuning process can be used by others to characterize other atypical communities, which may differ significantly from prototypical models.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, this paper proposes an analytics model for quantifying the interdependence between the resilience of power and water distribution systems. The proposed model first performs spatio-temporal outage analysis on the PDS and WDS to determine the PDS power serving capability and the resulting cascading impact on the WDS water serving capability during the occurrence of disruptions. The resilience interdependence is then determined by a proposed set of six metrics calculated using the power and water serving capability profiles, which trace and quantify the cascading impacts of power outages in the operation of WDSs during the degradation and recovery stages. The proposed analytics model is implemented on the IEEE 33-bus power distribution system supplying power for pumping stations of a 15-node test WDS, considering multiple cases of water storage capacity, single and multiple outage scenarios, and availability of distributed generation. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed metrics track the temporal and spatial interdependence between the resilience of power and water distribution systems, providing a mechanism to identify weak spots, and assess options to enhance the resilience of the critical water infrastructure.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

Manufacturing is responsible for a significant amount of energy/material consumption and environmental burden and, therefore, has a great opportunity to reduce its impact through green manufacturing. Green manufacturing presents opportunities across the manufacturing enterprise to increase the efficient usage of energy and material resources. These opportunities include designing products to consume fewer materials and energy during manufacturing and use, incorporating more efficient manufacturing processes, streamlining and optimizing manufacturing schedules and plans, and circularizing products. The goal of this paper will be to provide a perspective from the authors on the opportunities that exist within green manufacturing for discrete products through a review of pertinent topics and future directions. The paper will focus on processes, manufacturing equipment, manufacturing systems, recovering value at a product’s end-of-life, and additional thoughts that include metrics and indicators, techno-economic assessment, and a discussion of efficiency and effectiveness. Key findings from this review include a need for social indicators and renewable energy considerations in scheduling and process planning, integrating Industry 4.0 into circular economy along with social and institutional dimensions, consistency in the ability to measure and conceptualize metrics and indicators, a detailed evaluation of the life cycle impacts and cost of Addit Manuf, and more human and environment-oriented considerations for smart manufacturing.","OAE Publishing Inc.","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); US Army Research Laboratory (USARL); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Sustainable Transportation.

The spatial dynamics of these are key to generating and interpreting outputs of transportation models that are most relevant for a community and the diverse mobility needs of its members. Here we present a typology transfer framework, grounded in socio-spatial dynamics shaping people's mobility, to take transportation-themed regional mobility model outcomes, in this case from two agent-based models (ABMs), and extrapolate them to other cities, with less time and resource intensity than new ABM development. The typology transfer process first identifies micro-urban social types (MUSTs) using socio-spatial factors, then defines city types based on spatial patterns of MUSTs to assess across which cities transfer results are likely to best hold. Lastly, a typology transfer multiplier matrix extrapolates a given variable, in our case the Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric, to another city. The full process demonstration uses ABM results from Chicago (POLARIS model) and San Francisco (BEAM model), applying them to New York City. We discuss how MEP or other outputs can be appropriately estimated and used for integrated, human-centered mobility analysis. Key findings include that this MUST framework of user-defined dependent and independent variables allows tailoring ABM results and interpretations to specific community needs and data availability. Findings clarify that positive outcomes can be targeted towards user groups, based on sociospatial characteristics, using a typology approach, such as inclusive access to mobility choices, transportation affordability, and greater efficiency in resource use.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Recycling strategies can recapture this wasted material, but there is a lack of quantitative and transparent data on the capabilities and impacts of these processes. Here, we develop a data set of material quality, material retention, circularity, contamination tolerance, minimum selling price, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, land use, toxicity, waste generation, and water use metrics for closed-loop polymer recycling technologies, including mechanical recycling and solvent-based dissolution of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polypropylene, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis, glycolysis, and vapor methanolysis of PET. Mechanical recycling and PET glycolysis display the best economic (9%-73% lower than competing technologies) and environmental (7%-88% lower) performances, while dissolution, enzymatic hydrolysis, and methanolysis provide the best recyclate material qualities (2%-27% higher). We identify electricity, steam, and organic solvents as top process contributors to these metrics and apply sensitivity and multicriteria decision analyses to highlight key future research areas. The estimates derived in this work provide a quantitative baseline for comparing and improving recycling technologies, can help reclaimers identify optimal end-of-life routes for given waste streams, and serve as a framework for assessing future innovations.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Several net-zero initiatives are taking place around the globe to achieve a balance between the GHGs put into the atmosphere and those taken out. While most efforts present a sectorized approach, this paper describes the importance of integrating information across different sectors for effective modeling of carbon emissions and holistic reduction opportunity analysis. Using the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) campus as a test case, this work provides a web-based tool for INL stakeholders to use when engaging in strategic planning to achieve carbon emissions reduction. This net-zero engineering support tool (NEST) uses historical data as foundational information for applying the modeling framework. Prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions throughout project completion integrates various approaches and schedules aimed at energy conservation, fleet decarbonization, and other GHG reduction activities. Using NEST, stakeholders can visualize carbon emissions, electricity consumption, and costs for decision making when planning the pathway for reaching carbon net zero. The INL’s initiative to transition into an EV fleet was used to demonstrate the developed framework and the advantages of using NEST. It was shown that electrifying different fossil-fueled campus vehicles before 2030 with aggressive replacement schedules require high annual capital expenditure (CAPEX), which may not be available. The tool allows decision makers to test different replacement schedules and prioritize those that yield CAPEX below a certain threshold while meeting target milestones. While the demonstration focused on vehicle electrification, the developed framework lays the foundation for further quantitative analysis of other GHG reduction activities.","MDPI","","Idaho National Lab.

"Developing an equity-focused metric for quantifying the social burden of infrastructure disruptions","Clark, Susan Spierre; Peterson, Sara K. E.; Shelly, Michael A.; Jeffers, Robert F.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; capabilities approach; community resilience; resilience metrics; resilient infrastructure; social burden; social equity","Communities in the United States are increasingly dependent upon aging infrastructure systems and challenged by more frequent and intense extreme weather events due in part to climate change. However, prioritizing resilience-related investments in these systems is hindered by the lack of performance metrics that objectively quantify the societal outcomes of infrastructure disruptions, such as power or water outages. This article outlines the process of developing an equity-focused resilience metric that captures the social consequences of infrastructure service disruptions on households. Theoretically grounded in the Capabilities Approach (CA) theory of human development, this metric focuses on estimating the burden of post-event adaptations taken by households to maintain their basic capabilities (e.g., ability to access food and water) and fulfill important household functionings (e.g., maintaining health and well-being). A travel cost method (TCM) that considers travel-related expenses, direct out-of-pocket expenses, and opportunity costs is presented as a way to measure the value of locations (e.g., grocery stores, emergency shelters, etc.) that provide services that enable households to maintain capabilities. A gravity-weighted model of accessibility is also discussed as a way to capture the value of having multiple potential service locations from which to choose and offers a way to capture important factors impacting a household’s ability to access important goods and services during outages. The proposed social burden metric equation incorporates the valuation principles of the TCM into the framework of the gravity model, resulting in a novel metric with strong methodological heritage. The article concludes by discussing the types of data needed to populate the proposed metric and future applications of this work that could inform the resilient infrastructure investments and planning necessary to mitigate the social burdens of power outages on vulnerable populations.","Informa UK Limited","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Emission factors (EFs) vary from region to region, which requires the use of spatially relevant EF data for electricity production while performing life cycle assessments (LCAs). Uncertainty information, which is sought by LCA practitioners, is rarely supplied with available life cycle inventories (LCIs). To address these challenges, we present a method for collecting data from different sources for electricity generation and environmental emissions; discuss the challenges involved in agglomerating such data; provide relevant suggestions and solutions to merge the information; and calculate EFs for electricity generation processes from various fuel sources for different spatial regions and spatial resolutions. The EFs from the US 2016 Electricity Life Cycle Inventory (eLCI) are analyzed and explored in this study. We also explore the method of uncertainty information derivation for the EFs. We explore the EFs from different technologies across Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) regions in the USA. We find that for certain eGRID regions, the same electricity production technology may have worse emissions. This may be a result of the age of the plants in the region, the quality of fuel used, or other underlying factors. Region-wise life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) ISO 14040 impacts for total generation mix activities provide an overview of the total sustainability profile of electricity production in a particular region, rather than only global warming potential (GWP). We also find that, for different LCIA impacts, several eGRID regions are consistently worse than the US average LCIA impact for every unit of electricity generated. Here this work describes the development of an electricity production LCI at different spatial resolutions by combining and harmonizing information from several databases. The inventory consists of emissions, fuel inputs, and electricity and steam outputs from different electricity production technologies located across various regions of the USA. This LCI for electricity production in the USA will prove to be an enormous resource for all LCA researchers - considering the detailed sources of the information and the breadth of emissions covered by it.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Natural variability in this teleconnection has not been robustly quantified, complicating the detection of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use a linear inverse model (LIM) to quantify natural variability in the ENSO-SWUS teleconnection. The LIM yields realistic teleconnection patterns with century-scale variability comparable to simulations from the Last Millennium Ensemble project and the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6. The variability quantified by the LIM illuminates two aspects of our understanding of ENSO and its impacts: the inherent statistics of the observable system can produce century-long periods with a wide range of correlations to SWUS hydroclimate, including nonsignificant correlations, and thus that detecting changes in ENSO-related hydroclimate variability is challenging in a changing climate.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Decarbonizing the grid: Utilizing demand-side flexibility for carbon emission reduction through locational marginal emissions in distribution networks","Park, Byungkwon; Dong, Jin; Liu, Boming; Kuruganti, Teja","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; active distribution network; carbon emissions; decarbonization; demand-side flexibility; load shift; locational marginal emission","Decarbonization of the electric grid has become an important world-wide priority and is actively happening in many ways by introducing innovations and new technologies from the generation sectors to the demand sectors. In particular, one promising pathway toward such net-zero carbon emissions is to utilize the demand-side flexibility with the increasing number of flexible loads in distribution networks. In this paper, we explore a load shifting strategy with the emerging concept of location marginal emissions (LMEs) to reduce carbon emissions. LMEs measure the impact of carbon emissions including the locational aspect in more granular way and thus provide a novel mechanism for the system operator and load aggregators to design the LME-based load shifting strategy, which can efficiently guide consumers and thus adjust their consumption behaviors. Simulation case studies on the IEEE test networks are performed to validate the capability of the proposed load shifting method to reduce carbon emissions. We also compare this with other relevant strategies to discuss multiple scenarios and corresponding results. Finally, while each provides a different level of flexibility, all the explored strategies tested have led to solutions that have lower carbon emissions, indicating the great potential of demand-side flexibility in reducing carbon emissions for future distribution networks.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Current commercial magnet technologies rely heavily on several critical materials such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, samarium, and cobalt which are primarily sourced and refined outside of the United States (U.S.). To combat these problems, the Critical Materials Institute (CMI) has begun research into novel magnet compositions aimed at replacing the conventional, commercial magnet technologies with more readily available raw materials in the U.S. or reduced critical materials content. Additionally, these novel magnets can fulfill a gap that exists in the market between the higher performance neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B) and samarium cobalt (Sm-Co) magnets and the lower performance ferrite magnets or bonded Nd-Fe-B magnets, earning the term gap magnets. This research seeks to compile a strategy for identifying an application for these novel magnets and assessing preliminary market impacts through substitution for two example magnets. The first novel magnet was identified to be applicable for ancillary motors and sensors in conventional gasoline vehicles with a maximum substitution of 4,825 metric tonnes (mt) per year by the year 2050. The second novel magnet was identified to be applicable for magnetic couplings in energy and industrial sectors with a maximum substitution of 978 mt per year by the year 2050.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

This paper presents a comparative techno-economic analysis and process sustainability assessment of four conversion pathways: (1) hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet wastes such as sewage sludge and manure; (2) fast pyrolysis of woody biomass; (3) landfill gas Fischer–Tropsch synthesis; and (4) lignin–ethanol oil from the lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery utilizing reductive catalytic fractionation. These alternative marine biofuels have a modeled minimum fuel selling price between $\$$1.68 and $\$$3.98 per heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent in 2016 U.S. dollars based on a mature plant assessment. The selected pathways also exhibit good process sustainability performance in terms of water intensity compared to the petroleum refineries. Further, the O and S contents of the biofuels vary widely. While the non-HTL biofuels exhibit negligible S content, the raw biocrudes via HTL pathways from sludge and manure show relatively high S contents (>0.5 wt %). Partial or full hydrotreatment can effectively lower the biocrude S content. Additionally, co-feeding with other low-sulfur wet wastes such as food waste can provide another option to produce raw biocrude with lower S content to meet the target with further hydrotreatment. This study indicates that biofuels could be a cost-effective fuel option for the marine sector. Marine biofuels derived from various feedstocks and conversion technologies could mitigate marine biofuel adoption risk in terms of feedstock availability and biorefinery economics.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Weibull distribution law has been used extensively to analyze the wind characteristics of candidate WPP sites, and to estimate the available and deliverable energy. This paper presents a comparative study of five wind energy resource assessment methods as they applied to the context of wind sites in West Sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated three numerical approaches, namely, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the multilayer perceptron method (MLP), and support vector regression (SVR), to derive the distribution law of wind speeds and to optimally quantify the corresponding wind energy potential. Next, we compared these three approaches to two well-known Weibull distribution law-based methods: the empirical method of Justus (EMJ) and the maximum likelihood method (MLM). Case study results indicated that the neural network-based methods, ANFIS and MLP, yielded the most accurate distribution fits and wind energy potential estimates, and consequently, are the most recommended methods for the wind sites in Togo and Benin. The orders of magnitude of the root mean squared error (RMSE) in estimating the recoverable energy using ANFIS were, respectively, 10-4 and 10-5 for Lomé and Cotonou, while MLP achieved an RMSE order of magnitude of 10-3 for both sites.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Countries often report not having enough qualified staff for performing building energy code inspections and many are exploring faster, easier, and more reliable methods to check the compliance of buildings with their codes. Building inspections are a critical element for ensuring code compliance and they have traditionally been performed in person. However, in-person inspections can be labor and travel intensive, costly, and prone to human error. In this paper, the authors explore how virtual inspections, particularly in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted processes for building code compliance checks in jurisdictions and communities around the world. Here, the authors collected data on four key parameters (time and financial savings, scope of inspections, changing practices and technological innovation, and benefits to consumers) from six jurisdictions and communities in five countries (Australia, Canada, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and the United States) to analyze the impacts of virtual inspections on code compliance checks. The analysis found the greatest value from virtual inspections in geographically dispersed regions and for cities experiencing rapid building construction. The study also explored emerging technologies that are being piloted for virtual inspections. Although many of these technologies hold promise, more resources and capacity are needed to make them viable for use in building energy code inspections.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Characterizing manufacturing sector disruptions with targeted mitigation strategies","Elimbi Moudio, Marie Pelagie; Bolin, Richard; Carpenter, Alberta; Reese, Samantha Bench; Shehabi, Arman; Rao, Prakash","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; disruption mitigation; manufacturing; supply chain risk; resilient systems; risk management","It has become clear in recent decades that manufacturing supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to disruptions of varying geographical scales and intensities. These disruptions—whether intentional, accidental, or resulting from natural disasters—cause failures and capacity reductions to manufacturing infrastructure, with lasting effects that can cascade throughout the manufacturing network. An overall lack of understanding of solutions to mitigate disturbances has rendered the challenge of reducing manufacturing supply chain vulnerability even more difficult. Additionally, the variability of disruptions and their impacts complicates policy maker and stakeholder efforts to plan for specific disruptive scenarios. It is necessary to comprehend different kinds of disturbances and group them based on stakeholder-provided metrics to support planning processes and modeling efforts that promote adaptable, resilient manufacturing supply chains. This paper reviews existing methods for risk management in manufacturing supply chains and the economic and environmental impacts of disruptions. In addition, we develop a framework using agglomerative hierarchical clustering to classify disruptions using U.S. manufacturing network data between 2000 and 2021 and characteristic metrics defined in the literature. Our review identifies five groups of disruptions and discusses both general mitigation methods and strategies targeting each identified group. Further, we highlight gaps in the literature related to estimating and including environmental costs in disaster preparedness and mitigation planning. We also discuss the lack of easily available metrics to quantify environmental impacts of disruptions and how such metrics could be included into our methodology.","IOP Science","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Over the past 30 years, such efforts have advanced technology performance and reduced cost by leveraging network effects and economies of scale. After demonstrating promise in applied R and D, successful clean energy and energy efficiency technologies are incorporated into an initial product sold by the private sector. Despite its importance, processes by which first commercialization occurs are difficult to generalize while capturing specific insights from practitioners in markets and technologies. This paper presents a policy-focused qualitative assessment of the first commercialization of four diverse energy technologies: thin film photovoltaics, wind turbine blades, dual-stage refrigeration evaporators, and fuel cells for material handling equipment. Each technology presents distinct value propositions, markets, and regulatory drivers. The case studies indicate three common characteristics of successful first commercialization for new energy technologies: 1) good fit between the technology, R&amp;D infrastructure, and public-private partnership models; 2) high degree of alignment of government regulations and R&amp;D priorities with market forces; and 3) compatibility between time scales required for R&amp;D, product development, and opportunities. These findings may inform energy investment decision-making, maximize benefits from R&amp;D, and advance the transition to a low-emission future.</p>","Frontiers Media SA","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Quantifying policy gaps for achieving the net-zero GHG emissions target in the U.S. light-duty vehicle market through electrification","Ou, Shiqi; Lin, Zhenhong; Jiang, Yilan; Zhang, Shengyong","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; consumer welfare; electric vehicle; vehicle and energy policy; greenhouse gas emissions target; internal combustion engine vehicle banning; light-duty vehicle","The U.S. light-duty vehicle (LDV) industry, a major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting sector, is embracing decarbonization. Considering only electrification pathways, this study uses publicly-available tools – MA3T and VISION on vehicle market penetration, fleet accounting and life-cycle analysis to quantify the policy gaps for LDVs to achieve the net-zero GHG emissions target in nine vehicle penetration cases under two electricity mix scenarios, including the U.S. administration's decarbonization strategy – 100% clean electricity by 2035. The MA3T model is a multinomial discrete choice model for market share projection by vehicle technology, and the VISION is a vehicle stocks and GHG emissions projection model by using vehicle and travel characteristics. This study projects the impacts of technology and policy enforcement on shaping the dynamics and decarbonization of the LDV market. Additionally, achieving the expected improvement of battery technology and charging infrastructure is critical but can only reduce the 2050 GHG emissions to 48–54% of the 2020 level under the electricity renewable mix scenario. It is almost impossible to achieve a 100% battery electric vehicle stock by 2050 and the 2050 net-zero target in the LDV industry unless ban of internal combustion engine technology is implemented starting in 2035 and under the 2035 100% clean electricity scenario. These extreme conditions also sacrifice most from the consumer welfare perspective. A greater policy forcing intensity accelerates plug-in electric vehicle penetration, while with declining marginal effect and reduced consumer welfare. Among the investigated policy scenarios, the policy forcing intensity equivalent to a fuel tax of $1–2 per gasoline gallon reduces the most GHG emissions while keeping a positive consumer welfare.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Nuclear-renewable integrated energy system (NR-IES) concepts are a leading solution that couples a nuclear power plant with renewable energy, hydrogen generation plants, and energy storage systems, such that thermal and electrical power are dispatchable to fulfill grid-flexibility requirements while also producing hydrogen and maximizing revenue. Here, this paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework to address the complex decision-making tasks for NR-IES. The objective is to maximize revenue by generating and selling hydrogen and electricity simultaneously according to their time-varying prices while keeping the energy flow in the subsystems in balance. A Python-based simulator for a NR-IES concept has been developed to integrate with OpenAI Gym and Ray/RLlib to enable an efficient and flexible computational framework for DRL research and development. Three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms have been investigated, including two-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), soft-actor critic (SAC), proximal policy optimization (PPO), to illustrate DRL’s superiority for controlling NR-IES by comparing it with a conventional control approach, particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this effort, PPO has shown more-stable performance and also better generalization capability than SAC and TD3. Comparisons with PSO have demonstrated that, on average, PPO can achieve 13.9% more mean episode returns from the training process and 29.4% more mean episode returns from the testing process when different hydrogen-production targets are applied.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

However, with the emerging of new technologies, one conventional assumption, on which many models rely, that all the day-to-day observations on the network follow a single pattern appears to be questionable. To better understand network flow patterns and their respective similarities, cluster analysis that partitions the day-to-day data into groups is an effective solution, but directly applying generic clustering algorithms may not always be appropriate identifying and interpreting day-to-day pattern changes due to the ignorance of the transportation network characteristics. In view of this practical issue, we propose a new clustering method that integrates network flow models, namely a statistical traffic assignment model and a probabilistic OD travel demand estimation model, into generic clustering algorithms. It essentially examines the probabilistic characteristics of traffic data by projecting those onto the dimensions of OD demands. For this reason, it can deal with traffic data where observations on some days and locations may be missing, or observing locations may change from day to day. The proposed algorithm embeds the domain knowledge of the transportation network, and is tested on two toy networks and one real-world network. Numerical experiments show the new clustering algorithm can effectively identify and interpret patterns that are hard to see by generic clustering algorithms otherwise, even with missing values or day-varying sensing locations.","Elsevier","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United Kingdom","2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies Journal Volume: 144 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 103882","","","DOE-EE0008466; EE0008466; CMMI-1751448","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X; S0968090X22002959; 103882; PII: S0968090X22002959","10.1016/j.trc.2022.103882","","2022-10-07T00:00:00Z","1891165","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1891165","","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","C","144"

The high renewable penetration made future large interconnected grids (LIGs) more volatile and hard to understand using historical observations. This led to the need to study future LIGs using a wide range of future year operating conditions and contingencies. However, existing planning tools are not sufficient for the dynamic security assessment (DSA) of these future LIGs due to a lack of detailed modeling capabilities and computational limitations when processing a wide range of scenarios. This paper addresses these two challenges by proposing; 1) a framework that can generate dynamic simulation data for a wide range of scenarios. This dynamic simulation data is generated by respecting the constraints of production cost models and their respective AC power flow dynamic simulation models at an hourly resolution. The framework also models the cascading behavior of LIGs; 2) a machine learning-based approach for fast scanning DSA data. The proposed simulation framework is used to generate 1.485 terabytes of dynamic simulation data for the 2028 WECC system containing 4455 scenarios. The proposed machine learning framework used the 2028 WECC system to demonstrate its effectiveness and speed in identifying the critical scenarios based on their total count of voltage and frequency violations.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Sensitivity of the U.S. economy to oil prices controlling for domestic production and imports","Oladosu, Gbadebo A.; Leiby, Paul; Uria-Martinez, Rocio; Bowman, David","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; oil price; domestic oil supply, oil import; economy; elasticities, autoregressive distributed lag","This paper investigates the sensitivity of U.S. economic performance to oil price changes, accounting for changes in the domestic petroleum supply-demand balance over the last decade. Herein, a non-linear (asymmetric) autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model is used to estimate the U.S. GDP elasticity with respect to the oil price, controlling for oil production, consumption and imports, and macroeconomic variables. The positive and negative components of the oil price both have statistically significant long-run impacts on the real U.S. GDP. The parameter estimates imply that a 1% positive and permanent oil price shock, all else the same, would have a long-run impact of –0.045% on the U.S. economy (an elasticity of –0.045), but short-run parameters on the positive oil price terms are not significant at the 10% level. The long-run parameter on the negative oil price component term implies an elasticity of –0.034. Thus, controlling for domestic U.S. oil production and oil trade, the long-run oil price elasticity of the U.S. GDP remains within the range of estimates from previous studies. The results also show that domestic oil production and consumption have short-run impacts on the U.S. GDP. The potential extent of interactions among these variables, and implications for the net economic impacts, under an oil price shock are subjects of future research.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

E.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; hybrid power systems, wind energy, solar energy, battery storage","Renewable energy technology adoption is on the rise in the United States, with high levels of new resources expected to be needed to meet national clean energy goals. While distributed wind energy has over 1,400 GW of potentially profitable deployment, less than 0.01% of that has currently been deployed. One barrier to distributed wind energy adoption is the variability of the wind resource, which can cause uncertainty and instability in the grid if not accounted for. Pairing distributed wind with other technologies, such as solar photovoltaics and/or energy storage, can alleviate some of the issues related to variability due to potential complementarity of resources and dispatchability. In this study we describe the potential impacts of adding solar photovoltaics and/or energy storage to a distributed wind energy installation, providing a qualitative ranking system for each value stream that might be available for the new hybrid power system, and quantitative results for the potential dollars per year that might be possible for select value streams. We find that hybridizing can add value to all value streams, though adding energy storage makes these impacts much larger than simply adding solar photovoltaics.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Static and dynamic modeling of steam integration for a NuScale small modular reactor and pulp and paper mill coupling for carbon-neutral manufacturing","Worsham, Elizabeth K.; Terry, Stephen D.","03 NATURAL GAS; 22 GENERAL STUDIES OF NUCLEAR REACTORS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; paper mill; pulp and paper; carbon neutral; manufacturing; smr; kraft cycle","Small modular reactors (SMRs) are reactor designs producing less than 300 MWe and are generally planned for deployment as multimodule nuclear power plants. The possibility of factory-manufactured, flexibly sized plants expands the opportunities for nuclear power to different communities and industries, including manufacturing plants that currently utilize fossil fuels to produce both steam and electricity. This paper examines the feasibility of coupling a NuScale SMR with a midsize pulp and paper mill in the Southeastern United States. A steady-state mill model was developed in Aspen HYSYS, based on real data from the operation of the mill, and modified it to include the SMR while maintaining steam quality requirements and making as few changes as possible to existing equipment. Dynamic plant models were also developed Dymola to demonstrate possible plant conditions, using three configurations. Preliminary results suggest that, while SMR coupling is physically feasible, its economic feasibility is limited by the differences in steam and electricity demands. Because of limitations in the amount of steam the mill can take from the SMR, sizing the SMR for the plant’s steam demand may result in an electricity deficit, or vice versa. Furthermore, dynamic analyses show that the addition of a thermal storage system could reduce such deficits, but this entails its own challenges. Each plant must determine the best configuration and control scheme for itself, based on its electricity and heat needs, including the peak duration and intensity for both. Ultimately, an implementation of SMRs with manufacturing processes would benefit from partnering with a local utility to purchase excess electricity generated by the SMR. This will help manufacturing facilities meet their environmental and cost-savings goals, in addition to meeting the need for cost-effective baseload power across the United States.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"A Case Study about Energy and Cost Impacts for Different Community Scenarios Using a Community-Scale Building Energy Modeling Tool","Ye, Yunyang; Lei, Xuechen; Lerond, Jeremy; Zhang, Jian; Brock, Eli Thomas","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; distributed energy resource; connected community; power demand; electricity tariff; building simulation","The United States building sector consumed approximately 75% of electricity in 2019. By implementing renewable energy technologies and control strategies into buildings, future buildings will serve as energy generators as well as consumers. To accommodate this transition, communications among buildings and between buildings and the grid could provide more possibilities to optimize the energy performance of buildings. This paper develops a community-scale building energy model tool and conducts a case study adopting behind-the-meter distributed energy resources, sharing energy in different buildings, and using different electricity tariff structures. Three scenarios are studied: (1) electricity only supplied by the grid, (2) photovoltaic (PV) panels installed on and available to some but not all buildings, and (3) a connected community. To consider the impacts of locations and energy tariffs, this paper selects four cities and three electricity tariffs to evaluate the energy and cost performances of these three scenarios. The results show that the PV panels in Scenario 2 reduce 25% to 33% of the community-level electricity consumption and 20% to 30% of the community-level electricity cost compared with Scenario 1 in all studied locations and energy tariffs. By considering power management in the connected community (Scenario 3), the electricity consumption and cost can be further reduced by 6% to 7% and 5% to 11%, respectively, compared with Scenario 2.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Principles to adapt financing mechanisms for fully integrated hybrid energy systems","Cox, Jordan; Murphy, Caitlin; Foss, Andrew","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; financing; hybrid; nuclear; renewable","<p>As the electricity sector evolves, and as all energy types (thermal, electric, chemical, etc.) become more coupled, there has been increased interest to develop and deploy hybrid energy systems (HES). This work focuses on fully integrated HES, where there are multiple energy sources and multiple energy products, often coupled through a storage buffer. A significant amount of the available literature on this work describes technology pathways for fully integrated HES; however, it is unclear how financial institutions should treat these systems. Fully integrated HES represent an increase in complexity from their stand-alone counterparts, but they also potentially mitigate financial risk and provide value to the energy system, which has not yet been accounted for in financing mechanisms that could help to enable such systems. This paper provides some examples of fully integrated HES and proposes principles to help adapt financing to adequately capture the value of such systems.</p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The challenges primarily stem from the infrequent utilization of assets deployed to meet high demand periods, which require very high revenue during those periods to recover capital costs. Achieving 100% carbon-free electricity obviates the use of traditional fossil-fuel-based generation technologies, by themselves, to serve the last increment of demand—which we refer to as the “last 10%.” Here, in this study, we survey strategies for overcoming this last 10% challenge, including extending traditional carbon-free energy sources (e.g., wind and solar, other renewable energy, and nuclear), replacing fossil fuels with carbon-free fuels for combustion (e.g., hydrogen- and biomass-based fuels), developing carbon capture and carbon dioxide removal technologies, and deploying multi-day demand-side resources. We qualitatively compare economic factors associated with the low-utilization condition and discuss unique challenges of each option to inform the complex assessments needed to identify a portfolio that could achieve carbon-free electricity. Although many electricity systems are a long way from requiring these last 10% technologies, research and careful consideration are needed soon for the options to be available when electricity systems approach 90% carbon-free electricity.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This unprecedented global scale-up will stress existing PV supply chains with increased material and energy demands. By 2050, 1.75 TW of PV in the US cumulatively demands 97 million metric tonnes of virgin material and creates 8 million metric tonnes of life cycle waste. This analysis leverages the PV in Circular Economy tool (PV ICE) to evaluate two circular economy approaches, lifetime extension and closed-loop recycling, on their ability to reduce virgin material demands and life cycle wastes while meeting capacity goals. Modules with 50-year lifetimes can reduce virgin material demand by 3% through reduced deployment. Modules with 15-year lifetimes require an additional 1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain capacity, increasing virgin material demand and waste unless >90% of module mass is closed-loop recycled. Currently, no PV technology is more than 90% closed-loop recycled. Glass, the majority of mass in all PV technologies and an energy intensive component with a problematic supply chain, should be targeted for a circular redesign.

These can typically be mitigated through responsive and proactive operations and maintenance (O&M) activities. However, to generate profit, the cost of O&M must be lower than the value of the recovered electricity. This value depends both on the amount of recovered energy and on the electricity prices, which can vary significantly over time in spot markets. The present work investigates the impact of the electricity price variability on the PV profitability and on the related O&M activities in Italy, Portugal, and Spain. Here, it is found that the PV revenues varied by 1.6 × to 1.8 × within the investigated countries in the last 5 years. Moreover, forecasts predict higher average prices in the current decade compared to the previous one. These will increase the future PV revenues by up to 60% by 2030 compared to their 2015–2020 mean values. These higher revenues will make more funds available for better maintenance and for higher quality components, potentially leading to even higher energy yield and profits. Linearly growing or constant price assumptions cannot fully reproduce these expected price trends. Furthermore, significant price fluctuations can lead to unexpected scenarios and alter the predictions.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

There is a need for power and energy system stakeholders to better understand and implement the strategies that help reduce net-economic and societal consequences associated with grid outages by improving the resilience of their systems. In addition, there are incentives to reduce emissions and meet climate goals, several pathways of which include resilient technologies. Including resilience constraints and metrics in energy system planning models may help inform the design of more resilient systems that are also more renewable and sustainable. This paper reviews qualitative definitions of resilience, quantitative approaches to resilience, recent examples of the inclusion of resilience in energy system models with respect to acute climatological threats, and the gaps in fully articulating resilience in current modeling tools. We then outline steps to effectively improve resilience considerations against such threats into energy sector modeling tools. Based on the findings, the authors propose a novel framework for energy system resilience assessment and future areas of research to bridge the current modeling gaps.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous studies have shown that such a transition in the United States (U.S.) may lead to higher system cost compared to a business-as-usual case, but it is not well-known how the cost of electricity generation varies at sub-regional level under the transition, and studies have rarely evaluated the trade-off between the cost and avoided climate damages, as well as the potential roles of negative emission technologies (NETs) in the electricity decarbonization. In this work, we present a regionally resolved national model to quantify the cost of decarbonizing the U.S. electricity system under a set of possible scenarios. The results show that, compared to the reference scenario without a decarbonization policy, reaching zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 2050 would incur, depending on the scenarios, 335-494 billion USD additional cost to the U.S. electric power sector during 2020-2050. The regional costs of electricity generation ranges from 2.4 to 4.7 cent/kWh, largely due to the generation profiles and renewable resources availability of those regions. The additional costs can be translated to an average CO<sub>2</sub> abatement cost of 29-59 USD/metric ton CO<sub>2</sub> (with 2%-7% discount rates), which are comparable to the social cost of carbon in the literature at around 4% discount rate. The results also show that the cost of mitigating the last few percent CO<sub>2</sub> emission from the U.S. electricity system may exceed the costs of NETs, indicating an opportunity for NETs to contribute to electricity decarbonization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The pandemic caused drastic fluctuations in energy demand, oil price shocks, disruptions in energy supply chains, and hampered energy investments, while the war left the world with energy price hikes and energy security challenges. The long-term impacts of these crises on low-carbon energy transitions and mitigation of climate change are still uncertain but are slowly emerging. This paper analyzes the impacts throughout the energy system, including upstream fuel supply, renewable energy investments, demand for energy services, and implications for energy equity, by reviewing recent studies and consulting experts in the field. We find that both crises initially appeared as opportunities for low-carbon energy transitions: the pandemic by showing the extent of lifestyle and behavioral change in a short period and the role of science-based policy advice, and the war by highlighting the need for greater energy diversification and reliance on local, renewable energy sources. However, the early evidence suggests that policymaking worldwide is focused on short-term, seemingly quicker solutions, such as supporting the incumbent energy industry in the post-pandemic era to save the economy and looking for new fossil fuel supply routes for enhancing energy security following the war. As such, the fossil fuel industry may emerge even stronger after these energy crises creating new lock-ins. This implies that the public sentiment against dependency on fossil fuels may end as a lost opportunity to translate into actions toward climate-friendly energy transitions, without ambitious plans for phasing out such fuels altogether. We propose policy recommendations to overcome these challenges toward achieving resilient and sustainable energy systems, mostly driven by energy services.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Unwanted air leakage through the building envelope also contributes to approximately 4 quadrillion Btu (1172 TWh) of energy consumption per year in the building sector in the United States. Locating and sealing leakage sites can improve the energy efficiency, comfort, air quality, and moisture durability of the building stock. Typical methods of finding leakage sites, such as infrared imaging and smoke tracing, rely on concurrent blower door operation, which can also measure the total leakage rate of the building. Smoke tracing can be disruptive to occupants, and infrared imaging and smoke tracing cannot measure the contribution of individual leaks to prioritize sealing efforts. Here, an optical fluid flow imaging technique, reference-free natural background–oriented schlieren imaging, was adapted to visualize air exfiltration. This is the first step in developing a method to noninvasively locate and measure exfiltration or infiltration sites so that sealing efforts can be prioritized. Experimental results of this technique are presented, demonstrating the method's applicability to visualizing exfiltration through three common building claddings in an outdoor environment. Key variables impacting the performance of this technique when applied to building leakage are also discussed.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Cordon screen: A cordon-based congestion pricing policy evaluation method for U.S. cities","Simeone, Christina E.; Thornton, Matthew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; congestion pricing; sketch planning; transportation planning; transportation planning tool","Global trends toward urbanization will exacerbate traffic congestion, delays in economic productivity, and air pollution issues for growing cities. Traffic congestion pricing is one method available to help ameliorate these concerns. New York City is on the verge of implementing a cordon-based traffic congestion pricing policy around its central business district. For budget-constrained municipalities, evaluating implementation of such policy could be costly. This article proposes a sketch-planning methodology, called Cordon Screen, for major U.S. cities to evaluate the net income, traffic mitigation, and avoided pollution emissions from cordon-based traffic congestion pricing. This method relies on national datasets and limited user-specific data inputs, along with a range of user-selectable assumptions informed by academic literature to deliver order-of-magnitude results. The numerous limitations of this method are acceptable for preliminary policy evaluation to determine if greater financial investment to obtain more accurate results is justified. The Denver metropolitan area is used to demonstrate Cordon Screen capabilities, with mid-range assumption results suggesting the policy is most effective at generating net income and increasing vehicle speeds on major interstates. For Denver, the policy is comparably less effective at reducing air pollution and increasing speeds on minor roadways. Validation against early implementation results from the London cordon are acceptable. Still, users should discount revenue generation projections.

"Advances in Energy Hybridization for Resilient Supply: A Sustainable Approach to the Growing World Demand","Al-Rubaye, Haider; Smith, Joseph D.; Zangana, Mohammed S.; Nagapurkar, Prashant; Zhou, Yishu; Gelles, Greg","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; resilience; hybrid energy system; life cycle analysis","Energy poverty, defined as a lack of access to reliable electricity and reliance on traditional biomass resources for cooking, affects over a billion people daily. The World Health Organization estimates that household air pollution from inefficient stoves causes more premature deaths than malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. Increasing demand for energy has led to dramatic increases in emissions. The need for reliable electricity and limiting emissions drives research on Resilient Hybrid Energy Systems (RHESs), which provide cleaner energy through combining wind, solar, and biomass energy with traditional fossil energy, increasing production efficiency and reliability and reducing generating costs and emissions. Microgrids have been shown as an efficient means of implementing RHESs, with some focused mainly on reducing the environmental impact of electric power generation. The technical challenges of designing, implementing, and applying microgrids involve conducting a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to evaluate these systems’ environmental and economic performance under diverse operating conditions to evaluate resiliency. A sample RHES was developed and used to demonstrate the implementation in rural applications, where the system can provide reliable electricity for heating, cooling, lighting, and pumping clean water. The model and findings can be utilized by other regions around the globe facing similar challenges.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Their increasing popularity runs contrary to the goal of fuel economy regulations to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and can be explained by consumer preference and lower regulation stringency, which is due to footprint, truck classification, and the omission of heterogenous lifetime vehicle distance traveled among vehicle classes. This study shows that, for both the US and China, large vehicles travel more, last longer, and are owned by higher income consumers. This means large vehicles and their high-income owners use more fuel and emit more pollutants than represented by current policy and thus raises both policy effectiveness and energy equity concerns. We propose and estimate Sales Adjustment Factors that weigh fuel economy standards based on vehicle lifetime usage and demonstrate the resultant significant improvements in the effectiveness and equity of fuel economy regulations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Stochastic optimal power flow (SOPF) formulations provide a mechanism to handle these uncertainties by computing dispatch decisions and control policies that maintain feasibility under uncertainty. Most SOPF formulations consider simple control policies such as affine policies that are mathematically simple and resemble many policies used in current practice. Motivated by the efficacy of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the potential benefits of general control policies for cost and constraint enforcement, we put forth a deep neural network (DNN)-based policy that predicts the generator dispatch decisions in real time in response to uncertainty. The weights of the DNN are learnt using stochastic primal–dual updates that solve the SOPF without the need for prior generation of training labels and can explicitly account for the feasibility constraints in the SOPF. The advantages of the DNN policy over simpler policies and their efficacy in enforcing safety limits and producing near optimal solutions are demonstrated in the context of a chance constrained formulation on a number of test cases.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Categorizing distributed wind energy installations in the United States to inform research and stakeholder priorities","Preziuso, Danielle; Orrell, Alice; Lantz, Eric","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 17 WIND ENERGY; Distributed wind; Wind energy; Market categorization; distributed wind; market categorization; wind energy","Background: Distributed wind energy adoption in the United States can contribute to the diverse portfolio of energy technologies needed to achieve ambitious decarbonization goals. However, with limited deployment to date, the current distributed wind market must be better understood; these efforts will support the range of stakeholders who will drive successful deployment. This article first distinguishes three categories of distributed wind from existing literature: (1) behind the meter, (2) intended for explicit local load, and (3) physically distributed. A novel methodology to classify individual wind installations into each of these categories is then presented and applied to two data sets of wind installations in the United States to categorize and illuminate distinct segments in the distributed wind market. Results: Physically distributed installations, constituted by small to moderately sized projects serving local loads on distribution systems solely because of their proximity to them, account for the highest amount of capacity but the lowest number of installations out of the three categories. The inverse is true for behind-the-meter installations, which are used to serve on-site loads. Installations intended for explicit local load, which are interconnected on the utility side of the distribution system and intentionally built to provide energy to loads on the same distribution system, rank in the middle for both installed capacity and number of installations. Conclusions: Distributed wind energy deployment in the United States is geographically widespread, but the extent to which a single category is developed in each state varies. Policies, wind resources, and broad energy technology trends contribute to these deployment patterns. By identifying the extent to which each category of installations exists, decision-makers are empowered with data necessary to tailor research and development programs and address stakeholder priorities through policy and other means, ultimately supporting future deployment.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While wind power enables decarbonizing the electricity grid, the rising amount of end-of-life (EOL) wind blades - which are arduous to recycle - present a challenge for landfills if disposed of whole and a missed opportunity to recover valuable composite materials. The circular economy (CE) concept proposes strategies to rethink, reuse and recover products, components, and materials. However, transitioning to a CE implies changing how business models, supply chains, and behaviors deal with products and waste; changes arduously captured with traditional methods used to assess circularity such as life cycle assessment or material flow analysis (MFA). Here we present an agent-based model (ABM) that captures behavioral aspects impacting wind blade circularity in the US. The ABM also accounts for wind plant projects and landfills heterogeneity - a characteristic not easily included in top-down approaches such as MFA, input-output analysis, or system dynamics. Results show that recycling is divided as most recycling facilities are on the eastern side of the country, a challenge that could be alleviated by shredding blades before transportation. Recycling programs from the wind industry could also seed recycling behaviors within wind plant owners. Better yet, new blade designs could increase circularity if original equipment manufacturers accept the risks involved with the investments needed to adapt the production lines.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, MPC field tests are still uncommon, especially for small- and medium-sized commercial buildings and for buildings integrated with onsite renewables. This paper describes the implementation and the long-term performance evaluation of an MPC controller in a small commercial building equipped with behind-the-meter photovoltaics and electrochemical batteries. MPC controls space conditioning, commercial refrigeration, and the battery system. We tested two types of demand flexibility applications in the field: electricity bill minimization under time-of-use tariffs and responses to grid flexibility events. Results show that the proposed controller achieves 12% of annual electricity cost savings and 34% peak demand reduction against the baseline, while respecting thermal comfort and food safety. The field tests also demonstrate the ability of the MPC controller to provide a multitude of grid services including real-time pricing, demand limiting, load shedding, load shifting, and load tracking, using the same optimization framework.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This human influence operates at multiple scales: from short-term (hourly to daily) to long-term (annually to centennial) timescales, and from the local to the global, pushing systems towards either desirable or undesirable outcomes. However, the effort to represent human systems in multisector models has been fragmented across philosophical, methodological, and disciplinary lines. To cohere insights across diverse modeling approaches, we present a new typology for classifying how human actors are represented in the broad suite of coupled human-natural system models that are applied in MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research. The typology conceptualizes a “sector” as a system-of-systems that includes a diverse group of human actors, defined across individual to collective social levels, involved in governing, provisioning, and utilizing products, goods, or services towards some human end. We trace the salient features of modeled representations of human systems by organizing the typology around three key questions: 1) Who are the modeled actors in MSD systems? 2) What are their modeled actions? 3) How and for what purpose are these actors and actions operationalized in a computational model? The typology is used to critically examine existing models and chart the frontier of future human systems modeling for MSD research.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hence, in this study, we search for the most cost-effective “second-best” policies. Focusing on the light-duty vehicle sector in the case of Canada, we compare several policies in terms of effectiveness (regarding 2030 GHG goals) and mitigation costs, namely: (i) a carbon tax; (ii) a vehicle emission standard (or VES); (iii) a zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, and (iv) combinations of all three at various stringencies. In this effort, we apply the AUtomaker-consumer Model (AUM), which endogenously simulates consumer and automaker decisions and technological change. Comparing individual policies, the regulations are about three times more expensive than the carbon tax. Among “second-best” policies, the VES is cheaper than a ZEV mandate at lower stringencies, but at higher stringencies the two are similarly efficient (both incentivize widespread ZEV deployment). In policy mixes, cost-effectiveness is improved by a carbon tax. Specifically, inclusion of a CDN$100–150/tonne tax can achieve targets while being 30–40% less costly than a regulation alone. We suggest that policymakers implement carbon pricing as stringently as politically feasible (for efficiency), complemented by regulations as needed (for efficacy) to meet GHG targets.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Many commercial and emerging energy technologies have not yet been explicitly evaluated based on these environmental and social performance metrics, which presents multiple opportunities for researchers and analysts. In this paper, we review the importance and current limitations of techno-economic and life-cycle assessment models for research design and manufacturing decisions.

The reduction of the payback period and the increase of the return on investment are adopted as evaluation metrics. Using medium office buildings as an example, this study predicted the economic impacts of ETS on building retrofits at four locations in the U.S., and three different carbon prices were investigated. The results show that carbon prices have significant economic impacts on building retrofits. With the relatively low forecasted time-variant carbon prices (around 10 USD per ton), the economic impacts of ETS on building retrofits are small. When carbon prices increase, the impacts of ETS would be up to 25% for 50 USD per ton (current prices in European Union) and 51% for 100 USD per ton. Furthermore, locations with more fossil energy have higher relative changes in the payback period and ROI but are more sensitive to carbon prices.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our previous study investigated different HVAC operation strategies, including increased filtration using MERV 10, MERV 13, or HEPA filters, as well as supplying 100% outdoor air into buildings for a system initially sized for MERV 10 filtration. This paper significantly extends that research by systematically analyzing the potential financial and environmental impact for different locations in the U.S. The previous medium office building system model is improved to account for operation in different climates. New evaluation metrics are created to consider the comprehensive impact of improving IAQ on costs and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, using dynamic emission factors for electricity generation depending on the location. HVAC operation strategies are studied in five different locations across the United States, with distinct climates and electricity sources. In four of the five locations, MERV 13 filtration offers the best improvement in IAQ per increase in costs and emissions relative to MERV 10. The exception is the mildest climate of San Diego, where use of 100% outdoor air provides the best IAQ with a limited increase in costs and emissions. Finally, a system not sized for HEPA filtration can lead to increased costs and emissions without much improvement in IAQ.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the United Nations setting Goal 7 of its sustainable development goals to be universal access to clean, reliable and affordable electricity, substantial research efforts have been made to optimize electricity supply based on projected demand in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Our study reviews the literature on electricity demand, with a specific focus on latent demand (i.e., electricity demand that would exist if the necessary techno-economic conditions were met) in SSA. We found that out of 57 electricity demand papers reviewed, only 3 (5%) incorporated latent demand in their electricity demand projections. Furthermore, majority of the literature on electricity consumption and demand estimation in SSA use econometric models to identify determinants of electricity consumption and project future demand. We find that population density, urbanization, household income, electricity price, market value of crops and availability of natural resources to be significant determinants of electricity consumption in SSA. We conclude the review by proposing a methodology, and providing an initial proof of concept, for more accurately projecting latent demand in sub-Saharan Africa. Incorporating latent demand in electrification models would help inform energy sector stakeholders (e.g., investors and policymakers) about which sectors and geographic locations hold potential for wealth creation via electricity access.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"A critical review of the circular economy for lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic modules – status, challenges, and opportunities","Heath, Garvin A.; Ravikumar, Dwarakanath; Hansen, Brianna; Kupets, Elaine","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; circular economy; end of life; LIB; lithium-ion battery; PV; recycling","To meet net-zero emissions and cost targets for power production, recent analysis indicates that photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the United States could exceed 1 TW by 2050 alongside comparable levels of energy storage capacity, mostly from batteries. For comparison, the total U.S. utility-scale power capacity from all energy sources in 2020 was 1.2 TW, of which solar satisfied approximately 3%. With such massive scales of deployment, questions have arisen regarding issues of material supply for manufacturing, end-of-life management of technologies, environmental impacts across the life cycle, and economic costs to both individual consumers and society at large. A set of solutions to address these issues center on the development of a circular economy - shifting from a take-make-waste linear economic model to one that retains the value of materials and products as long as possible, recovering materials at end of life to recirculate back into the economy. With limited global experience, scholars and practitioners have begun to investigate circular economy pathways, focusing on applying novel technologies and analytical methods to fast-growing sectors like renewable energy. This critical review aims to synthesize the growing literature to identify key insights, gaps, and opportunities for research and implementation of a circular economy for two of the leading technologies that enable the transition to a renewable energy economy: solar PV and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We apply state-of-the-science systematic literature review procedures to critically analyze over 3,000 publications on the circular economy of solar PV and LIBs, categorizing those that pass a series of objective screens in ways that can illuminate the current state of the art, highlight existing impediments to a circular economy, and recommend future technological and analytical research. We conclude that while neither PV nor LIB industries have reached a circular economy, they are both on a path towards increased circularity. Based on our assessment of the state of current literature and scientific understanding, we recommend research move beyond its prior emphasis on recycling technology development to more comprehensively investigate other CE strategies, more holistically consider economic, environmental and policy aspects of CE strategies, increase leveraging of digital information systems that can support acceleration towards a CE, and to continue to study CE-related aspects of LIB and PV markets.","Informa UK Limited","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work studies the cost competitiveness of clean energy heating technologies under three dynamic mechanisms: investment costs, subsidy policies, and operating costs with real data. It provides key insights into the cost competitiveness of the different heating technologies deployed in different areas, as well as their sensitivity to the three dynamic mechanisms. The results show that currently, the distinct heating programs are more cost-efficient in the urban area with existing heating networks. The average payback period of all district clean energy heating programs in the urban area is 14.9 years, while that of the individual clean heating programs is 24.7 years. The individual heating programs are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with the incentive mechanisms, especially the electricity pricing mechanisms. Moreover, individual heating technologies present remarkable advantages on flexibility and sustainability in the long run. According to the technology diffusion model proposed in this paper, the individual clean heating programs will occupy more than 50% of the market share in 2050 under the comprehensive effect of CAPEX, government subsidies, and OPEX. The real-world results and analysis render references to shape the pathway of clean energy heating electrification in Northwest China and other regions with a similar situation.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

These range from building energy benchmarking and disclosure to building performance standards (BPS) that require buildings to meet specific targets of energy use or emissions. The City of Seattle adopted a climate action plan in 2013 that set a goal of zero net GHG emissions in the road transportation, buildings, and waste sectors by 2050, with a number of near and long term actions. Seattle implemented mandatory building tune-ups in 2016, applying to commercial buildings larger than 50,000 sqft. Building tune-ups1 involve assessment and implementation of operational and maintenance (O + M) improvements to achieve energy and water efficiency, such as changes to thermostat set points or adjusting lighting or irrigation schedules. Seattle's tune-ups program covered 27 such improvements in HVAC, lighting, domestic hot water, and envelope systems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Traditionally, simple, heuristic control approaches, such as the storage priority control which charges TES during the nighttime and discharges during the daytime, have been widely used in practice, and shown reasonable performance in the past benefiting both the grid and the end-users such as buildings and district energy systems. However, the increasing penetration of renewables changes the situation, exposing the grid to a growing duck curve, which encourages the consumption of more energy in the daytime, and volatile renewable generation which requires dynamic planning. The growing pressure of diminishing greenhouse gas emissions also increases the complexity of cooling TES plant operations as different control strategies may apply to optimize operations for energy cost or carbon emissions. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC), site demonstration and evaluation results of optimal operation of a chiller plant, TES and behind-meter photovoltaics for a campus-level district cooling system. The MPC was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program for better numerical and control properties. Compared with baseline rule-based controls, the MPC results show reductions of the excess PV power by around 25%, of the greenhouse gas emission by 10%, and of peak electricity demand by 10%.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Negative ramifications of these standards, particularly for credit constrained or low-income consumers, such as increased prices or decreased choice, are contingent on the pricing behavior of suppliers. We use market point of sales data to estimate the change in price and efficiency of clothes washers following the change in United States minimum efficiency standards in 2004 and 2007, differentiated by market segment. With a relatively narrow confidence interval, the average price of the baseline market segment did not change significantly concurrent with either the 2004 or 2007 standard change, while efficiency of these products increased by 30%, resulting in significant financial savings for consumers of the least expensive baseline products. The highest efficiency products experienced a significant drop in price and increase in efficiency as well, particularly following the 2007 standard change. The results suggest that the effect of this increase in minimum efficiency standards for clothes washers was beneficial to all consumers, but particularly those with lower incomes or renters. Low-income consumers were not priced out of the market, but rather benefited particularly.

However, understanding the adoption barriers of alternative fuel technologies for commercial vehicles has largely been limited to the total cost of ownership approach that mainly considers tangible costs. Additionally, this study proposes a perceived cost of ownership (PCO) model, which monetizes both tangible and implicit costs, including charging annoyance for buses and trucks by size and classification under different use scenarios. In the case study for China's current bus and truck market, the PCO of alternative fuel technologies, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are 27%–129% and 31%–86% higher than the most economically competitive powertrains – the compressed natural/liquefied petroleum gas technology and hybrid electric technology. BEVs could be cost-effective in the mini/midsize bus segment or in the daily short-distance driving scenario, and FCEVs could firstly be deployed in cities with a low hydrogen price. Though the implicit costs caused by range anxiety and charging annoyance account for at least 27% of BEV's PCO, making BEV uncompetitive, the battery swapping technique could reduce the implicit cost and overall cash outflow for BEV owners.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For instance, inverters’ control strategies can affect protection behaviors, and low short-circuit ratios and bi-directional power flows also make protection operations complex. Protection schemes based on conventional principles such as overcurrent and distance relays do not always provide reliable, sensitive, or selective operations. Here, we devise a traveling wave protection approach for microgrids using a wavelet-driven deep neural network named WaveletKernelNet (WKN). Compared with conventional methods, the presented approach provides enhanced sensitivity, higher selectivity, and better identification of various faults in microgrids.

We provide a detailed quantified overview of utilised auction schemes, including geographical spread, volumes, results, and design specifications. Our comprehensive global dataset reveals heterogeneous designs. Although most auction designs provide some form of revenue stabilisation, their specific instrument choices vary and include feed-in tariffs, one-sided and two-sided contracts for difference, mandated power purchase agreements, and mandated renewable energy certificates. We review the schemes used in all eight major offshore wind jurisdictions across Europe, Asia, and North America and evaluate bids in their jurisdictional context. We analyse cost competitiveness, likelihood of timely construction, occurrence of strategic bidding, and identify jurisdictional aspects that might have influenced auction results. We find that auctions are embedded within their respective regulatory and market design context, and are remarkably diverse, though with regional similarities. Auctions in each jurisdiction have evolved and tend to become more exposed to market price risks over time. Less mature markets are more prone to make use of lower-risk designs. Still, some form of revenue stabilisation is employed for all auctioned offshore wind energy farms analysed here, regardless of the specific policy choices. Our data confirm a coincidence of declining costs and growing diffusion of auction regimes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The locational value of distributed energy resources: A parcel-level evaluation of solar and wind potential in New York state","Bowen, Thomas; Koebrich, Sam; McCabe, Kevin; Sigrin, Ben","17 WIND ENERGY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; value of distributed energy resources; distributed generation; New York state; parcels; net energy metering; front-of-the-meter","We report distributed energy resources (DERs) are poised to play a significant role in evolving power systems because of their flexibility to be sited in areas of high value to the grid. Traditional DER compensation frameworks, specifically net energy metering (NEM), inadequately communicate differences in the locational and temporal value of DER generation to the grid. As a transition from NEM, New York State's (NYS's) Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) framework provides a methodology for calculating different value components that DERs offer the grid. To study the impacts of VDER frameworks on DER deployment, we developed a model to assess the value of distributed solar and wind systems configured as either a behind-the-meter system or a front-of-the-meter system for each parcel of land in NYS. Using parcel-level granularity, we can closely evaluate DER locational value and siting availability, particularly in urban and suburban settings. Our analysis finds while most DER generators would be modestly compensated for deferred transmission and distribution infrastructure upgrades (~0.01 $\$$/kWh for solar PV), a subset of projects receive significant value from this component (0.035 to 0.089 $\$$/kWh for top 5% of parcels for solar PV). Finally, our analysis finds VDER provides less overall compensation than NEM to the average DER generator, however, it increases access to compensation for front-of-the-meter DERs - a large and emerging market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Notwithstanding this, resilience of the current schemes on classical communication makes microgrids vulnerable to cyber attacks. Inspired by recent revolutionary breakthroughs in quantum communication, in this paper, we devise a novel synchronization mechanism. We extend the synchronization framework utilized in distributed control algorithms to networks of quantum systems by generating pinning terms and coupling mechanism for the new synchronization rule via exploiting proper quantum jump operators and observables, and show that the quantum system will converge to a time-variant target state. Our devised quantum distributed controller (QDC) gives rise to a novel quantum communication scheme for distributed control of microgrids and enables microgrids to exploit the state-of-the-art quantum communication frameworks as communication infrastructure. Finally, test results on two representative AC and DC networked microgrids validate the efficacy and universality of the quantum distributed control.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The advanced specification includes geographic clustering, exogenously estimated market size, and dynamic time steps. Training on historical adoption of rooftop photovoltaics at the U.S. county-level and using detailed techno-economic estimates, our model achieves a two-year average mean-absolute-percentage-error of 19% in predicting system counts at the county-level, weighted by population. Model error was negatively correlated with market maturity - the error was 12% for counties in states with at least 28 W-per-capita of installed capacity. The advanced specification significantly reduces unweighted forecasting percent error compared to a conventional Bass specification: from 196% to 25% for capacity and from 226% to 22% for system count.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Incorporating energy justice into utility-scale photovoltaic deployment: A policy framework","Heeter, Jenny; Reames, Tony","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; energy equity; energy justice; environmental justice; utility programs; utility-scale photovoltaics","Utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) installations made up 77 GW (6%) of installed capacity in the United States, as of the end of 2021. This will grow to more than 500 GW by 2050 under a mid-case projection or more than 800 GW if solar costs decline more rapidly. While utility-scale PV is projected to grow rapidly, to date, unlike energy efficiency or distributed PV, utility-scale PV has not been used to provide substantial financial benefits to underserved communities, either through ownership, financing of assets, or direct electricity bill reduction. We assess two mechanisms through which utility-scale PV could benefit underserved communities. We find that while a framework for direct electricity bill reduction can be meaningful to customers, this mechanism falls short of providing restorative justice via wealth creation for minority-owned businesses. In contrast, we find that a framework for procurement of utility-scale PV by public and private entities from PV projects that are financed, owned, and/or developed by minority-owned businesses can provide this restorative justice benefit, and thereby facilitate an equitable energy transition. We conclude with concrete recommendations for new policies and programs to ensure that the benefits of utility-scale PV systems are distributed to underserved communities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nuclear power plants, with a large ratio of capital to variable costs, have historically operated as base load energy suppliers but the need for more flexible operation is increasing. We simulate the techno-economic performance of a 950 MWt nuclear power plant, based on the Westinghouse lead-cooled fast reactor, coupled with molten salt thermal storage as a method for flexible energy dispatch. We use the System Advisor Model to model the nuclear reactor thermal power input and power cycle operating modes. We combine this robust engineering model with a mixed-integer linear program model for optimized dispatch scheduling. We then simulate the coupled nuclear and thermal storage system under different market scenarios with varying price volatility. We find that the coupled plant outperforms the base plant under markets where energy price peaks fluctuate by a factor of two or more about the mean price. We show that a calculated power purchase agreement price for the plant improves by up to 10% when operating under California energy market conditions.

However, there is significant variation in projected bioenergy deployment results, as well as concerns about the potential environmental and social implications of supplying biomass. Bioenergy deployment projections are market equilibrium solutions from integrated modeling, yet little is known about the underlying modeling of the supply of biomass as a feedstock for energy use in these modeling frameworks. We undertake a novel diagnostic analysis with ten global models to elucidate, compare, and assess how biomass is supplied within the models used to inform long-run climate management. With experiments that isolate and reveal biomass supply modeling behavior and characteristics (costs, emissions, land use, market effects), we learn about biomass supply tendencies and differences. The insights provide a new level of modeling transparency and understanding of estimated global biomass supplies that informs evaluation of the potential for bioenergy in managing the climate and interpretation of integrated modeling. For each model, we characterize the potential distributions of global biomass supply across regions and feedstock types for increasing levels of quantity supplied, as well as some of the potential societal externalities of supplying biomass. We also evaluate the biomass supply implications of managing these externalities. Finally, we interpret biomass market results from integrated modeling in terms of our new understanding of biomass supply. Overall, we find little consensus between models on where biomass could be cost-effectively produced and the implications. We also reveal model specific biomass supply narratives, with results providing new insights into integrated modeling bioenergy outcomes and differences. The analysis finds that many integrated models are considering and managing emissions and land use externalities of supplying biomass and estimating that environmental and societal trade-offs in the form of land emissions, land conversion, and higher agricultural prices are cost-effective, and to some degree a reality of using biomass, to address climate change.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper presents a case study of a mixed-use, all-electric community located in Denver, Colorado. We use URBANopt<sup>TM</sup>, a physics-based urban energy modeling platform to model the community and then evaluate the impact of EEMs and DERs (i.e., photovoltaics [PV], electric vehicles [EVs], and batteries) on the community's energy usage, carbon emissions, and peak demand. The results show that adding EEMs and PV led to both energy consumption and carbon emissions reductions across all building types. However, we saw fairly limited impact of EEMs and PV on buildings' peak demand in our case. Additionally, due to overnight EV charging activities and higher grid carbon intensity at night, the carbon emissions in multifamily buildings have a noticeable increase compared to scenarios without vehicles. Finally, the addition of batteries helped reduce peak demand by 11%-29%. The modeling workflow and evaluation methods can be applied to similar communities to evaluate their performance and the effect of integrating EEMs and DERs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Adoption of biofuels for marine shipping decarbonization: A <scp>long‐term</scp> price and scalability assessment","Tan, Eric C. D.; Harris, Kylee; Tifft, Stephen M.; Steward, Darlene; Kinchin, Christopher; Thompson, Thomas N.","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; biorefinery; decarbonization; marine biofuels; scalability","This study assessed the long-term annual biofuel production capacity potential and price in the United States and shed light on the prospect of biofuel adoption for marine propulsion. A linear programming model was developed to assist the projections and provide insightful analyses. The projected long-term (2040) maximum annual capacity of biofuels in the United States is 245 million metric tons (Mt) or 65 billion gallons of heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent (HFOGE) when based on the median feedstock availability. Between 2022 (near-term) and 2040, the potential biofuel capacity increases by over 40%, attributed to increased feedstock availability. At a price range up to $500/t, biodiesel is the main product, and the annual capacity (12 Mt) is limited to feedstock availability constraints. Biodiesel and corn ethanol are the main biofuels at a price range up to 750 dollars per t. At a higher price point (above 750 dollars per t), the biofuel types and annual capacities increase substantially (218 Mt per year). Biofuels above this price include gasoline-, jet-, and diesel-range blendstocks, as well as bio-methanol, bio-propane, and biogas. This study concludes that the US domestic feedstock availability coupled with advanced conversion technologies can produce substantial amounts of biofuels to achieve a critical mass and be impactful as alternative marine fuels. There is also a need to improve the biofuel price for marine shipping adoption. Policies and economic incentives that provide temporary financial support would help facilitate maritime biofuel adoption.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, early-stage CCU technologies must prove their economic viability and environmental reduction potential compared to already-deployed technologies. These comparisons can be misleading, as emerging technologies typically experience a drastic increase in performance and decrease in cost and greenhouse gas emissions as they develop from research to mass-market deployment due to various forms of learning. These changes complicate the interpretation of early techno-economic assessments (TEAs) and life cycle assessments (LCAs) of emerging CCU technologies. The effects of learning over time or cumulative production themselves can be quantitatively described using technology learning curves (TLCs). While learning curve approaches have been developed for various technologies, a harmonized methodology for using TLCs in TEA and LCA for CCU in particular is required. To address this, we describe a methodology that incorporates TLCs into TEA and LCA to forecast the environmental and economic performance of emerging CCU technologies. This methodology is based on both an evaluation of the state of the art of learning curve assessment and a literature review of TLC approaches developed in various manufacturing and energy generation sectors. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement this methodology using a case study on a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mineralization pathway. Finally, commentary is provided on how researchers, technology developers, and LCA and TEA practitioners can advance the use of TLCs to allow for consistent, high-resolution modeling of technological learning for CCU going forward and enable holistic assessments and fairer comparisons with other climate technologies.</jats:p>","Frontiers Media S.A.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to model performance constraints, these models typically do not explicitly simulate every hour within a year, but instead simulate representative time segments (groups of hours). This paper evaluates different approaches for selecting time segments across three methods: sequential, categorical, and clustering, across a wide range of time-segment quantities, for a total of 204 temporal profiles. To measure the performance of each profile's ability to accurately represent data, the root-mean-square-error of each profile's time segments are compared to the data's original hourly data. The temporal alignment across regions is also measured (i.e., how often windy days align across regions). Different spatial resolutions were applied for a subset of the temporal selection methods to investigate the impact spatial resolution has on performance. This paper provides a framework for measuring the value of different temporal selection methods and of adding more granular data to energy system models. Overall, multi-criteria clustering yields the lowest root-mean-square-error across all datasets evaluated and provides a holistic view of the intertwined relationships between renewable generation and electricity demand.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Nevertheless, several sustainability concerns are associated with bioenergy, especially related to the impacts of using land for dedicated energy crop production. Cultivating energy crops can result in synergies or trade-offs between GHG emission reductions and other sustainability effects depending on context-specific conditions. Using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, the main synergies and trade-offs associated with land use for dedicated energy crop production were identified. Furthermore, the context-specific conditions (i.e., biomass feedstock, previous land use, climate, soil type and agricultural management) which affect those synergies and trade-offs were also identified. The most recent literature was reviewed and a pairwise comparison between GHG emission reduction (SDG 13) and other SDGs was carried out. A total of 427 observations were classified as either synergy (170), trade-off (176), or no effect (81). Most synergies with environmentally-related SDGs, such as water quality and biodiversity conservation, were observed when perennial crops were produced on arable land, pasture or marginal land in the ‘cool temperate moist’ climate zone and ‘high activity clay’ soils. Most trade-offs were related to food security and water availability. Previous land use and feedstock type are more impactful in determining synergies and trade-offs than climatic zone and soil type. This study highlights the importance of considering context-specific conditions in evaluating synergies and trade-offs and their relevance for developing appropriate policies and practices to meet worldwide demand for bioenergy in a sustainable manner.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We investigated the sensitivity of a Western U.S. power system to isolated and combined heat and drought when it has low (5%) and moderate (31%) variable renewable energy shares, representing historic and future systems. We used an electricity operational model combined with a model of historically extreme drought (for hydropower and freshwater-reliant thermoelectric generators) over the Western U.S. and a synthetic, regionally extreme heat event in Southern California (for thermoelectric generators and electricity load). We found that the drought has the highest impact on summertime production cost (+10% to +12%), while temperature-based deratings have minimal effect (at most +1%). The Southern California heat wave scenario impacting load increases summertime regional net imports to Southern California by 10-14%, while the drought decreases them by 6-12%. Combined heat and drought conditions have a moderate effect on imports to Southern California (-2%) in the historic system and a stronger effect (+8%) in the future system. Southern California dependence on other regions decreases in the summertime with the moderate increase in variable renewable energy (-34% imports), but hourly peak regional imports are maintained under those infrastructure changes. By combining synthetic and historically driven conditions to test two infrastructures, we consolidate the importance of considering compounded heat wave and drought in planning studies and suggest that region-to-region energy transfers during peak periods are key to optimal operations under climate extremes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We develop the capability of producing dynamic-reservoir-simulation-based geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage supply curves with the Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> Tool (SCO<sub>2</sub>T) and use it with the ReEDS electric sector planning model to investigate the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation and geologic storage representation on energy system planning tool results. We use a locational case study of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region. Our results suggest that the cost of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage may be as low as $3/tCO<sub>2</sub> and that site-level assumptions may affect this cost by several dollars per tonne. At the grid level, the cost of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage has generally smaller effects compared to other assumptions (e.g., natural gas price), but small variations in this cost can change results (e.g., capacity deployment decisions) when policy renders CCS marginally competitive. The cost of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation generally affects the location of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage investment more than the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> captured or the location of electricity generation investment. We conclude with a few recommendations for future energy system researchers when modeling CCS. For example, assuming a cost for geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage (e.g., $5/tCO<sub>2</sub>) may be less consequential compared to assuming free storage by excluding it from the model.","Frontiers Media SA","","Carbon Solutions LLC, Bloomington, IN (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors. Though most historical U.S. wind deployment has been confined to the temperate grassland biome in the nation’s interior, regional expansion has implicated diverse land use and cover types. A large percentage of the typical wind plant footprint (∼96% to <inline-formula> <tex-math> <CDATA/> </tex-math> <math overflow='scroll'> <mrow> <mo>></mo> </mrow> </math> <inline-graphic href='erlac5f2cieqn1.gif' type='simple'/> </inline-formula> 99%) is not directly impacted by permanent physical infrastructure, allowing for multiple uses in the spaces between turbines. Surprisingly, turbines are commonly close to built structures. Moreover, rangeland and cropland have supported 93.4% of deployment, highlighting potential synergies with agricultural lands. Despite broadly decreasing capacity densities, offsetting technology improvements have stabilized power densities. Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation. Increased land-use and sustainability feedback in technology and plant design will be critical to sustainable management of wind power. </p>","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Optimal strategies to accelerate EV adoption must weigh the relative value of alternative policy mechanisms to consumers, including public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies. We use a historically validated light-duty vehicle consumer choice tool, the ADOPT model, to simulate personal light-duty vehicle adoption and related emissions in California. ADOPT is updated to incorporate a quantification of the tangible value of public charging infrastructure, allowing us to simulate the impact of investments in public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies under different scenarios. We show that both policies result in increased EV adoption, with the most effective policy varying depending on vehicle technology assumptions. Under conservative technology improvement assumptions, infrastructure investments are most effective in promoting EV sales and reducing CO2 emissions, while under optimistic technology improvement assumptions a combination of infrastructure and subsidies best supports EV sales and CO2 emission reductions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is one technology that can utilize greenhouse gasses that would be otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere by producing chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide and electricity. Significant progress has been made in the experimental performance of carbon dioxide reduction systems with novel catalyst designs, new materials, and systems engineering; however, no work has linked such changes in stack design and materials to capital costs for the stack itself. In this study, we present an analysis that accounts for and analyzes the impacts of alternative materials and system architectures on manufactured costs of carbon dioxide reduction stacks, thus providing a framework to understand exactly how these advances impact the at-scale capital costs of these systems. Specifically, we consider the impact that the addition of a catholyte buffer layer has on an electrolyzer reducing carbon dioxide to formate, finding that the cost of manufacturing this part only increases stack costs by about $30/m<sup>2</sup> at high manufacturing rates, while previous work finds that this part improves system performance. This work shows that the links between system performance, materials, and costs are nonlinear, and that achieving low-cost scalability requires optimization of not just performance parameters but also the use of low-cost and highly scalable materials. These results bridge experimental and techno-economic analysis of processes for carbon dioxide reduction, informing researchers by providing a quantifiable estimate of the impact of advances in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technology on manufactured stack capital costs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Results also indicate that although charging is demanded in areas nearby high trip demand, fast charging ports are also demanded in areas near driver residences as a supplement for home charging in scenarios with limited overnight charging access. These findings motivate investment into both overnight charging and public fast charging to meet the charging demands of ride-hailing fleets.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Robust Scheduling of Networked Microgrids for Economics and Resilience Improvement","Liu, Guodong; Ollis, Thomas B.; Ferrari, Maximiliano F.; Sundararajan, Aditya; Tomsovic, Kevin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; robust optimization; networked microgrids; uncertainty; economics; resilience","<p>The benefits of networked microgrids in terms of economics and resilience are investigated and validated in this work. Considering the stochastic unintentional islanding conditions and conventional forecast errors of both renewable generation and loads, a two-stage adaptive robust optimization is proposed to minimize the total operating cost of networked microgrids in the worst scenario of the modeled uncertainties. By coordinating the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) and responsive demand among networked microgrids, the total operating cost is minimized, which includes the start-up and shut-down cost of distributed generators (DGs), the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost of DGs, the cost of buying/selling power from/to the utility grid, the degradation cost of energy storage systems (ESSs), and the cost associated with load shedding. The proposed optimization is solved with the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm. The results of case studies demonstrate the advantages of networked microgrids over independent microgrids in terms of reducing total operating cost and improving the resilience of power supply.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper is a confluence of quantum computing, data science and machine learning to potentially address the power system TSA issue. Here, we devise a quantum TSA (QTSA) method to enable scalable and efficient data-driven transient stability prediction for bulk power systems, which is the first attempt to tackle the TSA issue with quantum computing. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) A high expressibility, low-depth (HELD) quantum circuit is designed for accurate and noise-resilient TSA; 2) A quantum natural gradient descent algorithm is developed for efficient HELD circuit training; 3) A systematical analysis on QTSAs performance under various quantum factors is per-formed. QTSA underpins a foundation of quantum-enabled and data-driven power grid stability analytics. It renders the intractable TSA straightforward and effortless in the Hilbert space, and therefore provides stability information for power system operations. Extensive experiments on quantum simulators and real quantum computers verify the accuracy, noise-resilience, scalability and universality of QTSA.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

As a result, the nascent carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) industry is rapidly growing with a plethora of new technologies in many different sectors. There is a need to holistically evaluate these new technologies in a standardized and consistent manner to determine which technologies will be the most successful and competitive in the global marketplace to achieve decarbonization targets. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment (TEA) have been employed as rigorous methodologies for quantitatively measuring a technology's environmental impacts and techno-economic performance, respectively. However, these metrics evaluate a technology's performance in only three dimensions and do not directly incorporate stakeholder needs and values. In addition, technology developers frequently encounter trade-offs during design that increase one metric at the expense of the other. The technology performance level (TPL) combined indicator provides a comprehensive and holistic assessment of an emerging technology's potential, which is described by its techno-economic performance, environmental impacts, social impacts, safety considerations, market/deployability opportunities, use integration impacts, and general risks. TPL incorporates TEA and LCA outputs and quantifies the trade-offs between them directly using stakeholder feedback and requirements. In this article, the TPL methodology is being adapted from the marine energy domain to the CCUS domain. Adapted metrics and definitions, a stakeholder analysis, and a detailed foundation-based application of the systems engineering approach to CCUS are presented. The TPL assessment framework is couched within the internationally standardized LCA framework to improve technical rigor and acceptance. It is demonstrated how stakeholder needs and values can be directly incorporated, how LCA and TEA metrics can be balanced, and how other dimensions (listed earlier) can be integrated into a single metric that measures a technology's potential.","Frontiers Media SA","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This can aid in achieving energy and environmental goals as well as encouraging more equitable distribution of costs and revenues between all parties on the energy system. Despite this potential, energy communities are still a nascent solution, the success of which is heavily influenced by regulations. As a result, there are a wide variety of organizational structures for energy communities at this time. This paper provides a review of the policy landscape in Spain as it relates to energy communities. This work also presents a formalized method for characterizing different energy community structures and provides a qualitative assessment of the impacts of different measures to encourage energy communities with respect to their organizational structure. Findings suggest that many market-focused measures, including wholesale, local flexibility, capacity, and multisector market measures favor larger, more integrated communities, while regulatory, legal, and organizational measures, including peer-to-peer trading, aggregation, and self-consumption favor smaller, more distributed communities. Additionally, when developing policies to encourage the growth of energy communities, policymakers should be cognizant of the progression of policies in the context of the desired outcomes for energy community growth specific to the region or country and its goals.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using real-time job vacancy data, this study analyzes the impacts of the pandemic on the U.S. clean energy labor market in 2020, including biomass, energy efficiency (EE), electric vehicle (EV), power/microgrid, solar, and wind industries. This study identifies how COVID-health factors and public health interventions influence clean energy job availability during the early COVID pandemic. Overall, California had the most energy jobs and experienced a significant decrease in April 2020. EV and solar had the highest percentages of job vacancies during the pandemic in general. Still, lockdowns had the most severe influence on EE and wind jobs. Stay-at-home orders negatively affected clean energy job vacancies in biomass, EV, power/microgrid, and wind. Social-gathering restrictions, however, did not have much influence. Increased COVID tests at the state level had the strongest and most positive influence on clean energy job postings, indicating the importance of a state's ability to manage public health infrastructure or crisis issues. COVID hospitalizations negatively influenced the job vacancies in biomass and wind but did not affect the other four sectors; conversely, as COVID death numbers increased, the number of jobs in biomass, EV, power grid, solar, and wind decreased, but not in EE jobs.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The demand for self-powered UUVs suitable for long-term deployments has been growing, and further research related to small-scale ocean gradient energy systems is needed. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review about harvesting energy from ocean thermal or salinity gradients for powering UUVs, focusing on gliders and profiling floats. Thermal gradient energy systems for UUVs based on phase change materials (PCM) cannot provide the energy required for powering autonomous sensing systems because of the systems’ low energy conversion efficiency. Besides reducing energy consumption by developing more efficient electrical-mechanical systems, enhancing the thermal conductivity of the PCMs may help address this challenge by increasing the power generation rate of the UUVs. Several other emerging technologies, such as thermoelectric generators, shape memory alloys, and small-scale thermodynamic cycle systems, have shown potential for powering UUVs, but they are still only at the laboratory testing or conceptual design phase. The most advanced power generation technologies based on salinity gradients, reverse electrodialysis and pressure-retarded osmosis, are still not economically viable for large-scale deployment, mainly because of the high cost of the components required to operate in harsh saline environments. Our feasibility evaluation showed that existing salinity gradient power generation technologies are not directly feasible for powering UUVs in the open ocean.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Many of the key approaches to achieving this transition in the critical areas of transportation, buildings and manufacturing depend on new materials and new approaches to rapidly increase electrification. This article reviews the overall energy landscape and highlights specific areas where new materials are critical to enabling transitions in energy storage, hydrogen utilization, transportation, buildings and the chemical industry and the articles on these topics that follow. How these transitions can be best integrated and the global societal impact of these transitions is also discussed. The development of new materials is instrumental in accelerating the move to a cleaner electrified society.

The first technology is key to obtaining the s-domain expressions from the transient response data, and the s-domain DQ admittance model from the frequency-domain measurements. The second technology is key to obtaining the dq-frame voltage and current signals from either the three-phase instantaneous measurements or the phasor measurement unit (PMU) data.

We found original licenses had shorter average timelines than relicenses and project capacity was only related to timeline length when license type (i.e., original, relicense) was included in analyses. Both licensing timeline length and variability were impacted by the licensing process (Alternative, Integrated, Traditional) used. Projects with greater environmental complexity (e.g., endangered species) had significantly longer timelines than projects that were less environmentally complex. We attributed shorter timelines for original licenses to lower environmental complexity (e.g., no endangered species) because most original licenses involved development of already impacted sites. Projects with greater environmental complexity significantly impact resources that may require greater stakeholder involvement and increased study that can lead to longer licensing timelines.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Industrial process heating, which still relies heavily on fossil fuel combustion and accounts for the majority of sector wide GHG emissions, is a particularly attractive electrification target. Electrifying industrial boilers represents a cross-cutting opportunity for GHG emissions reductions, given their widespread use in most manufacturing industries. Yet, there are gaps in the understanding of the current population of conventional industrial boilers in the United States that preclude a characterization of boiler electrification's technical potential to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions. In this study, we develop an up-to-date dataset of the industrial boiler population in the U.S. and quantify the county-level electricity requirements and net changes in fuel use and GHG emissions under the current electric grid and theoretical future grid scenarios. Our results show an increase of 105 MMmtCO<sub>2</sub>e and 73 MMmtCO<sub>2</sub>e in GHG emissions from boiler electrification, with and without the replacement of byproduct fuels, respectively, under the current electric grid, and a reduction of 19 MMmtCO2e and 7 MMmtCO2e in GHG emissions under a future high renewables electric grid. GHG emissions savings are currently possible only in certain regions of the U.S. unless future grids are decarbonized. We also provide discussion that could be useful for policy makers and manufacturing facilities for advancing the electrification of industrial boilers in locations and industries toward fuel savings and GHG emissions reductions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Looking Beyond Bill Savings to Equity in Renewable Energy Microgrid Deployment","Anderson, Kate; Farthing, Amanda; Elgqvist, Emma; Warren, Adam","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; energy decision-making; energy justice; environmental justice; equity; microgrid; resilience","Microgrids powered by renewable energy can provide backup power to critical infrastructure during grid outages. These systems can also play an important role in advancing energy justice by providing economic, environmental, health, and resilience benefits for underserved communities. The value of microgrids is often measured by the economic savings and resilience provided, but there are other energy justice factors that should be considered. This paper describes a methodology for quantifying broader costs and benefits including utility bill savings, value of resilience, social cost of carbon, public health costs, and jobs associated with the construction and operation of microgrids. We evaluate these factors at three case study sites and find that including energy justice values in the cost-benefit analysis of microgrids can change investment decisions. When climate, health, resilience, and job creation are considered, cost-optimal microgrids include more renewable generation, leading to a 52-82% reduction in emissions and diesel fuel use. The net present values of the microgrids grow from negative $626,000-843,000 in the diesel only case to $10-16 million in the hybrid microgrid case and $12-19 million in the renewable microgrid case, indicating potential for greater microgrid deployment if energy justice values are incorporated in decision making.

These technologies capture carbon dioxide from industrial point sources or from the atmosphere directly and then either sequester it or use it as a carbon source in valuable products. Potential utilization pathways include, but are not limited to, concrete, fuels, and certain commodity chemicals, and sequestration pathways can include permanent geological storage or temporary storage in natural sinks ranging from forests to agricultural soil. Regardless of the pathway, assessment of the economic and environmental performance of the technologies is important for understanding their potential scalability and impact as well as developing plans to minimize life cycle costs and potential environmental trade-offs. A full discussion of potential trade-offs associated with CCUS is outside the scope of this article, but promoting assessment broadly helps to stimulate important conversations about the benefits and drawbacks of any particular technological choice.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We sought to identify areas where disadvantaged community indicators and high generation potential from cost-effective renewable energy opportunities intersect and deployment could lead to economic development and job creation. Through a geospatial intersection of energy burden, environmental hazard, and sociodemographic data with technical generation potential and the levelized cost of energy for multiple renewable energy technologies, we calculated county-level correlations and identified trends across disadvantaged community indicators and renewable energy deployment potential. Data sources and tools included the Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) tool, the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping (EJSCREEN) tool, the State and Local Planning for Energy (SLOPE) platform, and the Renewable Energy Integration and Optimization (REopt) model. Metrics include levelized costs and generation potential for utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), rooftop PV (residential and commercial), distributed PV plus storage, land-based wind, geothermal, and hydropower development.

Coordinated planning of electric power and natural gas systems will allow synergistic investments to address cross-sector operational constraints, competing uses for net-zero emissions fuels, and shifts in energy demands across energy carriers. In this study, we develop a novel optimization program that finds the cost-minimizing mix of infrastructure expansion or reduction across gas and electric systems to satisfy sector-specific emissions constraints. Alongside energy supply resources, our framework allows for central-planning of end-use equipment stocks to allow switching between gas and electric appliances upon failure or premature replacement. The proposed model is used to simulate case study scenarios for a benchmark 24-pipe gas network coupled to a 24-node power system test network. We find that electrification of greater than 80% of core gas demands is a component of the least-cost solution for modeled energy systems. Despite this substitution, the gas system is maintained to service difficult-to-electrify customers and to deliver net-zero emissions gas to electricity generators in times of peak electricity demand. Restricting electrification of gas appliances increases reliance on power- to-gas technologies and increases annual costs by 15% in 2040. Neglecting constraints on pipeline blending of hydrogen can produce a misleading result that relies on hydrogen blend fractions of greater than 50%. In all cases, we find the average costs of delivered gas increase nearly 5-fold across the decarbonization transition, highlighting the importance of future work investigating cost-allocation strategies for ensuring an equitable energy transition.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Fast and accurate influenza forecasting in the United States with Inferno","Osthus, Dave (ORCID:000000024681091X); Funk, ed., Sebastian","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","<p>Infectious disease forecasting is an emerging field and has the potential to improve public health through anticipatory resource allocation, situational awareness, and mitigation planning. By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSight’s onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development and improvement while providing flexibility when deployed in a real-time setting. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When pseudoprospectively compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in the national and regional challenge as well as the state challenge, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance. Forecasting challenges like FluSight should continue to monitor and evaluate how they can be modified and expanded to incentivize the development of forecasting models that benefit public health.</p>","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Our framework is based on a pollutant's characterization factor (CF) and three new metrics: Available Regulatory Capacity for Incremental Emissions (ARCIE), Source CF Ratio, and Activity Health Impact (AHI) Ratio. ARCIE can be used to assess whether a receptor location has capacity to accommodate additional source emissions while complying with regulatory limits. We present CF as a midpoint indicator of health impacts per unit mass of emitted pollutant. Source CF Ratio enables comparison of potential new-source locations based on human health impacts. The AHI Ratio estimates the health impacts of a pollutant in relation to the utilization of the source for each unit of product or service. These metrics can be applied to any pollutant, energy source sector (e.g., agriculture, electricity), source type (point, line, area), and spatial modeling domain (nation, state, city, region). We demonstrate these metrics through a case study of fine particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) emissions from U.S. corn stover harvesting and local processing at various scales, representing steps in the biofuel production process. We model PM<sub>2.5</sub> formation in the atmosphere using a novel reduced-complexity chemical transport model called the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). Through this case study, we present the first area-source PM<sub>2.5</sub> CFs that address the recommendations of several LCIA studies to establish spatially explicit CFs specific to an energy source sector or type. Overall, the framework developed in this work provides multiple new ways to consider the potential impacts of air emissions through spatially differentiated metrics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most future model simulations assume a single average consumer and thus miss this important demand determinant. We quantify long-term implications of alternative future income distributions for state-level residential energy demand, investment, greenhouse gas, and pollutant emission patterns in the United States (U.S.) by incorporating income quintiles into the residential energy sector of the Global Change Analysis Model with 50-state disaggregation. We find that if the income distribution within each U.S. state becomes more egalitarian than present, what means that the difference on income between the richest and poorest decreases over time, residential energy demand could be 10% (4%–14% across states) higher in 2100. This increase of residential energy demand will directly reduce energy poverty, with a very modest increment on economywide CO <sub>2</sub> emissions (1%–2%). On the other hand, if U.S. states transition to a less equitable income distribution than present, with the difference between richest and poorest increasing over time, residential energy demand could be 19% (12%–26% across states) lower. While this study focuses on a single sector, we conclude that to improve understanding of synergies and tradeoffs across multiple societal goals such as energy access, emissions, and investments, future model simulations should explicitly consider subregional income distribution impacts. </p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We find that not all reductions in reserve electricity-generation capacity result in impacts, and that when they occur, intermittent interruptions in electricity supply at critical times of the day, week and year account for much of the economic impacts. Finally, we find that impacts may be in different locations from the original water stress. Herein, we estimate that the consumption loss can be up to 0.3% annually and the drivers identified in coupled modelling can increase the average cost of electricity by up to 3%.

Here, we employ a grid operations model and a large synthetic weather ensemble to “stress test” a range of future grid pathways for the U.S. West Coast developed by ReEDS, a well-known capacity planning model. Our results show that gradual changes in the underlying capacity mix from 2020 to 2050 can cause significant “re-ranking” of weather years in terms of annual wholesale electricity prices (with “good” years becoming bad, and vice versa). Nonetheless, we find the highest and lowest ranking price years in terms of average electricity price remain mostly tied to extremes in hydropower availability (streamflow) and load (summer temperatures). Seasonal dynamics seen today involving spring snowmelt and hot, dry summers remain well-defined out to 2050. In California, future supply shortfalls are greatest under future pathways involving widespread vehicle electrification, and are concentrated in the evening and occur mostly during periods of high temperature anomalies in late summer months and in late winter; in the Pacific Northwest, supply shortfalls are much more strongly tied to negative streamflow anomalies. Under our more robust sampling of stationary hydrometeorological uncertainty, we also find that the ratio of dispatchable thermal (i.e. natural gas) capacity to wind and solar required to ensure grid reliability can differ significantly from values reported by ReEDS.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Much research has been done in forecasting energy prices for a single market while little research has been reported on forecasting price difference between markets, which presents higher volatility and yet plays a critical role in applications such as virtual trading. To this end, this paper takes the first attempt at it and employs novel deep learning architecture with Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units and Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture to forecast nodal price difference between day-ahead and real-time markets. In addition to value prediction, these deep learning architectures are also used to develop classification models to predict the price difference bands/ranges. The proposed methods are tested using historical PJM market data, and evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and other customized performance metrics. Case studies show that both deep learning methods outperform common methods including ARIMA, XGBoost and Support Vector Regression (SVR) methods. More importantly, the deep learning methods can capture the magnitude and timing of price difference spikes. Numerical results show the Seq2Seq model performs particularly well and demonstrates generalization capability to extended forecasting lead time.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Missouri Univ. of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Diversion of the wet waste resources from going through conventional waste management practices to utilization as feedstocks for energy production also benefits from avoided cost and pollutant emissions of waste management and disposal. This study investigates the economic and environmental implications of producing bioblendstocks for mixing controlled compression ignition engines from two waste-to-fuel pathways: hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) from yellow grease and swine manure hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) followed by biocrude upgrading. Detailed process models were developed for both pathways, which informed the techno-economic analysis and life-cycle analysis. Conventional swine manure management practice was also modeled in detail as the business-as-usual scenario for the swine manure HTL pathway. The estimated minimum fuel selling prices were $1.22/gasoline liter equivalent (GLE) and $0.94/GLE for the yellow grease to HEFA and swine manure HTL pathways, respectively. The life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the two pathways were 11.2 and -33.3 g of CO(2)e/MJ, respectively, for the yellow grease to HEFA and swine manure HTL pathways. The credits of avoided emissions from conventional swine manure management were the main reason for the negative GHG emissions of the swine manure HTL pathway. The marginal GHG emissions abatement costs were estimated to be $116-$270/tonne CO(2)e and $5-$103/tonne CO(2)e for the yellow grease HEFA and swine manure HTL pathways, respectively, for a diesel price ranging between $0.5/GLE and $0.9/GLE. Since the yellow grease HEFA pathway is already commercialized, it can benefit from the $200/tonne carbon credit in the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard market, which could help the yellow grease HEFA pathway to achieve near-zero marginal GHG emissions abatement cost.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Two common PTC policies are studied – in the first policy, a wind farm receives PTC by selling wind generation to the market and its storage can be used to store energy from the wind generation and energy purchased from the grid but the energy released from the storage cannot receive PTC; in the second policy, the energy released from the storage can also qualify for PTC but purchasing energy from the grid is not allowed. We then employ dynamic programming to study merchants' optimal decision-making while considering PTC and the physical characteristics of storage systems. We analytically show that the state of charge (SOC) range can be segmented into different regions by SOC reference points under two PTC policies. The merchant's optimal action can be conveniently and uniquely determined based on the region within which the current SOC falls. Moreover, this study illustrates that PTC could substantially alter the optimal scheduling policy structures by affecting reference points and their relationships. The results showed that the frequencies for charging and discharging storage decisions decreased with an increase in PTC subsidy.

However, the remote nature of O&G operations limits the applicability of many of these solutions, which may be spatially inefficient, require operator supervision, or are ill-suited for the complex nature of produced water. Furthermore, the responsible, sustainable reuse of produced water as an alternative water source requires standardized analytical techniques for characterizing and determining the toxicity of treated produced water and improving our understanding of the fate and transport of various constituents. In the past decade, we made little progress in economically treating produced water for beneficial reuse outside of oilfield operations; the sole major breakthrough has been in the development of salt-tolerant fracturing chemicals that allow for reuse of produced water for fracking operations. Guided research should assist in the development of fit-for-purpose solutions to maximize the reuse of treated produced water. This is exemplified by the case studies presented here that detail currently operating treatment facilities for reclamation and reuse of produced water.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Importantly, decision-makers are concerned about the potential future rate impacts on energy affordability and equity. We disaggregate the key drivers of retail electricity rates and assess their impacts on future rate growth considering their interactions and uncertainty. Specifically, we develop ranges of future cost growth for a generic investor-owned and vertically-integrated electric utility representing typical cost and operating characteristics. The rate driver growth rate ranges are applied in isolation and jointly to quantify the uncertainty and variability in future retail electricity rates. The results identify what rate drivers and factors may minimize and/or decrease uncertainty in retail rate growth and their linkages to industry trends.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Due to data security concerns, most EOL HDDs are currently shredded (even when still functioning), representing an economic loss. Moreover, raw material extraction linked to the increased demand for storage causes environmental impacts. Besides mitigating the threat posed by sudden restrictions of raw materials, the circular economy (CE) offers to maximize value retention in the economy and reduce the environmental impacts of human activities. Common CE strategies are reusing and recycling products. However, the reuse of hard disk drives is currently burdened by the lack of trust HDD end-users have toward other non-physical means of data removal than shredding. Here, an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach is proposed to explore how techno-economic and social factors affect end-users' decisions to adopt EOL management practices other than shredding. The proposed method also accounts for data uncertainty by applying a semi-quantitative approach. Results demonstrate how increased green procurement and more robust standards could spur end-users' trust toward data-wiping technologies. Even when accounting for uncertainty, HDDs' reuse brings better environmental and economic benefits than HDD shredding followed by material recovery. The semi-quantitative approach proposed in this study could be more universally applied in future ABM, especially given the often-stochastic nature of such models. The developed ABM is also the first to represent several HDD industry stakeholders and demonstrate how the HDD shredding lock-in situation could be resolved.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study carried out a technoeconomic assessment (TEA) for three SWRO desalination plants in the U.S. and one in Israel to set baselines for the cost and energy consumption for seawater desalination. In addition, a breakeven curve for implementing SWRO desalination was estimated in relation to the cost of water conservation measures to meet drought-induced reduction of the traditional water supply. The results show that the cost of SWRO water production scales with the plant capacity while energy intensity is not dramatically different across the plants. The higher cost in some U.S. plants is due to high capital investment, including land acquisition and permitting. Variations in plant capacity utilization have the greatest impact on the levelized cost of water (LCOW) over the plant service life, suggesting the importance of reducing fouling and maintenance-related downtime. Scenario analysis of fixed labor cost reduction through process automation indicates investments in automation and sensing technology could result in long-term savings. Breakeven analysis shows the decision to adopt SWRO is highly dependent on the local cost associated with water conservation to meet water supply reduction. Moreover, a small reduction in SWRO cost can influence a shift toward the adoption of SWRO over water conservation measures. Incorporation of future water demand, water conservation potential, and water stress data around the nation indicates SWRO desalination could be an important contributor to the future municipal drinking water portfolio in the U.S.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Effects of Climate Change on Interregional Electricity Market Dynamics on the U.S. West Coast","Hill, Joy; Kern, Jordan; Rupp, David E.; Voisin, Nathalie; Characklis, Gregory","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The United States (U.S.) West Coast power system is strongly influenced by variability and extremes in air temperatures (which drive electricity demand) and streamflows (which constrain hydropower production). As hydroclimate changes across the West Coast, a combination of forces may work in tandem to make its bulk power system more vulnerable to physical reliability issues and market price shocks. In particular, a warmer climate is expected to increase summer cooling (electricity) demands and shift the average timing of peak streamflow (hydropower production) away from summer to the spring and winter, depriving power systems of hydropower when it is needed the most. Here, we investigate how climate change could alter interregional electricity market dynamics on the West Coast, including the potential for hydroclimatic changes in one region (e.g. Pacific Northwest (PNW)) to “spill over” and cause price and reliability risks in another (e.g. California). We find that the most salient hydroclimatic risks for the PNW power system are changes in streamflow, while risks for the California system are driven primarily by changes in summer air temperatures, especially extreme heat events that increase peak system demand. Altered timing and amounts of hydropower production in the PNW do alter summer power deliveries into California but show relatively modest potential to impact prices and reliability there. Instead, it is future climate conditions (extreme heat) in California that may exert a stronger significant influence on prices and reliability in the PNW, especially if California continues to rely on its northern neighbor for imported power to meet higher summer demands.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This study synthesized information regarding the current technological and regulatory statuses of municipal reuse. It provides process-level information on cost and energy metrics for three potable reuse and one nonpotable reuse case studies using the new Water Techno-economic Assessment Pipe-Parity Platform (WaterTAP3). WaterTAP3 enabled comparisons of cost and energy metrics for different treatment trains and for different alternative water sources consistently with a common platform. A carbon-based treatment train has both a lower calculated levelized cost of water (LCOW) ($0.40/m3) and electricity intensity (0.30 kWh/m3) than a reverse osmosis (RO)-based treatment train ($0.54/m3 and 0.84 kWh/m3). In comparing LCOW and energy intensity for water production from municipal reuse, brackish water, and seawater based on the largest facilities of each type in the United States, municipal reuse had a lower LCOW and electricity than seawater but higher values than for production from brackish water. For a small (2.0 million gallon per day) inland RO-based municipal reuse facility, WaterTAP3 evaluated different deep well injection and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) scenarios for management of RO concentrate. Adding ZLD to a facility that currently allows surface discharge of concentrate would approximately double the LCOW. For all four case studies, LCOW is most sensitive to changes in weighted average cost of capital, on-stream capacity, and plant life. Baseline assessments, pipe parity metrics, and scenario analyses can inform greater observability and understanding of reuse adoption and the potential for cost-effective and energy-efficient reuse.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the conventional use of the gravity models (i.e., the Armington approach) of trade may not adequately account for the dynamic process of market integration. In this paper, we generalize a logit-based Armington approach by permitting home preference bias erosion to account for a trend of global market integration. We build a simple agricultural economic equilibrium model and conduct hindcast experiments to examine the historical trend of market integration. The results show a significant integrating trend of the global agricultural market implied by converging Armington preference distributions (i.e., home bias erosion) in 1995 – 2015, with a half-life of 45 years. We demonstrate important implications of allowing the dynamic trend of market integration implied by bias erosion on estimating trade elasticities. By testing the future market integration trend implied by historical home bias integration in GCAM, we show a high sensitivity of long-term agroeconomic projections to future trade and market integration scenarios.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

At the lower level, the discharging capability of EVs and on-site PV generation are leveraged by individual EVCS for participating in the transactive trading with their peers. Once the lower-level trading is completed, EVCSs trade energy at the upper level through the power grid network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO). The upper-level market is cleared while satisfying the power distribution network constraints. A cooperative game-based model is proposed to model the energy trading among EVCSs. To this end, the asymmetric Nash bargaining method is applied to allocate the grand coalition's payoff to each EVCS at the upper-level market, while a weighted proportional allocation method is used to allocate individual EVCS's payoff to its respective EVs at the lower-level market. In this work, the upper-level market formulation is further decomposed into two subproblems representing an energy scheduling and trading subproblem which maximizes EVCS payoffs, and a bargaining subproblem which allocates EVCS payoffs. The effectiveness of the proposed framework for incentivizing transactive trades among EVs and EVCSs is validated in case studies.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

In the United States, site-specific and material flow approaches determine the MSW composition at regional and national levels. The material flow-based national estimates are determined by the US EPA; the US EPA’s estimates are known to differ substantially from the aggregated tonnage of MSW managed by waste handling facilities in the United States. However, the material class-specific discrepancies of the US EPA’s material flow approach resulting in these differences are unknown. To find the basis of these discrepancies, we analyze the discarded MSW stream of 27 US states, which roughly accounts for 73 percent of the US population. Our analysis indicates that the material flow-based national estimates are accurate for the food, plastic, and glass material classes. In contrast, we find that the US EPA’s material flow-based predictions underestimate paper waste disposal by at least 15 million tons annually. These differences likely stem from incorrect assumptions of residence time.

We also investigate how these changes in BOS costs influence the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). We show that increasing the plant size from 150 to 400 MW could reduce the BOS costs by 21%. We also show that if the foundation costs decreased by 50%, building a wind power plant with 5-MW turbines (having rotor diameters of 166 m and hub heights of 120 m) could decrease the LCOE by 5%.

In this techno-economic analysis, the opportunity to scale at this production throughput is considered with manufacturing rates exceeding one gigawatt per year in a single plant. Intense pulsed light is used for the post deposition process to minimize costs associated with the footprint, equipment, and operation. The analysis is limited to the operation of a roll-to-roll manufacturing facility producing a perovskite solar film that can be incorporated into photovoltaic modules. Costs associated with materials, labor, and equipment are considered along with utilities determined from the fundamental engineering calculations. Furthermore, the results show that at very large-scale operations of several gigawatts, the costs to produce the solar films range between $0.04-$0.10 per watt.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Louisville, KY (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous virtual water trade studies largely focus on historical timeframes. We explore, for the first time, future—through 2050—virtual water trade driven by electricity trade under a range of future electricity sector transformation scenarios using the United States as an example. Under a business-as-usual scenario, virtual water trading in 2050 decreases by 3% relative to 2015 levels. By contrast, virtual water trading increases respectively by 3%, 26%, and 32%, in scenarios characterized by higher socioeconomic growth, higher potential for transmission expansion, and low-carbon transitions. These increases are driven by electricity generation expansion in the western U.S., resulting in higher virtual water trade to the east. In addition, we find that as electricity generation shifts west, an increased amount of nonrenewable groundwater will be consumed to generate electricity that is supplied to the east. Independent of scenario, the US electricity grid largely relies on virtual water exports from only a few states.

Climate change, the pressure of a growing population, degrading water quality, and increased competition from other sectors could constrain continuous supply to meet future agricultural water demand. This study presents an evaluation framework to assess the potential reuse of agricultural drainage water for crop irrigation. Using a regional approach, we review the current state of agricultural drainage treatment and reuse and the institutional, economic, and other barriers that can influence the reuse decision. In the 31 eastern states, agricultural drainage contains valuable nutrients that can be reused for irrigation with minimal treatment, while the 17 western states struggle with large volumes of saline drainage that can contain constituents of concern (e.g., selenium), preventing reuse without treatment. Using a new decision-support tool called WaterTAP3, a potential treatment train for saline agricultural drainage was analyzed to identify treatment challenges, research needs, and the potential implementation at a larger scale. As demonstrated by our case study, desalination of agricultural drainage is costly and energy intensive and will require sizable investments to fully develop and optimize technologies as well as manage the generated waste and brine.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Stakeholder Support for Wildlife Conservation Funding Policies","Henderson, Chris D.; Riley, Shawn J.; Pomeranz, Emily F.; Kramer, Daniel B.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; human dimensions; hunting; Michigan; wildlife management; wildlife watching","State wildlife management agencies in the United States have depended on a “user-pay” funding model for conservation efforts that relies on revenue from hunting license sales and a federal excise tax on firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment. Declines in hunting participation, however, jeopardize sustainability of the current funding model. Ensuring support among stakeholders for wildlife management and conservation may require expanding sources of funding and incorporating the perspectives and values of a diversifying constituency into decision making processes. We used a web-based survey of wildlife-associated recreationists in Michigan, USA to evaluate support for a range of conservation funding policies. Respondents self-identified primarily as hunters (n = 2,558) or wildlife watchers (n = 942). We used binary logistic regression to evaluate support for four conservation funding policy options: state sales tax, lottery proceeds, extractive industry revenue, and a user-based tax on outdoor gear (i.e., “backpack tax”). Determinants of support varied by type of policy and stakeholder characteristics. We found no statistically significant differences between hunters and wildlife watchers in their support for conservation funding policies when accounting for other variables such as wildlife value orientations, engagement in stewardship behaviors, age, and gender. The industry-based policy achieved the greatest level of approval, while the backpack tax had the lowest. Respondents were mixed in their support of the sales tax and lottery proceeds options. Cluster analysis revealed three homogenous groups related to conservation funding policies: “strong support,” “mixed/opposed,” and “anti-backpack tax.” Clusters differed in their support for conservation funding policies and on psychological and demographic variables. The “strong support” and “anti-backpack tax” groups differed in their levels of stewardship engagement, knowledge of conservation funding mechanisms, and support for the backpack tax option. The “mixed-opposed” group tended to be older, less educated, and less likely to be a member of a conservation organization. Results suggest support for conservation funding differs by policy type and social and psychological characteristics of stakeholders. Based on differences in policy support revealed in this study, we suggest a multi-tiered approach to funding conservation and building on support among wildlife stakeholders to mitigate the looming funding crisis for state wildlife agencies.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Improving the performance of first- and last-mile mobility services through transit coordination, real-time demand prediction, advanced reservations, and trip prioritization","Grahn, Rick; Qian, Sean; Hendrickson, Chris","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; First-mile; Last-mile; Public transit; Flexible transit; Demand responsive transit","Socio-demographic trends and recent economic development patterns have resulted in travel behavior changes that call for more flexible and accessible public transit options. Because flexible transit services vary in scope, size, and service type, new data-informed methods are useful to optimize services based on the specific needs of local communities and riders. In this study, real-world demand and vehicle trajectory data were used to evaluate and optimize system performance for an existing first-mile–last-mile (FMLM) service in Robinson Township, PA. A general FMLM model for arbitrary demand and service supply was then developed to quantify system performance—both travel time costs and day-to-day reliability—for various operational polices considering spatio-temporal demand variation and transportation network dynamics. Heuristics were used for optimal real-time vehicle routing in sizable real-world networks accommodating various service types and scopes. In this case study, total user costs were reduced by 18.6% when rides were coordinated with mainline fixed-route transit. Predictive routing strategies were shown to marginally improve system performance under sparse and variable spatio-temporal demand. The case study also highlights potentially large travel time and user reliability improvements—reductions of 51% and 53.8%, respectively—when trip requests were made in advance of their desired pickup time. Finally, we show that travel time reliability can be improved for time-inflexible trips with trip prioritization without increasing total user costs. These results were stable to changes in demand density.","Elsevier","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-11-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Journal Volume: 133","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 103430","","","EE0008883","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X","10.1016/j.trc.2021.103430","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1885409","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1885409","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1885409","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","","133"
"Optimal strategies for a cost-effective and reliable 100% renewable electric grid","Houssainy, Sammy; Livingood, William","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 100% renewable; demand flexibility; energy efficiency; energy storage; renewable energy","This paper explores cost-optimal pathways to 100% renewable power systems for the U.S. building stock. We show that long-duration misalignments of supply and demand, spanning from multi-day to seasonal timescales, present a dominant challenge that must be addressed to meet real-time 100% renewable targets. While long-duration misalignments can be addressed through energy storage, we show that alternative and readily available solutions that are more cost-effective should be considered first. Through a techno-economic analysis, we identify cost-optimal, region-dependent, supply-side, and demand-side strategies that reduce, and in some U.S. regions eliminate, the otherwise substantial capacities and associated costs of long-duration energy storage. Investigated supply-side strategies include optimal mixes of renewable portfolios and oversized generation capacities. Considered demand-side strategies include building load flexibility and building energy efficiency investments. Our results reveal that building energy efficiency measures can reduce long-duration storage requirements at minimum total investment costs. In addition, oversizing and diversifying renewable generation can play a critical role in reducing storage requirements, remaining cost effective even when accounting for curtailed generation. We identify regionally dependent storage cost targets and show that for emerging long-duration energy storage innovations to achieve broad adoption, their costs will need to compete with the decreasing cost of renewables. The findings of this research are particularly important given that most long-duration storage technologies are currently either uneconomical, geologically constrained, or still underdeveloped.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By 2050, battery electric vehicles could gain significant market share—as much as 30.4%–64.6%; and the industry's sales-weighted average fuel consumption could reach 1.81–3.11 L/100 km. Cumulative battery demand from PEVs could soar to over 700 GWh by 2050, whereas battery recycling alone could satisfy about 60% of the demand by 2050. The key metal supplies—lithium, cobalt, and nickel—for China's PEV market are projected, and nickel should be concerned more over the coming decades.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We develop empirical hourly savings shapes for residential space-conditioning measures from nearly 18,000 efficiency projects in California and show how they combine with the diurnal and seasonal variation in electricity system costs. We find that these measures (cooling replacements; windows, doors, and skylights; and other envelope measures) tend to save electricity when system costs are highest and that the hourly savings account for 1.4–1.5 times as much value as non-time-sensitive estimates of efficiency would predict. We present these impact multipliers for each measure to quantify the additional value revealed by the time-sensitive approach.

Vincent","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Energy resources; Energy policy; Energy systems; Energy management; Energy flexibility","Despite extensive research in the past five years and several successfully completed and on-going pilot projects, regulators are still reluctant to implement peer-to-peer trading at a large-scale in today’s electricity market. The reason could partly be attributed to the perceived disadvantage of current market participants like retailers due to their exclusion from market participation - a fundamental property of decentralized peer-to-peer trading. As a consequence, recently, there has been growing pressure from energy service providers in favor of retailers’ participation in peer-to-peer trading. However, the role of retailers in the peer-to peer market is yet to be established as no existing study has challenged this fundamental circumspection of decentralized trading. In this context, this perspective takes the first step to discuss the feasibility of retailers’ involvement in the peer-to-peer market. In doing so, we identify key characteristics of retail-based and peer-to-peer electricity markets and discuss our viewpoint on how to incorporate a single retailer in a peer-to-peer market without compromising the fundamental decision-making characteristics of both markets. Finally, we give an example of a hypothetical business model to demonstrate how a retailer can be a part of a peer-to-peer market with a promise of collective benefits for the participants.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The regional biomass supply for a 20 MW bioelectricity facility is estimated using the Land Use and Resource Allocation (LURA) model. Results from LURA and data on regional forest management, harvesting, and processing are incorporated into the GHGs, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for LCA. The results suggest that GHG emissions of mill residues-based pathways can be 15-52% lower than those of pulpwood-based pathways, with logging residues falling in between. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that screening bioenergy projects on specific feedstock types alone is not sufficient because GHG emissions of a pulpwood-based pathway in one state can be lower than those of a mill residue-based pathway in another state. Furthermore, the available biomass supply often consists of several woody feedstocks, and its composition is region-dependent. Forest biomass-derived electricity is associated with 86-93% lower life-cycle GHG emissions than the emissions of the average grid electricity in the U.S. Key factors driving bioelectricity GHG emissions include electricity generation efficiency, transportation distance, and energy use for biomass harvesting and processing.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Research and development investment decisions in the energy space are especially difficult due to numerous risks and uncertainties, and due to the complexity of energy's interactions with the broad economy. Historically, much of the U.S. Department of Energy's in-depth research and development analyses focused on assessing the impact of a research and development activity in isolation from other available opportunities and did not substantially consider risk and uncertainty. Endeavoring to combine integrated energy-economy modeling with uncertainty analysis and technology-specific research and development activities, the U.S. Department of Energy commissioned the development of the Stochastic Energy Deployment System to support and improve public energy research and development decision-making. The Stochastic Energy Deployment System draws from expert-elicited probability distributions for research and development-driven improvements in technology cost and performance, and it uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the likelihood of outcomes within a system dynamics energy-economy model. The framework estimates the uncertain benefits and costs of various research and development portfolios and provides insight into the probability of meeting national technology goals, while accounting for interactions with the larger economy and for interactions among research and development investments spanning many energy sectors.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To address FEW resources inequity among different regions and countries, transdisciplinary research networking becomes increasingly important for tackling this intractable, complex grand challenge. In contrast to interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary research, transdisciplinary research emphasizes the interactions of scientific, cognitive, and social factors from a top-down view. Intellectual and strategic integrations entail weaving scientific, socioeconomic, and political perspectives together into a new convergence model and fostering a shared vision and comparable assessment, though these goals might not be realistically achievable in the short term. This article summarizes major barriers to transdisciplinary research on FEW nexus grand challenges and possible solutions to be implemented at multiple levels of distinct social systems. Implementation of the solutions relies on not only top-down incentives of governments but also bottom-up initiatives of academic communities and individual researchers. The relevance of shared interests and visions between the research communities and the public is emphasized.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One such strategy is to diversify the sources from which water is supplied. Industrial withdrawals represent the fourth largest category of U.S. water use, the majority of which is sourced from fresh surface and groundwater. In this study, we critically explore the potential of industrial wastewater to serve as an alternative water resource through direct treatment and reuse. We begin by reviewing the state of the art of water use, treatment, and reuse across six representative industries: food and beverages, primary metals, pulp and paper, petroleum refining, chemicals, and data centers and campuses, highlighting key challenges and opportunities toward the expansion of reuse. We then employ a technoeconomic assessment of water treatment processes to analyze the capital investment, operating and maintenance costs, levelized cost of water, and electricity consumption of three specific industrial plants as case studies to better understand where research can promote impactful innovation. Finally, drawing together the results of our literature review and technoeconomic analyses, we provide a broad outlook on the future of industrial water reuse and discuss strategies for its expansion.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Bubbles in US gasoline prices: Assessing the role of hurricanes and anti–price gouging laws","Oladosu, Gbadebo A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Gasoline prices; Price bubbles; Adjustment speed; Hurricanes; Price gouging","This paper examines the presence of bubbles — price changes that cannot be attributed to market fundamentals — in weekly US retail gasoline prices for ten US cities, and whether these bubbles are affected by hurricane events and anti–price gouging laws. Rolling-window, right-tailed unit root tests were used to identify and date bubbles. The analysis found 6 to 22 bubbles, lasting 4 weeks or longer, in city-level retail gasoline prices between 2000 and 2017. A linear regression model of the adjustment speed coefficients from the bubble identification step found that hurricane events increase the rate of price explosivity (or slow the rate of return to equilibrium) following a shock. Furthermore, the regression estimates also imply that state anti–price gouging laws can counteract these effects.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A transient period of inequitable adoption is common among emerging technologies but stakeholders are calling for an accelerated transition to equitable rooftop PV adoption. To date, researchers have focused on demand-side drivers of PV adoption inequity, but supply-side factors could also play a role. Here, we use quote data to explore whether PV installers implement income-targeted marketing and the extent to which such strategies drive adoption inequity. We find that installers submit fewer quotes to households in low-income areas and those households that receive fewer quotes are less likely to adopt. The data suggest that income-targeted marketing explains about one-quarter of the difference in PV adoption rates between LMI and higher-income households. Policymakers could explore a broader suite of interventions to address demand- and supply-side drivers of PV adoption inequity.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Plentiful electricity turns wholesale prices negative","Seel, Joachim; Millstein, Dev; Mills, Andrew; Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; negative electricity prices; electricity markets; system flexibility; variable renewable energy","In 2020, average wholesale electricity prices in the United States fell to $21/MWh, their lowest level since the beginning of the 21st century. Low natural gas prices and the proliferation of low marginal cost resources like wind and solar had already established a trend toward lower wholesale prices, and this trend was exacerbated by declining electricity demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Negative real-time hourly wholesale prices occurred in about 4% of all hours and wholesale market nodes across the United States, but these were not distributed evenly. Regional clusters emerged, for example, in the Permian Basin in western Texas, and in Kansas and western Oklahoma in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), negative prices accounted for more than 25% of all hours. Negative electricity prices result either from local congestion of the transmission system leading supply to exceed demand locally or due to system-wide oversupply. Looking at the latter condition in SPP, we find that all major generator types contribute to this excess supply, because of limited ramping flexibility or self-scheduled out-of-market unit commitments. Additional monetary production incentives such as renewable energy credits or tax credits also enable negative bids; indeed, negative prices predominantly occur when demand levels are low and wind production levels are high. Frequent negative prices can inform the value of additional renewable energy investments at specific locations, the need for transmission and storage development, and opportunities load growth or adaptation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A shear fracture is created within a Marcellus shale sample, and the fracture aperture is measured using a triaxial direct-shear device coupled with real-time X-ray imaging at in-situ stress conditions. We construct an ensemble of fracture networks based on natural fractures in Marcellus shale and project regions of the experimental aperture field onto each fracture in the networks. Our calculations demonstrate that the degree of flow channelization, a network-scale flow field structure, is dramatically increased by local changes in the aperture field that in turn affects flow and transport properties.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Future power plant siting costs will depend on a number of factors including the characteristics of the electricity capacity expansion and electricity demand (e.g., fuel mix of future electric power capacity, and the magnitude and geographic distribution of electricity demand growth) as well as the geographic location of power plants. Electricity technology capacity expansion plans modeled to represent alternate future conditions meeting a set of scenario assumptions are traditionally compared against historical trends which may not be consistent with current and future conditions. We present the `cerf` Python package (a.k.a., the Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility model) which helps evaluate the feasibility and structure of future, scenario-driven electricity capacity expansion plans by siting power plants in areas that have been deemed the least cost option while considering dynamic future conditions. We can use `cerf` to gain insight to research topics such as: 1) under what conditions future projected electricity expansion plans from models such as GCAM-USA are possible to achieve, 2) where and which on-the-ground barriers to siting (e.g., protected areas, cooling water availability) may influence our ability to achieve certain expansions, and 3) how electricity infrastructure build-outs and value may evolve into the future when considering locational marginal pricing (LMP) based on the supply and demand of electricity from a grid operations model.","Open Source Initiative - NumFOCUS","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper presents a modeling framework that integrates travel mode encoding, demand projection, and microsimulation to enable airports to develop, simulate, and evaluate curbside traffic managements policies and measure their impact. The framework is utilized to analyze several traffic scenarios and policies for DFW: a baseline scenario which represents DFW traffic pattern as observed in 2018 and projected to 2045, a transit network company (TNC) electrification policy, a TNC queuing policy, a policy that increased transit ridership, a bus-only policy which considers the use of only buses inside DFW, an autonomous vehicle (AV) policy which investigates the impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption on airport operations, and an example COVID-19 scenario which models the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. The simulations’ results demonstrate that: increasing the DFW transit ridership postpones the need for airport curbside expansion the most; encouraging shared-mobility with the bus-only policy produces the most savings in curbside congestion delays; automation and electrification for all passenger vehicle trips to/from DFW generates the most saving in fuel consumption and emissions; and uncontrolled AV adoption incurs the highest increase in fuel consumption, delay, and emissions and could require immediate airport capacity extension. Without policy intervention or investment in additional infrastructure capacity, these results predict the current operations would face significant congestion on high demand days starting as early as 2028.

Directly capturing humidity, membrane-based liquid-desiccant dehumidification systems separate sensible and latent cooling (SSLC) loads and thus offer a promising pathway for a high-performance AC solution. Design of an energy-efficient SSLC-AC system, however, rests largely on detailed understating of the dehumidification process. While some studies have identified the dehumidification process mainly depends on membrane characteristics, other studies have argued that the process is limited by desiccant liquid or alternatively air thermo-hydraulic physics for typical humid climate conditions. The present study examines performance and physics of the membrane-based liquid-desiccant dehumidification process over a wide range of climate conditions through a novel 3D, two-phase, multi-species CFD model. Decoupling the thermodynamic and hydraulic effects, the study reveals that the dehumidification rate is a linear function of the water vapor pressure potential ($J=α ΔP$) summarizing the system's thermodynamic state. The slope of the curve (i.e., α) depends on hydraulic transport characteristics of the membrane pores, air stream, and desiccant solution. More importantly, it was found that the air dehumidification process is mainly limited by the air-side transport physics for thin liquid-desiccant films and commonly used porous superhydrophobic membranes. Additionally, results show that, depending on ambient/desiccant conditions and physical dehumidifier characteristics, energy effectiveness and dehumidification rate vary from 13 to 34% and from 0.13 to 1.4 g m<sup> -2</sup> s<sup> -1</sup>, respectively. Therefore, the present study allows to efficiently design future SSLC-based AC systems exhibiting high performance energy metrics.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The toolset is piloted by a global architecture and master planning firm to evaluate several key urban-scale technical questions for the design of a district in Chicago. The findings indicate that, while energy savings can be achieved through traditional architectural studies and enhancements to individual building efficiency, the modeling toolset helps identify additional savings and insights that can be achieved when considering district-scale energy systems. Finally, this study demonstrates how the Dragonfly/URBANopt toolset can integrate with master planning workflows, thereby enabling an iterative performance-based design process.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Role of the social factors in success of solar photovoltaic reuse and recycle programmes","Walzberg, Julien; Carpenter, Alberta; Heath, Garvin A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; agent-based modeling; circular economy; circular strategies; machine learning; socio-technical systems; sustainability; energy management; environmental impact; photovoltaics; psychology and behavior","By 2050, the cumulative mass of end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) modules may reach 80 Mt globally. The impacts could be mitigated by module recycling, repair and reuse; however, previous studies of PV circularity omit the consideration of critical social factors. Here we used an agent-based model to integrate social aspects with techno-economic factors, which provides a more realistic assessment of the circularity potential for previously studied interventions that assesses additional interventions that cannot be analysed using techno-economic analysis alone. We also performed a global sensitivity analysis using a machine-learning metamodel. We show that to exclude social factors underestimates the effect of lower recycling prices on PV material circularity, which highlights the relevance of considering social factors in future studies. Interventions aimed at changing customer attitudes about used PV boost the reuse of modules, although used modules can only satisfy one-third of the US demand during 2020–2050, which suggests that reuse should be complemented by recycling.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Designing Pareto optimal electricity retail rates when utility customers are prosumers","Saumweber, Andrea; Wederhake, Lars; Cardoso, Gonçalo; Fridgen, Gilbert; Heleno, Miguel","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Ratemaking; Rate case; Prosumer; Utility; DER-CAM; Pareto optimization","Electric retail rate design is relevant to utilities, customers, and regulators as retail rates impact the utility's revenue as well as the customers' electricity bills. In California, regulators approve rate proposals by privately owned vertical integrated utilities. Approval, however, is subject to compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives such as economic or environmental objectives. Additionally, retail rates are price signals that affect how customers use electricity services. When utility customers change their usage, they also impact the ratemaking objectives to which rates have been designed. This suggests a feedback loop, which is particularly pronounced with prosumers, as they can systematically optimize their interactions with the electricity system. Prevalent ratemaking methods may not deliver retail rates that are optimal for multiple objectives when customers are prosumers. We propose a novel ratemaking method that formalizes the problem of designing retail rates as a multi-criteria optimization problem and accounts for prosumer reactions through a simulation-based optimization approach. Through a fictive case study, we found that the resulting Pareto frontiers are useful in recognizing and balancing tradeoffs among conflicting ratemaking objectives. Additionally, our results indicate that prevailing retail rates in California are not Pareto optimal.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We estimate the technical potential near- and long-term impacts of best available building efficiency and flexibility measures on annual electricity use and hourly demand across the contiguous U.S. Co-deployment of building efficiency and flexibility avoids up to 742 TWh of annual electricity use and 181 GW of daily net peak load in 2030, rising to 800 TWh and 208 GW by 2050; at least 59 GW and 69 GW of the peak reductions are dispatchable. Implementing efficiency measures alongside flexibility measures reduces the potential for off-peak load increases, underscoring limitations on load shifting in efficient buildings. Overall, however, we find a substantial building-grid resource that could reduce future fossil-fired generation needs while also reducing dependence on energy storage with increasing variable renewable energy penetration.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using the iodine–sulfur (IS) cycle coupled with a nuclear heat source is one method for producing hydrogen without the use of fossil fuels. An economic dispatch model was developed for a nuclear-driven IS system to determine hydrogen sale prices that would make such a system profitable. The system studied is the HTTR-GT/H2, a design for power and hydrogen cogeneration at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor. This study focuses on the development of the economic model and the role that input data plays in the final calculated values. Using a historical price duration curve shows that the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) or breakeven sale price of hydrogen would need to be 98.1 JPY/m3 or greater. Synthetic time histories were also used and found the LCOH to be 67.5 JPY/m3. The price duration input was found to have a significant effect on the LCOH. As such, great care should be used in these economic dispatch analyses to select reasonable input assumptions.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Climate change threatens both objectives through potentially compounding supply- and demand-side climate-induced impacts. Uncertainty surrounds each of these future potential impacts. Given long planning horizons, system planners must weigh investment costs against operational costs under this uncertainty. Here, we developed a comprehensive and coherent integrated modeling framework combining physically-based models with cost-minimizing optimization models in the power system. We applied this modeling framework to analyze potential tradeoffs in planning and operating costs in the power grid due to climate change in the Southeast U.S. in 2050. We find that planning decisions that do not account for climate-induced impacts would result in a substantial increase in social costs associated with loss of load. These social costs are a result of under-investment in new capacity and capacity deratings of thermal generators when we included climate change impacts in the operation stage. Finally, these results highlight the importance of including climate change effects in the planning process.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Household Transportation Energy Affordability by Region and Socioeconomic Factors","Zhou, Yan; Aeschliman, Spencer; Gohlke, David","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; gasoline price; machine learning; stock-weighted MPG; transportation energy affordability; vehicle miles traveled (VMT)","Transportation fuel is an important component of household budgets, as 3.3% of total household expenditures are for vehicle fuel nationwide and over 50% of annual household expenditures on energy are for transportation. These average values vary geographically, and higher energy cost burdens are faced by households with lower incomes. Defining transportation energy affordability burden as the percentage of annual household income spent on vehicle fuel, this study aims to quantify affordability as a function of household characteristics and geography. Here, through analysis at the census tract level, this study (i) projects annual household vehicle miles traveled (VMT) based on demographic factors using machine-learning techniques, (ii) estimates local differences in vehicle fuel economy and fuel price, and (iii) quantifies resulting transportation energy affordability by census tract. This study found that the average burden by tract varies from 0.15% to 8%. The variation in affordability can be largely explained by income level and vehicle fuel efficiency. Suburban and rural households spend more on transportation energy compared with urban households because of the usage of less fuel-efficient vehicle technologies and higher annual VMT. Lower-income groups have a wide distribution of the percentage of income spent on transportation energy, 1.2% to 8%, whereas the range for the highest income group ($125,000+) is from 0.15% to 3.9%. This detailed transportation energy affordability analysis provides a better understanding of regional variations in household travel behavior, helps to determine where fuel-efficient vehicle technologies are more likely to be used, and improves estimates of vehicle ownership costs.","SAGE","","Argonne National Lab.

To capture Argentina’s sub-national EWL dynamics in the context of global change, we couple the Global Change Analysis Model with a suite of consistent, gridded sectoral downscaling models to explore multiple stakeholder-engaged scenarios. Across scenarios, Argentina has the economic opportunity to use its vast land resources to satisfy growing domestic and international demand for crops, such as oil (e.g., soy) and biomass. The human (rather than earth) system produces the most dominant changes in mid-century EWL resource use. A Reference scenario characterized by modest socioeconomic growth projects a 40% increase in Argentina’s agricultural production by 2050 (relative to 2020) by using 50,000 km<sup>2</sup> of additional cropland and 40% more water. A Climate Policy scenario designed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions globally shortly after mid-century projects that Argentina could use 100,000 km<sup>2</sup> of additional land (and 65% more water) to grow biomass and other crops. The burden of navigating these national opportunities and challenges could fall disproportionately on a subset of Argentina’s river basins. The Colorado and Negro basins could experience moderate-to-severe water scarcity as they simultaneously navigate substantial irrigated crop demand growth and climate-induced declines in natural water availability. Argentina serves as a generalizable testbed to demonstrate that multi-scale EWL planning challenges can be identified and managed more effectively via integrated analysis of coupled human-earth systems.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It also provides a critical source of raw materials for the manufacturing, transportation, construction, and energy sectors. Demand for raw materials is projected to increase as the world population grows and many low-income economies become middle-income countries. This growth in mineral demand, coupled with falling mineral ore grade, will likely increase the mining industry’s energy demand, used for activities across exploration, extraction, beneficiation and processing, and refining. At the time of this writing, mine operations are – due to their remoteness – dependent on fossil fuels such as diesel, heavy oils, and coal. In principle, mining could use energy recovery, renewable energy, and carbon capture to supplement, replace, or mitigate the impacts of fossil fuel use. However, a combination of renewable-energy technologies would be required. We explore challenges, opportunities, and enabling approaches to integrate renewable energy technologies into mining operations by examining the literature, including academic work, technical reports, and data produced by international agencies. Here, we find that despite numerous opportunities, technical issues still need to be considered, but solutions can tailor renewables to the mining industry. Further research should focus on identifying specific opportunities, technologies, and implementation strategies across the value chain of a variety of minerals with similar operational procedures.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, renewable energy infrastructure expansion requires significant land-assets and could come at high costs to ecosystem integrity, creating potential mismatches in global climate and biodiversity conservation priorities. Here, we explore the potential land requirements and biodiversity implications of alternative future global electrification pathways as depicted under the Shared Socioeconomic Scenarios (SSPs). High-resolution estimates of global energy densities for ten renewable and conventional technologies were overlain with global richness data to estimate biodiversity footprints (species per GWh) for each technology. Regionally explicit electricity generation scenarios (2020 to 2100) were downscaled to 50-km depictions of future technology deployment and were additionally constrained by scenarios of protected land exclusion and variant local energy development policies. Biodiversity footprints were used to explore land and biodiversity impacts through a heuristic cumulative biodiversity impact (CBI) score. CBI variation among SSPs was not a clear tradeoff in global climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation, but an outcome of total electricity demand, energy efficiency, and the total magnitude of renewable energy development and storage technologies. Despite comprising <= 7% of total generation, biomass energy contributed the most to biodiversity impacts. However, our results suggest that land conservation practices and local strategies aimed to promote energy diversification could have greater implications for future biodiversity conflicts than alternative SSPs. Hence, there is great uncertainty in how future global electrification pathways will influence biodiversity depending on local land use and conservation policies.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Disruption from extreme weather events and cybersecurity events is bringing new scrutiny to power-system resilience. Recognizing the complex social and technical aspects that are involved, this article provides a meta-level framework for coherently evaluating and making decisions about power-system resilience. It does so by examining net-zero carbon strategies with quantitative, qualitative, and integrative dimensions across discrete location-specific systems and timescales. The generalizable framework is designed with a flexibility and logic that allows for refinement to accompany stakeholder review processes and highly localized decision-making. To highlight the framework’s applicability across multiple timescales, processes, and types of knowledge, power system outages are reviewed for extreme weather events, including 2021 and 2011 winter storms that impacted Texas, the 2017 Hurricane Maria that affected Puerto Rico, and a heatwave/wildfire event in California in August 2020. By design, the meta-level framework enables utility decision-makers, regulators, insurers, and communities to analyze and track levels of resilience safeguards for a given system. Future directions to advance an integrated science of resilience in net-zero power systems and the use of this framework are also discussed.","MDPI","","Idaho National Lab.

"Circular Bioeconomy Concepts—A Perspective","Tan, Eric C. D.; Lamers, Patrick","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; bioeconomy; carbon cycle; carbon utilization; circular economy; sustainability","<p>Circular economy concepts—including a circular bioeconomy—aim to transition the current, essentially linear, economic system to a more sustainable one. However, organizations and researchers currently define the circular economy concept differently, resulting in inconsistencies and difficulty in effectively implementing the framework. In this paper, we provide our perspective on the conceptual definitions of the circular economy, bioeconomy, and circular bioeconomy, outlining potential overlaps and differences and proposing a harmonized interpretation that stresses the importance of the carbon cycle. We conclude that the key goal of a circular economy is to slow, narrow, and close material resource loops, built on the foundation of renewable energy and non-toxic materials. Further, a sustainable bioeconomy goes beyond simply switching fossil resources with renewable, biological resources. It requires low-carbon energy inputs, sustainable supply chains, and promising disruptive conversion technologies for the sustainable transformation of renewable bioresources to high-value bio-based products, materials, and fuels. The bio-based circular carbon economy, in particular, stresses capturing atmospheric carbon via photosynthesis and exploiting this unique feature to the fullest extent possible.

"Potential Early Markets for Fusion Energy","Handley, Malcolm C.; Slesinski, Daniel; Hsu, Scott C.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; fusion energy; energy markets","We examine potential early markets for fusion energy and their projected cost targets, based on analysis and synthesis of many relevant, recent studies and reports. Seeking to provide guidance to ambitious fusion developers aspiring to enable commercial deployment before 2040, we examine cost requirements for fusion-generated electricity, process heat, and hydrogen production based on today’s market prices but with various adjustments relating to possible scenarios in 2035, such as ‘‘business-as-usual,’’ high renewables penetration, and carbon pricing up to 100 $/tCO<sub>2</sub>. Key findings are that fusion developers should consider focusing initially on high-priced global electricity markets and consider including integrated thermal storage, depending on techno-economic factors, in order to maximize revenue and compete in markets with high renewables penetration. Process heat and hydrogen production will be tough early markets for fusion, but may open up to fusion as markets evolve and if fusion’s levelized cost of electricity falls below 50 $/MWh<sub>e</sub>. Finally, we discuss potential ways for a fusion plant to increase revenue via cogeneration (e.g., desalination, direct air capture, or district heating) and to lower capital costs (e.g., by minimizing construction times and interest or by retrofitting coal plants).","Springer","","Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E), Washington, DC (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fusion Energy; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 18","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0164-0313","10.1007/s10894-021-00306-4","","2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","1861030","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1861030","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1861030","Journal of Fusion Energy","2","40"
"The impacts of convex piecewise linear cost formulations on AC optimal power flow","Coffrin, Carleton James; Knueven, Bernard; Holzer, Jesse; Vuffray, Marc Denis","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Computer Science; Energy Sciences; Nonlinear optimization; Convex optimization; Optimal power flow; Piecewise linear functions; POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; convex optimization; nonlinear optimization; optimal power flow; piecewise linear functions","Despite strong connections through shared application areas, research efforts on power market optimization (e.g., unit commitment) and power network optimization (e.g., optimal power flow) remain largely independent. A notable illustration of this is the treatment of power generation cost functions, where nonlinear network optimization has largely used polynomial representations and market optimization has adopted piecewise linear encodings. This work combines state-of-the-art results from both lines of research to understand the best mathematical formulations of the nonlinear AC optimal power flow problem with piecewise linear generation cost functions. An extensive numerical analysis of non-convex models, linear approximations, and convex relaxations across fifty-four realistic test cases illustrates that nonlinear optimization methods are surprisingly sensitive to the mathematical formulation of piecewise linear functions. The results indicate that a poor formulation choice can slow down algorithm performance by a factor of ten, increasing the runtime from seconds to minutes. These results provide valuable insights into the best formulations of nonlinear optimal power flow problems with piecewise linear cost functions, an important step towards building a new generation of energy markets that incorporate the nonlinear AC power flow model.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Impact of operating reserve rules on electricity prices with high penetrations of renewable energy","Frew, Bethany; Brinkman, Gregory; Denholm, Paul; Narwade, Vinayak; Stephen, Gordon; Bloom, Aaron; Lau, Jessica","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; costs; demand; electricity prices; operating reserves; prices; production cost modeling; scarcity pricing; solar; supply; wholesale electricity markets; wind","In competitive wholesale electricity markets, significant effort is devoted to designing markets that set efficient prices for maintaining supply-demand balance. One factor that can impact prices is administratively-set scarcity pricing, which sets prices to a preset level when the market is not able to meet operating reserve or energy requirements. When energy and operating reserves are co-optimized, assumptions surrounding operating reserve requirements and scarcity pricing can impact system-wide price outcomes for both operating reserves and energy. This study uses production cost modeling of an ERCOT-like system to evaluate the impact of operating reserve eligibility, scarcity pricing, and quantity rules on electricity prices, and therefore also on generator revenues. Results reveal economic and operational benefits with allowing open participation in reserve markets, as this enables greater access to the full set of capable resources at lowest cost. Furthermore, both energy and reserve prices are strongly impacted by reserve scarcity pricing events, which reveals that reserve scarcity pricing assumptions can impact price outcomes even for units not providing reserves. This study highlights the importance of operating reserve scarcity pricing rules because of the strong coupling between energy and reserve prices and because these rules serve as proxies for true price responsive demand.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Rotating power outages happen when the power supply is unable to meet the cooling demand increase resulting from extreme high temperatures. Power outages during heat waves expose residents to high risks of overheating. In this study, we propose a novel data-driven inverse modelling approach to inform decision makers and grid operators on planning rotating power outages. We first infer the building thermal characteristics using the connected smart thermostat data, and used the estimated thermal dynamics to simulate the thermal resilience during a heat wave event. Our proposed method was tested for the California power outage in August 2020 by using the open source Ecobee Donate Your Data dataset. We found in California the power outage should not last more than two hours during heat waves to avoid overheating risks. Informing the residents in advance so they can prepare for it through pre-cooling is a simple but effective strategy to expand the acceptable power outage duration. In addition to assisting power outage planning, the proposed method can be used for other applications, such as to evaluate a building energy efficiency policy, to examine fuel poverty, and to estimate the load shifting potential of building stocks.</p>","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Resilience and economics of microgrids with PV, battery storage, and networked diesel generators","Marqusee, Jeffrey; Becker, William; Ericson, Sean","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; distributed energy resources; microgrid; reliability; resilience; techno-economic optimization","Current designs and assessments of microgrids have ignored component reliability, leading to significant errors in predicting a microgrid’s performance while islanded. Existing life cycle cost studies on hybrid microgrids—which combine photovoltaics (PV), battery storage and networked emergency diesel generators—also have not identified all the potential economic opportunities. Reducing the number of emergency diesel generators through reliance on PV and battery, retail bill savings, and demand response and wholesale market revenue streams are all important. This paper provides a new statistical methodology that calculates the impact of distributed energy reliability and variability on a microgrid’s performance and a novel use of the optimization platform REopt to explore multiple cost savings and revenue streams. We examine the impacts for microgrids in California, Maryland, and New Mexico and show that a hybrid microgrid is a more resilient and cost-effective solution than a diesel-only system. Under realistic conditions, a hybrid microgrid can provide higher system reliability when islanded and have a lower life cycle cost under multiple market conditions than a traditional diesel generator-based system. The improved performance of the hybrid system is resilient to conditions experienced over the last 20 years in solar irradiance and sees little degradation in performance immediately after a hurricane. The cost savings to provide this more resilient backup power system as compared to a diesel-only microgrid are significant. The net present cost for a hybrid microgrid is 19% lower in New Mexico and 35% lower in Maryland than a diesel-only microgrid. In California, the net present cost of the hybrid microgrid is negative because, unlike a diesel-only microgrid, a hybrid microgrid has lower life cycle costs than the power costs without a microgrid.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

H.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; plasma physics; mathematics and computing","A fourth-order accurate continuum kinetic Vlasov solver and a systematic method for constructing customizable kinetic equilibria are demonstrated to be powerful tools for the study of nonuniform collisionless low-beta plasmas. The noise-free methodology is applied to investigate two gradient-driven instabilities in 4D (x,y,vx,vy) phase space: the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability and the lower hybrid drift instability. Nonuniform two-species configurations where ion gyroradii are comparable to gradient scale lengths are explored. The approach sheds light on the evolution of the pressure tensor in Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and demonstrates that the associated stress tensor deviates significantly from the gyroviscous stress tensor. Even at high magnetization, first-order approximations to finite-gyromotion physics are shown to be inadequate for the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, as shear scales evolve to become on par with gyromotion scales. The methodology facilitates exploring transport and energy partitioning properties associated with lower hybrid drift instabilities in low-beta plasma configurations. Distribution function features are captured in detail, including the formation of local extrema in the vicinity of particle-wave resonances. Finally, the approach enables detailed targeted investigations and advances kinetic simulation capability for plasmas in which gyromotion plays an important role.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The connected community is optimized using all zones as variables, while the individual buildings are optimized separately and then aggregated. These optimization problems are run for a range of individual zone flexibility values. The results indicate that a connected community offered 60.0% and 24.8% more peak demand savings for low and high flexibility scenarios, relative to individually optimized buildings.

"A systematic solution to quantify economic values of vehicle grid integration","Zhang, Haifeng; Tian, Ming; Zhang, Cong; Wang, Bin; Wang, Dai","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; vehicle-grid-integration; electric vehicle; simulation platform; real-time allocation","We report Vehicle-Grid-Integration (VGI) supplies one of the potential benefit extensions for electric vehicles (EVs) to make use of their parking time, which enables the EVs to provide grid services while still meeting consumer driving needs. However, the costs, benefits and risks of VGI still remain unclear, which limits the development of the VGI to promote the interaction between the EV and grid. In this study, we propose an integrated framework to quantify and utilize the aggregate flexibility of the EVs to supply the grid services in electricity markets. The integrated solution includes five sub-modules that cover end-to-end functionalities from individual EV energy consumption estimation to final monetary values calculation of providing grid services. Both wholesale market and local level charging management are formulated in the optimization module. A predictive control algorithm is proposed to allocate power to individual vehicles in real time, considering uncertainties from dispatch signal and travel behavior. Simulation results from 10,000 EVs indicate that the proposed optimization methods can significantly reduce the system cost in both wholesale market and retail market. Local tariff optimization reduces the electricity cost by 24.4% compared to uncontrolled charging. Wholesale market optimization results show that $\$$691 and $\$$255 revenues can be captured by each EV in ERCOT and CAISO markets per year, although with a conservative assumption on battery throughput cost at 0.16$\$$/kWh.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Specific objectives included (1) identifying and assessing significant non-economic barriers that complicate the ability of LMI households to adopt and benefit from solar, even under scenarios with low economic barriers; (2) assessing the differential ability of groups to benefit from solar adoption based on their ability to invest in different solar innovations; (3) explaining why some LMI communities nonetheless experience significantly higher rates of solar adoption and benefit than others; (4) developing a methodological model for generating data addressing key issues to the project; and (5) designing and developing an interactive web portal that aggregates existing datasets, provides researchers trend analysis capabilities, standardizes project protocols for other states and communities; provides the opportunities for researchers using the same protocol in other communities to upload their results; and engages with the general public by providing them the ability to upload their own perspectives and stories of solar technology adoption. Through a common framework for conducting semi-structured field interviews. In partnership with cooperative extension services, in conjunction with survey research and the aggregation of existing solar adoption datasets, this study has identified that currently ,there is a strong values alignment and knowledge access challenge that continues to affect solar adoption. Participants in this study – many of whom are either low or moderate-income and/or live in underserved rural communities do not believe solar is an option where they live or believe solar is appropriate for their lifestyle. This perception challenge is further exacerbated by the absolute dearth of adopters in most communities and a total lack of local marketing for solar energy. What marketing that does exist is geared towards audiences other than those in the participant's community, reinforcing a perception that 22% of survey respondents (n = 1,551) have: that solar energy is not meant for them and their community. Overcoming these serious human challenges pertaining to knowledge and marketing are critical to reducing the customer acquisition costs incurred amongst LMI communities and especially those in rural America where the opportunities solar provides to increase local energy resilience, security, all while engaging in personal stewardship of the planet could align with local values. Community-Based Social Marketing, built in partnership with community leaders and geared towards meeting local visions of ideal life, is a near term opportunity to bridge the gap between local priorities and national market and policy imperatives for solar while moving towards the administration's goals for renewable energy as part of a just and equitable decarbonization program. The tools and methods developed for this study can serve as a template for identifying other specific local challenges for solar adoption in other state, and provide the opportunity for a common data framework for understanding system-wide trends and barriers to achieving uptake of residential solar in communities that may, ultimately, benefit the most from the technology.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

First, we cluster all 73,057 census tracts, using factor analysis and the CLARA clustering algorithm into “microtypes” based on their street network and economic characteristics. Then we cluster regions (core-basic statistical areas and counties) into “geotypes” using PAM clustering according to their commute configurations, polycentricity and density. The resulting set captures both local and regional variation. These microtypes and geotypes are comparable across all locations, enabling a national level perspective, while maintaining sufficient heterogeneity to support a variety of transportation analyses capturing critical geographic variation.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Predicting city-scale daily electricity consumption using data-driven models","Wang, Zhe (ORCID:0000000222311606); Hong, Tianzhen; Li, Han (ORCID:0000000346389907); Ann Piette, Mary","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; City-scale electricity usage; Decomposed time-series modeling; Gradient boosting trees; Temperature-sensitive energy demand; Machine learning prediction","Accurate electricity demand forecasts that account for impacts of extreme weather events are needed to inform electric grid operation and utility resource planning, as well as to enhance energy security and grid resilience. Three common data-driven models are used to predict city-scale daily electricity usage: linear regression models, machine learning models for time series data, and machine learning models for tabular data. In this study, we developed and compared seven data-driven models: (1) five-parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network). Seven models are applied to the city-scale electricity usage data for three metropolitan areas in the United States: Sacramento, Los Angeles, and New York. Results show seven models can predict the metropolitan area's daily electricity use, with a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) less than 10%. The lightGBM provides the most accurate results, with CVRMSE on the test dataset of 6.5% for Los Angeles, 4.6% for Sacramento, and 4.1% for the New York metropolitan area. These models are further applied to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) influence each city's electricity demand. Results show weather-sensitive component accounts for 30%–50% of the total daily electricity usage. Every degree Celsius ambient temperature increase in summer leads to about 5% (4.7% in Los Angeles, 6.2% in Sacramento, and 5.1% in New York) more daily electricity usage compared with the base load in the three metropolitan areas. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced city-scale electricity demand: compared with the pre-pandemic same months in 2019, daily electricity usage during the 2020 pandemic decreased by 10% in April and started to rebound in summer.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The effect of price-based demand response on carbon emissions in European electricity markets: The importance of adequate carbon prices","Fleschutz, Markus; Bohlayer, Markus; Braun, Marco; Henze, Gregor; Murphy, Michael D.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; price-based demand response; time-dependent carbon emission factor; marginal emission; merit order; European electricity market; carbon price","Price-based demand response (PBDR) has recently been attributed great economic but also environmental potential. However, the determination of its short-term effects on carbon emissions requires the knowledge of marginal emission factors (MEFs), which compared to grid mix emission factors (XEFs), are cumbersome to calculate due to the complex characteristics of national electricity markets. This study, therefore, proposes two merit order-based methods to approximate hourly MEFs and applies them to readily available datasets from 20 European countries for the years 2017–2019. Based on the calculated electricity prices, standardized daily load shifts were simulated which indicated that carbon emissions increased for 8 of the 20 countries and by 2.1% on average. Thus, under specific circumstances, PBDR leads to carbon emissions increases, mainly due to the economic advantage fuel sources such as lignite and coal have in the merit order. MEF-based load shifts reduced the mean resulting carbon emissions by 35%, albeit with 56% lower monetary cost savings compared to price-based load shifts. Finally, by repeating the load shift simulations for different carbon price levels, the impact of the carbon price on the resulting carbon emissions was analyzed. The Spearman correlation coefficient between carbon intensity and marginal cost along the German merit order substantially increased with increasing carbon price. The coefficients were -0.13 for the 2019 carbon price of 24.9 €/t, 0 for 42.6 €/t, and 0.4 for 100.0 €/t. Therefore, with adequate carbon prices, PBDR can be an effective tool for both economical and environmental improvement.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Techno-economic Assessments (TEAs) have been conducted to evaluate innovative approaches to recover REEs from waste streams. However, most TEA studies do not consider the price volatility of REEs, which raises concern over the reliability of the analysis in an unpredictable dynamic market. To address this shortcoming, a dynamic price model is proposed that adjusts REE price based upon supply-demand conditions. The dynamic market behavior is simulated and its effect on a TEA is examined via a case study. The results of the dynamic simulation indicate a growing trend of the market price for REE materials/products. Compared to a conventional TEA that does not consider price dynamics, a significant difference in economic performance metrics is identified from the dynamic TEA results. Finally, the proposed dynamic TEA method is not limited to a specific application and can provide insights for evaluating a broad range of technologies.","Elsevier","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Despite the increasing interest in FPV systems, a robust validation of their suggested co-benefits and impacts on the nexus of energy, water, and food (EWF) systems is lacking. This information gap makes it challenging for decision makers to justify its adoption—potentially suppressing FPV deployment. To address this gap and to help de-risk this PV deployment opportunity, we (1) review the suggested co-benefits of FPV systems with a focus on the impacts that could alleviate pressures on EWF systems and (2) identify areas where further research is needed to reduce uncertainty around FPV system performance. Our review reveals that EWF nexus-relevant co-benefits, such as improved panel efficiency and reduced land usage, are corroborated in the literature, whereas others, such as water quality impacts, lack empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that further research is needed to quantify the water-related and broader economic, environmental, social, sustainability, justice, and resilience co-benefits and impacts of FPV systems.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We provide dramatic evidence of a default effect on program participation, consistent with previous research. A novel feature of our study is that we also observe how the default manipulation impacts customers’ subsequent electricity consumption. Passive consumers who did not opt-out but would not have opted in-comprising more than 70$\%$ of the sample-nonetheless reduce consumption in response to higher prices. Observing of this follow-on behaviour enables us to assess competing explanations for the default effect. We draw conclusions about the likely welfare effects of defaulting customers onto time-varying pricing.","Oxford University Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

As a test case, this study develops the electric demand profile and investigates the technical and environmental feasibility of a hybrid renewable energy system for the New Town community on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation (FBIR) in North Dakota. This study conducts the hybrid renewable energy system’s analysis by developing scripts in the LK scripting language and integrating System Advisor Model software’s open-source modules for modeling of renewable energy systems.

Processing of landfilled coal fly ash, GBF slag and supplementary raw materials into a geopolymer binder was accomplished by a simple, scalable milling process in the absence of heating under a carbon dioxide environment. The resultant geopolymer cement binders were tested for carbon dioxide uptake, compressive strength, and heavy metal stabilization. The geopolymer binder demonstrated a desired balance of carbon dioxide uptake, strength and safety. These results also indicate that the performance of the geopolymer binder depends on the landfill disposal age of the coal fly ash.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Using the United States as an example, here we show that under a scenario consistent with a socioeconomic pathway 2 (SSP2) and representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5), mean temperature changes drive increases in annual electricity demands by 0.5-8% across states in 2100. But more importantly, peak temperature changes drive increases in capital investments by 3-22%. Moreover, temperature-induced capital investments are highly sensitive to both long-term socioeconomic assumptions and spatial heterogeneity of fuel prices and capital stock characteristics, which underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to inform long-term electric sector planning.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We use the concept of rank, which plays a crucial role in information theory where power laws are involved, and is a useful measure for seeking extremal principles. Borrowing from an analogy to Zipf’s law leads to a power-law relationship between abundance and rank that—pressing the Zipf’s law analogy further—may suggest that the price paid for elemental materials optimizes efficient utilization. Factors such as weight, volume, and moles in the earth's crust or in global mining production of elements are used in our analysis. For this research, 42 elements with price and production data for the year 2010 (a relatively typical year) were considered. We observe that the role of the volume from global mining production dominates in materials economics and indicate that elements such as Te and He should be sold at prices at leas ~ 100–1000 times more than their present price for efficient utilization.","Materials Research Society - Cambridge University Press","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Optimal scheduling for profit maximization of energy storage merchants considering market impact based on dynamic programming","Liu, Jian; Bo, Rui; Wang, Siyuan; Chen, Haotian","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Energy; Electricity storage and dispatch; Market impact; Power market; Dynamic programming","This paper analyzes how electricity merchants' market impact affects merchants' profit. Energy storage has long been studied for its role in maximizing profit, and merchant decisions are assumed to have no impact on market prices. However, the trading decisions of large-scale energy storage merchants (e.g., pumped storage hydro) will affect the market prices. This paper employs dynamic programming theory to investigate merchants' optimal economic dispatch considering the market impact and physical characteristics of storage systems. Our findings show that the State-of-Charge (SOC) based analytical solution significantly facilitates energy storage merchants' decision-making. The SOC range is segmented into three regions by two optimal SOC reference points, which depend on the available energy in storage, given prices, and market impact. By comparing the current storage SOC with the reference points, the merchant can get the corresponding optimal actions. We analytically show that if the merchant neglects the market impact on the power market, she will exaggerate her expected profit when the price-taker and price-maker merchants have the same generating and pumping upper limits offered to Independent System Operators (ISOs). Furthermore, the profit-maximizing merchant must, therefore, assay to balance the trade-off correctly between the intensity of market impact and the dispatched power. Our findings are verified by numerical simulation, and results demonstrate the ramifications for electricity merchants in energy arbitrage decisions.","Elsevier","","Missouri Univ. of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

To evaluate technologies that could enable such changes, it is imperative to compare the sustainability of bio-based and/or circular plastic flows to those of incumbent manufacturing paradigms. To that end, we estimate the supply chain energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with US-based plastics consumption. Major commodity polymers, each of which has a global consumption of at least 1 MMT per year, account for an estimated annual 3.2 quadrillion Btutus (quads) of energy and 104 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>e of GHG emissions in the US alone. This study serves as a foundation for comparing the supply chain energy requirements and GHG emissions of today’s plastics manufacturing to tomorrow’s disruptive technologies, to inform the development of bio-based plastics and the circular economy for synthetic polymers.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Herein, this study discusses an innovative energy solution for WWTPs in the United States, and one of the WWTPs with a flow capacity of 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD) was selected as a case study. An optimization tool, Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software, is used in this study to find the best energy system configuration to run the system. An energy audit for one WWTP was conducted in early 2020 and the report is used to do this study. The proposed EEOs were able to reduce WWTP energy consumption by about 11%. The excess anaerobic digester gas was utilized in a CHP system to cover about 42% of the facility’s consumption. Also, 3% of the utility energy consumption can be claimed by microturbines in the aeration tanks. Another two renewable energy systems, solar photovoltaic (PV) with 29% and water turbines with 15%, contribute to covering 100% of the WWTP energy consumption and achieving an NZE WWTP.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this paper, we evaluate the United States’ potential to supply Li from geothermal brines using Systems Dynamics modeling. The main goals are to assess (1) the viability of US Li supply from geothermal brines and (2) the potential supply chain impact of extracting Li from this source.

"Enhancing integrated analysis of national and global goal pursuit by endogenizing economic productivity","Hughes, Barry B.; Narayan, Kanishka","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Analysis with integrated assessment models (IAMs) and multisector dynamics models (MSDs) of global and national challenges and opportunities, including pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), requires projections of economic growth. In turn, the pursuit of multiple interacting goals affects economic productivity and growth, generating complex feedback loops among actions and objectives. Yet, most analysis uses either exogenous projections of productivity and growth or specifications endogenously enriched with a very small set of drivers. Extending endogenous treatment of productivity to represent two-way interactions with a significant set of goal-related variables can considerably enhance analysis. Among such variables incorporated in this project are aspects of human development (e.g., education, health, poverty reduction), socio-political change (e.g., governance capacity and quality), and infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation and modern energy access), all in conditional interaction with underlying technological advance and economic convergence among countries. Using extensive datasets across countries and time, this project broadly endogenizes total factor productivity (TFP) within a large-scale, multi-issue IAM, the International Futures (IFs) model system. We demonstrate the utility of the resultant open system via comparison of new TFP projections with those produced for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, via integrated analysis of economic growth potential, and via multi-scenario analysis of progress toward the SDGs. We find that the integrated system can reproduce existing SSP projections, help anticipate differential economic progress across countries, and facilitate extended, integrated analysis of trade-offs and synergies in pursuit of the SDGs.","Public Library of Science","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The behavior of the DERs in the distribution electricity market may ultimately impact the market-clearing and locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the wholesale market. This paper proposes a bi-level optimization model for distribution market clearing and distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) considering the interactions between distribution and transmission wholesale markets. In the proposed model, the upper-level model represents the distribution system operator (DSO) market-clearing and the lower-level model represents the wholesale market-clearing by the independent system operator (ISO). The LMP at the substation will impact the DER dispatch and power demands of the DSO as well as the DLMP. In turn, the power demands of the DSO will further impact the ISO market and its LMPs. The equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) approach is applied to find the equilibria of multiple DSOs and the ISO. The EPEC problem is transformed into a single-level mixed-integer convex problem in order to allow for efficient solving. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method are demonstrated through case studies.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The accurate predictivity and fast computational speed enable a large volume of time-consuming engineering processes such as history-matching and field development optimization. The Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP) project desires rigorous history-matching and multi-objective optimization processes, which fits the superiorities of the machine-learning approaches. Although the machine-learning proxy models are trained and validated before imposing to solve practical problems, the error margin would essentially introduce uncertainties to the results. In this paper, a hybrid numerical machine-learning workflow solving various optimization problems is presented. By coupling the expert machine-learning proxies with a global optimizer, the workflow successfully solves the history-matching and CO<sub>2</sub> water alternative gas (WAG) design problem with low computational overheads. The history-matching work considers the heterogeneities of multiphase relative characteristics, and the CO<sub>2</sub>-WAG injection design takes multiple techno-economic objective functions into accounts. This work trained an expert response surface, a support vector machine, and a multi-layer neural network as proxy models to effectively learn the high-dimensional nonlinear data structure.

To mitigate these environmental impacts, we develop an optimization framework for the design of a sustainable ammonia-based agricultural system that synergistically integrates the production of ammonia from renewable resources and effective measures for nitrogen management. The proposed model captures the effect of intermittency by incorporating both design and detailed operational decisions.

We compile localized regulatory information and use high-resolution data to present multiple siting regimes covering relatively constrained to unconstrained potentials. Our efforts reveal high sensitivity to these variables and sizable uncertainty in the overall wind energy resource potential. Specifically, we find that siting constraints may shift the total capacity available to commercial wind energy by 2.3–15.1 TW. Furthermore, our results illustrate that technology advancement could require larger setbacks from buildings and infrastructure, reducing the total available capacity potential by 20% relative to estimates using current technology, but that this reduction is largely offset by increased generation such that the net effect on generation is 1%.

"Estimating the Rebound Effect of the U.S. Road Freight Transport","Patwary, A. Latif; Yu, T. Edward; English, Burton C.; Hughes, David W.; Cho, Seong-Hoon","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","The United States (U.S.) road freight sector has continued to grow over recent decades. Growth in road freight could result in more fuel consumption and hence increased greenhouse gas emissions. Policymakers have attempted to manage the growth of energy usage through improved fuel economy based on technological advances. However, such improvements may not lead to anticipated goals because of the rebound effect, where improvements in energy efficiency trigger more travel and energy consumption that offsets energy savings. Thus, this study aims to determine the potential rebound effect from improved energy efficiency in the U.S. road freight sector. Eight fuel cost models are applied and asymmetric price response is incorporated in estimating the U.S. road freight sector’s rebound effect from 1980 to 2016. In addition, a recently developed data envelopment analysis is applied to determine the annual rebound effect in the road freight sector. The results suggest that, after accounting for the asymmetric price response, the average rebound effect of the U.S. road freight sector ranges from 6.9% to 8.8%, a level considerably less than that found for several industrialized countries and emerging economies. However, a considerable increase in the rebound effect has been seen in more recent years. Here, the findings suggest that overlooking the rebound effect in environmental policies could impede the goal of reducing total energy consumption and accompanying emissions.

It is unexpected that Na+ electrochemistry outperforms Li+ and K+ at high current densities. Here, in situ transmission electron microscopy is used to uncover nanoscale transformations during lithiation, sodiation, and potassiation, which follows two-step conversion and alloying reactions with Li+ and Na+, and three-step intercalation-conversion-alloying reactions with K+. Counterintuitively, sodiation exhibits the highest reaction kinetics, and its origin can be elucidated by first-principles and finite-element simulations in two aspects. The lower interfacial strain accommodation energy between Bi2Te3 and its Na-conversion products allows more facile sodiation phase transformation than Li- and K-ion reactions. The higher chemo-mechanical stress concentration at the concave-shaped sodiation reaction front facilitates continued Na-ion diffusion and reaction propagation.

This generation’s overarching goal is to develop heating concepts for smart energy systems contributing to the net-zero carbon emission society by substituting older district heating generations, originally developed for fossil fuels. The evolving technology generation has to consider the future challenges of lower heat demands, increased cooling demands, and integration of renewable and recycled thermal sources. Driven by these challenges, the district heating and cooling community is fast growing and very dynamic in its innovation. This trend can be observed in the development of cold networks for both heating and cooling. Several new systems in Europe, North America, and Asia have applied newly developed heating and cooling network configurations. It is essential to consolidate these novel technical solutions into the entire family of fourth generation at this stage of development to efficiently and effectively deploy and expand district heating and cooling solutions.

Generating hydrogen by electrolysis using renewable energy is one way to support a decarbonized economy; however, its cost is not typically competitive with the carbon-emitting incumbent technology, steam methane reforming. The ability of electrolysis to integrate with electricity markets presents a unique cost reduction opportunity due to the perceived future availability of low and zero-marginal cost renewable energy sources. Additionally, as renewables, and particularly, photovoltaics are installed on the grid, they have a value deflation effect. This work evaluates solar-electrolysis configurations using a mathematical programming framework to maximize system net present value. The framework has been tested with specific weather conditions and financial mechanisms in California. Our findings indicate that a spectrum of potential cost competitive solutions is available for systems that (i) have market configurations resembling hybrid retail/wholesale, resulting in a hydrogen production cost range of US$6.2 kg-1–US$6.6 kg-1, or full wholesale market participation, reducing production cost to US$2.6 kg-1–US$3.1 kg-1, and (ii) achieve projected future cost reductions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study applies an integrative approach that combines spatially-explicit resource potential analysis with high spatial resolution U.S. electricity system modeling. Multiple wind supply curves, representing variations in siting regimes that account for interactions with built infrastructure, regulatory, physical, and social land use factors, are evaluated to determine how siting could influence prospective wind development. Different siting regimes lead to variations in future wind capacity, with the greatest impacts observed under scenarios with high demand for clean energy. With the tightest emissions limit modeled, 2050 onshore wind capacity varied by +7% (49 GW) in the least-restrictive siting regime to a decrease of 37% (270 GW) under the most-constrained case. More-stringent siting restrictions lead to higher electricity prices and emissions that should be weighed with local impacts. Under restrictive siting regimes, wind deployment is also sensitive to transmission availability and wind plant design. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of local land use considerations in regional and national power system planning.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As the number of controllable devices rapidly expands, grid operators must determine how to incorporate these assets while delivering reliable, equitable, and affordable electricity. One possible approach is to establish distribution-level electricity markets and allow devices/aggregations of devices to participate in price establishment. While this approach purports some of the same benefits as the highly successful wholesale electricity markets (i.e., open competition, efficient price discovery, reduced communication overhead), this needs to be researched and quantified via an analysis platform that models distribution-level markets at the appropriate fidelity. Specifically, the simultaneous evaluation of market performance, DER performance, DER bidding approaches, and distribution feeder power quality requires modeling that spans multiple technical areas. Co-simulation has emerged as a powerful tool in addressing this type of problem, where outputs depend on a range of underlying areas of expertise and associated models. In this paper we describe a solution, as implemented in the HELICS co-simulation platform, where we include (1) high fidelity house models, (2) intelligent bidding agents, (3) a modular market integration/design, and (4) a distribution feeder model. We then present a case study where we test two different market designs: (1) a pseudo-wholesale double-blind auction, and (2) an asynchronous matching market. In this work, the markets are run under two DER penetration levels and economic results are compared to full retail net energy metering and avoided cost net metering scenarios that bookend current approaches to remuneration of DER participation. We show the potential for transactive markets to provide increased value for most customers relative to net metering (and all customers relative to avoided cost scenarios) while decreasing costs for the utility.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Quantitative computational models are necessary when analyzing energy, and more specifically electricity, systems, as they are technologically-complex systems that can diverge from intuitive patterns. To assure energy justice, these models must be reflective of, and informative to, a wide range of stakeholders, including households and communities alongside utilities, governments, and others. Yet, moving from a qualitative understanding of preferences to quantitative modeling is challenging. In this perspective piece, we pilot the use of the value-focused thinking framework to inform stakeholder engagement. The result is a strategic objective hierarchy that highlights the tradeoffs and the social, economic and technological factors that need to be measured in models. We apply the process in Ghana, using a survey, stakeholder workshops, and follow-up interviews to uncover key tradeoffs and stakeholder-derived objectives. We discuss three key areas that have been rarely, if ever, well-represented in energy models: (1) the relationship between the dynamics of electricity end-use and the technology and economic structure of the system; (2) explicit tradeoffs between electricity access, cost, and reliability as defined by stakeholders; and (3) the definition of new objectives, such as minimizing hazards related to theft. We conclude that this model of engagement provides an opportunity to tie together rigorous qualitative analysis and stakeholder engagement with crucial quantitative models of the electricity system.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Indeed, these models rely on retrospective analyses that provide insights into shifting human population demands and adaptions to water shortages. However, accurate, methodologically consistent, empirically authentic, and spatiotemporally comprehensive historical datasets for water withdrawals are scarce. Herein, we present a reanalysis of annual resolution (1950–2016) historical data set on irrigation, electric power, and public supply water withdrawal within the conterminous United States (US) at the county-level, and, for power plants, at the site-level. To estimate electric power water use, we synthesized a historically comprehensive list of generators and historic patterns in generation across fuels, prime movers, and cooling technologies. Irrigation water use estimation required building a crop-demand model that utilized historical information on irrigated acreage for crops and golf courses, stage-specific crop water demand, and climate information. To estimate public water supply use, we developed a random forest model constructed from information on population, infrastructure, climate, and land cover. These estimates generally agree with total county and state water use information provided by the US Geological Survey (USGS) water use circular and estimates generated from independent studies for specific years. However, we also observed discrepancies between our estimates and USGS data that appear to be caused by inconsistencies in the methods used by the USGS's primary data sources at the state level over decades of data collection, highlighting the importance of reanalysis to yield spatiotemporally consistent and intercomparable estimates of water use.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Using the integrated assessment model GCAM, we develop an endogenous representation of hydropower for Canada that accounts for market dynamics, thus permitting analysis of the competition of hydropower with other electricity generation technologies, both with and without cost overruns. Results show that modelling hydropower resources endogenously increases further deployment of hydropower relative to an assumption of fixed hydropower production, from 417 to 495 TWh of annual generation in Canada by 2050. In model scenarios that apply cost overruns historically observed amongst electricity generation projects, hydropower loses market share to more easily scalable technologies like wind power. When including high cost overrun assumptions, the model determines that, by 2050, hydropower falls from about 73% of Canadian electricity generation to 65%, while wind power increases from about 8% to 11%. Countries may be better able to achieve electrification and renewable energy targets at lower cost by avoiding large-scale hydropower and nuclear generation projects due to high cost overruns. Model results support that cost overruns are important considerations for policy decisions related to electricity sector development in Canada and elsewhere.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper examines the greenhouse gas and welfare implications of this repeal while incorporating the presence of the state renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in the US as the status quo. We assess the carbon abatement and welfare costs with the CPP relative to two alternative baselines: a no–policy baseline and a pre–existing policy baseline with the RPS. The CPP is implemented as a regional mass–based standard, a regional rate–based standard, or as a national mass–based standard with trading of emissions across regions over the 2022–2030 period. We find that the incremental discounted welfare costs per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> that would have been abated by the CPP relative to the RPS would be substantially lower than the global social cost of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, the overall costs of carbon abatement with the CPP added to the RPS would have become higher than the social cost of carbon when estimated relative to a no–policy baseline, except with a national mass–based CPP. Across all policy combinations and choice of baselines, the aggregate welfare costs were lowest under a national mass–based standard and highest under the regional rate–based standard. Here, we also find that the CPP would have imposed large welfare costs on consumers and fossil fuel producers while benefiting the renewable fuel producers.","","","Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2021-01-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Agricultural Economics; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 33-51","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-9092","10.1111/ajae.12189","","2022-03-28T00:00:00Z","1764018","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1764018","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1764018","American Journal of Agricultural Economics","1","104"

Because the SMM faces the high cost pressure of adopting carbon emission reduction (CER) technologies, the retailer may take an altruistic preference for the long-term sustainability of the chain. Three decision-making models, centralized, decentralized without altruistic preference, and decentralized with altruistic preference, are constructed to compare decisions and profits of both parties. Since neither decentrailized models can lead to a coordinated solution that is incentive compitable, a coordination contract, referred to as the cost sharing contract with altruistic preference, is proposed. Numerical study shows that the altruistic preference can help increase the SMM's profit and system efficiency but decrease the retailer's profit. The coordination contract requires the retailer to adjust the unit profit and share more than half of the CER cost. Finally, it is found that the wholesale price is the lowest in the coordination contract and the comparison of unit profit depends on the coefficient of CER cost.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

When considering energy sources independently and competitively, value-added synergies among energy technologies may be overlooked for meeting demanding, multidimensional requirements. This paper presents novel concepts for tightly coupled hybrid energy systems that leverage capabilities of diverse energy generators, including renewable, nuclear, and fossil with carbon capture, to provide power, heat, mobility, and other energy services. Further, this paper presents a framework for engineering-based modeling and analysis for complex optimization of energy generation, transmission, services, processes and products, and market interactions. New modeling capabilities are needed to adequately represent multi-input, multi-output tightly coupled hybrid energy systems that utilize multiple feedstocks to create multiple products and services in novel and synergistic ways through increased coordination of energy systems and tightly coupled hybrid system configurations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Time Series Sustainability Assessment of a Partial Energy Portfolio Transition","Hale, Jacob; Long, Suzanna (ORCID:0000000165895528)","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; energy & fuels; time series forecast; life cycle thinking; energy transition; sustainability","<p>Energy portfolios are overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuel resources that perpetuate the consequences associated with climate change. Therefore, it is imperative to transition to more renewable alternatives to limit further harm to the environment. This study presents a univariate time series prediction model that evaluates sustainability outcomes of partial energy transitions. Future electricity generation at the state-level is predicted using exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The best prediction results are then used as an input for a sustainability assessment of a proposed transition by calculating carbon, water, land, and cost footprints. Missouri, USA was selected as a model testbed due to its dependence on coal. Of the time series methods, ARIMA exhibited the best performance and was used to predict annual electricity generation over a 10-year period. The proposed transition consisted of a one-percent annual decrease of coal’s portfolio share to be replaced with an equal share of solar and wind supply. The sustainability outcomes of the transition demonstrate decreases in carbon and water footprints but increases in land and cost footprints. Decision makers can use the results presented here to better inform strategic provisioning of critical resources in the context of proposed energy transitions.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","Switzerland","2020-12-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel) Journal Volume: 14 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 141","","","DOE Project DE-EE0006341; EE0006341","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en14010141","10.3390/en14010141","","2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","1752983","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1752983","","Energies (Basel)","1","14"

A planetary gear set and a brake permit the power split supercharger (PSS) to share a 9 kW motor between supercharging the engine and direct torque supply to the crankshaft. In contrast, most e-boosting schemes use two separate motors for these two functionalities. This single motor structure restricts the PSS operation to only one of the supercharging or parallel hybrid modes; therefore, an optimized decision making strategy is necessary to select both the device mode and its power split ratio. An adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), which uses the battery state of charge (SoC) history to adjust the equivalence factor, is developed for energy management of the PSS. The A-ECMS effectiveness is compared against a dynamic programming (DP) solution with full drive cycle preview through hardware-in-the-loop experiments on an engine dynamometer testbed. The experiments show that the PSS with A-ECMS reduces vehicle fuel consumption by 18.4% over standard FTP75 cycle, compared to a baseline turbocharged engine, while global optimal DP solution decreases the fuel consumption by 22.8% compared to the baseline.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","Switzerland","2020-12-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel) Journal Volume: 13 Journal Issue: 24","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 6580","","","AR0000659","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en13246580","10.3390/en13246580","","2020-12-17T00:00:00Z","1735759","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1735759","","Energies (Basel)","24","13"

However, the air quality co-benefits of differentiated policies remain unclear. Here we combine a multi-regional dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and an extend response surface model (ERSM) to investigate the impact of nationally uniform and subnationally differentiated carbon pricing policies on fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations in China. All policies examined lead to the same accumulated national CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (2020–2050), with the 2030 emissions attaining China&#x27;s national abatement target. We find that, when subnational policies differentiated according to provincial PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are implemented, the higher-than-average carbon price over more polluted provinces results in twice as much reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> and air pollutant emissions in 2050 as the national policy. As a result, the subnational policies cause larger PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration reductions in these provinces (9%–18%) than the national policy (7%–11%). Also, the subnational policies eliminate high PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure of over 45 μg/m<sup>3</sup> which 12% people suffer from under the national policy. Overall, the subnational policies substantially reduce regional disparity in PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution and hence improve environmental equity. The results suggest that subnationally differentiated carbon policies are a promising instrument to mitigate severe pollution and promote environmental equity.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The zero-emissions cost of energy: a policy concept","Beal, Colin M.; King, Carey W.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; climate change; energy economics; greenhouse gas emissions; energy spending; carbon tax; negative emissions","The energy sector generates over 70% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but existing energy-climate policies do little to reduce GHG emissions to prevent climate change. We present a new carbon tax policy concept in which energy users would be taxed an amount equal to the cost of cleaning up the emissions that they create, wherein the tax revenues would be used to operate negative emissions technologies. The policy is based on applying the zero-emissions cost (ZEC) metric to energy prices, which includes the 'regular' cost of an energy source plus the cost of sequestering its emissions. Using the ZEC, (a) the energy sector would be emissions-neutral, (b) biofuels would be cheaper than petroleum fuels, and (c) renewable electricity would be cheaper than fossil-fuel electricity. We calculate the energy spending as a fraction of gross domestic product for 'regular' and ZEC cost scenarios. Implementing the ZEC carbon-tax policy would enable a monumental shift to a net-zero emissions energy sector, but carries a significant risk of causing an economic recession. The summary point of this commentary is to demonstrate a pathway to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from the US energy sector, and to contemplate the associated economic impacts on our society.","IOP Publishing","","B&D Engineering and Consulting LLC, Lander, WY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-04-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Progress in Energy; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 023001","","","EE0007091","Journal ID: ISSN 2516-1083","10.1088/2516-1083/abef1f","","2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","1897626","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1897626","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1897626","Progress in Energy","2","3"

These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Lastly, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 8","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-37","AR0000666; CNS-1647015; CNS-1818901; CNS-1840052","Journal ID: ISSN 2378-962X","10.1145/3403711","","2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","1768837","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1768837","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1768837","ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems","1","5"

Here, this paper analyzes the key stakeholder interactions utilizing various data sources including survey results, social media posts, and empirical and theoretical analyses. An intensive review is conducted for a number of surveys and research papers on different aspects of biofuel development such as land use choices, biorefinery and transportation, infrastructure development, consumer priorities, environmental impacts, etc. Following that, a stakeholder synergy approach is applied to synthesizing typical responses of stakeholders, such as producers, consumers, biorefineries, rural communities, and the government, and discussing how their responses influence each other's decisions and the overall system performance. Based on the findings of inadequate stakeholder synergy, it is recommended that new surveys and further research should be conducted to understand why synergy between stakeholders in biofuel development is absent. Additionally, this paper provides research perspectives, including (1) applying cutting-edge text-mining techniques to conduct sentiment analysis, and research and public attention analysis; (2) using an agent-based model to simulate stakeholder interactions and understand the factors that influence stakeholder synergy and the emergence of a bioeconomy.","Elsevier","","Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews; Journal Volume: 137","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 110613","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 1364-0321","10.1016/j.rser.2020.110613","","2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","1728608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1728608","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1728608","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","","137"

"Characteristics of locational uncertainty marginal price for correlated uncertainties of variable renewable generation and demands","Fang, Xin; Cui, Hantao; Du, Ershun; Li, Fangxing; Kang, Chongqing","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; locational marginal price; uncertainty pricing; cost recovery; revenue adequacy; market equilibrium","With the rapid increase of variable renewable energy sources in power systems, how to manage and price the uncertainty of renewable resources’ power outputs is becoming an urgent issue. Current market designs considering the uncertainties are mainly based on the probabilistic scenario set of demand and renewable energy resources power outputs. This consideration makes market designs vulnerable to three significant challenges when put into practice. First, the accurate probability distribution of renewable generation is hard to obtain in real-time. Second, it is challenging to clear the market timely with many scenarios to guarantee accuracy. Third, generation cost recovery cannot be guaranteed for some scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a locational uncertainty marginal price model to price the uncertainty explicitly based on a scenario-free stochastic market-clearing model. Instead of using the probabilistic scenario set, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and loads is modeled with distributionally-robust chance constraints. The correlation of uncertainties can be endogenously modeled in both the market-clearing and the locational uncertainty marginal price formation. Furthermore, this paper proves that generation cost recovery, revenue adequacy, and partial market equilibrium can be achieved using the locational uncertainty marginal price model. Numerical results from both the small and large systems simulations validate that the generation cost recovery is maintained no matter the generation participates in uncertainty mitigation or not. The transmission congestion surplus is also allocated appropriately among loads, renewable energy sources, and financial transmission right owners.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The prospective impacts of 2019 state energy policies on the U.S. electricity system","Mai, Trieu; Cole, Wesley; Gates, Nathaniel; Greer, Daniel","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; clean energy; renewable energy; state policy; renewable portfolio standard; clean energy standard","Over the past several years state energy policies have been evolving rapidly, and are more frequently including higher targets, including 100% clean energy targets. This study assesses the aggregate impacts of state clean energy standards and emissions policies on national electricity generation, power sector carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, and electricity prices and system costs. To do so, we apply the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model, which is a detailed electric sector capacity expansion model, to evaluate scenarios with and without state policies and using a range of renewable energy technology cost projections. Across the scenarios analyzed, we find that the state policies drive 1.9%–10.7% of total nationwide clean energy and reduce cumulative power sector CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.6%–5.4% over the 2020–2050 study period. This incremental generation is predominantly, but not exclusively, from renewable energy technologies. In most cases, the state policies result in increases to electricity prices and electricity system costs, and policy costs are sensitive to the future cost of clean energy technologies. Across all scenarios, the levelized cost of incremental policy-driven clean energy generation is estimated to be $17–38/MWh and the average cost of CO<sub>2</sub> abatement from the state-level policies is estimated to be $29–74/metric ton.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The impact of policies and business models on income equity in rooftop solar adoption","O’Shaughnessy, Eric; Barbose, Galen; Wiser, Ryan; Forrester, Sydney; Darghouth, Naïm","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Economics; energy and society; energy policy; environmental social science","Low- and moderate-income (LMI) households are less likely to adopt rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) than higher-income households in the United States. As the existing literature has shown, this dynamic can decelerate rooftop PV deployment and has potential energy justice implications, in light of the cost-shifting between PV and non-PV households that can occur under typical rate structures and incentive programmes. Here we show that some state policy interventions and business models have expanded PV adoption among LMI households. Additionally, we find evidence that LMI-specific financial incentives, PV leasing and property-assessed financing have increased the diffusion of PV adoption among LMI households in existing markets and have driven more installations into previously underserved low-income communities. By shifting deployment patterns, we posit that these interventions could catalyse peer effects to increase PV adoption in low-income communities even among households that do not directly benefit from the interventions.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Demand charge savings from solar PV and energy storage","Darghouth, Naïm R.; Barbose, Galen; Zuboy, Jarett; Gagnon, Pieter J.; Mills, Andrew D.; Bird, Lori","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; demand charges; photovoltaics; retail rate design","With an increasing number of jurisdictions considering alternatives to net metering policies to financially compensate behind-the-meter solar photovoltaics (PV), customer economics will increasingly depend on its ability to reduce demand charges. Understanding these demand charge savings from PV—and how behind-the-meter storage can potentially enhance those savings—is essential to understand PV market dynamics and adoption in the coming years. This article explores how these demand charge savings vary with demand charge designs and customer load profiles, modeled for a variety of residential and commercial customers. Our findings indicate that demand charge savings are lowest under a basic, non-coincident demand charge design where the demand charge is based on the maximum demand level over the month, regardless of timing, resulting primarily from the temporal mismatch between the timing of the PV host's demand peak and PV generation. PV provides greater demand charge savings, for both commercial and residential customers, when demand charge designs are based on predefined, daytime peak periods or longer averaging intervals. Demand charge savings from PV combined with storage are almost always greater than the sum of the savings attained through either technology separately. We also explore how well demand charge savings from PV align with corresponding utility savings.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Safety evaluation of connected and automated vehicles in mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections","Arvin, Ramin; Khattak, Asad J.; Kamrani, Mohsen; Rio-Torres, Jackeline","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Adaptive cruise control; connected and automated vehicles; cooperative adaptive cruise control; driving volatility; intersection safety; mobility; simulation; time to collision","Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can potentially improve the performance of the transportation system by reducing human errors. This paper investigates the safety impact of CAVs in a mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections. Analyzing real-world AV crashes in California revealed that rear-end crashes at intersections are the dominant crash type. Therefore, to enhance our understanding of the future interactions between human-driven vehicles with CAVs at intersections, a simulation framework was developed to model the mixed traffic environment of Automated Vehicles (AV), cooperative AVs, and conventional human-driven vehicles. In order to model AVs driving behavior, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and cooperative ACC (CACC) models are utilized. Particularly, this study explores system improvements due to automation and connectivity across varying CAV market penetration scenarios. ACC and CACC car following models are used to mimic the behavior of AVs and cooperative AVs. Real-world connected vehicle data are utilized to modify and tune the acceleration/deceleration regimes of the Wiedemann model. Next, the driving volatility concept capturing variability in vehicle speeds was utilized to calibrate the simulation to represent the safety performance of a real-world environment. Two surrogate safety measures are used to evaluate the safety performance of a representative intersection under different market penetration rate of CAVs: the number of longitudinal conflicts and driving volatility. At low levels of ACC market penetration, the safety improvements were found to be marginal, but safety improved substantially with more than 40% ACC penetration. Additional safety improvements can be achieved more quickly through the addition of cooperation and connectivity through CACC. Furthermore, ACC/CACC vehicles were found to improve mobility performance in terms of average speed and travel time at intersections.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Earlier versions of the tax credit with lower credit values generated limited interest. This change to the tax code could potentially alter U.S. energy systems. Here, we examine the effect of the increased 45Q credits on CO<sub>2</sub> capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) deployment in the United States and on petroleum and power production. A range of potential outcomes is explored using five modeling tools. The paper goes on to explore the potential impact of possible modifications of the current tax credit including extension of its availability in time, the period over which 45Q tax credits can be utilized for any given asset and increases in the value of the credit as well as interactions with technology availability and carbon taxation. The paper concludes that 45Q tax credits could stimulate additional CCUS beyond that which is already underway.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper proposes a framework for the market-based coordination of electricity and natural gas system operations. The proposed framework includes a power system model that accounts for flexibility in the commitment of power plants with short start-up and shut-down times, coupled with a dynamic gas model that simulates when gas cannot be delivered to generators. The capabilities of the framework are illustrated using real-world electric power and gas systems, including scenarios around wind and solar penetrations and the analysis of time-variant, “shaped flow” gas nominations. Our results indicate that coordination between power and gas systems improves total gas delivery and reduces out-of-merit order dispatch in the electricity system, and that shaped flows may reduce unserved gas in systems with high penetrations of wind and solar. Coordination can have mixed effects on carbon-dioxide emissions, with emissions increasing with coordination for current systems during high load weeks but decreasing for systems with high renewable penetrations, particularly during periods of high variability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To better study the trading behavior and provide guidance for a viable local market design, different game-theoretical frameworks including cooperative and non-cooperative games are established and compared here. For the cooperative grand coalition, the maximum social welfare is guaranteed, the Shapley value and bargaining based approaches are implemented for further profit redistribution. It is shown that the asymmetrical bargaining power can be critical in the final payment clearing and it is equivalent to the Shapley value allocation if prosumers bargain based on their marginal contributions. Non-cooperative trading is formulated by using a Stackelberg bilevel model in which the upper level has the privilege in internal price setting. However, system optimum is not obtained due to competition, and the selfish leader could take away 89% of the collective benefit by price-gap based arbitraging. Aiming for a long-lasting trading market, a virtual benevolent leader and a uniform price structure in which purchase price equals selling price are tested. Experimental results indicate that maximum social welfare and a fairer profit allocation can be achieved with a uniform price structure, regardless of the selfish or benevolent attitude.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Two incentive-based DR methods and four price-based DR schemes — real time pricing (RTP), time-of-use (TOU) rates, critical peak prices (CPP), and variable peak prices (VPP) — are analyzed. Load reduction potential is evaluated for scenarios where the home has both onsite solar and storage, only solar, and no solar or storage. Results show that, from the utility’s perspective, the optimal load control schemes, which result in greatest reduction in peak load and energy consumption from the grid during peak hours, are CPP and VPP (critical price option). By considering the combined effect of demand response, solar generation, and energy storage systems, this study aims to equip electric utilities with the ability to make decisions about dynamic rate design and direct load control to curtail peak demand and shift energy usage.","","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Such supply and demand curves have value in that modelers can (i) use them to communicate SD simulation results in commonly-employed microeconomic terms, (ii) calculate important microeconomic metrics such as price elasticities of demand/supply, (iii) transfer them into other, non-SD models or simulations that require such curves as input, and (iv) better understand the interrelationships and latencies between supply and demand. The technique uses dummy prices or quantities as inputs that deviate from the actual prices or quantities in the SD model, and then the model computes the hypothetical quantities or prices, respectively, for consumption or production at the dummy price or quantity.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Overall, the primary objective is to inform future energy planning. The authors evaluated offshore wind, wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-based solar photovoltaics (PV), ocean current, and ocean thermal energy conversion. Of these energy resources, offshore wind was the most viable option and was the focus of the second part of the study. The technical challenges of developing offshore wind in the GOM are discussed including hurricane design for turbines and substructures, as well as turbine solutions to overcome lower wind regimes. In addition, advantages to offshore wind development in the GOM are described including proximity to oil and gas supply chains. Economic analysis using established cost models at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory identified hypothetical project locations where net value of offshore wind was the highest, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was calculated for three sites: Port Isabel, Port Arthur, and Pensacola.

"Learning to Count Grave Sites for Cemetery Observation Models With Satellite Imagery","Lunga, Dalton; Dhamdhere, Rohan; Walters, Sarah; Bragg, Lauryn; Makkar, Nikhil; Urban, Marie","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; classification algorithms; geospatial analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); semisupervised learning","Understanding how people occupy open spaces is important for research in support of population modeling, policy, national security, emergency response, and sustainability. For the past decade, there has been an increase in research toward capturing and reporting population dynamics and patterns of life at the building level and in some open public spaces such as cemeteries and parks. This is done through observation models developed from local sociocultural information acquired at various spatiotemporal scales to inform night, day, and episodic population occupancy estimates (people/1000 sq ft). Sociocultural information for cemeteries and parks is scarcely available and often collected manually. The process is not only marred by inconsistencies but is laborious and time consuming. In this study, we leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and satellite imagery to derive grave site counts as proxy variables to support scalable and accurate sociocultural data required in a population observation model. Through a hybrid workflow (weak localization plus regression model), we characterize a large scale automation process to counting of grave sites. We evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of proposed workflow using out-of-data set large satellite imagery and establish its broader impact on cemetery observation models.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Models that represent the energy use of the building stock at scale under various scenarios of technology deployment have become essential tools for the development and assessment of such strategies. Within the past decade, the capabilities of building stock energy models have improved considerably, while model transferability and sharing has increased. Given these advancements, a new scheme for classifying building stock energy models is needed to facilitate communication of modeling approaches and the handling of important model dimensions. In this article, we present a new building stock energy model classification framework that leverages international modeling expertise from the participants of the International Energy Agency's Annex 70 on Building Energy Epidemiology. Drawing from existing classification studies, here we propose a multi-layer quadrant scheme that classifies modeling techniques by their design (top-down or bottom-up) and degree of transparency (black-box or white-box); hybrid techniques are also addressed. The quadrant scheme is unique from previous classification approaches in its non-hierarchical organization, coverage of and ability to incorporate emerging modeling techniques, and treatment of additional modeling dimensions. The new classification framework will be complemented by a reporting protocol and online registry of existing models as part of ongoing work in Annex 70 to increase the interpretability and utility of building stock energy models for energy policy making.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This study mapped the spatial potentials of renewable resources (i.e., solar radiation, precipitation, wind, and geothermal resources) in China. The results showed that China's most abundant renewable resources are located in the southwestern regions, which are significantly different from the spatial distribution patterns of population and economic development. Four southwestern provinces (Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan) make up only 7% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) and 30% of the national land area but possess 58% of the renewable resources. Furthermore, we found a weak to moderate degree of negative correlation between the emergy density of renewable resources and GDP per capita on the administrative levels of the prefecture-level cities for the whole country and in its eastern, central, and western regions. This means that the socioeconomically underdeveloped Midwest has more abundant renewable resources. A distributed energy-economic system may help to bridge the regional gaps of renewable sources in China. These findings can support policy decisions for the better development and use of renewable resources in China.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We find load profile shape alone does not explain a site’s optimal configurations (i.e., PV, Storage, PV and Storage, No System). Still, load profile shape does introduce uncertainty to optimal PV and storage capacities. Across all cases where PV is part of an optimal configuration, we find the average ratio of power capacities derived from metered loads to capacities derived from CRB profiles to be 0.97 (and as high as 1463), where 1 would be a perfect match in system size. For storage, the ratio is 1.6 (and as high as 42). We also assess how, in the absence of complete metered data, a CRB profile can be selected that would be expected to yield the most similar solar PV and storage capacities. From those metrics that can be available from billing data (i.e., peak demand, monthly load totals), we find that uncertainty is most reduced by selecting the CRB’s with an annual peak occurring at the most similar time, or those with the lowest average root mean square error (RMSE) among monthly peak loads. This research can help improve the implementation and interpretation of results derived from simulated load profiles and is an important next step in advancing smart grid solutions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An adoption model that captures the economic rationality of tariff-driven investments and considers the stochastic nature of individual consumers’ decisions is proposed. This model is then combined with a probabilistic load flow to evaluate the long-term impacts of the adoption on the voltage profiles of the distribution grid. To illustrate the methodology, different components of the electricity tariffs, including solar compensation mechanisms and time differentiation of Time-of-Use (ToU) rates, are evaluated, using a case study involving a section of a medium-voltage network with 118 nodes.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Efforts to improve the integration of water and energy management and to understand their cross-sector relevance are growing. In particular, this paper develops a better empirical understanding on the extent to which governance settings hinder and/or enable policy coherence between the water and energy sectors through a comparative analysis of two case studies, namely, Los Angeles County, California, the United States, and the city of Beijing, China. This paper examines the extent to which the institutional context enables policy coordination within (vertically) and between (horizontally) the water and energy sectors in Beijing and Los Angeles. To do so, we propose a framework for analyzing policy integration for the water energy nexus based on environmental policy integration (EPI). The results highlight the multiple and flexible approaches of EPI in nexus governance, not least with regards to horizontal and vertical policy integration, but also in terms of explicit (i.e., intended) and implicit (i.e., unintended) coordination. The level of nexus-focused policy integration is highly dependent on the motivation at the local context and the criteria to evaluate policy success in each sector.</jats:p>","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Examining the Economic Optimality of Automatic Generation Control","Baros, Stefanos; Chen, Y. Christine; Dhople, Sairaj V.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; automatic generation control; economic dispatch; loss penalty factors; participation factors","The automatic generation control (AGC) system is temporally situated between economic dispatch and synchronous generator dynamics, and its primary role is to regulate frequency within and tie-line flows between control areas. Given appropriate choice of participation factors (feed-forward controller gains that govern the disaggregation of the area-level power requirement to individual generators), the AGC can be engineered to nudge system dynamics toward a steady-state operating point corresponding to economic optimality. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions under which a widely accepted choice of participation factors guarantees the alignment of steady-state synchronous generator outputs with a global minimum of a prototypical economic dispatch problem. In so doing, it resolves several ambiguities and formalizes technical assumptions governing the role of the standard AGC architecture in the context of economic dispatch and steady-state operation. Numerical case studies tailored to a modified version of the New England 39-bus 10-machine test system validate the theoretical results.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One potential pathway to resolving these perceived challenges involves allowing utilities to own and operate rooftop solar systems. However, the financial benefits and costs of this business model are not well understood. Here we model the financial performance of a large-scale utility-owned residential rooftop solar programme. Furthermore, over a 20 yr period, the programme increases shareholder earnings by 2–5% relative to a no-solar scenario, compared to a 2% earnings loss when an equivalent amount of rooftop solar is instead owned by non-utility parties. Such a programme could therefore be attractive from the perspective of utility investors. The impacts on utility customers, however, are more mixed, with average bills of non-solar customers increasing by 1–3% compared to the no-solar scenario, similar to the 2% increase under traditional, non-utility-ownership structures.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging battery electric bus system","He, Yi; Liu, Zhaocai; Song, Ziqi","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science; Transportation; Battery electric buses; Charging scheduling and management; Fast-charging; Demand charges; Time-of-use rate structure","Herein we discuss how battery electric buses (BEBs) are rapidly being embraced by public transit agencies because of their environmental and economic benefits. To address the problems of limited driving range and time-consuming charging for BEBs, manufacturers have developed rapid on-route charging technology that utilizes typical layovers at terminals to charge buses in operation using high power. With on-route fast-charging, BEBs are as capable as their diesel counterparts in terms of range and operating time. However, on-route fast-charging makes it more challenging to schedule and manage charging events for a BEB system. First, on-route fast-charging may lead to high electricity power demand charges. Second, it may increase electricity energy charges because of charging that occurs during on-peak hours. Without careful charging scheduling and management, on-route fast-charging may significantly increase fuel costs and reduce the economic attractiveness of BEBs. The present study proposes a network modeling framework to optimize the charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging BEB system, effectively minimizing total charging costs. The charging schedule determines when to charge a BEB, while the charging management strategically controls the actual charging power. Charging costs include both electricity demand charges and energy charges. The charging scheduling and management problem is first formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex program with time-continuous variables. A discretizing method and a linear reformulation technique are then adopted to reformulate the model as a linear program, which can be easily solved using off-the-shelf solvers, even for large-scale problems. Finally, the model is demonstrated with extensive numerical studies based on two real-world bus networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively determine the optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast-charging BEB system, which carries the potential for use in large-scale real-world bus networks.","Elsevier","","PacifiCorp, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 102056","","","EE0007997","Journal ID: ISSN 1366-5545; PII: S1366554520307079","10.1016/j.tre.2020.102056","","2022-07-26T00:00:00Z","1848663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848663","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848663","Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","C","142"

Two fuel properties that can enhance the efficiency of boosted spark ignition engines are research octane number and octane sensitivity. Biomass feedstocks can produce fuel blendstocks with these properties. Correspondingly, using a suite of models, we evaluated the change in energy and water consumption and greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions in the light duty fleet from 2025 to 2050 when bio-blendstocks isopropanol, a methylfuran mixture, and ethanol are blended at 31%, 14%, and 17%, respectively, with petroleum. These blended fuels increase engine efficiency by 10% when used with a co-optimized engine. In these scenarios, we estimated that petroleum consumption would decrease by between 5–9% in 2050 alone and likely by similar levels in future years as compared to a business as usual case defined by energy information administration projections. Overall, between 2025 and 2050, we determined that, when isopropanol is the bio-blendstock, GHG emissions, water consumption, and PM2.5 emission cumulative reductions could range from 4–7%, 3–4%, and 3%, respectively. Cumulative reductions would continue to increase beyond 2025 as the technology would gain an increasing foothold, indicating the importance of allowing time for technology penetration to achieve desired benefits. Annual jobs increased between 0.2 and 1.7 million in the case in which isopropanol was the bio-blendstock. Overall, this analysis provides a framework for evaluating the benefits of deploying co-optimized fuels and engines considering multiple energy, environmental, and economic factors.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

To address the issues of computation burdens and privacy in the centralized transient analysis, this paper devises an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-enabled distributed transient stability (DTS) methodology for NMGs. First, an ODE-based microgrid model is established to capture the dynamics in the droop control of DERs as well as network and load. Further, a distributed DTS is devised for the ODE representation of an NMG, allowing a privacy-preserving transient analysis of each microgrid while accurately reconstructing the frequency dynamics under droop controls in all DERs. In conclusion, extensive tests are performed to verify the validity of the ODE-based microgrid model through both dynamic response and eigenvalue analysis, and the efficacy of the DTS algorithm in simulating the large signal responses and the frequent fluctuations in NMG.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Assessments of data centers for provision of frequency regulation","Fu, Yangyang; Han, Xu; Baker, Kyri; Zuo, Wangda","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Frequency regulation; data center; frequency regulation flexibility factor; regulation capacity; 30 EE - Building Technologies Office (EE-5B); frequency regulation","There are numerous opportunities for data centers to participate in demand response programs considering their large energy capacities, flexible working environments and workloads, redundant design and operation, etc. As a type of demand response, frequency regulation requires fast response, and its potential is not fully explored by data centers yet. This paper proposes a synergistic control strategy for data center frequency regulation which uses both IT and cooling systems. It combines power management techniques at the server level with control of the chilled water supply temperature to track the regulation signal from the electrical market. A frequency regulation flexibility factor is also proposed to increase the IT capacity for frequency regulation. The performance of the control strategy is studied through numerical simulations using an equation-based object-oriented Modelica platform designed for data centers. Simulation results show that with well-tuned control parameters, data centers can provide frequency regulation service in both regulation up and down. The performance of data centers in providing frequency regulation service is largely influenced by the regulation capacity bid, frequency regulation flexibility factor, workload condition, and cooling mode of the cooling system, and not significantly influenced by the time constant of chillers. In addition, compared with a server-only control strategy, the proposed synergistic control strategy can provide an extra regulation capacity of 3% of the design power when chillers are activated. When chillers are deactivated, both strategies have a similar regulation capacity.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

"What Factors Drive the Changes in Water Withdrawals in the U.S. Agriculture and Food Manufacturing Industries between 1995 and 2010?","Avelino, Andre Fernandes Tomon; Dall'erba, Sandy","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; crops; food; irrigation; livestock; organic reactions","Climate change and increasing world population will directly impact the global food supply chain linkages. In the United States, agricultural production requires less irrigated water than before but it still accounts for a third of total water withdrawals. To better understand the evolution of its water use, we perform a structural decomposition analysis of water withdrawals across eight different crops and six livestock categories and differentiate the trends over 1995–2005 vs 2005–2010 to account for the role of the economic crisis in the second period. Based on USGS data, the results show that both periods experienced an overall decline in water withdrawals in the production of all crops except oilseeds. This trend is driven by a decrease in water intensity, reflecting greater efficiency of irrigation systems, and by reduced local per capita income in the second period. However, increased foreign demand for water-intensive sectors like oilseeds from NAFTA and Asian partners mitigated the decline. Results indicate also a decreasing water use in livestock production partially due to a shift from red to white meat consumption in the country. Arguably, recent tariff wars and border closures have greatly reduced the virtual water embodied in American exports.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, we investigated both thermodynamic and kinetic profiles of benzaldehyde hydrogenation over the Pd(111) and Pt(111) metal surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations. The adsorption of H<sub>2</sub> shows the mixed preference of H adsorption sites on the Pt(111), while the fcc adsorption site is dominant for H on the Pd(111). When benzaldehyde is added to the systems, we observe a strong reduction of benzaldehyde on charged Pd (111) surface compared with that on neutral surface. In contrast, charged state of the Pt(111) surface does not change their interaction. Subsequent hydrogenation reaction of benzaldehyde over Pd(111), proceeding via Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, is affected by two major factors: the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O solvent and surface charge. The presence of H<sub>2</sub>O solvent greatly reduces the activation energy of C-H and O-H bond formation during the hydrogenation process. Furthermore, the hydrogenation step via C-H bond formation is preferred thermodynamically and kinetically over O-H bond formation during thermocatalytic hydrogenation, while the opposite trend holds true during electrocatalytic hydrogenation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We found that under the reference infection scenario, the US gasoline demand grows slowly after a quick rebound in May, and is unlikely to fully recover prior to October 2020. Under the reference and pessimistic scenario, continual lockdown (no reopening) could worsen the motor gasoline demand temporarily, but it helps the demand recover to a normal level quicker. Under the optimistic infection scenario, gasoline demand will recover close to the non-pandemic level by October 2020.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In these markets, there are price-maker agents representing some frequency regulation (FR) providers and a number of independent price-taker FR providers. An equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) model is employed in this paper to study the equilibria of a PBR market in the presence of price-maker agents and pricetaker FR providers. Due to the incorporation of the FR providers' dynamics, the proposed model is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem over innovative mathematical techniques. An optimal equilibrium point is also selected for the market, where none of the agents is unique deviator and the dynamic performance of power system is improved simultaneously. The effectiveness of proposed optimal equilibrium point is evaluated in the numerical results section by comparing the outputs with conventional optimal dispatches of the FR providers.","Springer","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Solving the duck curve in a smart grid environment using a non-cooperative game theory and dynamic pricing profiles","Sheha, Moataz; Mohammadi, Kasra; Powell, Kody","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; duck curve; dynamic optimization; Stackelberg game; distributed energy storage; solar penetration; levelized cost of storage","With the intermittency that comes with electricity generation from renewables, utilizing dynamic pricing will encourage the demand-side to respond in a smart way that would minimize the electricity costs and flatten the net electricity demand curve. Determining the optimal dynamic pricing profile that would leverage distributed storage to flatten the curve is a novel idea that needs to be studied. Moreover, the economic feasibility of utilizing distributed electrical energy storage is still not given in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a novel way of solving a citywide dynamic model using a bilevel programming algorithm is introduced. The problem is developed as a novel non-cooperative Stackelberg game that utilizes air-conditioning systems and electrical storage through the end-users to determine the optimal dynamic pricing profile. The results show that the combined effect of utilizing demand-side air-conditioning systems and distributed storage together can flatten the curve while employing the optimal dynamic pricing profile. An economic study is performed to determine the economic feasibility of 20 different cases with different battery designs and the level of solar penetration. Three metrics were used to evaluate the economic performance of each case: the levelized cost of storage, the levelized cost of energy, and the simple payback period. Most cases had levelized cost of storage values lower than 0.457 $/kWh, which is the lower bound available in the literature. Seven out of 16 cases have a simple payback period shorter than the lifetime of the system (25 years). The case with a 100 MW PV power plant and a battery storage of size 597 MWh, was found to be the most promising case with a simple payback period of 12.71 years for the photovoltaic plant and 19.86 years for the demand-side investments.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

Using statistical methods to detect data manipulation in compliance reports, we find evidence that firms deliberately exaggerated performance during the first phase of the program (2006-2010), suggesting the high compliance rate was overstated. In its second phase (2011-2015), the number of firms in the program expanded by an order of magnitude, and the compliance rate decreased. We develop a simple model to show how the observed increase in non-compliance is consistent with reduced misreporting. Statistical tests find no evidence of manipulation in the second phase. Larger firms, especially those not controlled by the state, and firms in cities with relatively low growth were more likely to report non-compliance, which suggests a role for state control and local protectionism in shaping compliance decisions.

The analysis is performed using a hypothetical industrial plant, where the cogeneration solution consists in the recovery of waste heat from the power generation for steam production. The feasibility is evaluated by calculating the Return of Investment (ROI) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project. Eight Latin American countries are studied considering their specific natural gas markets, regulation, and macroeconomic variables. Two scenarios, electricity production for self-consumption and electricity production with power surplus sale, are independently analyzed considering the effects of available incentives. In the countries where the project is feasible, the application of incentives leads to a significant reduction in the ROI and, consequently, to an increment in the IRR. The effect of the interest rate and environmental impact were also analyzed. In general terms, along the region, the regulation for cogeneration is incipient while incentives are very standard and similar respect to lowering of import, Value-Added Tax (VAT), and income taxes, which seems to be designed purely to promote capital investment. Following the results from this study, it is of paramount importance to create new policy instruments in the future to advance the regulatory framework for cogeneration in Latin America.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We applied our typology to characterize efficiency programs along several dimensions (market sector, technology, delivery approach, and intervention strategy) and report the costs incurred by utilities and other program administrators to achieve electricity savings as a result of the programs. Such cost performance data can be used to compare relative costs of different types of efficiency programs, evaluate efficiency options alongside other electricity resources, benchmark local efficiency programs against regional and national cost estimates, and assess the costs of meeting state efficiency policies. The savings-weighted average cost of saved electricity for the period was $0.025/kilowatt-hour (kWh). The cost of saved electricity for programs that targeted residential customers was $0.021/kWh, compared to $0.025/kWh for programs for commercial and industrial customers. Ultimately, we developed an aggregate program savings “cost curve” for the actual electricity efficiency resource during the period that provides insights into the relative costs of various types of efficiency programs and the savings contribution of each program type to the efficiency resource at a national level.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Editorial: Achieving Water-Energy-Food Nexus Sustainability: A Science and Data Need or a Need for Integrated Public Policy?","Mohtar, Rabi; Lawford, Richard George; Engel-Cox, Jill A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; environmental policy; future sustainability; global change; water; water-energy-food nexus","The benefits of addressing the water, energy, and food sectors in an integrated manner is gaining significant recognition. An integrated approach can provide improved resource use efficiencies, more coherent environmental policies, and an overall strategy for achieving sustainability in the three sectors, as outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 (Food), 6 (Water), and 7 (Energy). Societies are concerned with ensuring food security, avoiding wars over water, and creating opportunity by ensuring access to energy. To be effective, however, this approach needs to be adopted at all levels of societies including government, private and civil society and reinforced by management and planning methods. This special issue identifies different approaches that are either being conceptualized or tested to support the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus approach. The articles contribute to answering the question, “Is achieving Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus Sustainability a science and data need or an integrated public policy need?” In either case, both natural and social sciences will need to combine to support science issues or integrated policy issues. The papers explore the ways in which science, data, and policy development could help to define integrative principles and policies for the three sectors. This approach could expand beyond the water, energy, and food sectors to include health, environment, trade, commerce, and international assistance thereby providing broad support to the SDGs. Moreover, this issue demonstrates that data combined with new technologies (tools and models) can support better decision-making when adopted by governments and the sectors.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is a novel framework that integrates both QKD and software-defined networking (SDN) techniques capable of enabling scalable, programmable, quantum-engineered, and ultra-resilient NMs. Equipped with a software-defined adaptive post-processing approach, a two-level key pool sharing strategy and an SDN-enabled event-triggered communication scheme, these PQNMs mitigate the impact of DoS attacks through programmable post-processing and secure key sharing among QKD links, a capability unattainable using existing technologies. Through comprehensive evaluations, we validate the benefits of PQNMs and demonstrate the efficacy of the presented strategies under various circumstances.

"A Step Towards Machine Learning-based Coherent Generator Grouping for Emergency Control Applications in Modern Power Grid","Zhang, Shiqi; Yogarathinam, Amirthagunaraj; Zhan, Junpeng; Yue, Meng; Lin, Guang","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; Coherent generator groups; Hierarchical clustering; Machine learning; Dynamic stability behaviors","A dynamic neural network (NN) based multi-class classifier is proposed for improving online prediction of coherent generator groups (CGGs), following the occurrences of various contingencies in the power grid. This is motivated by the increasing availability of the measurements from phasor measurement units (PMUs) and the number of grouping schemes is limited. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, by performing offline simulations, a library of system dynamic responses characterized by post-contingency rotor angles and speeds of individual generators is obtained. To generate sufficient data, up to N-2 contingencies and the uncertain parameters associated with the power grid including type and location of disturbance and fault clearing times are modeled. Secondly, the training data-set is produced by generating labels for individual contingencies using a hierarchical clustering method based on rotor angle and speed data. Lastly, the dynamic NN models are trained for online applications such as emergency controls and controlled islanding. The proposed method is tested on the standard 16-generator 68-bus system to demonstrate its performance. Furthermore, the impact of the sample data lengths on the CGG numbers is evaluated. It is interesting to observe that the time domain stability behaviors can be determined by examining the changes in the CGG numbers.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Of particular importance are the communities most directly impacted. The current study focuses on a random sample of 970 adults in eight counties within the oil and gas industry-reliant region of southeast Texas in order to explore support for carbon capture and storage (CCS), which is a climate change mitigation technology that has seen a great deal of investment in that area. Results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis and general linear modeling (GLM) suggest that policy support –individual support and perceived community support – is dependent on perceived risks and benefits of CCS, community-focused perceptions (including Bourdieu’s social capital), and perceptions about stakeholders (trustworthiness and expected role in CCS policy making). Here, one key takeaway is that social capital was both a predictor and moderator in community-level CCS support and helped explain the hidden effects of risk perception of CCS and CCS knowledge on community-level CCS support. Implications for public policy and stakeholder relations are discussed.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Texas at Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Policy; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 111312","","","FE0029487","Journal ID: ISSN 0301-4215","10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111312","","2021-07-05T00:00:00Z","1804064","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1804064","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1804064","Energy Policy","10","139"

"Leveraging concentrating solar power plant dispatchability: A review of the impacts of global market structures and policy","McPherson, Madeleine; Mehos, Mark; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; thermal energy storage; electricity markets and policies; electricity system integration; renewable energy","Concentrating solar power (CSP) integrated with thermal energy storage delivers flexible and dispatchable power, which is an increasingly valuable quality as electricity systems integrate growing penetrations of variable renewable energy. Valuing and compensating CSP's dispatchability and flexibility requires electricity market structures and policies that appropriately remunerate generation during high-value portions of the day. In this paper, we review previous analyses of CSP economics and deployment, and we find that continued CSP growth will require valuation mechanisms that appropriately compensate for CSP's flexibility during both plant design and plant operation. We then review market structures that drive CSP operations and dispatch in jurisdictions where CSP is being developed, with perspectives from Spain, Chile, Australia, Morocco, South Africa, the United States, China, and the United Arab Emirates (Dubai). Despite broad agreement that CSP's dispatchability provides value to electricity grids, countries' policies for remunerating and leveraging such dispatchability varies widely. As deployment of CSP and variable renewable energy grows, it will be increasingly important to redesign current integration policies to signal the delivery of CSP's grid services more appropriately.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Leveraging inter-firm influence in the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies: An agent-based model","Shi, Yingying; Zeng, Yongchao; Engo, Jean; Han, Botang; Li, Yang; Muehleisen, Ralph T.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Energy efficiency technology; Small and medium-sized enterprises; Technology adoption; agent-based modeling; technology diffusion","Energy efficiency technologies (EETs) are crucial for saving energy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the diffusion of EETs in small and medium-sized enterprises is rather slow. Literature shows the interactions between innovation adopters and potential adopters have significant impacts on innovation diffusion. Enterprises lack the motivation to share information, and EETs usually lack observability, which suppress the inter-firm influence. Thus, an information platform, together with proper policies encouraging or forcing enterprises to disclose EET-related information, should help harness inter-firm influence to accelerate EETs' diffusion. To explore whether and how such an information platform affects EETs' diffusion in small and medium-sized enterprises, this report builds an agent-based model to mimic EET diffusion processes. Based on a series of controlled numerical experiments, some counter-intuitive phenomena are discovered and explained. The results show that the information platform is a double-edged sword that notably accelerates EETs' diffusion by approximately 47% but may also boost negative information to diffuse even faster and delay massive adoption of EETs. Increasing network density and the intensity of inter-firm influence are effective to speed EET diffusion, but their impacts diminish drastically after reaching some critical values (0.05 and 0.15 respectively) and eventually harm the stability of the system. Ultimately, the findings implicate that EET suppliers should carefully launch their promising but immature products; policies that can reduce the perceived risk by enterprises and the effort to maintain an informative rather than judgmental information platform can prominently mitigate the negative side effects brought by high fluidity of information.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

In this analysis, we use a conventional risk-modeling framework to develop and apply a new methodology for assessing the supply risk to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Specifically, supply risk is defined as the confluence of three factors: the likelihood of a foreign supply disruption, the dependency of U.S. manufacturers on foreign supplies, and the ability of U.S. manufacturers to withstand a supply disruption. The methodology is applied to 52 commodities for the decade spanning 2007–2016. The results indicate that a subset of 23 commodities, including cobalt, niobium, rare earth elements, and tungsten, pose the greatest supply risk.

This enables a technically viable hybridization of a solar topping cycle and a geothermal bottoming cycle at locations where both resources are available. In this article, an underperforming geothermal power system based at Burley, Idaho is used as a baseline to investigate the technical and economic potential of such a hybrid cycle. A direct thermal energy storage (TES) system is also integrated to overcome the intermittency of the solar resource. Design and off-design behavior of key components are modelled to simulate the annual performance of the hybrid system on an hourly basis. The sizing of the solar field and thermal storage is investigated and is seen to significantly impact the annual electricity generation and efficiency. Various cost scenarios for the solar field and thermal energy storage are investigated. An economic metric - levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) - is used to optimize the solar field sizing and TES capacity. The hybrid plant converts the additional solar heat input into additional work with an efficiency of 32.9%. Retrofitting a geothermal plant with solar and eight hours of energy storage can achieve an LCOE of 0.136 $/kWhe in current cost scenarios and 0.081 $/kWhe in a future cost reduction scenario. Although the hybrid system cannot directly compete with current PV systems without batteries, it has an LCOE 32% lower than that of a PV-battery system. This paper provides insights into the research and development of the future grid with a high renewable energy penetration and encourages further study of energy hybridization for improved efficiencies and economics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, in this work, we have designed two different centralized water treatment facilities capable of managing produced water from oil and gas wells in Texas and Louisiana, both of which convert the produced water into the following valuable resources: ten-pound brine and fresh water. The two main designs each use commercially available technology with varying levels of establishment in treating produced water. Both treatment processes remove oil and grease and suspended solids, reduce the divalent ion concentrations, and concentrate the brines to a near-saturation state. The baseline design uses chemical precipitation to remove the divalent ions to meet the reuse specifications, whereas the advanced design uses nanofiltration (NF) membranes to separate divalent ions and uses reverse osmosis (RO) membranes to partially concentrate the brine. Both models use mechanical vapor recompression to concentrate the brine up to NaCl saturation. The baseline process is shown to be cost-effective for low-hardness brines. In the case of high hardness, the chemical precipitation step is cost-prohibitive. We find that NF membranes are a promising alternative to chemical precipitation as a means of separating monovalent and divalent ions.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Desalination; Journal Volume: 481","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 114381","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0011-9164","10.1016/j.desal.2020.114381","","2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","1890939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890939","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1890939","Desalination","","481"

Optimization using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is conducted to identify the optimum operating conditions of the system under various conditions. The results show that the effect of integrating the compressor on thermo-economic performance is different under various operating conditions. However, it significantly improves the coefficient of performance (COP) and the improvement decreases with a further increase in the compressor pressure ratio. Integrating the compressor makes the system operation practical under certain operating conditions, especially at high condenser temperatures, where a typical system fails to operate. Here, the results show that employing the compressor is not always economically attractive and requires careful consideration. For an evaporator temperature of 6 °C, a COP enhancement of over 200% can be achieved at a condenser temperature of 40 °C, which corresponds to 57% reduction in the unit production cost of cooling. Performing a detailed optimization using a robust algorithm like PSO is very useful in designing a thermodynamically and economically efficient hybrid system.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments; Journal Volume: 38","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 100652","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 2213-1388","10.1016/j.seta.2020.100652","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1864025","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864025","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864025","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","","38"

Though solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays are cost-effective across each of the three North Carolina facilities, adopting battery storage to enable PV to operate with existing diesel generators in a hybrid energy system reduces the economic value of the system. This is in contrast to more economically viable systems in California and New York. All of these systems also offer unquantified resilience benefits by extending operation from hours to weeks across the facilities. If decision makers were able to value the resilience benefits offered by each system or utility rate structures were changed to incentivize battery storage during normal operations, it would impact these assessments. Even so, this analysis provides decision makers a key set of cost benchmarks when considering how they might improve resilience at their critical operations.","Prime National Publishing Corp.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Economic and environmental benefits of market-based power-system reform in China: A case study of the Southern grid system","Abhyankar, Nikit (ORCID:0000000333838558); Lin, Jiang; Liu, Xu (ORCID:0000000257841244); Sifuentes, Froylan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; China; southern grid; power market reforms; dispatch modeling; CO2 emissions","China, whose power system accounts for about 13% of global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, has begun implementing market-based power-sector reforms. This paper simulates power system dispatch in China's Southern Grid region and examines the economic and environmental impacts of market-based operations. We find that market-based operation can increase efficiency and reduce costs in all Southern Grid provinces—reducing wholesale electricity costs by up to 35% for the entire region relative to the 2016 baseline. About 60% of the potential cost reduction can be realized by creating independent provincial markets within the region, and the rest by creating a regional market without transmission expansion. The wholesale market revenue is adequate to recover generator fixed costs; however, financial restructuring of current payment mechanisms may be necessary. Electricity markets could also reduce the Southern Grid's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by up to 10% owing to more efficient thermal dispatch and avoided hydro/renewable curtailment. The benefits of regional electricity markets with expanded transmission likely will increase as China's renewable generation increases.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

By mining the large-scale trajectory data and conduct the case study in NYC, we confirm that the rise of TNC is the major contributing factor that makes urban traffic congestion worse. From 2017 to 2019, the number of for-hire vehicles (FHV) has increased by over 48% and served 90% more daily trips. These resulted in an average citywide speed reduction of 22.5% on weekdays, and the average speed in Manhattan decreased from 11.76 km/h in April 2017 to 9.56 km/h in March 2019. The heavier traffic congestion may have led to 136% more NOx, 152% more CO and 157% more HC emission per kilometer traveled by the FHV sector. Our results show that the traffic condition is consistently worse across different times of the day and at different locations in NYC. And we build the connection between the number of available FHVs and the reduction in travel speed between the two years of data and explain how the rise of TNC may impact traffic congestion in terms of moving speed and congestion time. Our findings provide valuable insights for different stakeholders and decision-makers in framing regulation and operation policies towards more effective and sustainable urban mobility.","Elseiver","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-01-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sustainable Cities and Society; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 102053","","","EE0008524","Journal ID: ISSN 2210-6707; PII: S2210670720300408","10.1016/j.scs.2020.102053","","2022-03-02T00:00:00Z","1799523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799523","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799523","Sustainable Cities and Society","C","55"

Six hybrid configurations are developed by integrating different desalination and chiller systems to the GTCC. Desalination systems include multi effect distillation (MED) and reverse osmosis (RO) with pressure exchanger (PEX) and chiller systems include double effect and half effect water-lithium bromide absorption chillers (DEABC and HEABC) and a vapor compression chiller (VCC) with different working fluids. The specific goal is to identify the optimal hybridization scheme and parameters among different configurations. The economic results show that implementation of RO is more economical than a hybrid MED-RO system in which the power cycle’s condenser is replaced by a MED. Also, the use of DEABC is more economical than a HEABC and a VCC. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that configuration 1 in which GTCC with the wet cooling tower is integrated with DEABC and RO is the most economical configuration. For this system, the levelized costs of electricity, water, and cooling (LCOE, LCOW, LCOC) are $\$0.0648$/kWh, $\$0.7219$/m<sup>3</sup> and $0.0402/ton-hr, respectively, of which LCOE and LCOC are not the lowest values among different configurations.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments; Journal Volume: 37","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 100632","","","EE0007712","Journal ID: ISSN 2213-1388","10.1016/j.seta.2020.100632","","2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","1864024","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864024","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864024","Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments","","37"
"Distributed Outage Detection in Power Distribution Networks","Samudrala, Ananth Narayan; Amini, M. Hadi; Kar, Soummya; Blum, Rick S.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Distributed outage detection; Power distribution network; Distributed estimation; Topology identification","Real time topology knowledge is essential for situational awareness of power distribution networks. Line outages change the topology of a distribution network. Hence, outage detection is an important task. Most of the existing outage detection algorithms are centralized, in which sensors communicate their data to a control center which performs outage detection using the received data. However, with the increasing size of the distribution network and with different areas of the network being monitored by different operators, communication is a bottleneck and scalability is a major concern. To address these issues, we propose a novel outage detection algorithm using a divide and conquer approach. First, we divide a distribution network into sub-networks, such that outage detection can be run in parallel in each sub-network independently ensuring scalability to large networks. Further, to reduce the latency, bandwidth and attenuation challenges associated with communications in a large network, we divide each sub-network into multiple control areas which communicate only with their neighbors. We employ a distributed iterative load estimation across the control areas of each sub-network and then use the load estimate for local outage detection in each control area. Here, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated for multiple feeder models and compared against traditional centralized outage detection algorithms.","IEEE","","Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR (United States); Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-06-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5124-5137","","","OE0000779","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/tsg.2020.2999921","","2021-06-04T00:00:00Z","1648141","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1648141","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1648141","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","6","11"

By coupling projections from four general circulation models (GCMs) with a state-of-the-art US electricity system model - the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) - this study evaluates both the isolated and combined effects of different climate-mediated drivers of US electricity system change through 2050. Comparing results across climate models allows us to evaluate which effects are robust to uncertainty in projected climate outcomes. Comparing effects of different drivers in isolation and in combination allows us to determine the relative contributions of the climate-mediated effects on system evolution. Our results indicate that national-level energy and economic impacts are largely driven by increases in electricity demand that follow from a consistent increase in surface air temperature that is largely robust to the choice of climate model. Other electricity system changes can be equally or more significant in some regions, but these effects are more regionally variable, less significant when aggregated to the national scale, and less robust to the choice of climate model. The findings show that the impacts of climate change on the electricity system can be understood in terms of fewer drivers and with greater certainty at the national level than at the regional level.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For a Texas electric power system with high wind and solar penetrations, we quantify how climate change will affect supply and demand during three types of high stress periods for the power grid: high demand hours, high net demand hours, and high system ramp hours. We specifically quantify effects on demand, reductions in available thermal capacity (i.e. thermal deratings), wind and solar generation, and net demand. We estimate each using meteorological variables from five climate change projections (2041-2050) assuming Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 and from a reference period (1996-2005). All five projections indicate that climate change will increase demand by up to 2 GWh during high demand hours (4% of demand in the reference period) and increase net demand by up to 3 GWh during high net demand periods (6% of net demand in the reference period). All five projections also indicate thermal deratings will increase during high demand and net demand periods by up to 2 GWh and high net demand ramps will increase by up to 2 GW. Overall, our results indicate compounding effects of climate change in Texas will necessitate greater investment in peak and flexible capacity.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using this synthetic data for the development and evaluation of short-term forecasting algorithms offer many unique advantages over observational data, such as the ability to observe the full wind flow field in the surrounding region. Several short-term forecasting algorithms are implemented and evaluated using the synthetic data at several different time horizons and for three different geographic locations. Comparison is made with observational data from one location. We find that short-term forecasts of the synthetic data considering wind flow from the surrounding region perform 26% better than persistence in terms of root mean square error at the 5-minute time horizon. This improvement is comparable to studies of observational data in the literature. These results provide motivation to use synthetic data for short term forecasting in grid simulations, and open the door to future algorithmic improvements.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Improving estimates of transmission capital costs for utility-scale wind and solar projects to inform renewable energy policy","Gorman, Will; Mills, Andrew; Wiser, Ryan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Estimating the overall costs of transmission needed to integrate variable renewable energy (VRE) onto the grid is challenging. An improved understanding of these transmission costs would support electricity system planning as VRE penetrations increase. This paper brackets VRE transmission capital costs using multiple approaches based on interconnection studies, actual transmission projects, capacity-expansion simulation models, and aggregated U.S. VRE-related transmission expenditures. Each approach possesses advantages and drawbacks, and combining the approaches lends confidence to the results. The resulting range of average levelized VRE transmission costs is 1– 10 dollars/MWh, which is generally lower than earlier estimates in the literature. These transmission capital costs can increase the direct plant-level levelized cost of VRE by 3%–33%, based on levelized costs of energy of 29– 56 dollars/MWh for utility-scale wind and 36–46 dollars/MWh for utility-scale solar. As VRE deployment continues to expand, policy makers can use this information to (1) assess the benefits of transmission avoidance and deferral when comparing distributed energy resources versus utility-scale projects, (2) evaluate the potential costs of large-scale public transmission investments, and (3) better analyze system-level costs of utility-scale VRE technologies. Future research can expand on the framework presented here by providing a review of operation and maintenance costs for transmission systems. ","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron &amp; steel, and chemicals &amp; plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To achieve this goal, a comprehensive 18-month field measurement campaign was conducted in the region of the Columbia River basin. The observations were used to diagnose and quantify systematic forecast errors in the operational High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model during weather events of particular concern to wind energy forecasting. Examples of such events are cold pools, gap flows, thermal troughs/marine pushes, mountain waves, and topographic wakes. WFIP2 model development has focused on the boundary layer and surface-layer schemes, cloud–radiation interaction, the representation of drag associated with subgrid-scale topography, and the representation of wind farms in the HRRR. Additionally, refinements to numerical methods have helped to improve some of the common forecast error modes, especially the high wind speed biases associated with early erosion of mountain–valley cold pools. This study describes the model development and testing undertaken during WFIP2 and demonstrates forecast improvements. Specifically, WFIP2 found that mean absolute errors in rotor-layer wind speed forecasts could be reduced by 5%–20% in winter by improving the turbulent mixing lengths, horizontal diffusion, and gravity wave drag. The model improvements made in WFIP2 are also shown to be applicable to regions outside of complex terrain. Ongoing and future challenges in model development will also be discussed.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Renewable electricity can be leveraged to produce fuels and chemicals from CO<sub>2</sub>, offering sustainable routes to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy and products-driven economy. A number of approaches have been developed for the electron-driven reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to products, including both direct and indirect (via an energy carrier such as H<sub>2</sub>) pathways and spanning from electrochemical to biological to thermocatalytic conversion. While these approaches are at various stages of development, there are technical barriers related to each core conversion technology that need to be addressed in order to accelerate commercialization and drive the transition towards a circular carbon economy. In this perspective, we assess and characterize the top technical barriers for utilizing renewable electricity for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction across five different conversion approaches (direct electrochemical, direct bioelectrochemical, direct non-thermal plasma, indirect bioelectrochemical, and indirect thermochemical) under state-of-technology conditions, outline the R&D needs to overcome each barrier, and identify the most promising C<sub>1</sub>–C<sub>3</sub> hydrocarbons and oxygenates based on their relative ease of formation, economic viability, CO<sub>2</sub> utilization potential, and energy storage capacity. Our analysis suggests, based on current reported states of technology, that indirect pathways paired with the formation of C<sub>1</sub> products offer the most technically feasible approach for electron driven CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the near term.

For these tests the models were run in control (CNT) and experimental (EXP) configurations, with the EXP configuration including all the improved parameterizations. The impacts of the experimental parameterizations on the forecast of 80 m wind speeds (wind turbine hub height) from the HRRR and HRRRNEST models are assessed, using observations collected by 19 sodars and three profiling lidars for comparison. Improvements due to the experimental physics (EXP vs. CNT runs) and those due to finer horizontal grid spacing (HRRRNEST vs. HRRR) and the combination of the two are compared, using standard bulk statistics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean bias error (bias). On average, the HRRR 80 m wind speed MAE is reduced by 3 %–4 % due to the experimental physics. The impact of the finer horizontal grid spacing in the CNT runs also shows a positive improvement of 5 % on MAE, which is particularly large at nighttime and during the morning transition. Lastly, the combined impact of the experimental physics and finer horizontal grid spacing produces larger improvements in the 80 m wind speed MAE, up to 7 %–8 %. The improvements are evaluated as a function of the model's initialization time, forecast horizon, time of the day, season of the year, site elevation, and meteorological phenomena. Causes of model weaknesses are identified. Finally, bias correction methods are applied to the 80 m wind speed model outputs to measure their impact on the improvements due to the removal of the systematic component of the errors.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We focus on which electric technologies are expected to grow, how electrification will impact electricity demand and grid activities, and which solutions might improve the integration of these technologies. Recent industry reports show increasing projections of electrification technologies in the coming decades. Studies show that increased demand from electrification will likely require grid capacity expansion and make grid operations and planning more challenging; however, multiple non-wires solutions exist to ensure integration is efficient and cost-effective. Electrification of space heating and especially transportation is expected to have the largest impact on electricity demand in the near future. Uncontrolled electric vehicle charging poses a significant challenge to grid operations, but control strategies create an opportunity for improved efficiency. Other insights include a high level of uncertainty in electrification adoption and potential benefits of combining electrification technologies with renewable generation and energy storage.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Policymakers can benefit from analyses of existing wind projects that enable them to better understand likely effects on residents around proposed projects. Our analysis of a randomly drawn, representative national survey of 1705 existing U.S. wind project neighbors provides previously unavailable detail about factors influencing the attitudes of these neighbors toward their local wind projects. Overall, we find positive-leaning attitudes, which improve over time as individuals self-select into communities near existing wind projects. Hearing wind turbines leads to less-positive attitudes, although living very near to turbines does not, nor does seeing wind turbines. In fact, our findings suggest complex relationships among nearby residents' attitudes, their perceptions about the particular fit of turbines within their landscape and community, and their perceptions of wind project impacts on property values. These findings - along with the positive correlation between perceived planning-process fairness and attitude - suggest areas of focus for wind project development that may influence social outcomes and acceptance of wind energy. The concluding discussion provides a number of policy and future research recommendations based on the research.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We show that load and operating reserve requirements can be met for all hours while considering key generator operational constraints. Storage plays an active role in maintaining the balance of supply and demand during sunset hours. Under the highest PV penetration scenario, hours with >90% PV penetration are relatively common, which require rapid transitions between predominately conventional synchronous generation and mostly inverter-based generation.

"Optimal charging management and infrastructure planning for free-floating shared electric vehicles","Roni, Mohammad S.; Yi, Zonggen; Smart, John G.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; integer programming; optimization; electric vehicle; charging infrastructure; car sharing","Recently, major car-sharing service providers have begun to include electric vehicles (EVs) in free-floating car-sharing fleets. For these EVs, downtime due to charging, including time spent traveling to and waiting in queues at charging stations in a sparse charging infrastructure network, is a major barrier to sustainable operation. An intuitive solution to overcome this barrier is to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the fleet service area. This paper studies the relationship between fleet vehicle downtime and the number of charging stations by modeling the fleet operations of a major car-sharing service provider. An integer programming model is developed that jointly optimizes charging station allocation, in terms of the number and location of charging stations, and the assignment of EVs to charging stations. Case study results showed that fleet vehicle charging time comprises 72-75% of the total downtime spent on charging trips. This indicates that charging time, as opposed to travel time or waiting time, is the dominant component of total fleet downtime for charging. The study also shows that by adding 5 to 20 new charging stations reduces total fleet downtime and travel time during charging trips by 2-4% and 26-49%, respectively. Although adding new charging stations to the fleet service area reduces total charging trip travel time significantly, it does not reduce total downtime significantly. Results also show that if the EV battery state of the charge (SOC) threshold—below which a charging trip is initiated—is less than 18%, not all EVs in the car-sharing fleet can be charged using the existing direct current fast chargers (DCFCs) in the fleet’s service area. Furthermore, this implies that adequate charging infrastructure coverage is required to ensure that EVs of a given range can operate in the car-sharing fleet.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Simulations show that a carbon tariff changes the structure of China’s exports and promotes trade diversion from the USA to other countries and regions. A domestic carbon tax and subsidy policy can dampen the adverse impacts of carbon tariffs on trade.

Building on a literature that has sought to develop and apply methods for retrospective benefit-to-cost evaluation for federal research programs, this study provides a quantitative analysis of the economic social return on these historical wind energy research investments. Importantly, the study applies multiple innovative methods and varies important input parameters to test the sensitivity of the results. The analysis considers public wind research expenditures and U.S. wind power deployment over the period 1976–2017, while also accounting for the full useful lifetime of wind projects built over this period. Assessed benefits include energy cost savings and health benefits due to reductions in air pollution. Overall, this analysis demonstrates sizable, positive economic returns on past wind energy research. Under the core analysis and with a 3% real discount rate, the net benefits from historical federal wind energy research investments are found to equal $31.4 billion, leading to an 18 to 1 benefit-to-cost ratio and an internal rate of return of 15.4%. Avoided carbon dioxide emissions are not valued in monetary terms, but are estimated at 1510 million metric tons. Alternative methods and input assumptions yield benefit-to-cost ratios that fall within a relatively narrow range from 7-to-1 to 21-to-1, reinforcing in broad terms the general finding of a sizable positive return on investment. Unsurprisingly, results are sensitive to the chosen discount rate, with higher discount rates leading to lower benefit-to-cost ratios, and lower discount rates yielding higher benefit-to-cost ratios.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This strong market growth is also driven by advances in power electronics, improved control systems, and the rapidly falling price and increased adoption of distributed energy generation technologies, like solar photovoltaics and storage. In the event of grid outages, microgrids can provide a backup source of power; providing resilience to the critical loads; however, this requires that the microgrid itself is resilient to physical and cyber threats. Building highly resilient microgrids requires a methodological assessment of potential threats, identification of vulnerabilities, and design of mitigation strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies and develops a definition for microgrid resilience.

However, it is unclear whether public support translates to paying for green electricity if given the option. Our analysis employs data from two national, longitudinal surveys on energy attitudes and willingness to pay for renewables to investigate whether environmental concerns and stated preferences for renewable energy translate to consumer behavior as measured through ratepayer participation in voluntary utility renewable energy programs known as utility green pricing. We find higher green pricing program participation rates in areas where consumers have stronger feelings about the environmental impacts of energy. Consumers in high-participation areas also have a higher stated willingness to pay for renewable energy, on average, than consumers in low-participation areas. We also find income, homeownership, and home value explain some of the difference between high- and low-participation programs. Further, program participation is lower in areas where utilities charge higher green pricing program premiums. These findings suggest that green power programs - such as utility green pricing - offer a market-based mechanism for consumers to realize their desire to purchase renewable energy. Policymakers may use these results to support further expansion of green power programs in areas where customers currently lack accessible and affordable options to act on their environmental beliefs and concerns.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Demand Response for Variable Renewable Energy Integration: A Proposed Approach and its Impacts","McPherson, Madeleine; Cowiestoll, Brady L","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; demand response; variable renewable energy integration; power systems; production cost model; load control; smart grid","As electricity systems integrate increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy, system operators are seeking technologies and strategies that increase their system's flexibility. Despite obstacles around hardware, market structure, and lack of experience, demand response is an important source of flexibility that complements more conventional supply-side flexibility resources. However, accurate representations of demand response in production cost models employed for grid systems analyses have been limited by incomplete formulations, inadequate real-world data, case studies with narrow applicability, and a finite list of end uses and sectors. This paper proposes a suite of demand response constraints that capture more-realistic demand response operational limitations including uptimes and downtimes, numbers of starts per day, allowable power limits, and required recovery periods. The proposed demand response implementation is tested with real-world load data for Bangalore, India. The results show that demand response reduces production costs primarily by facilitating the substitution of high-marginal-cost thermal generators with near-zero-marginal-cost renewables. Overall, demand response utilization rates are most constrained by their maximum allowable daily deployment, but intraday recovery constraints govern their operational behavior. In addition to the significant value that demand response provides to the grid, demand response aggregators can expect substantial revenues from price arbitrage.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Switch Opening and Exchange Method for Stochastic Distribution Network Reconfiguration","Zhan, Junpeng; Liu, Weijia; Chung, C. Y.; Yang, Jiajia","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR); multi-hour stochastic DNR; photovoltaics (PV); radiality.","The purpose of distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) is to determine the optimal topology of an electricity distribution network, which is an efficient measure to reduce network power losses. Electricity load demand and photovoltaic (PV) output are uncertain and vary with time of day, and will affect the optimal network topology. Single-hour deterministic DNR is incapable of handling this uncertainty and variability. Therefore, this paper proposes to solve a multi-hour stochastic DNR (SDNR). Existing solution methods for DNR are either inaccurate or excessively time-consuming, and are therefore incapable of solving multi-hour SDNRs for large distribution networks. In this regard, a switch opening and exchange (SOE) method is proposed. Starting from a looped network with all switches closed, the SOE consists of three steps. The first step is to sequentially open the switches until all of the loops are opened. The second and third steps modify the status of branches obtained in the first step to obtain better radial topologies. Finally, five test systems are used to validate the accuracy and fast solution speed of the SOE and the superiority of multi-hour SDNR over single-hour deterministic DNR.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here we examine the connections between climate mitigation and climate adaptation, specifically, between low-carbon energy systems and extreme events. The article specifically addresses the question, how do responses to extreme climate risks enhance or limit capacity to promote city-level greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation? As a step toward answering this question, we present a framework for considering windows of opportunity that may arise as a result of extreme events and how these windows can be exploited to foster development and implementation of low-carbon energy strategies. Four brief case studies are used to provide empirical background and determine the impact of potential windows of opportunity. Some general conclusions are defined. In particular, the existing energy system structure is an important determinant of impact and potential for energy transitions. Well-developed and articulated governance strategies and ready access of effective and economically efficient alternative energy technology were key to transitions. However, prospects for inequity in development and implementation of low-carbon solutions need to be considered. Finally, exploiting windows of opportunity afforded by extreme events for developing low-carbon economy and infrastructure also can provide resilience against those very events. These types of responses will be needed as extreme events increase in frequency and magnitude in the future, with cities as primary sites of impact and action.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Availability of the raw resources is essential, but equally important are the services that deliver resources to human populations, such as adequate access to safe drinking water, electricity, and sufficient food. Any failures in either resource availability or FEW resources-related services will have an impact on human health. The ability of countries to intervene and overcome the challenges in the FEW domain depends on governance, education, and economic capacities. We distinguish between FEW resources, FEW services, and FEW health outcomes to develop an analysis framework for evaluating interrelationships among these critical resources. The framework is applied using a data-driven approach for sub-Saharan African countries, a region with notable FEW insecurity challenges. The data-driven approach using a cross-validated stepwise regression analysis indicates that limited governance and socioeconomic capacity in sub-Saharan African countries, rather than lack of the primary resources, more significantly impact access to FEW services and associated health outcomes. The proposed framework helps develop a cohesive approach for evaluating FEW metrics and could be applied to other regions of the world to continue improving our understanding of the FEW nexus.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Sandia National Lab.

Designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor, one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components. Here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity, revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector. To assess this thesis, we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following Folke et al., that is extended in this special issue, by which resilience comprises three capabilities: system persistence, adaptability, and transformation. We apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous United States, with particular attention to water-driven stressors. We provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities (persistence, adaptability, and transformability) of the water-electricity system in the United States over three scales of inter-dependencies: individual power plant, urban and grid scales.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the future, utilities and consumers may monetarily and environmentally benefit from continuously shaping load by alternatively encouraging or discouraging the use of electricity. One way to shape load and introduce elasticity is to broadcast forecasts of dynamic electricity prices that orchestrate electricity supply and demand in order to maximize the efficiency of conventional generation and the use of renewable resources including wind and solar energy. A binary control algorithm that influences the on and off states of end uses was developed and applied to empirical time series data to estimate price-based instantaneous opportunities for shedding and adding electric load. To overcome the limitations of traditional stochastic methods in quantifying diverse, non-Gaussian, non-stationary distributions of observed appliance behaviour, recent developments in wavelet-based analysis were applied to capture and simulate time-frequency domain behaviour. The performance of autoregressive and spectral reconstruction methods was compared, with phase reconstruction providing the best simulation ensembles. Results show spatiotemporal differences in the amount of load that can be shed and added, which suggest further investigation is warranted in estimating the benefits anticipated from the wide-scale deployment of continuous automatic residential load shaping.

Zico; Azevedo, Inês Lima","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Environmental pollution; Fossil fuels; Particulate matter; Power; Testing and assessment","In recent years, several methods have emerged to estimate the emissions and health, environmental, and climate change damages avoided by interventions such as energy efficiency, demand response, and the integration of renewables. However, differing assumptions employed in these analyses could yield contradicting recommendations regarding intervention implementation. We test the magnitude of the effect of using different key assumptions—average vs marginal emissions, year of calculation, temporal and regional scope, and inclusion of nonemitting generation—to estimate Mid-Atlantic region power pool (PJM) emissions and damage factors. We further highlight the importance of factor selection by evaluating three illustrative 2017 power system examples in PJM. We find that for a simple building lighting intervention, using average emissions factors incorporating nonemitting generation underestimates avoided damages by 45% compared to marginal factors. For PJM demand response, outdated marginal emissions factors from 2016 overestimate avoided damages by 25% compared to 2017 factors. Our assessment of PJM summer load further suggests that fossil-only average emissions factors overestimate damages by 63% compared to average factors incorporating nonemitting generation. Here, we recommend that energy modelers carefully select appropriate emissions metrics when performing their analyses. Furthermore, since the U.S. electric grid is rapidly changing, we urge decision-makers to frequently update (and consider forecasting) grid emissions factors.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 53; Journal Issue: 16","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 9905-9914","","","FG02-97ER25308","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; DGE1252522; SES-1463492","10.1021/acs.est.8b06586","","2022-10-05T00:00:00Z","1890396","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1890396","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1890396","Environmental Science and Technology","16","53"

As system owners and operators seek to improve the system resilience, they often find it challenging to assess the costs and benefits of resilience investments. Costs are fairly well understood and measured, but benefits are less so. There are many resilience metrics that attempt to measure resilience benefit, but the existing methods for calculating metrics and incorporating value of resilience in energy decisions are not easily executed. To address this, we developed a method for modeling the value of resilience that is flexible and scalable across multiple types of models. This article describes a framework for incorporating duration-dependent customer damage functions (CDFs) into grid- and campus-scale planning and operations models. In two case studies, we consider how the duration-dependent value of resilience influences the investment and operation decisions. We find that in both cases, knowledge of the value of lost load provides opportunities to reduce the lifecycle cost of energy through adjusted investment or operational decisions. The primary contribution of this research is to integrate the duration-dependent value of resilience in energy decisions. This study will be useful to grid operators interested in reducing the value of customer losses during grid outages, as well as campus or site owners evaluating resilience investments.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Energy Master Planning: Identifying Framing Constraints that Scope Your Technology Options","Sharp, Terry R.; Zhivov, Alexander; Haase, Matthias; Rose, Joergen","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","This paper addresses the framing constraints for building and community energy projects that must be considered when energy master planning (EMP) is conducted. The constraints cover emissions, sustainability, resilience, regulations and directives, and regional and local limitations such as available energy types, local conditions, and project requirements. The paper reflects development results from participants in an International Energy Agency project on energy master planning and in a U.S. Department of Defense project on technology integration to achieve resilient, low-energy use military installations. It identifies a comprehensive list of framing constraints categorized into locational threats, locational resources, energy and water distribution and storage systems, building and facility, indoor environmental, and equipment in buildings and district systems constraints. In addition, it identifies limits for these constraints that exist in seven participating countries. Some framing constraints can profoundly impact technology selection while others impact the installation of technologies (as in hardening) and have little to no impact on technology selection. Furthermore, framing constraints can be assessed in different ways and there are resources available to help EMP stakeholders evaluate them. Finally, a case is made that identifying and applying framing constraints early in EMP can bring efficiencies and better focus to the EMP process. We come to the conclusion that (1) for holistic energy planning, it is essential to identify and assess the framing constraints that bound an optimized EMP solution, (2) framing constraints limits should be evaluated as either hard or soft or promising technologies may fall out of an EMP analysis, (3) to maintain consistent quality in the EMP process, the identification of framing constraints and their limits, and perhaps their evaluation, should be standardized, (4) a standardized approach could establish a baseline that can be used, built upon, and improved, (5) as automated EMP tools are improved or developed, the resources in this paper could possibly contribute to their interworkings relative to technology screening, and (6) continued climate change and resulting aggressive goal setting will likely drive a continued and strong emphasis on EMP.","ASHRAE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Alaska, with its vast coastline, presents ample potential territory in which to build offshore wind farms, but significant challenges have thus far limited Alaska’s deployment of utility-scale wind energy capacity to a modest 62 MW (or approximately 2.7% of the state’s electric generation) as of this writing, all in land-based wind farms. This study provides an assessment of Alaska’s offshore wind resource, the first such assessment for Alaska, using a 14-year, high-resolution simulation from a numerical weather prediction and regional climate model. This is the longest-known high-resolution model data set to be used in a wind resource assessment. Widespread areas with relatively shallow ocean depth and high long-term average 100-m wind speeds and estimated net capacity factors over 50% were found, including a small area near Alaska’s population centers and the largest transmission grid that, if even partially developed, could provide the bulk of the state’s energy needs. The regional climate simulations were validated against available radiosonde and surface wind observations to provide the confidence of the model-based assessment. The model-simulated wind speed was found to be skillful and with near-zero average bias (-0.4–0.2 m s<sup>-1</sup>) when averaged over the domain. Small sample sizes made regional validation noisy, however.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Impacts of variable renewable energy on wholesale markets and generating assets in the United States: A review of expectations and evidence","Mills, Andrew D.; Levin, Todd; Wiser, Ryan; Seel, Joachim; Botterud, Audun","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Variable renewable energy; Electricity markets; Electricity prices; Generator profitability; Variable renewable energyElectricity marketsElectricity pricesGenerator profitability","We synthesize available literature, data, and analysis on the degree to which growth in variable renewable energy (VRE) has impacted or might in the future impact bulk power system assets, pricing, and costs in the United States. Most studies of future scenarios indicate that VRE reduces wholesale energy prices and capacity factors of thermal generators. Traditional baseload generators are more exposed to these changing market conditions than low-capital cost and more flexible intermediate and peak-load generators. From analysis of historical data we find that VRE is already influencing the bulk power market through changes in temporal and geographic patterns areas with higher levels of VRE. The most significant observed impacts have concentrated in areas with significant VRE and/or nuclear generation along with limited transmission, with negative pricing also often occurring during periods with lower system-wide load. So far, however, VRE, has had a relatively modest impact on historical average annual wholesale prices across entire market regions, at least in comparison to other drivers. The reduction of natural gas prices is the primary contributor to the decline in wholesale prices since 2008. Similarly, VRE impacts on thermal plant retirements have been limited and there is little relationship between the location of recent retirements and VRE penetration levels. Although impacts on wholesale prices have been modest so far, impacts of VRE on the electricity market will be more significant under higher VRE penetrations.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Advancing next generation nanolithography with infiltration synthesis of hybrid nanocomposite resists","Tiwale, Nikhil; Subramanian, Ashwanth; Kisslinger, Kim; Lu, Ming; Kim, Jiyoung; Stein, Aaron; Nam, Chang-Yong","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Organic–inorganic hybrid resists are emerging as an effective way of addressing stringent process requirements for aggressive down-scaling of semiconducting devices. Yet, hybrid resists generally require complex chemical synthesis while being predominantly negative-tone with high dose requirements. For positive-tone processes and high-aspect-ratio pattern transfers, resist choices are limited to costly, non-hybrid alternatives, whose etch resistance is still inferior compared with hybrid resists. In this work, we demonstrate a novel hybrid positive-tone resist platform utilizing simple ex situ vapor-phase inorganic infiltration into standard resist materials. A model system based on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film hybridized with aluminum oxide has been demonstrated for electron-beam lithography patterning, featuring a fully controllable critical exposure dose, contrast, and etch resistance. The hybrid resist not only achieves contrast as high as ~30, six-fold enhancement over standard PMMA, but also enables Si nanostructures with resolution down to ~30 nm and an aspect ratio as high as ~17, owing to enhancement of the Si etch selectivity to ~70, with an estimated achievable maximum of ~300, far exceeding known commercial positive-tone resist systems. The easy implementabilility, combined with versatile ex situ control of resist characteristics, makes this hybrid resist synthesis method uniquely suited for addressing the resist performance and high throughput required for advanced nanolithography techniques, such as extreme ultraviolet lithography, possibly.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The visible light response of WO<sub>3</sub> with a long hole diffusion length (~150 nm) and good electron mobility (~12 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) makes it suitable as the photoanode. Yet, WO<sub>3</sub> suffers from issues including rapid recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, photo-corrosion during the photocatalytic process due to the formation of peroxo-species, sluggish kinetics of photogenerated holes, and slow charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Our report highlights the approaches to overcome these drawbacks of WO<sub>3</sub> photoanodes, including: (i) the manipulation of nanostructured WO<sub>3</sub> photoanodes to decrease the nanoparticle size to promote hole migration to the WO<sub>3</sub>/electrolyte interface which benefits the charge separation; (ii) doping or introducing oxygen vacancies to improve electrical conductivity; exposing high energy crystal surfaces to promote the consumption of photogenerated holes on the high-active crystal face, thereby suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes; (iii) decorating with co-catalysts to reduce the overpotential which inhibits the formation of peroxo-species; (iv) other methods such as coupling with narrow band semiconductors to accelerate the charge separation and controlling the crystal phase via annealing to reduce defects.

To achieve high-performance and low-cost OER electrocatalysts, great effort has been devoted to the development of noble-metal-free OER nanocatalysts. While nanostructured materials have been shown effective at improving the catalytic activity, the stability of the nanocatalyst has yet to be significantly improved. Furthermore, nanocatalyst syntheses are typically complex, limiting their practical application. Herein, we design a noble-metal-free nanocatalyst which has a CoFeP<sub>x</sub> core and an in situ Fe coating layer to enhance the material’s catalytic activity and durability for OER. We utilize the vapor pressure difference of Fe and Co at high temperature to synthesize the CoFeP<sub>x</sub>-Fe core-shell nanoparticles via a one-step high-temperature shock technique. The high-temperature method strongly anchors the CoFeP<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles onto a carbon substrate. The thin Fe shell layer (~2 nm) coated on the CoFeP<sub>x</sub> greatly enhances the durability of the CoFeP<sub>x</sub> catalyst without hampering its activity due to the geometric effect. This nanocatalyst with an in situ Fe shell demonstrates a successful nanocoating approach for fabricating catalytically active protection layers on catalysts with improved activity and durability.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Economic analysis of a high-pressure urban pipeline concept (HyLine) for delivering hydrogen to retail fueling stations","Penev, Michael; Zuboy, Jarett; Hunter, Chad","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; hydrogen; pipeline; infrastructure; delivery; stations; refueling; HyLine; safety","Reducing the cost of delivering hydrogen to fueling stations and dispensing it into fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) is one critical element of efforts to increase the cost-competitiveness of FCEVs. Today, hydrogen is primarily delivered to stations by trucks. Pipeline delivery is much rarer: one urban U.S. station has been supplied with 800-psi hydrogen from an industrial hydrogen pipeline since 2011, and a German station on the edge of an industrial park has been supplied with 13,000-psi hydrogen from a pipeline since 2006. This article compares the economics of existing U.S. hydrogen delivery methods with the economics of a high-pressure, scalable, intra-city pipeline system referred to here as the 'HyLine' system. In the HyLine system, hydrogen would be produced at urban industrial or commercial sites, compressed to 15,000 psi, stored at centralized facilities, delivered via high-pressure pipeline to retail stations, and dispensed directly into FCEVs. Our analysis of retail fueling station economics in Los Angeles suggests that, as FCEV demand for hydrogen in an area becomes sufficiently dense, pipeline hydrogen delivery gains an economic advantage over truck delivery. The HyLine approach would also enable cheaper dispensed hydrogen compared with lower-pressure pipeline delivery owing to economies of scale associated with integrated compression and storage. In the largest-scale fueling scenario analyzed (a network of 24 stations with capacities of 1500 kg/d each, and hydrogen produced via steam methane reforming), HyLine could potentially achieve a profited hydrogen cost of 5.3/kg, which is approximately equivalent to a gasoline cost of 2.7/gal (assuming FCEVs offer twice the fuel economy of internal combustion engine vehicles and vehicle cost is competitive). It is important to note that significant effort would be required to develop technical knowledge, codes, and standards that would enable a HyLine system to be viable. However, our preliminary analysis suggests that the HyLine approach merits further consideration based on its potential economic advantages. These advantages could also include the value of minimizing retail space used by hydrogen compression and storage sited at fueling stations, which is not reflected in our analysis.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The approach is demonstrated using a hypothetical WDS and tested for pipe breakage and replacement scenarios using EPANET hydraulic simulations. First, the correlation between hydraulic resilience and economic consequence resilience was investigated to assess differences between two resilience measures for identifying pipe’s criticality for replacement. The results confirmed the two resilience measures exhibited differing responses (covariance = 0.2), suggesting that use of both would provide complementary insight. Results of the MPT analysis identified the benefits of balancing hydraulic and economic consequence resilience measures to yield lower risk.

Of particular focus are batteries with 4-h duration due to rules in several regions along with these batteries' potential to achieve life-cycle cost parity with combustion turbines compared to longer-duration batteries. However, whether 4-h energy storage can provide peak capacity depends largely on the shape of electricity demand. Under historical grid conditions, beyond about 28 GW nationally the ability of 4-h batteries to provide peak capacity begins to fall. We find that the addition of renewable generation can significantly increase storage's potential by changing the shape of net demand patterns; for example, beyond about 10% penetration of solar photovoltaics, the national practical potential for 4-h storage to provide peak capacity doubles. Furthermore, the impact of wind generation is less clear and likely requires more detailed study considering the exchange of wind power across multiple regions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A novel district control scheme is proposed for pursuing NZE on a subhourly basis while mitigating potential grid impacts such as power backfeeding and voltage violations. As a case study, Pena Station NEXT, a new 100-building, mixed-use district on a 1200-node distribution feeder in Denver, Colorado, is modeled in the integrated framework. An exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. Here, when trying to achieve annual NZE, the district incurs frequent operating violations, and achieving NZE on a 15-min basis is also limited by seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ~78% without significant violations.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessing wind power operating costs in the United States: Results from a survey of wind industry experts","Wiser, Ryan; Bolinger, Mark; Lantz, Eric J.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; wind power; operations; maintenance; levelized cost of energy; operational expenditures; learning curves","This paper draws on a survey of wind industry professionals to clarify trends in the operational expenditures (OpEx) of U.S. land-based wind power plants. We find that average all-in lifetime OpEx has declined from approximately $80/kW-yr (~$35/MWh) for projects built in the late 1990s to a level approaching $40/kW-yr (~$11/MWh) for projects built in 2018. Turbine operations and maintenance costs represent the single largest component of overall OpEx and the primary source of cost reductions. We observe wide ranges of OpEx over time; respondents cite a range in average expected costs for recently commissioned projects from $33/kW-yr to $59/kW-yr. We also use historical OpEx learning rates, showing a 9% OpEx reduction for each doubling of global wind capacity, to project a further $5-$8/kW-yr reduction from 2018 to 2040. These findings suggest that continued OpEx reductions may contribute 10% or more of the expected reductions in land-based wind's levelized cost of energy. Moreover, these estimates understate the importance of OpEx owing to the multiplicative effects through which operational advancements influence not only operations and maintenance costs but also component reliability, performance, and plant-level availability - thereby also affecting levelized costs by enhancing annual energy production and plant lifetimes. Given the limited quantity and comparability of previously available OpEx data, the trends reported here may inform OpEx assumptions used by electric planners, analysts, and modelers. The results may also provide useful benchmarks to the wind industry, helping developers and asset owners compare their expectations with historical experience and other industry projections.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Yet, typical electricity capacity expansion planning does not consider climate-water constraints. We project four alternative U.S. power system configurations using an iterative modeling and data exchange platform that integrates climate-driven hydrological, thermal power plant, and capacity expansion models. Through a comparison with traditional modeling approaches, we show that this novel approach provides greater confidence in electricity capacity projections by incorporating feasibility checks that adjust infrastructure development to reach grid reliability thresholds under climate-water constraints. Initial projections without climate-water impacts on electricity generation show future power systems become less vulnerable, independent of climate-water adaptation, as economic drivers increase renewable and natural gas-based capacity, while water-intensive coal and nuclear plants retire. However, power systems may face reliability challenges without climate-water adaptation, revealing the significance of incorporating climate-water impacts into power system planning. Climate-adjusted (Iterative approach) projections require a 5.3-12.0% increase in national-level capacity, relative to Initial projections, leading to an additional $125-143 billion (5.0-7.0%) in infrastructure costs. Variable renewable and natural gas technologies account for nearly all the additional capacity and, together with regional trade-offs in electricity generation, enhance grid performance to reach reliability thresholds. These adaptation transitions also lower water use and emissions, contributing to climate change mitigation, and highlight the trade-offs and impacts of both near and long-term electricity generation planning decisions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we report a new aspect of PEO in assisting the energy funneling in formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr<sub>3</sub>) thin films, leading to a very high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~62.1%. By mixing PEO with FAPbBr<sub>3</sub> at a desired ratio, self-assembled 3D polycrystals with sizes from ~20 to ~1500 nm were formed. The polycrystals contain inhomogeneous domains with a range of energetic excited states. Through fluorescence lifetime image microscopy, the <em>in situ</em> fluorescence emissions and the lifetimes of the domains were measured simultaneously, indicating energy funneling from the wide-bandgap domains (with small-size grains) into the narrow-bandgap domains (with large-size grains). PL spectroscopy on the nano-second scale was used to study the dynamics of charge transfer, which shows a reduced short-wavelength emission and narrowed full width at half maximum with increasing time. Our results also indicate that the optimal PEO doping ratio of 0.35 :1 can facilitate the most efficient charge carrier cascade for energy funneling. Furthermore, this study establishes the role of PEO-assisted energy funneling avoiding the defect-quenching effect in perovskites, for potential applications in perovskite LEDs and lasers.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We explicitly consider the sequential and yet inter-connected decision-making stages specific to on-demand service usage. The framework includes a hybrid choice model for service subscription, and three logit mixture models with inter-consumer heterogeneity for the service access, menu product choice and opt-out choice. Different models are connected by feeding logsums. The proposed modeling framework is essential for accounting the impacts of real-time on-demand system's dynamics on traveler behaviors and capturing consumer heterogeneity, thus being greatly relevant for integrations in multi-modal dynamic simulators. The methodology is applied to a case study of an innovative personalized on-demand real-time system which incentivizes travelers to select more sustainable travel options. The data for model estimation is collected through a smartphone-based context-aware stated preference survey. Through model estimation, lower values of time are observed when the respondents opt to use the reward system. The perception of incentives and schedule delay by different population segments are quantified. These results are fundamental in setting the ground for different behavioral scenarios of such a new on-demand system. Here, the proposed methodology is flexible to be applied to model other on-demand mobility services such as ride-hailing services and the emerging mobility as a service.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Based on oil taxation and pricing mechanisms in China, this study establishes the statistical relationship between the retailed gasoline prices in China and international crude oil prices using error correction models (ECM), time-series models. Detailed comparison among asymmetric ECM, threshold ECM, and threshold asymmetric ECM are provided. By adopting the ECMs, the study projects the retailed gasoline prices from 2019 to 2050 based on the international crude oil prices from the Annual Energy Outlook provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The results show that the asymmetric responsiveness and the threshold effect exist under current Chinese oil pricing policy with a lag of one month or even shorter in gasoline price adjustment. Moreover, the analysis informs one that, in the short-run, the retailed gasoline prices in China are more sensitive to international crude oil price increases; while in the long-run, the retailed gasoline prices are more sensitive to international crude oil price decreases. Compared with the national average gasoline price in China of 6.04 CNY/Liter in 2017, the national average gasoline price in China is projected to be about 7.64 CNY/Liter (2017 dollar) by 2050.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

While the technologies and fuels that will move people and goods in the future remain uncertain, the future transportation system will be more integrated with smart buildings, the electric grid, renewables, and information ecosystems, allowing for great opportunities to exploit these interconnections. Modeling tools for analyzing integrated mobility-energy systems require a deep understanding of these interconnections, of the infrastructure required to support alternative fuel vehicles, and a more nuanced understanding of transportation energy needs across multiple segments and spatiotemporal scales. In this paper, we assess the landscape of existing tools used to represent and model future mobility systems and their interactions with other energy systems. Here, we conclude that (a) out-of-sample extrapolation of emerging trends and future anticipated developments is more important than ever due to the plethora of factors driving disruptive change in mobility systems; (b) understanding adoption opportunities for alternative fuel light-duty vehicles requires modeling intra-household decisions affecting travel demand and mode choice; (c) mobility and energy systems need to be modeled as an integrated continuum, breaking the traditional approach in which dynamic energy supply models use relatively simple transportation demand and vice-versa; and (d) increased spatiotemporal fidelity and scalability are required to dynamically couple transportation/mobility and energy supply models and capitalize on these unprecedented interconnection opportunities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive study to assess energy savings and peak power reductions of condenser evaporative cooling. Condenser evaporative cooling leads to a lower temperature of the air entering the condenser of a rooftop unit, which results in smaller compressor power consumption. Utilizing EnergyPlus building energy simulations, we mapped the impacts on energy savings and energy reductions at peak ambient temperatures in three building types and 16 locations with levels of pad effectiveness and demonstrated the effects on air conditioner using either R22 or R410A as refrigerants. Economics and control strategy to maximize the cost saving were also investigated. The conclusions demonstrate that energy savings are much greater for HVAC systems with the refrigerant R410A than they are with R22, and evaporative pre-cooling provides the opportunity for annual energy savings and peak demand reductions, with significant potential in hot, dry climates. Additionally, we validated an improved mathematical model for estimating the condenser pre-cooling wet bulb efficiency which shows clear advantage over the current EnergyPlus model.</p>","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Although capacity investment requires time horizons over years and decades, planners need to also consider shorter-term conditions of high stress such as sudden changes in fuel prices and demand to maintain reliability of power supply during all times. Consequently, long-term models used to inform planning therefore need to account for the impacts of sub-annual load variation along with the co-evolution of the power sector with other sectors of the economy. We incorporate sub-annual investment and operation dynamics in the power sector module of a long-term multisector model with state-level detail in the U.S. (GCAM-USA) to better reflect operational flexibility in the power sector in response to various stressors. For example, we demonstrate the ability of dispatchable technologies (e.g. coal and gas) to increase generation in response to increasing demands for electricity without increasing capacity at the same rate. We also demonstrate that the impacts of an important stressor, namely, natural gas price variation on power-sector investment and operation are heterogeneous across states and depend on the character of state-level fuel mixes.

"Using a coupled agent-based modeling approach to analyze the role of risk perception in water management decisions","Hyun, Jin-Young (ORCID:0000000215550481); Huang, Shih-Yu (ORCID:000000026165349X); Yang, Yi-Chen Ethan (ORCID:0000000279827988); Tidwell, Vincent; Macknick, Jordan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 42 ENGINEERING; 58 GEOSCIENCES; water resources; agent-based model; RiverWare","<p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Managing water resources in a complex adaptive natural–human system is a challenge due to the difficulty of modeling human behavior under uncertain risk perception. The interaction between human-engineered systems and natural processes needs to be modeled explicitly with an approach that can quantify the influence of incomplete/ambiguous information on decision-making processes. In this study, we two-way coupled an agent-based model (ABM) with a river-routing and reservoir management model (RiverWare) to address this challenge. The human decision-making processes is described in the ABM using Bayesian inference (BI) mapping joined with a cost–loss (CL) model (BC-ABM). Incorporating BI mapping into an ABM allows an agent's psychological thinking process to be specified by a cognitive map between decisions and relevant preceding factors that could affect decision-making. A risk perception parameter is used in the BI mapping to represent an agent's belief on the preceding factors. Integration of the CL model addresses an agent's behavior caused by changing socioeconomic conditions. We use the San Juan River basin in New Mexico, USA, to demonstrate the utility of this method. The calibrated BC-ABM–RiverWare model is shown to capture the dynamics of historical irrigated area and streamflow changes. The results suggest that the proposed BC-ABM framework provides an improved representation of human decision-making processes compared to conventional rule-based ABMs that do not take risk perception into account. Future studies will focus on modifying the BI mapping to consider direct agents' interactions, up-front cost of agent's decision, and upscaling the watershed ABM to the regional scale.</p></p>","European Geosciences Union (EGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In these studies, it is important to understand the flexibility of the thermal power fleet, including how thermal plants operate at part load. Without a comprehensive understanding of thermal plant operation, we may over- or underestimate our ability to integrate variable generation resources and thus draw incomplete or inaccurate conclusions regarding their potential economic and environmental effects. The only public data source for understanding many elements of the operational characteristics of the thermal fleet is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Markets database of historical power plant operation. However, though these data sets have been widely utilized, their use has proven to be difficult, and methods to clean and filter the data are not transparent. Here, we describe the database and a method to clean and filter it. We then use the cleaned database to demonstrate several characteristics of historical plant operation, including frequent part load operation. Finally, we provide a cleaned data set with heat rate curves and describe how to use it in general modeling activities and analysis.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In each iteration, the house energy management system (HEMS) installed in each house minimises its electricity costs and the costs associated with the discomfort of customers due to deviations in indoor temperature from customers’ set points. At the community level, the microgrid central controller (MCC) schedules the distributed energy resources (DERs) and energy storage based on the received load profiles from customers and the forecast energy price at the point of common coupling. The MCC updates the energy price for each phase based on the amount of unbalanced power between generation and consumption. The updated energy price and unbalanced power for each phase are distributed to the HEMSs on corresponding phases. When the optimisation converges, the unbalanced power of each phase is close to zero. Meanwhile, the schedules of DERs, energy storage systems and the energy consumption of each house are determined by the MCC and HEMSs, separately. Specifically, the phase balancing and peak shaving are considered in the proposed distributed energy management model. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed energy management has been illustrated by case studies.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs. Overall, the analysis illustrates the importance of considering electricity market impacts in assessing the economic efficiency of VRE and carbon incentive mechanisms.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Scenarios produced by different models contain inconsistencies due to disparate model structures and assumptions. Although inconsistencies can characterize structural uncertainties, they could have important consequences in various contexts such as multi-sector energy-water-land studies that couple multiple models. In such studies, it is important for models with overlapping scope (models having different sectoral, regional, temporal, and process details but producing scenarios for some common output variable(s)) to produce consistent scenarios of common output variable(s) to minimize propagation of inconsistent information. Using the example of baseline electricity capacity expansion scenarios produced by two models with overlapping scope, we explore cross-model scenario consistency (extent to which projections for a common scenario variable(s) diverge). We define a quantitative metric of consistency and examine the sensitivity of consistency of the models' electricity generation by technology outputs to changes in harmonization of assumptions surrounding the representations of key capacity expansion drivers such as fuel prices, renewable resources, demand, and retirements. Our study establishes a framework to systematically examine scenario consistency. In addition, our study utilizes complementary features of well-established models to produce consistent baseline electricity capacity expansion scenarios which can then be used in multi-sector studies.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Risk Inequality and the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus: A Study of 43 City Adaptation Plans","Romero-Lankao, Patricia; Gnatz, Daniel","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; inequality; FEW nexus; urban adaptation; discourse analysis; meta-analysis; urban climate governance","Goals aimed at adapting to climate change in sustainable and just ways are embedded in global agreements such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda. However, largely unexamined, are the ways that narrative understandings conveyed in adaptation plans consider and attempt to address inequality in climate risk to urban populations and FEW-systems. In this paper, we examine whether and how adaptation plans from C40 member cities address inequality in risk, by planning actions to reduce hazard exposure or tackling the drivers of social vulnerability. C40 is a network of 94 of the world's cities fostering policies to address climate change. We apply a mixed methods approach, including a discourse analysis and meta-analysis of adaptation plans. The discourse analysis helps to unpack framings of urban equity issues as they relate to policy actions, and the meta-analysis seeks to quantitatively investigate patterns of framing and policy across adaptation plans. Our findings suggest that FEW-nexus thinking is not yet embedded in narrative understandings of risk and planned adaptation actions, within the adaptation plans we studied. In the city adaptation plans we analyzed, we found multiple frames coexisting behind the broader adaptation visions (e.g., risk and resilience). Rather than converging, issues, and principles such as those of equality, coexist with economic issues in an imbalance of incongruent political movements and priorities. Techno-infrastructural and economic investments and concerns tend to take precedence over concerns and interests for inequality in climate risks. We discuss some of the institutional factors explaining this. Knowledge integration, for instance, is constrained by the existence of a plurality of sectors, levels of government, power, values, and ways of understanding and managing climate risk. We also suggest that the relatively low importance of equality considerations in the adaptation plans will likely limit the capacity of cities to support broader goals such as those of the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Variable renewable energy now dominates total investment in electricity power generation systems. This dominance of variable renewable energy in investment has thrust the systems integration task of matching electricity supply with demand to center stage, presenting new challenges for energy policy and planning as well as for the institutional organization of power systems. Despite these challenges, there is ample reason to believe that variable renewables will attain very high levels of penetration into energy systems, particularly in regions well endowed with solar and wind potential.

Many power plants in the United States will need to be replaced in the coming decades, so opportunities for renewable energy development are imminent. Although numerous cities have committed to sourcing 100% of their electricity needs from renewables, those cities represent a very small portion of cities across the United States. Due to their high energy consumption, cities have environmental impacts in areas far from their centre but are often unaware of these impacts and are thus unmotivated to undergo a transition to more sustainable energy sources. Herein we present a spatial framework for matching the supply of energy to demand across the electricity grid that allows for allocation of city energysheds. A city energyshed comprises the network of power plants that supply a given city and the amount of energy drawn from each plant. As a result, the power plant–city links revealed by energysheds allow for estimations of a city’s energy mix and environmental footprint from electricity consumption, and provide urban areas with insights into their energy sources that can catalyse renewable energy penetration for cities seeking to expand their renewable portfolio.","Springer Nature","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Current panel data analysis and local scale modeling are limited in projecting global urban area growth with large spatial heterogeneities. In this study, we developed country-specific urban area growth models using the time series data set of global urban extents (1992–2013) and projected the future growth of urban areas under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Our results indicate the global urban area would increase roughly 40–67% under five SSPs until 2050 relative to the base year of 2013, and this trend would continue to a growth ratio of more than 200% by 2100. The growth of urban areas under relatively unsustainable development pathways (e.g., regional rivalry SSP3 and inequality SSP4) is smaller compared to other SSPs. Although developing countries would remain as leading contributors to the increase of global urban areas in the future, they may exhibit different temporal patterns, that is, plateaued or monotonically increasing trends. This variation is primarily attributed to the compounding effect of the growth in population and gross domestic product. Our urban area data set presents a first country-level urban area projection under the five SSPs, spanning from 2013 to 2100. This data set has a great potential to support various global change studies, for example, urban sprawl simulation, integrated assessment modeling for sustainable development goals, and investigation of the impact of urbanization on atmospheric emissions, air quality, and human health.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper proposes a cumulative prospect theory (CPT) based modeling framework to describe the charging behavior of BEV drivers. CPT captures an individual’s attitude and preference toward risk in the decision-making process. A BEV mass-market scenario is constructed using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. This work applies the CPT-based charging behavior model to study the battery state-of-charge (SOC) when drivers decide to charge their vehicles, charging timing and location choices, and charging power demand profile under the mass-market scenario. In addition, sensitivity analyses are used to examine the drivers’ risk attitudes and public charger network coverage. BEV drivers who reflect a higher degree of risk-seeking tend to charge vehicles at a lower SOC. Some home charging shifts to workplace and public charging as the public charger network expands, but home charging still plays the most significant role in BEV use. The power demand from public chargers increases critically with BEV expansion and has a larger impact on the power grid. The time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate can shift peak power demand to off-peak periods from midnight to early morning.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e., IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Accelerating Photovoltaic Market Entry with Module Replacement","Jean, Joel; Woodhouse, Michael A; Bulovic, Vladimir","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; photovoltaics; reliability; LCOE","Today's approach to deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) implicitly assumes that module technology is fixed. Solar panels are installed and expected to operate for the system life of 30 years or more. However, many PV technologies are improving rapidly along several dimensions, including cost, power conversion efficiency, and reliability. Periodic module replacement or planned repowering takes advantage of this technological improvement and counteracts predictable degradation. Here, we show that a module replacement strategy allows a competitive levelized cost of electricity to be achieved with an initial module lifetime of less than 15 years, assuming backward compatibility with the original system design. We also assess the life-cycle environmental impacts of module replacement and find that all commercial PV technologies offer benefits in the majority of impact categories, regardless of the replacement strategy, compared to today's electric generation mix.

"Regulating TNCs: Should Uber and Lyft set their own rules?","Li, Sen; Tavafoghi, Hamidreza; Poolla, Kameshwar; Varaiya, Pravin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; TNC; Wage floor; Ride-haling tax; Regulatory policy","We evaluate the impact of three proposed regulations of transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber, Lyft and Didi: (1) A minimum wage for drivers, (2) a cap on the number of drivers or vehicles, and (3) a per-trip congestion tax. The impact is assessed using a queuing theoretic equilibrium model which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing matching platform, the ride prices and driver wages established by the platform, and the incentives of passengers and drivers. We show that a floor placed under driver earnings can push the ride-hailing platform to hire more drivers and offer more rides, at the same time that passengers enjoy faster rides and lower total cost, while platform rents are reduced. Contrary to standard competitive labor market theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both drivers and passengers, and promotes the efficiency of the entire system. This surprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because the wage floor curbs TNC labor market power. In contrast to a wage floor, imposing a cap on the number of vehicles hurts drivers, because the platform reaps all the benefits of limiting supply. The congestion tax has the expected impact: fares increase, wages and platform revenue decrease. Here, we also construct variants of the model to briefly discuss platform subsidy, platform competition, and autonomous vehicles.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Forecasting Indonesia's electricity load through 2030 and peak demand reductions from appliance and lighting efficiency","McNeil, Michael A.; Karali, Nihan; Letschert, Virginie","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Energy efficiency; Indonesia; Lighting; Appliances; Electricity demand forecasting; Peak load","Indonesia's electricity necessity is growing rapidly, driven by robust economic growth combined with unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. Energy-efficiency improvements could reduce the country's electricity demand, thus providing monetary savings, greenhouse gas and other pollutant reductions, and improved energy security. Above all else, using energy efficiency to lower peak electricity demand could reduce the risk of economically damaging power shortages while freeing up funds that would otherwise be used for power plant construction. We use a novel bottom-up modeling approach to analyze the potential of energy efficiency to reduce Indonesia's electricity demand: the LOAD curve Model (LOADM) combines total national electricity demand for each end use—as modeled by the Bottom-Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS)—with hourly end-use demand profiles. We find that Indonesia's peak demand may triple between 2010 and 2030 in a business-as-usual case, to 77.3 GW, primarily driven by air conditioning and with important contributions from lighting and refrigerators. However, we also show that appliance and lighting efficiency improvements could hold the peak demand increase to a factor of two, which would avoid 26.5 GW of peak demand in 2030. These results suggest that well-understood programs, such as minimum efficiency performance standards, could save Indonesia tens of billions of dollars in capital costs over the next decade and a half.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Yet, the range of dopant types and concentrations remains limited for many metal-oxide hosts, largely because of the difficulty in establishing reaction kinetics that favors dopant incorporation by using the co-thermolysis method. Here we develop cation-exchange reactions to introduce p-type dopants (Cu<sup>+</sup>, Ag<sup>+</sup>, etc.) into n-type metal-oxide nanocrystals, producing programmable LSPR redshifts due to dopant compensation. We further demonstrate that enhanced n-type doping can be realized via sequential cation-exchange reactions mediated by the Cu<sup>+</sup> ions. Cation-exchange transformations add a new dimension to the design of plasmonic nanocrystals, allowing preformed nanocrystals to be used as templates to create compositionally diverse nanocrystals with well-defined LSPR characteristics. The ability to tailor the doping profile postsynthetically opens the door to a multitude of opportunities to deepen our understanding of the relationship between local structure and LSPR properties.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Spatial heterogeneity might arise for several reasons. For example, landowners closer to bioenergy processing plants might be more likely to be willing to supply bioenergy crops, and landowners who are more willing to supply bioenergy crops may be spatially clustered because they share similar land attributes, demographics, experiences, and/or values. Using high–resolution GIS data related to the location of pellet plants utilizing bioenergy crops and survey data related to landowners’ characteristics including spatial location, we estimate a spatial probit model to explain the variation in individual–specific reservation prices (RPs)—the feedstock price at which landowners become willing to supply a bioenergy crop. We find that respondents’ RP is lower the closer they live to their nearest pellet plant and spatial dependency is only present for switchgrass supply. We also identify three economic hotspots (areas with high potential supply and low RPs) for each bioenergy crop. We believe that bioenergy supply chains could be developed around these hotspots.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Using a suite of economic models, this study estimates prices of four WTE resources: food waste; fats, oils, and greases (FOG); animal manure; and sewage sludge. Some of these materials are commoditized (e.g. FOG) thus their price is determined by market demand. For the materials regarded as waste, the study relates price to the avoided cost of disposal through waste management alternatives such as landfilling. This study finds that significant amounts of these feedstocks could be available at negative prices, meaning that a potential bioenergy facility could receive these materials for free or be paid to accept them in some locations. It is estimated that about 61% of sewage sludge, 27% of manure, and 7% of food waste may be available at negative prices. These negative price feedstocks are not uniformly distributed and are most likely to occur in areas with organic waste disposal bans, high population densities, and high landfill tipping fees. This study intends to open an initial discussion into how stakeholders view and value these materials, and how this view is evolving as their potential as WTE feedstocks is realized.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using detailed data on approximately 1.5 million individual rides provided by RideAustin in Austin Texas, we quantify the additional miles TNC drivers travel: before beginning and after ending their shifts, to reach a passenger once a ride has been requested, and between consecutive rides (all of which is referred to as deadheading); and the relative fuel efficiency of the vehicles that RideAustin drivers use compared to the average vehicle registered in Austin. We conservatively estimate that TNC drivers commute to and from their service areas accounts for 19% of the total ridesourcing VMT. In addition, we estimate that TNC drivers drove 55% more miles between ride requests within 60 min of each other, accounting for 26% of total ridesourcing VMT. Vehicles used for ridesourcing are on average two miles per gallon more fuel efficient than comparable light-duty vehicles registered in Austin, with twice as many are hybrid-electric vehicles. New generation battery electric vehicles with 200 miles of range would be able to fulfill 90% of full-time drivers' shifts on a single charge. We estimate that the net effect of ridesourcing on energy use is a 41-90% increase compared to baseline, pre-TNC, personal travel.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Availability Assessment Based Case-Sensitive Power System Restoration Strategy","Liu, Weijia; Zhan, Junpeng; Chung, C. Y.; Sun, Lei","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY","Increasingly frequent severe weather events in recent years threaten the security of power systems and result in major power outages throughout the world. The development of reasonable power system restoration (PSR) solutions is therefore urgently needed to speed up the recovery of the power supply while at the same time steering clear of vulnerable and risky equipment. This paper aims to develop a case-sensitive PSR model for power transmission systems that can adjust restoration solutions according to the evaluated availability of outage equipment in specific blackout scenarios and weather conditions. A novel PSR model that integrates the startup of generating units, formulation of the restoration network, renewable energy sources, and availability assessment of devices is proposed. A reformulated model is also proposed to relieve the computational burden of complex PSR problems. The availability of outage equipment is comprehensively assessed based on historical operating records, fault diagnosis results, and weather conditions. The assessed availability results are sensitive to the characteristics of real blackout cases and will support system operators generate case-sensitive PSR solutions while mitigating the vulnerable equipment. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed PSR model and its reformulations are verified through case studies.","IEEE","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Results from this work estimate that in U.S. single-family households with income less than 200% of the federal poverty level, energy efficiency packages tailored to maximize net present value could result in an estimated $13 billion per year in energy cost savings, or $670 per year for an average household, corresponding to about 1 EJ (0.9 quads) of annual primary energy savings. These types of metrics can be estimated for other geographies (regions, states, and counties) and for other ranges of household income. These results can be used by policymakers and program designers to improve the cost-effectiveness of income-qualified programs and to improve the equity of non-income-qualified programs. The results can also be used to understand how energy efficiency opportunities differ between urban and rural areas, as well as how energy efficiency can spur economic development in areas that have had high poverty rates for decades.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

FCETs use a battery combined with onboard hydrogen storage for energy storage. The additional battery provides regenerative braking and better fuel economy, but it will also increase the initial cost of the vehicle. Heavier reliance on stored hydrogen might be cheaper initially, but operational costs will be higher because hydrogen is more expensive than electricity. Achieving the right tradeoff between these power and energy choices is necessary to reduce the ownership cost of the vehicle. This paper develops an optimum component sizing algorithm for FCETs. The truck vehicle model was developed in Autonomie, a platform for modelling vehicle energy consumption and performance. The algorithm optimizes component sizes to minimize overall ownership cost, while ensuring that the FCET matches or exceeds the performance and cargo capacity of a conventional vehicle. Class 4 delivery truck and class 8 linehaul trucks are shown as examples. We estimate the ownership cost for various hydrogen costs, powertrain components, ownership periods, and annual vehicle miles travelled.","MDPI AG","","Argonne National Lab.

For plug-in electric vehicles, direct-current fast charging (DCFC) is proposed as a solution to support long-distance travel and relieve range anxiety. However, DCFC has also been shown to be potentially more expensive compared to residential or workplace charging. In particular, electricity demand charges can significantly impact electricity cost for fast charging applications. Here we explore technological solutions that can help reduce the electricity cost for electric vehicle fast charging. In particular, we consider thousands of electricity rates available in the United States and real-world vehicle charging load scenarios to assess opportunities to reduce the cost of DCFC by deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) panels and energy storage (battery), and implementing a co-location configuration where a DCFC station is connected to an existing meter within a commercial building. Results show that while the median electricity cost across more than 7000 commercial retail rates remains less than $0.20/kWh for all charging load scenarios considered, cost varies greatly, and some locations do experience significantly higher electricity cost. Co-location is almost always economically viable to mitigate fixed cost and demand charges, but the relative benefit of co-locating diminishes as station size and utilization increase. Energy storage alone can help mitigate demand charges and is more effective at reducing costs for “peaky” or low-utilization loads. On the other hand, PV systems primarily help mitigate energy charges, and are more effective for loads that are more correlated with solar production, even in areas with lower solar resource. PV and energy storage can deploy synergistically to provide cost reductions for DCFC, leveraging their ability to mitigate demand and energy charges.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Air leakage in commercial buildings in the U.S. accounts for about one quad (one quadrillion Btu) of energy annually, costing approximately $10 billion. As the thermal resistance of commercial building enclosures continues to improve, the relative contribution of air leakage to heating and cooling loads is increasing. A wide variety of air barrier technologies and construction practices to reduce the air leakage in buildings are available to the architect and designer. To promote more energy-efficient and durable building enclosure design, advances in easy-to-use tools for determining the impact of air leakage are needed. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the Air Barrier Association of America (ABAA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) partnered to develop an online calculator that estimates the potential energy, cost savings (due to energy use reduction), and moisture transport due to improvements in airtightness. The calculator estimates the energy and cost savings potential based on the pre-and post-retrofit air leakage rates for prototype commercial buildings. The tool does not include the energy and hygrothermal impacts of air intrusion or air that flows into and out of the building enclosure from the same side. This article reports on the development of the Energy Savings and Moisture Transfer Calculator. This online tool aims to fill this void, is based on the best science available, and is easy to use.","International Institute of Building Enclosure Consultants","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Providing the Spark: Impact of Financial Incentives on Battery Electric Vehicle Adoption","Clinton, Bentley C.; Steinberg, Daniel C","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; electric vehicles; tax incentives; rebates; technology adoption","To overcome adoption barriers and promote battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as an energy efficient consumer transportation option, a number of states offer subsidies to consumers for BEVs. We use a national data set of vehicle registrations and state-level financial incentives to assess the impact of vehicle purchase subsidies on adoption using both difference-in-differences and synthetic controls methods. We find that incentives offered as direct purchase rebates generate increased levels of new BEV registrations at a rate of approximately 8 percent per thousand dollars of incentive offered. Between 2011 and 2015, vehicle rebate incentives are associated with an increase in overall BEV registrations of approximately 11 percent. Our findings indicate incentives offered as state income tax credits do not have a statistically significant effect on BEV adoptions, though we caution this may be a result of limited temporal variation in BEV incentives across our sample. Responses to rebate incentives do not differ significantly by the make of the vehicle purchased (i.e., Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles). We combine our results with recent assessments of marginal environmental costs of electric vehicle charging and measure net welfare effects of BEV subsidy programs. Our analysis indicates these programs are not welfare-improving if only considering benefits associated with avoided emissions. Additional benefits associated with long-term market growth, production cost savings, network externalities, or accelerated innovation could substantially impact the net welfare outcomes.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effect of Heavy-Truck Platooning Fuel-Efficiency Gains on Overall Fuel Efficiency","Franzese, Oscar; Lascurain, Mary Beth; Loy, Luke W.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Heavy-Truck Platooning; Fuel-Efficiency Gains; Annual Cost Savings; Real-World Data","Many studies addressing the fuel-efficiency gains derived from heavy-truck platooning operations have shown that it is possible to achieve increases in fuel efficiency of 10% or more. These studies focus only on the gains realized while traveling under platooning conditions (i.e., highway speeds sustained for sizable intervals of time). However, heavy-truck long-haul operations involve many other travel conditions that fall outside platooning-travel conditions. In this paper, we study the effect of platooning fuel-efficiency gains on the fuel efficiency of the overall operation. The authors used real-world data collected by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for a U.S. Department of Energy study to determine the percentage of distance traveled that is “platoonable.” Lastly, with this and the fuel consumption information collected in the study, the fuel-efficiency gain for the entire operation was computed, as well as annual fuel cost savings.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Addressing the soft cost challenge in U.S. small-scale solar PV system pricing","OShaughnessy, Eric J; Nemet, Gregory F.; Pless, Jacquelyn; Margolis, Robert M.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar; soft costs; market design; price drivers","Solar photovoltaic (PV) prices have fallen significantly over the past two decades. These price reductions have relied primarily on falling system hardware costs. Future reductions in PV prices - which are needed to ensure that enough PV will be deployed to meet global clean energy objectives - will require reductions in non-hardware or 'soft' costs, particularly in markets with relatively high soft costs such as the United States. In this article, we draw insights from the literature on which factors affect soft costs for small-scale PV systems in the United States. The literature shows that soft costs tend to be lower for systems that are larger, installed during new construction, installed by more experienced installers, installed in more concentrated markets and in more competitive markets, installed in markets where customers receive more quotes, or installed in markets with less onerous permitting requirements. We identify three marketplace design strategies that policymakers could pursue to address the soft cost challenge in the United States and similar markets: encourage the expansion of quote platforms; encourage or require that PV system installation be integrated into the new construction and roof replacement process; and encourage the expansion of customer aggregation models such as Solarize campaigns and community solar.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Incorporating machine learning with building network analysis to predict multi-building energy use","Xu, Xiaodong; Wang, Wei; Hong, Tianzhen; Chen, Jiayu","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Predicting multi-building energy use at campus or city district scale has recently gained more attention; and more researchers have started to define reference buildings and study inter-impact between building groups. However, how to integrate the relationship to define reference buildings and predict multi-building energy use, using significantly less amount of building data and reducing complexity of prediction models, remains an open research question. To resolve this, this study proposed a novel method to predict multi-building energy use by integrating a social network analysis (SNA) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique. The SNA method was used to establish a building network (BN) by identifying reference buildings and determine correlations between reference buildings and non-reference buildings. The ANN technique was applied to learn correlations and historical building energy use, and then used to predict multi-building energy use. To validate the SNA-ANN method, 17 buildings in the Southeast University campus, located in Nanjing, China, were studied. These buildings have three years of actual monthly electricity use data and were grouped into four types: office, educational, laboratory, and residential. The results showed the integrated SNA-ANN method achieved average prediction accuracies of 90.67% for the office group, 90.79% for the educational group, 92.34% for the laboratory group, and 83.32% for the residential group. The results demonstrated the proposed SNA-ANN method achieved an accuracy of 90.28% for the predicted energy use for all building groups. Finally, this study provides insights into advancing the interdisciplinary research on multi-building energy use prediction.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, there is typically little if any coordination between the district developers and the local utility. Most attention is paid to the district's annual net load and generation without considering their instantaneous imbalance or the connecting network's state. This presents an opportunity to learn lessons from the design of distribution feeders for districts characterized by low loads and high penetrations of DERs that can be applied to the distribution grid at large. The aim of this overview is to summarize current practices in sustainable district planning as well as advances in modeling and design tools for incorporating the power distribution system into the district planning process. Recent developments in the modeling and optimization of district power systems, including their coordination with multi-energy systems and the impact of high penetration levels of renewable energy, are introduced. Sustainable districts in England and Japan are reviewed as case studies to illustrate the extent to which distribution system planning has been considered in practice. Finally, newly developed building-to-grid modeling tools that can facilitate coordinated district and power system design with utility involvement are introduced, along with suggestions for future research directions.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The introduced technology, GLIDES, which was invented at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), stores energy by compression and expansion of air using water as a liquid piston inside high-pressure reservoirs. GLIDES is introduced by combining Pumped Hydroelectric Storage (PHS) and Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) technologies. By replacing inefficient gas compressor and turbine with higher efficiency liquid turbomachines for liquid-piston compression/expansion, GLIDES achieves higher roundtrip efficiency than other gas compression-based energy storage technologies and is a scalable energy storage system. For cost reduction purposes, various pressure reservoirs including steel vessels, carbon fiber vessels, pipe segments, and underground pressure reservoirs are analyzed in this paper. Based on the analyzed data using the models discussed in this paper, energy storage costs as low as ~$14/kWh and ~$346/kWh (roundtrip efficiency (RTE) ~80%) can be achieved for a grid-scale GLIDES using depleted oil/gas reservoirs and high-pressure pipe segments respectively.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Building energy consumption is affected by what is inside the building (such as occupants, appliances, HVAC systems, etc.) and by what is outside: the weather conditions the building is exposed to. However, freely available weather data files are limited to a number of specific locations, usually airports, which are often located away from city centers where buildings are concentrated. The authors have developed a new tool that supports the investigation and quantification of micro-climate conditions on building energy consumption. LAF is built on the Python open-source programming language and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to create custom weather data files for building energy simulations. Many sets of actual meteorological year weather data for long time periods are publicly available online (such as the MesoWest database) for thousands of locations in the US. LAF selects weather data according to user specifications and automatically processes it through an API across multiple weather stations and multiple time periods. The user may easily select a specific location, time frame, and time step that best meets their needs.

The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth—as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, we apply the modeling framework to investigate the impact of high penetration levels of variable renewable energy resources and different market designs on achieving resource adequacy. The model captures the strategic capacity investment and retirement decision-making of profit-maximizing generation companies. In contrast to many previous studies, this paper considers markets for capacity, energy, and reserve products in detail; thus, the modeling framework allows improved analysis of generation expansion and revenue sufficiency in a competitive market environment. The modeling framework is based on Stackelberg leader-follower games and is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which is then transformed into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. Furthermore, we employ a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm to enhance computational performance.

Here, an effective strategy that can tailor Fe-N-C catalysts to simultaneously enrich the number of active sites while boost their intrinsic activity and utilization is reported. This is achieved by edge engineering of FeN<sub>4</sub> sites via a simple ammonium chloride salt-assisted approach, where a high fraction of FeN<sub>4</sub> sites are preferentially generated and hosted in a graphene-like porous scaffold. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the FeN<sub>4</sub> moieties with adjacent pore defects are likely to be more active than the non-defective configuration. Coupled with the facilitated accessibility of active sites, this prepared catalyst when applied in a practical H<sub>2</sub>-air proton exchange membrane fuel cell delivers a remarkable peak power density of 0.43 W cm<sup>-2</sup>, ranking it as one of the most active M-N-C catalysts reported to date.

As a result, India currently contributes less than one-quarter of the amount of China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, India's forecasted economic growth suggests that those emissions will almost quadruple, with much of this rise coming from the industry sector. Whole-economy scenarios for limiting global warming suggest that direct CO2 emissions should decrease significantly, but leave unanswered the question of how this can be achieved by real-world policies. This study describes a bottom-up model that can be used to assess the impacts of emissions mitigation policies and the linkages between the physical drivers and energy growth of India's key industries. It focuses on capturing the main physical drivers of this growth, to identify and prioritize the subsectors to address and develop sustainable, low carbon pathways to support economic growth. This analysis shows that India can achieve its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) while achieving substantial economic growth using its currently planned policies. The study describes in detail the methodology and underlying assumptions that are needed by policy makers to inform targeted policy interventions and provide a baseline scenario in the case of no major new technology breakthroughs and no new adopted policies.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Environmentally significant shifts in trace element emissions from coal plants complying with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments","Gingerich, Daniel B.; Zhao, Yifan; Mauter, Meagan S.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Coal-fired power plants; Trace elements; Clean air act amendments; Effluent limitation guidelines and standards; Environmental regulations","The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAAs) reduced criteria air pollution from coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the United States, but compliance strategies additionally altered the magnitude and phase of environmentally significant trace element emissions. This report quantitatively assesses changes in trace element emissions stemming from CAAAs compliance, attributes these changes to specific CAAAs compliance strategies, and discusses implications for future environmental regulatory design. We combine plant-level coal purchase and installed air pollution control device data with a trace element partitioning model to approximate changes in trace element mass entering and exiting CFPPs in the solid, liquid, and gas phase between 1993 and 2017. Though US coal combustion decreased by 2% during this period, the vast majority of trace element emissions reductions stem from the 18-64% reductions in the fleet-wide average concentrations of arsenic, bromine, chloride, lead, mercury, and selenium in the combusted coal. Combined with the installation of air pollution control technologies, these shifts concluded in nationwide reductions of gas phase trace element emissions by between 49 and 68% for the elements included in this study. In contrast, installation of flue gas desulfurization devices increased the mass of trace elements discharged in wastewater. This work reinforces the value of multi-phase emissions regulations in ensuring that contaminants are not shunted from regulated to unregulated phases.","Elsevier","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Policy; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1206-1215","","","FE0031646","Journal ID: ISSN 0301-4215","10.1016/j.enpol.2019.07.003","","2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","1545308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1545308","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1545308","Energy Policy","C","132"

Although renewable electricity remains the focus, considerable investment has supported construction of coal liquefaction and coal gasification facilities in the desert steppes of north-central China, new coal mines in arid Inner Mongolia, and tight oil and gas extraction in the Ordos to supplement limited domestic supplies of oil and gas. At the same time, China is also facing severe drought and water scarcity in these same regions and in response has expanded various water supply technologies such as desalination and wastewater treatment. Recent government goals and measures for reducing energy and water consumption and increasing efficiency introduced in national policies, however, are poorly or not coordinated, resulting in contradictory objectives for which physical interlinkages are not well understood. This research intends to provide insights for future energy-water nexus management decisions in China, through systematic, comprehensive modeling of the water-energy nexus in China based on comprehensive, bottom-up technology characterizations. Existing studies fail to adequately characterize the details on specific technologies, nor do they comprehensively cover all energy sectors, including energy conversion for non-energy products. We developed integrated assessment (IA) capabilities to allow stakeholders to observe the tradeoffs between various technology options and policy decisions and to test hypotheses/premises in a scenario-driven environment. The results of our analysis underscore the growing interconnection between water and energy in China, the mixed trade-offs from developing low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy and inland nuclear, and the importance of water-energy nexus issues at the regional and local scales. This study lays the groundwork for an integrated resource policy planning process in China and provides an assessment methodology and research directions for future studies of the water-energy nexus. To conclude, this study contributes to the water-energy nexus literature by providing systematic data and policy implications for China, where data are typically less accessible, as well as providing references for other regions in the world that are facing similar water and energy use and planning challenges.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We demonstrate in this paper that the jumping speed of drops is nonmonotonic with the drop size, showing a maximum around 5μm (a size commonly observed in dew), below and above which viscous and inertial effects, respectively, impede the takeoff. We quantitatively describe this optimum in antifogging. Here, we also studied the ballistics of the jumping microdrops, from the height they reached to their behavior at landing; a situation where retakeoff is surprisingly found to be nearly unachievable despite the extreme nonwettability of the material.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Surface radiances in 2002 narrow-wavelength bands from 0.28 to 4.0 um are analytically computed by solving the radiative transfer equation for five independent photon paths accounting for clear-sky absorption, Rayleigh scattering, and cloud absorption and scattering. The Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine (SMARTS) is used to show the optical thickness of the clear-sky atmosphere. Unlike Part I, which approximates the computation of aerosol scattering using the single-scattering phase function, the cloud transmittance and reflectance are efficiently retrieved from a comprehensive look-up table pre-computed by a 32-stream DIScrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model for possible cloud conditions as well as solar and viewing geometries. A resolution assessment is performed to observe the optimal balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy in the development of the look-up table. Model simulations by DISORT and TMYSPEC are used to evaluate the performance of FARMS-NIT under cloudy-sky conditions. Compared to DISORT, FARMS-NIT yields 2-3% uncertainties on average, but it substantially reduces the computational time because of the independent computation of cloud properties and the implementation of the look-up table. In contrast to TMYSPEC, which uses successive steps to empirically compute plane-of-array (POA) irradiances and spectral irradiances, FARMS-NIT directly solves spectral radiances from the radiative transfer equation, which profoundly increases the accuracy in surface irradiances, especially over inclined photovoltaics (PV) panels.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Electrolyte Concentration Effect on Sulfur Utilization of Li-S Batteries","Sun, Ke; Li, Na; Su, Dong; Gan, Hong","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; Batteries Lithium; Electrolyte Concentration; Li-S Batteries; Sulfur Utilization","Electrolyte is the critical component of the Li-S battery. Past studies have shed light on the behavior of the Li-S cells when the electrolyte salt concentration is increased to the solvent-in-salt regime and demonstrated tremendously improved cycle life. However, there is no systematic study on the Li-S cell when the electrolyte salt concentration is reduced from the standard 1.0M condition. This work investigates the lower salt concentration regime by doing a systematic study with the standard LiTFSI in DME:DOL combination, using sulfur electrodes with relatively high loading (> 6 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). Although reducing the electrolyte salt concentration lowers the ionic conductivity, it is found that the sulfur utilization and rate capability of the Li-S cells benefits from this process. Similar observations are also found when LiTFSI is replaced with LiI and LiBr, which form less conductive electrolytes than LiTFSI at the same concentration levels. Data correlation indicates a stronger correlation between the Li-S cell’s rate-capability and the electrolyte conductivity than electrolyte viscosity. It is proposed in this work that free Li<sup>+</sup> concentration, which is proportional to the electrolyte conductivity, is the real rate-capability determining parameter. Reducing the electrolyte salt concentration and replacing LiTFSI with less dissociable salts (LiI, LiBr) both will reduce the free Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte, which will allow a higher saturation point of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Li<sub>2</sub>S. This probably will delay the insulating layer build-up on the cathode conductive network and improve the dissolved Li-polysulfide to Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>/Li<sub>2</sub>S conversion efficiency.

D.; Voisin, Nathalie; Fazio, John; Hua, Daniel; Jourabchi, Massoud","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Power system operations are sensitive to climate-driven variations in both energy demands and water availability. Yet the combined effect of these impacts on power system adequacy is rarely evaluated. Here we assess power shortfall risk for the U.S. Pacific Northwest under combined climate impacts on loads and hydropower generation. Climate change emerges as both a risk and an opportunity; potential shortfall events occur more readily, but are significantly less severe in nature (annual shortfall probability is more than doubled for a business as usual policy; average shortfall event duration is halved and average maximum shortfall is reduced by up to ~60%). A seasonal reversal in shortfall risk occurs: winter shortfalls are eradicated due to reduced building heating demands, whilst summer shortfalls multiply as increased peak loads for day-time cooling coincide with impaired hydropower generation. Many of these summer shortfalls go unregistered when climate change impacts on loads and hydro dispatch are analyzed in isolation—suggesting an important role of compound events.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.(PNNL), Richland, WA (United States)","Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Statistical change detection of building energy consumption: Applications to savings estimation","Touzani, Samir; Ravache, Baptiste; Crowe, Eliot; Granderson, Jessica","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","The surge in interval meter data availability and associated activity in energy data analytics has inspired new interest in advanced methods for building efficiency savings estimation. Statistical and machine learning approaches are being explored to improve the energy baseline models used to measure and verify savings. One outstanding challenge is the ability to identify and account for operational changes that may confound savings estimates. In the measurement and verification (M&amp;V) context, ‘non-routine events’ (NREs) cause changes in building energy use that are not attributable to installed efficiency measures, and not accounted for in the baseline model’s independent variables. In the M&amp;V process NREs must be accounted for as ‘adjustments’ to appropriately attribute the estimated energy savings to the specific efficiency interventions that were implemented. Currently this is a manual and custom process, conducted using professional judgment and engineering expertise. As such it remains a barrier in scaling and standardizing meter-based savings estimation. Here in this work, a data driven methodology was developed to (partially) automate, and therefore streamline the process of detecting NREs in the post-retrofit period and making associated savings adjustments. The proposed NRE detection algorithm is based on a statistical change point detection method and a dissimilarity metric. The dissimilarity metric measures the proximity between the actual time series of the post-retrofit energy consumption and the projected baseline, which is generated using a statistical baseline model. The suggested approach for NRE adjustment involves the NRE detection algorithm, the M&amp;V practitioner, and a regression modeling algorithm. The performance of the detection and adjustment algorithm was evaluated using a simulation-generated test data set, and two benchmark algorithms. Results show a high true positive detection rate (75%-100% across the test cases), higher than ideal false positive detection rates (20%-70%), and low errors in energy adjustment (&lt;0.7%). These results indicate that the algorithm holds for helping M&amp;V practitioners to streamline the process of handling NREs. Moreover, the change point algorithm and underlying statistical principles could prove valuable for other building analytics applications such as anomaly detection and fault diagnostics.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Two case studies based on this package are performed to investigate the performances of the cooling and electrical system under normal conditions and emergency situations such as a blackout: one is for a data center powered by conventional energy, and the other is for a data center powered by renewable energy. Simulation results show that the dynamic modeling and multi-domain simulation in the Modelica-based tool make it convenient for users to investigate both normal and emergent operations for conventional and renewable data centers.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Optimal scheduling of isolated microgrid with an electric vehicle battery swapping station in multi-stakeholder scenarios: A bi-level programming approach via real-time pricing","Li, Yang; Yang, Zhen; Li, Guoqing; Mu, Yunfei; Zhao, Dongbo; Chen, Chen; Shen, Bo","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Real-time pricing; Battery swapping station; Bi-level programming; Demand response; Isolated microgrids; Multi-stakeholder; Optimal scheduling; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","In order to coordinate the scheduling problem between an isolated microgrid (IMG) and electric vehicle battery swapping stations (BSSs) in multi-stakeholder scenarios, a new bi-level optimal scheduling model is proposed for promoting the participation of BSSs in regulating the IMG economic operation. In this model, the upper-level sub-problem is formulated to minimize the IMG net costs, while the lower-level aims to maximize the profits of the BSS under real-time pricing environments determined by demand responses in the upper-level decision. To solve the model, a hybrid algorithm, called JAYA-BBA, is put forward by combining a real/integer-coded JAYA algorithm and the branch and bound algorithm (BBA), in which the JAYA and BBA are respectively employed to address the upper- and lower- level sub-problems, and the bi-level model is eventually solved through alternate iterations between the two levels. The simulation results on a microgrid test system verify the effectiveness and superiority of the presented approach.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper conducts a comprehensive review of techno-economic assumptions in the electricity sector among fifteen different global and national integrated assessment models. Particular focus is given to six major economies in the world: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. The comparison reveals that techno-economic characteristics are quite different across integrated assessment models, both for the base year and future years. It is, however, important to recognize that techno-economic assessments from the literature exhibit an equally large range of parameters as the integrated assessment models reviewed. Beyond numerical differences, the representation of technologies also differs among models, which needs to be taken into account when comparing numerical parameters. While desirable, it seems difficult to fully harmonize techno-economic parameters across a broader range of models due to structural differences in the representation of technology. Therefore, making techno-economic parameters available in the future, together with of the technology representation as well as the exact definitions of the parameters should become the standard approach as it allows an open discussion of appropriate assumptions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Data center growth in the United States: Decoupling the demand for services from electricity use","Shehabi, Arman; Smith, Sarah J.; Masanet, Eric; Koomey, Jonathan","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Data centers are energy intensive buildings that have grown in size and number to meet the increasing demands of a digital economy. This paper presents a bottom-up model to estimate data center electricity demand in the United States over a 20 year period and examines observed and projected electricity use trends in the context of changing data center operations. Results indicate a rapidly increasing electricity demand at the turn of the century that has significantly subsided to a nearly steady annual electricity use of about 70 billion kWh in recent years. While data center workloads continue to grow exponentially, comparable increases in electricity demand have been avoided through the adoption of key energy efficiency measures and a shift towards large cloud-based service providers. Alternative projections from the model illustrate the wide range in potential electricity that could be consumed to support data centers, with the US data center workload demand estimated for 2020 requiring a total electricity use that varies by about 135 billion kWh, depending on the adoption rate of efficiency measures during this decade. While recent improvements in data center energy efficiency have been a success, the growth of data center electricity use beyond 2020 is uncertain, as modeled trends indicate that the efficiency measures of the past may not be enough for the data center workloads of the future. The results show that successful stabilization of data center electricity will require new innovations in data center efficiency to further decouple electricity demand from the ever-growing demand for data center services.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

One such infrastructure is parking, as parking demand may shift with the availability of ride-hailing services. This study uses ethnographic methods - complemented with passenger surveys collected when driving for Uber and Lyft in the Denver, Colorado, region - to gather quantitative and qualitative data on ride-hailing and analyze the impacts of ride-hailing on parking, including changes in parking demand and parking as a reason to deter driving. The study also examines relationships between parking time and cost. This includes building a classification tree-based model to predict the replaced driving trips as a function of car ownership, destination land type, parking stress, and demographics. The results suggest that: i) ride-hailing is replacing driving trips and could reduce parking demand, particularly at land uses such as airports, event venues, restaurants, and bars; ii) parking stress is a key reason respondents chose not to drive; and iii) respondents are generally willing to pay more for reduced parking time and distance. Conversely, parking supply, time, and cost can all influence travel behavior and ride-hailing use. This work provides insight into potential benefits and disadvantages of ride-hailing as related to parking.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Bimetallic and multi-component catalysts typically exhibit composition-dependent activity and selectivity, and when optimized often outperform single-component catalysts. Here we used ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and in situ and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to elucidate the origin of composition dependence observed in the catalytic activities of monodisperse CoPd bimetallic nanocatalysts for CO oxidation. We found that the catalysis process induced a reconstruction of the catalysts, leaving CoOx on the nanoparticle surface. The synergy between Pd and CoOx coexisting on the surface promotes the catalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts. This synergistic effect can be optimized by tuning the Co/Pd ratios in the nanoparticle synthesis, and it reaches a maximum at compositions near Co0.24Pd0.76, which achieves complete CO conversion at the lowest temperature. Our combined AP-XPS and TEM studies provide direct observation of the surface evolution of the bimetallic nanoparticles under catalytic conditions and show how this evolution correlates with catalytic properties.","Springer Nature","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this work, we propose a new strategy for the catalyst support design focusing on OV-rich, low-bandgap semiconductor. The OVs promote the electrical conductivity of the oxide support, and at the same time offer a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), which enables the catalysts small metal size, high catalytic activity, and high stability. The strategy is demonstrated by successfully synthesizing ultrafine Co metal decorated three-dimensionally ordered macroporous titanium oxynitride (3DOM-Co@TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>). The 3DOM-Co@TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> catalyst exhibits comparable activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, but much higher cycling stability than noble-metals in alkaline conditions. The zinc-air battery using this catalyst delivers an excellent stability with less than 1% energy efficiency loss over 900 charge-discharge cycles at 20 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The high stability is attributed to the strong SMSI between Co and 3DOM-TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub> which verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These results shed light on using OV-rich semiconductors as a promising support to design efficient and durable non-precious electrocatalysts.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Floating Photovoltaic Systems: Assessing the Technical Potential of Photovoltaic Systems on Man-Made Water Bodies in the Continental United States","Spencer, Robert S.; Macknick, Jordan; Aznar, Alexandra; Warren, Adam; Reese, Matthew O.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; floating; PV; technical potential; geospatial; water; energy","We report that floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems, also called floatovoltaics, are a rapidly growing emerging technology application in which solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are sited directly on water. The water-based configuration of FPV systems can be mutually beneficial: Along with providing such benefits as reduced evaporation and algae growth, it can lower PV operating temperatures and potentially reduce the costs of solar energy generation. Although there is growing interest in FPV, to date there has been no systematic assessment of technical potential in the continental United States. We provide the first national-level estimate of FPV technical potential using a combination of filtered, large-scale datasets, site-specific PV generation models, and geospatial analytical tools. We quantify FPV co-benefits and siting considerations, such as land conservation, coincidence with high electricity prices, and evaporation rates. Our results demonstrate the potential of FPV to contribute significantly to the U.S. electric sector, even using conservative assumptions. A total of 24?419 man-made water bodies, representing 27% of the number and 12% of the area of man-made water bodies in the contiguous United States, were identified as being suitable for FPV generation. FPV systems covering just 27% of the identified suitable water bodies could produce almost 10% of current national generation. Lastly, many of these eligible bodies of water are in water-stressed areas with high land acquisition costs and high electricity prices, suggesting multiple benefits of FPV technologies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Distributionally-Robust Chance Constrained and Interval Optimization for Integrated Electricity and Natural Gas Systems Optimal Power Flow with Wind Uncertainties","Fang, Xin; Cui, Hantao; Yuan, Haoyu; Tan, Jin; Jiang, Tao","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; integrated electricity and natural gas systems; IEGS; economic dispatch; spatial-temporal correlation; distributional robustness","With increasing penetrations of gas-fired generation in power systems because of reducing gas prices and emissions regulations, the interdependent and coordinated operation of integrated electricity and natural gas systems (IEGSs) is becoming an urgent research topic. Meanwhile, the significantly increasing deployment of wind power necessitates that IEGSs operation considers wind power output uncertainty. How to model the impact of wind power uncertainty on IEGSs power and gas flows dispatch is challenging. In this paper, a hybrid distributionally-robust chance-constrained and interval optimization (DRCC-IO) based model is proposed to consider the influence of wind power uncertainty and its spatial-temporal correlation on IEGSs operation. First, the DRCC-OPF model is proposed to obtain reliable economic dispatch solutions for the electricity network considering the wind power forecast errors. The spatial-temporal correlation of the wind power plant (WPP) forecasts is considered with a sparse correlation covariance matrix. Then, the interval optimization (IO) model is used to model the impacts of the power variations of gas-fired units on the natural gas network. Finally, the proposed model considers the impacts of wind power uncertainty on both the electricity and natural gas networks. Case studies performed on a six-bus power system coupled with a seven-node gas system and an IEEE 118-bus power system with a 14-node gas system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method to improve system security and reduce costs of the IEGSs. The robustness of the wind power forecast errors can be controlled in the proposed model to trade off the security and costs of the IEGSs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both centralized and distributed decision approaches were explored in past decades as a way to enable efficient transactive operations. However, online distributed stochastic transactive operation has been overlooked in the literature. To bridge gaps in the research, a bi-level distributed stochastic model predictive control framework was proposed to study the transactive operations of building clusters where a system-level agent is employed to coordinate multiple building agents at the subsystem level. The energy transaction is optimized by a marginal price-based particle swarm optimizer at the system level. Given the energy transaction decisions, each building can independently solve a scenario-based two-stage stochastic model to optimally dispatch the electricity and ancillary services for optimal energy performance. The effectiveness of the proposed framework and coordination algorithm are demonstrated in deterministic, stochastic, and online operations and compared to centralized decisions using several sets of experiments. Additionally, the proposed approach can realize autonomous transactive operation and be extended to community-level building clusters in a plug-and-play way.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, the ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectroscopy, transient photocurrent spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-ZISe-Mo is mainly attributed to its widened photoresponse range and effective carrier separation because of its special structure.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Costs and consequences of wind turbine wake effects arising from uncoordinated wind energy development","Lundquist, J. K.; DuVivier, K. K.; Kaffine, D.; Tomaszewski, J. M.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; wind energy; wind farm; wake effects; power production; assessment","Optimal wind farm locations require a strong and reliable wind resource and access to transmission lines. As onshore and offshore wind energy grows, preferred locations become saturated with numerous wind farms. An upwind wind farm generates 'wake effects' (decreases in downwind wind speeds) that undermine a downwind wind farm's power generation and revenues. Here we use a diverse set of analysis tools from the atmospheric science, economic and legal communities to assess costs and consequences of these wake effects, focusing on a West Texas case study. We show that although wake effects vary with atmospheric conditions, they are discernible in monthly power production. In stably stratified atmospheric conditions, wakes can extend 50+ km downwind, resulting in economic losses of several million dollars over six years for our case study. However, our investigation of the legal literature shows no legal guidance for protecting existing wind farms from such significant impacts.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we use the system-dynamics-based biomass scenario model (BSM), focused on alternative jet fuel production capacity evolution, and the geospatially explicit Freight and Fuel Transportation Optimization Tool (FTOT), focused on optimal feedstock and fuel flows over the transportation system, to explore the incentive effects on alternative jet fuel production capacity trajectories and potential geospatial patterns of production and delivery in the USA. Scenarios presented here focus on readily available waste feedstocks (waste fats, oils and greases, municipal solid waste, and crop and forestry residues) and conversion technologies included in the ASTM D7566 synthesized aviation turbine fuels specification. The BSM modeling of possible deployment trajectories from 2015 to 2045 suggests that up to 8 billion gallons may be available by 2045 depending on the policies and incentives implemented. Both approaches suggest that 200 million to 1 billion gallons per year of alternative jet fuel production are possible in 2030 given multiple incentives and a favorable investment climate, and that capital costs and technology maturation rates will affect deployment of different fuel production technologies, and therefore the feedstocks needed. Further collaboration on these modeling approaches would reduce methodological blind spots while providing insights into future industry trajectories.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Could a bioenergy program stimulate electric vehicle market penetration? Potential impacts of biogas to electricity annual rebate program","Xie, Fei; Lin, Zhenhong; Podkaminer, Kara","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; bioelectricity; biogas; consumer choice; electric vehicle; renewable fuel standards; renewable identification number","The biogas–to–electricity pathway under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) allows for Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits to be generated when electricity produced from biogas is used in the transportation sector. Though approved as a general pathway, EPA has proposed multiple credit allocation methods to functionalize this pathway. This study describes and evaluates a potential credit allocation framework where vehicle manufacturers generate electricity RIN (E–RIN) credits and use these credits to increase the sales of plug–in electric vehicles (PEVs). Under this framework, manufacturers use part of the credit value to reimburse electricity generators, offsetting potential higher biogas electricity generation cost. The remaining credit value is passed on to consumers as an annual PEV rebate to stimulate PEV sales. An iterative simulation framework is developed to fulfill two tasks: (a) to estimate the annual rebate amounts and their upfront value to consumers based on various factors, such as vehicle mileage, E–RIN equivalence value, and biogas capacity, and (b) to evaluate potential impacts of the E–RIN program on electrification of the future light–duty vehicles (LDVs) and energy use. The annual rebate amount varies by vehicle technology and could be up to 870/year for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and range between 230 and 825/year for plug–in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) depending on the electric range. These per vehicle rebates decrease when demand for electricity exceeds biogas electricity availability. The effectiveness of the program as modeled here is subject to different factors, such as the E–RIN equivalence value, biogas electricity generation cost, biogas electricity generation capacity, and consumers’ valuation of the E–RIN rebate. As a result, our modeling results indicate that an E–RIN program has the potential to produce nearly 12 billion in E–RIN credits annually and to significantly increase PEV annual sales by up to 2.3 million and the PEV population by about 19.7 million in 2030.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The importance of atmospheric turbulence and stability in machine-learning models of wind farm power production","Optis, Mike; Perr-Sauer, Jordan","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; machine learning; data mining; wind farm power; wind power forecasting; atmospheric stability; turbulence","Machine learning is frequently applied in the wind energy industry to build statistical models of wind farm power production using atmospheric data as input. In the field of wind power forecasting, in particular, there has been substantial research into finding the best-performing learning algorithms that improve model predictions. Overlooked in the literature, however, is the influence of atmospheric turbulence and stability measurements in improving model predictions. It has been well-established through observations and physical models that these effects can have considerable influence on wind farm power production; yet consideration of these effects in statistical models is almost entirely absent from the literature. In this work, we examine the impact of atmospheric turbulence and stability inputs on statistical model predictions of wind farm power output. Hourly observations from a wind farm in the Pacific Northwest United States located in very complex terrain are used. Five common learning algorithms and nine atmospheric variables are considered, five of which represent some measure of turbulence or stability. Here, we find a considerable improvement in hourly power predictions when some measure of turbulence or stability is included in the model. In particular, turbulent kinetic energy was found to be the most important variable apart from wind speed and more important than wind direction, pressure, and temperature. By contrast, the choice of learning algorithm is shown to be relatively less important in improving predictions. Based on this work, we recommend that turbulence and stability variables become standard inputs into statistical models of wind farm power production.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Toward an Understanding of Synergies and Trade-Offs Between Water, Energy, and Food SDG Targets","Fader, Marianela; Cranmer, Colleen; Lawford, Richard; Engel-Cox, Jill","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; water-food-energy nexus; trade-offs; synergies; sustainable development goals","Achieving the targets set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) will require committed efforts by nations and organizations over the coming decade. To determine which actions work most harmoniously within funding, infrastructure development, and implementation of three closely aligned goals, we conducted an assessment to identify where the greatest synergies may occur and where conflicting resource needs create trade-offs that may threaten SDG success. The SDGs each have several targets that need to be realized for the goal to be reached. In the present study, we developed a methodology where each target of the SDG 2 (food), 6 (water), and 7 (energy) was analyzed for its input requirements, infrastructure needs, and the risks and benefits for the provision of ecosystem services. Then the targets were compared pairwise and a total score of interaction was calculated to determine different levels of synergies and trade-offs for every pair. In some cases targets were mutually supportive, in other cases there were no interactions among the targets, and for some areas the targets were in conflict with each other. For example, targets 2.5 (maintain genetic diversity), 6.5 (implement integrated water resources management) and 7.a (enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy) have no conflicts with other targets and have different levels of synergies with most of the other targets. On the contrary, various targets of SDG 2, and especially the target 2.b (correct and prevent trade restrictions), are in slight conflict with other targets by potentially overusing resources needed by other targets or threatening ecosystem services. Our approach confirms the general belief that SDG 6 (water) has the highest number of potential synergies (a total of 124). Thus, achieving the water targets will make it continuously easier to achieve other targets. While the results may need to be adapted for a specific locality or country, overall they provide an improved understanding of the interactions between the targets. Furthermore, the value of the study lies in the quantitative methodology as it can be used as a replicable analysis for any level of work on SDG implementation.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These disparities reflect both technical and economic factors, as well as the social, political, and ecological gaps between how communities see energy development and national/global policy goals. Known as the “local-national gap”, many nations struggle with fostering meaningful conversations about the role of alternative energy technologies within communities. Mitigation of this problem first requires understanding the distribution of existing alternative energy technologies at the local level of policymaking. To address the limitation of existing adoption trend analysis at the scale of local governance (e.g., county governments), this paper demonstrates a novel method for contextualizing solar technology adoption by using the State of Georgia in the United States as an exemplar. Leveraging existing work on the Gini Coefficient as a metric for measuring energy inequity, we argue these tools can be applied to analyze where gaps exist in ongoing solar adoption trends. As we demonstrate, communities that adopt solar tend to be concentrated in a few counties, indicating existing conversations are limited to a circumscribed set of social networks. This information and the model we demonstrate can enable focused qualitative analyses of existing solar trends, not only among high-adoption areas but within communities where little to no adoption has occurred.","MDPI","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

We add to the current body of literature by outlining a framework which properly accounts for the effects of outage duration. We begin by separating costs into categories depending on whether the cost varies with outage duration and whether the cost is due to perishable inventory. We derive useful functional forms for each cost category and discuss how parameters vary by load type and outage characteristics. We derive outage cost estimates for an unexpected loss of power to both an example manufacturing plant and an example fire station. The framework described in this paper can easily be employed to model outage costs for a wide range of specific operating conditions.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Setting cost targets for zero-emission electricity generation technologies","Mai, Trieu T.; Cole, Wesley J.; Reimers, Andrew","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; power system modeling; energy economics; technology innovation; grid integration","Clean energy deployment scenarios typically assume a diverse mix of low-emission generation. However, because of historically low natural gas prices and cost reductions for onshore wind and photovoltaic technologies, recent new capacity deployment, especially in the United States, has come largely from these three generation sources. Here, we quantify competitive cost targets for three less-common zero-emission generation technologies -- nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind -- under a range of future conditions. We determine the cost targets based on the technologies' system value, such that technology value equals or exceeds its cost. Using a capacity expansion model that develops system-wide, economically optimal generation scenarios of the United States power sector, we find that nuclear, concentrating solar, and offshore wind would need to attain levelized cost ranges of $53-84/MWh, $65-91/MWh, and $39-77/MWh, respectively, to achieve 1% additional grid penetration. We refer to this metric as the 'required cost,' which is a technology's levelized cost of energy needed to achieve a specific penetration level. Higher penetrations lead to lower required costs as lower-cost generation is displaced. We estimate that to reach 10% penetration, the required cost for nuclear declines to $45-76/MWh. Because of resource variability and increased transmission needs for concentrating solar power and offshore wind, even lower costs are needed to reach higher penetrations: required cost ranges to achieve 10% penetration are estimated to be $30-56/MWh and $18-40/MWh for these two technologies respectively. Our analysis informs research and development priorities and the design of policies supporting clean technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Power system operations are usually evaluated through system reliability and economic perspectives, with assumptions on market prices and normal water availability. As natural gas technologies continue to dominate new thermal capacity replacing retiring coal and nuclear generators, natural gas price stability becomes increasingly important and the impact of price volatility on grid operations must be understood. Here, we explore the range of Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) regional power operations , which represents the electric interconnection over the western half of the continental United States, using a production cost model driven by different fuel prices and an integrated hydrology model to simulate historical water availability. Results show that system-wide operation costs increase in drought years or when gas prices increase, as expected. System wide increases in cost due to WECC drought and regional gas price volatility can be of the same magnitude but can differ regionally depending on regional generation technology portfolios. The Pacific Northwest is most sensitive to drought conditions, Southern California is most sensitive to gas prices, and the Desert Southwest is sensitive to both.

"Quantifying adoption rates and energy savings over time for advanced energy-efficient manufacturing technologies","Hanes, Rebecca; Carpenter, Alberta; Riddle, Matthew; Graziano, Diane J.; Cresko, Joe","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; advanced manufacturing; technology adoption; Bass diffusion; energy efficiency","Energy-efficient manufacturing technologies can reduce energy consumption and lower operating costs for manufacturing facilities, but up-front costs and increased process complexity frequently lead to manufacturers being reluctant to adopt such technologies. To avoid over-estimating the benefits of advanced energy-efficient manufacturing technologies, it is necessary to account for how quickly and how widely the technology will be adopted by manufacturers. This work develops a method for estimating manufacturing technology adoption rates using quantitative technology characteristics including energetic, economic, and technical criteria that capture both incentives (such as energy and cost savings) and disincentives (such as increased process complexity) for technology adoption. This method is unique in that it can be applied before or after a technology reaches the market; other adoption rate estimation methods require sales data and can only be applied post-market. Eleven technology characteristics are considered, with each characteristic weighted to reflect its impact on the overall technology adoption rate. Technology characteristic data is used to estimate model parameters for the Bass diffusion curve, which quantifies the change in the number of new technology adopters in a population over time. Finally, energy savings at the sector level are calculated over time by multiplying the number of new technology adopters at each time step with the technology's facility-level energy savings. The proposed method is demonstrated with an application to glass industry manufacturing technologies using technology data obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy's 2017 bandwidth study. The potential energy savings for each technology and the rate at which each technology is adopted in the sector are quantified and used to identify the technologies which offer the greatest cumulative sector-level energy savings over a period of 20 years.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It provides quantitative and specific electric (kWhr/vehicle) and fossil-fuel (MMBtu/vehicle) energy predictions of the body-in-white (BIW) manufacturing processes including body panel forming, welding, painting, and final assembly, in addition to the facility heating ventilation and air conditioning or HVAC consumption. Two hybridised BIW design criteria are analysed; the first is based on minimising the added cost per unit weight saved (+$/-kg), while the second is based on maximising the percentage of weight saved (% -kg). Also a new criterion; that is the added specific-energy per unit weight-saved or (+kWhr/vehicle/-kg) is proposed. The light-weight structures comprise body parts made of aluminium and steel. To compute energy consumptions, the study utilises the energy performance index (EPI) stochastic model in addition to complementing it with a panel-forming energy model. Cost analysis is also provided for all the major vehicle body-panels using an in-house Excel macro.

The value of improved VRE forecasts can increase with increasing VRE penetration levels as well as the range of this value becoming wider. This value also saturates with high levels of improved VRE forecasts as there is relatively lower impact of improving VRE forecasts further.

The model uses a novel link cost function that retains all microscopic transient behavior along a link by capturing within-link speed, acceleration, and road grade variations. Specifically, eight vehicle-agnostic link-specific variables are transmitted to the cloud and fused with information received from other connected vehicles. The fused data are then sent back to the connected vehicles and used to compute vehicle-specific eco-routes (edge computing). The solution produces an energy-efficient dynamic user-equilibrium traffic assignment that is solved incrementally. A numerical experiment is first designed to test the model, demonstrating the benefits associated with vehicle-specific eco-routes compared to those produced by traditional models. The model is then implemented in a micro-simulation framework to evaluate the network-wide impacts of the proposed energy-efficient user-optimum incremental traffic assignment for different traffic demand levels. Results demonstrate that the proposed model produces lower network-wide energy consumption levels compared to traditional energy-efficient and travel time user-optimum traffic assignment methods for both conventional fuel and electric vehicles. Conventional fuel savings relative to travel time routing decrease with increasing traffic demand levels, while electric power savings do not vary monotonically with congestion levels. Energy savings relative to traditional eco-routing are also demonstrated to not vary monotonically with demand levels. Results of the study also demonstrate that the transportation network layout significantly affects the eco-routing system performance. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed model in real-world applications is discussed and presented.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Role of Input Assumptions and Model Structures in Projections of Variable Renewable Energy: A Multi-Model Perspective of the U.S. Electricity System","Mai, Trieu; Bistline, John; Sun, Yinong; Cole, Wesley; Marcy, Cara; Namovicz, Chris; Young, David","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; intermodel comparison; capacity expansion modeling; grid integration","Recent wind and solar deployment in the United States has grown at unprecedented rates, but the extent to which this growth will continue is a key question. Energy-economic planning models are often used to develop future projections of these technologies, and although it is well-understood that model outcomes are sensitive to assumptions about technology developments and market conditions, it is less clear how underlying model structures might impact outcomes. For wind and solar technologies, model structures might be an even larger driver due to the complexity required to represent their variability, uncertainty, and location-dependence. Here, we apply three state-of-the-art electric sector planning models to evaluate variable renewable generation under different conditions with both harmonized and native input assumptions to isolate the impact that model structures might have on deployment outcomes. We find growth in wind and solar deployment in all models under a business-as-usual scenario (without new policies), where the median value for variable renewable energy generation share is found to be 27% by 2050 - but with a wide range of estimates (18-43%), types of renewable technologies deployed, and regional distributions across models. With harmonized assumptions about technology costs and market conditions the range narrows slightly, but a large range in penetration outcomes remains (24-41% by 2050) suggesting that model representations play significant roles in projections of future wind and solar deployment. We also assess the implications of achieving 55% wind and solar penetration by 2050 - to assess potential challenges at higher penetration levels - and the magnitude of variable generation under a carbon-constrained future. Finally, we identify research needs to better assess the future deployment of variable renewable energy.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To understand how this growth can be slowed, here we explore four scenarios for Chinese buildings, ranging from a high-energy-demand scenario with no new energy policies to lowest energy demand under a techno-economic-potential scenario that assumes full deployment of cost-effective efficient and renewable technologies by 2050. We show that, in the high energy demand scenario, building energy demand has an average annual growth rate of about 2.8%, with slower growth rates in the other three scenarios. In all scenarios, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions grow slower than energy, with building CO<sub>2</sub> peaking around 2045 in the high energy demand scenario, and as early as 2030 in the techno-economic-potential scenario. We show that although various technological solutions, systems and practices can be very effective in minimizing building energy use, rigorous policies are needed to overcome multiple implementation barriers.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The U.S. energy service company (ESCO) industry generates significant energy savings and other benefits through installing and maintaining energy efficiency, renewable and other types of projects. In this study, we evaluate factors that may explain trends in the economic performance of U.S. ESCO projects by analyzing project level data for ~7000 U.S. ESCO industry projects. We find that real project investment levels normalized for floor area have increased over time in ESCO projects across market segments. However, the dollar value of energy savings and other reported benefits have not kept pace with increases in real project investment levels over time. The latter have increased 100%–500% in various market segments from 1990 to 2017. We conduct an econometric analysis to decompose the drivers of these underlying trends. Number of measures and a changing mix of conservation measures are the primary factors that correlate with the long-term increase in project investment levels. However, our analysis is only able to account for less than 50% of the increase in real investment levels. Finally, we discuss additional factors, and conclude discussing policy implications and outlining long-term research needs.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An Ensemble Optimization Framework for Coupled Design of Hydropower Contracts and Real-Time Reservoir Operating Rules","Sahu, Reetik Kumar; McLaughlin, Dennis B.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Often, revenues from hydropower generation depend on the operator's ability to provide firm power in the presence of uncertain inflows. The primary options available for optimizing revenue are negotiation of a firm power contract before operations begin and adjustment of the reservoir release during operations. Contract and release strategy optimization are closely coupled and most appropriately analyzed with stochastic real-time control methods. Here we use an ensemble-based approach to stochastic optimization that provides a convenient way to construct nonparametric revenue probability distributions to explore the implications of uncertainty. The firm power contract is a simplified bilateral fixed price agreement that partially insulates operator and buyer from price fluctuations. The release control laws and firm energy target are jointly optimized to maximize the operator's expected revenue. Revenue probability distributions and related spill performance statistics indicate that predictive operating strategies such as stochastic dynamic programming and model predictive control can give significantly better performance than standard deterministic operating rules. The performance obtained from batch optimization with perfect inflow information establishes a convenient upper bound on potential revenue and provides a baseline for assessing the significance of differences between real-time operating strategies. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the benefits of predictive operational strategies are greatest for reservoirs with medium nondimensional residence times and less important for reservoirs with large residence times. Overall, probabilistic analysis of the coupled hydropower contract-operations problem provides a realistic way to assess revenue and risk for reservoirs that must provide firm power when inflows are uncertain.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Valuing variable renewable energy for peak demand requirements","Zhou, Shengru; Cole, Wesley J.; Frew, Bethany A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; wind; solar; renewable energy; capacity value; capacity credit; resource adequacy","The capacity credit for a generator is the fraction of its nameplate capacity that can contribute to meeting the system's resource adequacy. However, estimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy is challenging due to the variability, uncertainty, and spatial diversity of the renewable resources. This study uses the Regional Energy Deployment System to quantify the impacts on the U.S. power sector through 2050 from misestimations of renewable capacity credit. Results show that small underestimates of the renewable capacity credit have little impact on system buildout, but that large underestimates (>50%) can reduce solar photovoltaic deployment by nearly 100 GW (50%) and wind by up to 43 GW (22.8%) in 2030s. Such large differences are possible because the capacity credit for variable renewable energy can substantially impact the overall costs and value of variable renewable energy relative to other technologies. Such effects are most strongly felt in the mid-term but are less relevant over the long-term due to the declining value of variable resources. Underestimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy leads to increased system costs and emissions. Conversely, overvaluing the capacity credit of variable renewable energy reduces system costs at the risk of lower reliability.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most research in this area quantifies impacts on one or a few components and does not link these impacts to effects on power system planning and operations. Here, we advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United States. Second, given the interconnected nature of the electric power system, we assess how aggregated component-level impacts might affect power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and operations. Although component-level impacts vary in their magnitude, collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations. Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across generation types might require systems to procure significant additional capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and increased operational reserve requirements. Future research should aggregate component-level impacts at operational timescales, quantify impacts on wind and solar variability, and contextualize climate change impacts within ongoing shifts in the electric power system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One is mathematical derivation on how the heterogeneity affects the estimated market acceptance of high-efficiency vehicles. The other is a consumer choice based simulation method to analyze the heterogeneity impacts on the compliance with the fuel economy standards for the entire light duty vehicle fleet in the United States. Our findings suggest that the direction of the impact of heterogeneity assumption depends on market positions of high-efficiency vehicles: (1) with the “Likely-Accept” condition, where high-efficiency vehicles sell well and higher achieved fuel economy is expected, the heterogeneity assumption can add additional risks to the compliance; and (2) with the “Likely-Reject” condition where the fuel economy standards may have difficulty in compliance, the heterogeneity can reduce the risks and improve the compliance outcome. It is concluded that consideration of fuel economy valuation heterogeneity is important in fuel economy standard analysis. In conclusion, it is hoped that such consideration may provide a framework to reconcile the different views on consumer valuation of fuel economy.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

High upfront costs, however, are often a barrier to adoption, even when costs may be offset by future energy savings. Through a series of randomized experiments, we examine whether framing strategies grounded in behavioral economics and psychology can be used to increase the financial appeal of such products. Using mock ads for residential solar photovoltaics (PV), we test four frames: gain/loss framing, temporal framing, varied savings amounts, and simple vs. detailed savings calculations. Overall, we find that reframing the financial benefits of PV does not greatly influence the appeal of solar or the likelihood to respond to the mock ads. Instead, underlying consumer motivations and predispositions (i.e., perceived social support, consumer innovativeness, and personal pro-environmental norms) are the primary factors driving interest in adopting solar. Our findings suggest that tailoring messages to targeted consumer segments may be more effective than attempts to market the financial benefits of PV to broad audiences. Furthermore, the results also contribute to behavioral economics and psychology research by identifying contexts under which the gain/loss framing bias and the present/future framing bias may not apply.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The buyers can adjust the energy consumption behavior based on the price and quantity of the energy offered by the sellers. There exist two separate competitions during the trading process: 1) price competition among the sellers; and 2) seller selection competition among the buyers. The price competition among the sellers is modeled as a noncooperative game. The evolutionary game theory is used to model the dynamics of the buyers for selecting sellers. Moreover, an M-leader and N-follower Stackelberg game approach is used to model the interaction between buyers and sellers. Two iterative algorithms are proposed for the implementation of the games such that an equilibrium state exists in each of the games. The proposed method is applied to a small community microgrid with photo-voltaic and energy storage systems. Simulation results show the convergence of the algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed model to handle P2P energy trading. The results also show that P2P energy trading provides significant financial and technical benefits to the community, and it is emerging as an alternative to cost-intensive energy storage systems.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This flawed approach originates in natural human tendencies exacerbated by an historical misunderstanding of research and development, science and technology, and the relationships between them. We outline the origin of the mis-control and mis-protection, and propose two guiding principles to mitigate them and instead nurture research: (i) focus on people, not projects; and (ii) culturally insulate research from development, but not science from technology.

Performance comparison is made based on the annual combined COP and Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) for operation in selected cities of Middle East and India. Our results show that in extreme warm climate, the energy efficiency of the proposed configuration exceeds that of all-CO<sub>2</sub> configuration by a maximum of about 12.23% and the total emissions are lower by up to 11.20%. However, the all-CO<sub>2</sub> multi ejector system performs better in cold and mild warm climate.

"Are vulnerable customers any different than their peers when exposed to critical peak pricing: Evidence from the U.S.","Cappers, Peter; Spurlock, C. Anna; Todd, Annika; Jin, Ling","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Time-based rate; Critical peak pricing; Vulnerable; Low income; Elderly; Chronically ill","Recent broad-based deployment of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) enables the opportunity for broader adoption of time-based rates, and the benefits that result have been sizable contributors to making the investments cost effective. However, some stakeholders have raised concerns about the assumptions underlying the benefits assessments in AMI business cases. Such concerns are especially acute for certain subpopulations of residential customers. Low income, elderly and chronically ill (i.e., vulnerable) customers are believed to have less load that can be shifted or reduced to capture bill savings, lack the know-how or wherewithal with which to curtail usage, likely have more limited financial resources which may compel them to avoid high priced periods by reducing electricity for essential usage potentially causing them physical harm, and more generally may be more adversely affected by higher bills, which might possibly result from certain forms of time-based rates. There is very limited existing literature that addresses these questions specifically with regard to vulnerable subpopulations. This paper, based on a larger report, extends the existing empirical literature on the experiences of low-income customers exposed to critical peak pricing, and provides the first glimpses into the experiences of the elderly and those who reported being chronically ill.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The goal of this paper is to understand the impact of attacks on pricing/load signals on the physical grid within a transactive energy market framework. First, this paper models the interaction between real-time electricity price and total energy demand in the form of a discrete time nonlinear autonomous dynamical system. Second, equilibrium electricity price and energy demand associated with this coupled dynamical system is derived and conditions for bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stability are identified. Third, a BIBO stable algorithm to design real-time electricity pricing scheme from a techno-economic perspective is developed. Finally, the impact of various levels of false data injection (FDI) attack on price of electricity, demand, and distribution system voltage is investigated. The proposed model is analyzed using simulations on the IEEE 69-bus test system and the impact of FDI attack on both electricity price/demand and distribution grid voltage is quantified. In conclusion, this paper shows that impact of FDI attack on electricity prices is more severe than an attack on electricity demand.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, bimodal template-based synthesis strategies are proposed for the scalable preparation of hierarchically porous M-N-C (M = Fe or Co) single-atom electrocatalysts featured with active and robust MN<sub>2</sub> active moieties. Multiscale tuning of M-N-C catalysts regarding increasing the number of active sites and boosting the intrinsic activity of each active site is realized simultaneously at a single-atom scale. In addition to the antipoisoning power and high affinity for O<sub>2</sub>, the optimized Fe-N-C catalysts with FeN<sub>2</sub> active site presents a superior electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.927 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) in an alkaline medium, which is 49 and 55 mV higher than those of the Co-N-C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN<sub>2</sub> site is more active than the CoN<sub>2</sub> site for ORR due to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates and products involved. In conclusion, the present work may help rational design of more robust ORR electrocatalysts at the atomic level, realizing the significant advances in electrochemical conversion and storage devices.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We model DR in an Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) framework with high levels of wind penetration. Investment, exit and operational decisions are optimized simultaneously. We examine the potential for DR to participate in both energy and reserve markets. DR participation in the energy market reduces costs and prices and gives rise to lower equilibrium levels of investment in conventional generation. DR and wind generation are strongly complementary, due to the ability of DR to mitigate against the variability of wind generation, with the highest reduction of consumer costs seen at high levels of wind penetration. The total impact of DR is highly dependent on specific system characteristics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

New modules introduced hereby consist in 1) a storm classifier based on weather variables; 2) a multimodel optimization of regression tree output; and 3) a post-processing routine for more accurately describing tree-leaf conditions. Model implementations are tested through leave-one-storm-out cross-validations performed on 120 storms of varying intensity and characteristics. The results demonstrate that the median absolute percentage error of the new OPM version decreased from 130% to 59% for outage predictions at the service territory level, and the OPM skills for operational forecasts are consistent with the skills based on historical storm analyses.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An old saying is, 'In the desert, gold is useless and water is priceless.' While water is common on Earth, it is of very high value in space. Science missions to the Moon have provided direct evidence that regions near the lunar poles, which are permanently in shadow, contain substantial concentrations of water ice. On the lunar surface, water itself is critical for human consumption and radiation shielding, but water can also be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis. The oxygen thus produced can be used for life support, and hydrogen and oxygen can be combusted for rocket propulsion. Due to the Moon's shallow gravity well, its water-derived products can be exported to fuel entirely new economic opportunities in space. This paper is the result of an examination by industry, government, and academic experts of the approach, challenges, and payoffs of a private business that harvests and processes lunar ice as the foundation of a lunar, cislunar (between the Earth and the Moon), and Earth-orbiting economy.

In order to try to integrate a very large share of variable renewable energy sources into the energy system, an integrated energy planning approach was used, including ice storage in the cooling sector, a smart charging option in the transport sector, and an excess capacity of reverse osmosis technology that was utilised in order to provide flexibility to the energy system. A unit commitment and economic dispatch tool (PLEXOS) was used, and the model was run with both 5 min and 1 h time resolutions. The case study was carried out for a typical Caribbean island nation, based on data derived from measured data from Aruba. The results showed that 78.1% of the final electricity demand in 2020 was met by variable renewable energy sources, having 1.0% of curtailed energy in the energy system. The total economic cost of the modelled energy system was similar to the current energy system, dominated by the fossil fuel imports.

Reducing emissions from petroleum production is of particular importance, as current transport fleets are almost entirely dependent on liquid petroleum products, and many uses of petroleum have limited prospects for near-term substitution (e.g., air travel). Better understanding of crude oil GHG emissions can help to quantify the benefits of alternative fuels and identify the most cost-effective opportunities for oil-sector emissions reductions (2). Yet, while regulations are beginning to address petroleum sector GHG emissions (3-5), and private investors are beginning to consider climate-related risk in oil investments (6), such efforts have generally struggled with methodological and data challenges. First, no single method exists for measuring the carbon intensity (CI) of oils. Second, there is a lack of comprehensive geographically rich datasets that would allow evaluation and monitoring of life-cycle emissions from oils. We have previously worked to address the first challenge by developing open-source oil-sector CI modeling tools [OPGEE (7, 8), supplementary materials (SM) 1.1]. Here, we address the second challenge by using these tools to model well-to-refinery CI of all major active oil fields globally - and to identify major drivers of these emissions.","AAAS","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Agricultural demand response for decarbonizing the electricity grid","Aghajanzadeh, Arian; Therkelsen, Peter","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Agriculture; Irrigation; Demand response; Ancillary services; Electricity; Water","Historically, the focus of the agricultural industry has been increasing profit through maximizing crop yield. Costs for energy and water are small compared to equipment and personnel, and are thus often overlooked. However, energy costs for irrigation are increasing and could be exacerbated with declining water levels in many Western states. This trend has motivated many farmers to explore sustainable irrigation water and energy management practices. Additionally, much of this new focus has been directed towards the adoption of new agricultural technologies with a misplaced assumption that technology alone will inherently bring all the benefits. On one hand, farms are going through a paradigm shift, and are turning into net electricity generators, and on the other, higher penetration of intermittent renewable sources into the electricity grid, require dynamic loads to help the grid balance its intra-hour variability and short duration ramps. The agricultural industry could be restructured to utilize larger amounts of renewable energy such as wind and solar and provide a great deal of flexibility to the grid. As emerging producers of clean energy, farmers are required to learn and speak the complex language of the electricity grid in order to monetize their energy generation while making the renewable electricity grid more resilient and reliable. In this paper, we develop a foundational approach for understanding and connecting three important concepts that can help the agricultural industry during this critical transition period. Those three concepts are: (a) current and future needs of the electricity grid, (b) available electricity market mechanisms through which farms can provide services to the grid, and (c) understanding electricity consuming/generating equipment on farms. Finally, defining these concepts and condensing them into a standardized framework, can remove a significant barrier for enabling farms to provide services to the electricity grid while improving their bottom line.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"An anomaly detection framework for dynamic systems using a Bayesian hierarchical framework","Moghaddass, Ramin; Sheng, Shuangwen","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; anomaly detection; wind turbine; dynamic systems; sensor-intensive energy; systems; Bayesian modeling","Complex systems are susceptible to many types of anomalies, faults, and abnormal behavior caused by a variety of off-nominal conditions that may ultimately result in major failures or catastrophic events. Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system inputs and outputs collected from sensors and smart devices has become a challenging problem and an active area of research in many application domains. In this article, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework that is able to model the relationship between system inputs (sensor measurements) and outputs (response variables) without imposing strong distributional/parametric assumptions while using only a subset of training samples and sensor attributes. Then, an optimal cost-sensitive anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is an anomalous one taking into consideration the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates. The model can be used for both supervised and unsupervised settings depending on the availability of data regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. The unsupervised model is particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies that a system may present and where no data are available regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. A Bayesian hierarchical setting is used to structure the proposed framework and help with accommodating uncertainty, imposing interpretability, and controlling the sparsity and complexity of the proposed anomaly detection framework. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is also developed for model training using past data. Furthermore, the numerical experiments conducted using a simulated data set and a wind turbine data set demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for system response modeling and anomaly detection.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, these data are aggregated to compute publicly reported metrics describing high-level characteristics of grid performance. The current work explores the depth of insights that can be gained from public data, and the implications of losing visibility into heterogeneity in grid performance through aggregation. We present an exploratory analysis examining three years of high-resolution power interruption data collected by archiving information posted in real-time on the public-facing website of a utility in the Western United States. We report on the size, frequency and duration of individual power interruptions, and on spatio-temporal variability in aggregate reliability metrics. Our results show that metrics of grid performance can vary spatially and temporally by orders of magnitude, revealing heterogeneity that is not evidenced in publicly reported metrics.

Lastly, given open questions about whether grid performance is adequate to support societal needs, we recommend establishing pathways to make high-resolution power interruption data available to support policy research.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Statistical Bus Ranking for Flexible Robust Unit Commitment","Gupta, Amandeep; Anderson, C. Lindsay","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; robust unit commitment; bus ranking; flexible ramping; bootstrap aggregation; customizability; parallelizable","As the level of uncertain renewable capacity increases on power systems worldwide, industrial and academic researchers alike are seeking a scalable, transparent and effective approach to unit commitment under uncertainty. This paper presents a statistical ranking methodology that allows adaptive robust stochastic unit commitment using a modular structure, with much-needed flexibility. Specifically, this paper describes a bus ranking methodology that identifies the most critical buses based on a worst-case metric. An important innovation is the ability to identify alternative metrics on which to rank the uncertainty set-for example, to minimize economic dispatch cost or ramping needs, to provide a customized robust unit commitment solution. Compared to traditional robust unit commitment models, the proposed model combines statistical tools with analytical framework of power system networks. The resulting formulation is easily implementable and customizable to the needs of the system operator. The method and its applications are validated against other established approaches, showing equivalent solution to the state-of-the-art approach. Case studies were conducted on the IEEE-30, IEEE-118, and the pegase-1354 networks. In addition, the flexibility of bus ranking formulation is illustrated through implementation of alternative definitions of worst-case metrics. Results show that the bus ranking method performs as well as the best of these methods, with the provision of additional flexibility and potential for parallelization.","IEEE","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Electricity (OE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 236-245","","TPWRS-01722-2017","OE0000843; EPAS-1453615","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; EPAS-1453615","10.1109/tpwrs.2018.2864131","","2022-07-20T00:00:00Z","1871547","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1871547","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1871547","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","34"
"Stochastic risk-sensitive market integration for renewable energy: Application to ocean wave power plants","Sedzro, Kwami Senam A.; Kishore, Shalinee; Lamadrid, Alberto J.; Zuluaga, Luis F.","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; grid reliability; market design; renewable integration; energy storage; optimization; short-term reserve market","With the expected increase of intermittent renewable energy resources on the electric power grid, short-term reserve markets can prove to be a critical reliability asset. This paper introduces and tests a potential market structure that includes a short-term reserve market for renewable resources where the realized energy is drawn within the bounds of the hourly capacity offered. The study presents a risk-aware stochastic model that determines, based on the day-ahead offer derived using a classic newsvendor formula, the best intraday offers for a renewable energy power plant. The stochastic approach takes into account the uncertainties of energy production and market prices. The proposed risk-sensitive model aims to maximize the renewable power plant's revenues and minimize potential risks of loss in a multi-product multi-timescale market setup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, we study the case of a hypothetical 750-kW wave power plant coupled with energy storage. The study shows that the risk of profit loss is not uniformly distributed across the risk-aversion factor space. We also find that the introduction of the short-term reserve market results in a wider range of conditional value at risk while inducing 5% profit increase and a lower profit reduction across the risk range. In addition, the study reveals that the short-term reserve market is profitable for both the system operator and the wave energy power plant considered.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using Willingness to Pay to Forecast the Adoption of Solar Photovoltaics: A ''Parameterization + Calibration'' Approach","Dong, Changgui; Sigrin, Benjamin","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar photovoltaics; willingness to pay; adoption forecasting; parameterization; calibration","Distributed energy resources, such as rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), are likely to comprise a substantial fraction of new generation capacity in the United States. However, forecasting technology adoption based on people's willingness to pay (WTP) faces two major challenges: the stated-intention and omitted-variable biases. Previous solar adoption literature has neglected to address these two biases altogether. Here, we adopt a 'parameterization + calibration' approach to address both biases and estimate customers' WTP for PV. After collecting survey data on respondents' WTP for adopting PV, we characterize its empirical cumulative density function using a gamma distribution. We further calibrate the gamma distribution parameters using a national distributed PV adoption simulation model, finding the parameters that produce the best fit between simulated and historic solar adoption. We then show that the calibrated gamma distribution improves the raw WTP data after correcting for the two biases. Finally, we use our optimally-calibrated WTP to forecast market demand for residential PV at the county-level of the United States in 2020. Improving estimates of customer willingness to pay has significant implications for policy directly, e.g. estimating the effect of a proposed policy on technology adoption, and other regulatory processes that use forecasting, e.g. integrated resource planning.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Traffic speed data have far outpaced the availability and accuracy of real-time traffic volume information. Limited to a relatively small number of permanent and temporary traffic counters in any city, traffic volumes typically only cover a handful of roadways, with inconsistent temporal resolution. This work addressed this data gap by coupling a commercial data set of typical traffic speeds (by roadway and time of week) from TomTom to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration's Highway Performance Monitoring System database of annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts by roadway. This work is technically novel in its solution for establishing a national crosswalk between independent network geometries using spatial conflation and big data techniques. The resulting product is a national data set providing traffic speed and volume estimates under typical conditions for all U.S. roadways with AADT values.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using facility-level emissions data to estimate the technical potential of alternative thermal sources to meet industrial heat demand","McMillan, Colin A.; Ruth, Mark","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; industry; manufacturing; process heating; thermal energy","Industry is frequently highlighted as the world's largest energy-using end-use sector. More specifically, the demand for heat drives much of the demand for energy and fossil fuels in the industrial sector. We conduct a top-down analysis to characterize historical energy and fossil fuel use in 14 top-GHG-emitting industries in the United States, their heat demand requirements, and the potential to substitute heat from geothermal, solar thermal (including concentrating technologies), and small modular nuclear reactors to meet these needs while reducing fossil-fuel use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We base this analysis on publicly-available facility-level GHG emissions and fuel-combustion data, in addition to assumed requirements for process temperature, to demonstrate the potential value to industry energy analysts of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data. We estimate on a county level that the adoption of these alternative heat sources could have reduced 2015 fossil-fuel use by approximately 31% and combustion GHG emissions by approximately 24%. The most extensive substitution opportunities are in the ethyl alcohol manufacturing and wet corn-milling industries; petroleum refining represents the largest absolute emissions mitigation potential. This initial top-down analysis of substitution potential does not consider more detailed technical factors, including resource availability that will influence the actual deployment of alternative energy technologies. The analysis also does not consider the economic or market factors, including the expected cost to build and operate these generators. We do assume process byproducts that are extensively used for combustion fuels would not be good candidates for substitution for alternative energy generators. Based on these caveats, our analysis could be considered a top-range estimate for this mix of heat generators and industry heat demands. Any subsequent analysis of these alternate energy sources should increase the level of technical, economic, and policy detail.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This review paper summarizes the end-user economics of battery and load control technologies that increase the value of PV by controlling and temporally shifting PV output, an approach referred to as 'solar plus.' Solar plus can increase on-site PV use. The literature shows that these values justify the incremental costs of solar plus devices for a wide variety of technologies, geographies, and customer load profiles, especially for customers in three rate structure contexts: where PV is sold to the grid at a lower value than the customer's retail rate, in time-of-use rates where peak periods do not coincide with PV output, and in demand charge rates where load peaks do not coincide with PV output. Rate structure and policy reform may be necessary to ensure that increasing solar plus deployment provides both end-user and system-level benefits.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results indicate that DCFC charging rate can deteriorate considerably in cold temperatures. These findings may be used as a reference to identify and assess the regions that may suffer from slow charging. In conclusion, the problems associated with temperature effects on DCFC charging deserve greater attention as electrification of motor vehicles progresses and DCFC usage increases in the future.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Efficiency improvements and advanced control strategies have a significant impact in the reduction of energy costs and CO2 emissions. Building energy simulation is widely used to help planners, contractors, and building owners analyse diverse options regarding the planning and management of energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, recent advances in data processing and computing have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from large datasets, e.g., sensor data from buildings, and use them to develop building-specific adaptive and automatic energy controllers. Control algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning can tune themselves, are model-free, and economical to implement. In this paper, we introduce an integrated simulation environment that combines CitySim, a fast building energy simulator, and TensorFlow, a platform for efficient implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is achieved via Keras - an API for TensorFlow - and a set of text and csv files for data transfer between the applications.

In this memorandum, we outline the current state of animal agriculture, its resultant impacts on the environment and human health, and various policy proposals that Congress could enact to combat these issues. As of 2018, consumption of red meat (RM; includes beef, lamb, veal, and pork) in the US was 19.78 kg/capita higher than the global average (OECD 2018). Globally, animal agriculture accounts for approximately 15% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (FAO 2016) and adds to poor health of individuals who consume red meat.

"A critical review on questionnaire surveys in the field of energy-related occupant behaviour","Deme Belafi, Zsofia; Hong, Tianzhen; Reith, Andras","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Occupant behaviour; Questionnaire survey; Energy use in buildings; Energy efficiency; Behaviour modelling","Occupants perform various actions to satisfy their physical and non-physical needs in buildings. These actions greatly affect building operations and thus energy use. Clearly understanding and accurately modelling occupant behaviour in buildings are crucial to guide energy-efficient building design and operation, and to reduce the gap between design and actual energy performance of buildings. To study and understand occupant behaviour, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey is one of the most useful tools to gain insights on general behaviour patterns and drivers, and to find connections between human, social and local comfort parameters. In this study, 33 projects were reviewed from the energy-related occupant behaviour research literature that employed cross-sectional surveys or interviews for data collection from the perspective of findings, limitations and methodological challenges. This research shows that future surveys are needed to bridge the gaps in literature but they would need to encompass a multidisciplinary approach to do so as until now only environmental and engineering factors were considered in these studies. Insights from social practice theories and techniques must be acquired to deploy robust and unbiased questionnaire results, which will provide new, more comprehensive knowledge in the field, and therefore occupant behaviour could be better understood and represented in building performance simulation to support design and operation of low or net-zero energy buildings.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Hybridizing a geothermal power plant with concentrating solar power and thermal storage to increase power generation and dispatchability","McTigue, Joshua D.; Castro, Jose; Mungas, Greg; Kramer, Nick; King, John; Turchi, Craig; Zhu, Guangdong","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; thermal energy storage; geothermal power; retrofit; levelized cost of energy; hybrid power generation","Geothermal power plants often deploy less than their full power capacity due to declining geothermal resources. Integrating heat from a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector field increases the power output at low cost. This article considers five methods of solar heat addition in a double-flash geothermal plant. The most promising solution converts solar heat into electrical work with an efficiency of 24.3%. The economic feasibility and optimal sizing of the solar field and thermal stores are evaluated. A hybrid plant that increases power generation from 22 to 24 MWe has a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.07 +/- 0.01 $/kWhe. Adding three hours of storage increases the LCOE to 0.08 +/- 0.01 $/kWhe. Photovoltaic systems are considered to be a low-cost renewable technology, but an equivalent photovoltaic system with battery storage costs 0.15 +/- 0.07 $/kWhe due to the high cost and replacement rate of batteries compared to thermal storage. The hybrid plant also has a lower LCOE than a conventional CSP plant. If the dispatchability that thermal storage provides is rewarded with higher electricity prices, calculations indicate storage becomes an attractive investment when discharged power receives 1.75 times the typical price of electricity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Advanced vehicles powered by low-carbon sources of electricity or hydrogen offer an alternative to conventional fossil-fuelled technologies. Yet, despite ambitious pledges and investments by governments and automakers, it is by no means clear that these vehicles will ultimately reach mass-market consumers. In this work, we develop state-of-the-art representations of consumer preferences in multiple global energy-economy models, specifically focusing on the non-financial preferences of individuals. We employ these enhanced model formulations to analyse the potential for a low-carbon vehicle revolution up to 2050. Our analysis shows that a diverse set of measures targeting vehicle buyers is necessary to drive widespread adoption of clean technologies. Carbon pricing alone is insufficient to bring low-carbon vehicles to the mass market, though it may have a supporting role in ensuring a decarbonized energy supply.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This article quantifies the influence of key incentives and enabling factors like charging infrastructure and receptive demographics on PEV adoption. The study focuses on three central questions. First, do consumers respond to certain types of state level vehicle purchase incentives? Second, does the density of public charging infrastructure increase PEV purchases? Finally, does the impact of various factors differ for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) and vehicle attributes within each category? Based on a regression of vehicle purchase data from 2008 to 2016, we found that tax incentives and charging infrastructure significantly influence per capita PEV purchases. Within tax incentives, rebates are generally more effective than tax credits. BEV purchases are more affected by tax incentives than PHEVs. The correlation of public charging and vehicle purchases increases with the battery-only driving range of a PHEV, while decreasing with increasing driving range of BEVs. Results indicate that early investments in charging infrastructure, particularly along highways; tax incentives targeting BEVs at the lower end of the price premium and PHEVs with higher battery only driving range, and better reflection of the environmental cost of owning gasoline vehicles are likely to increase PEV adoption in the U.S.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It provides insight into the near-term and future solar-plus-storage market opportunities across the U.S. We explore the impacts of location, building load profile, technology cost, utility rate structure, and policies on solar-plus-storage economic viability, and identify which factors are most significant to project economics. While savings from storage-only projects are largely derived from demand charge reductions, solar combined with storage also provides significant energy charge savings. A common assumption is that load profiles with peaks are likely candidates for savings from storage, due to the opportunity for demand charge reduction. Our results indicate that potential for savings from combining solar with storage is independent of building load variability, likely due to the energy cost reductions from the solar. Systems are more often economical under time of use and demand charge rates, particularly when demand charges are >$10 per kilowatt. Where systems were found to be economical, expected lifetime savings averaged between 7%-10%, with savings of 30% in numerous cases. Near term markets exist for solar-plus-storage in locations such as California and New York. As technology prices drop, the number of building types that can benefit increase, and additional markets appear in Colorado, New Mexico, and Alaska.

We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these most difficult-to-decarbonize services, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but these options are expensive in comparison to current costs of services.

Scenario analyses and case study were applied to illustrate the results, which show five basic conclusions. (1) Low-carbon development doesn't require eliminating energy consumption completely during urbanization (2) The average level of urbanization is relatively low owing to the large disparities among provinces and the provinces’ economic development. Though the development of low-carbon in the 30 provinces is generally rapid, the gap between the highest provinces and the lowest provinces is relatively large because of their different socio-economic features. (3) Much more attention should be paid to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita. The quality of public social service,the basic and medical insurance coverage for the elderly, the community service coverage in infrastructure and the green design during urban construction should be improved. (4) The coordination of CUS is closely related to the different development stages and geographic locations of each province.

This article analyzes the storage duration required to reduce VG curtailment under high-VG scenarios. The three analysis scenarios assume VG provides 55% of the electricity demand in the largely isolated Electricity Reliability Council of Texas grid system in 2050, with three different proportions of wind and solar generation. Across the three scenarios, 11%-16% of VG energy is curtailed without storage due to system-generation constraints. When 8.5 GW of storage capacity with 4 h of duration are added, curtailment is reduced to 8%-10% of VG. Additional storage duration further reduces curtailment, but with rapidly diminishing returns. At least half the potential avoided-curtailment benefits are realized with 8 h of storage, and the first 4 h provide the largest benefit. At VG penetrations up to 55%, there appears to be little incremental benefit in deploying very-long-duration or seasonal storage.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fuel consumption for various driving styles in conventional and hybrid electric vehicles: Integrating driving cycle predictions with fuel consumption optimization","Rios-Torres, Jackeline; Liu, Jun; Khattak, Asad","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Driving cycle; equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS); fuel consumption; hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); optimal energy management","Here, improving fuel economy and lowering emissions are key societal goals. Standard driving cycles, pre-designed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), have long been used to estimate vehicle fuel economy in laboratory-controlled conditions. They have also been used to test and tune different energy management strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This paper aims to estimate fuel consumption for a conventional vehicle and a HEV using personalized driving cycles extracted from real-world data to study the effects of different driving styles and vehicle types on fuel consumption when compared to the estimates based on standard driving cycles. To do this, we extracted driving cycles for conventional vehicles and HEVs from a large-scale U.S. survey that contains real-world GPS-based driving records. Next, the driving cycles were assigned to one of three categories: volatile, normal, or calm. Then, the driving cycles were used along with a driver-vehicle simulation that captures driver decisions (vehicle speed during a trip), powertrain, and vehicle dynamics to estimate fuel consumption for conventional vehicles and HEVs with power-split powertrain. To further optimize fuel consumption for HEVs, the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is applied. The results show that depending on the driving style and the driving scenario, conventional vehicle fuel consumption can vary widely compared with standard EPA driving cycles. Specifically, conventional vehicle fuel consumption was 13% lower in calm urban driving, but almost 34% higher for volatile highway driving compared with standard EPA driving cycles. Interestingly, when a driving cycle is predicted based on the application of case-based reasoning and used to tune the power distribution in a hybrid electric vehicle, its fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 12% in urban driving. Implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The approach is data-driven, combining Geographic Information Systems analysis of an extensive dataset of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) measurements collected by the Department of Homeland Security with a statistical model trained on these same data. The model developed herein can predict the quantity of suitable roof area where LiDAR data is not available. This analysis focuses on small buildings (1000 to 5000 square feet) which account for more than half of the total available rooftop space in these data (58%) and demonstrate a greater variability in suitability compared to larger buildings which are nearly all suitable for PV installations. This paper presents new results characterizing the size, shape and suitability of US rooftops with respect to PV installations. Overall 28% of small building roofs appear suitable in the continental United States for rooftop solar. Nationally, small building rooftops could accommodate an expected 731 GW of PV capacity and generate 926 TWh/year of PV energy on 4920 km2 of suitable rooftop space which equates to 25% the current US electricity sales.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although monitoring-based commissioning (MBCx) can reduce energy waste by up to 20%, many buildings still underperform due to issues such as unnoticed system faults and inefficient operational procedures. While there are technical barriers that impede the MBCx process, such as data quality, the focuses of this paper are the non-technical, behavioral and organizational, barriers that contribute to issues initiating and implementing MBCx. In particular, this paper discusses cognitive biases, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes in energy efficiency decisions, resulting in missed opportunities for energy savings. This paper provides evidence of cognitive biases in decisions during the MBCx process using qualitative data from over 40 public and private sector organizations. The results describe barriers resulting from cognitive biases, listed in descending order of occurrence, including: risk aversion, social norms, choice overload, status quo bias, information overload, professional bias, and temporal discounting. Building practitioners can use these results to better understand potential cognitive biases, in turn allowing them to establish best practices and make more informed decisions. Finally, researchers can use these results to empirically test specific decision interventions and facilitate more energy efficient decisions.","Elseiver","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Microgrid to enable optimal distributed energy retail and end-user demand response","Jin, Ming; Feng, Wei; Marnay, Chris; Spanos, Costas","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Microgrid; Demand response; Energy pricing; Unit commitment; Distributed energy resources; Rate design","In the face of unprecedented challenges in environmental sustainability and grid resilience, there is an increasingly held consensus regarding the adoption of distributed and renewable energy resources such as microgrids (MGs), and the utilization of flexible electric loads by demand response (DR) to potentially drive a necessary paradigm shift in energy production and consumption patterns. However, the potential value of distributed generation and demand flexibility has not yet been fully realized in the operation of MGs. This study investigates the pricing and operation strategy with DR for a MG retailer in an integrated energy system (IES). Based on co-optimizing retail rates and MG dispatch formulated as a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem, our model devises a dynamic pricing scheme that reflects the cost of generation and promotes DR, in tandem with an optimal dispatch plan that exploits spark spread and facilitates the integration of renewables, resulting in improved retailer profits and system stability. Main issues like integrated energy coupling and customer bill reduction are addressed during pricing to ensure rates competitiveness and customer protection. By evaluating on real datasets, the system is demonstrated to optimally coordinate storage, renewables, and combined heat and power (CHP), reduce carbon dioxide emission while maintaining profits, and effectively alleviate the PV curtailment problem. Finally, the model can be used by retailers and MG operators to optimize their operations, as well as regulators to design new utility rates in support of the ongoing transformation of energy systems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The first trend is from a world containing a diversity of energy currencies to one whose predominant currency is electricity, driven by electricity’s transportability, exchangeability, and steadily decreasing cost. The second trend is from electricity generated from a diversity of sources to electricity generated predominantly by free-fuel sources, driven by their steadily decreasing cost and long-term abundance. These trends necessitate a just-emerging third trend: from a grid in which electricity is transported unidirectionally, traded at near-static prices, and consumed under direct human control; to a grid in which electricity is transported bidirectionally, traded at dynamic prices, and consumed under human-tailored artificial agential control. These trends point toward a future in which energy is not costly, scarce, or inefficiently deployed but instead is affordable, abundant, and efficiently deployed; with major economic, geo-political, and environmental benefits to humanity.","Materials Research Society - Cambridge University Press","","Sandia National Lab.

"U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle Air Conditioning Fuel Use and Impact of Solar/Thermal Control Technologies","Rugh, John Palmer; Kreutzer, Cory; Kekelia, Bidzina; Titov, Gene; Lustbader, Jason","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; environmental regulations and standards; greenhouse gas emissions; fuel economy; weather and climate; carbon dioxide; fuel consumption; simulators; air conditioning","To reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from mobile air conditioning (A/C) systems, 'U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards' identified solar/thermal technologies such as solar control glazings, solar reflective paint, and active and passive cabin ventilation in an off-cycle credit menu. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) researchers developed a sophisticated analysis process to calculate U.S. light-duty A/C fuel use that was used to assess the impact of these technologies, leveraging thermal and vehicle simulation analysis tools developed under previous U.S. Department of Energy projects. Representative U.S. light-duty driving behaviors and weighting factors including time-of-day of travel, trip duration, and time between trips were characterized and integrated into the analysis. In addition, U.S. weather conditions weighted based on light-duty vehicle registrations were generated and used for the analysis. Three representative vehicle types for the light-duty fleet were selected based on registration data containing vehicle size information. These key inputs were used to support a weighted parametric analysis that quantified vehicle thermal load, vehicle accessory load, and vehicle fuel use. This analysis estimates that 7.6 billion gallons of fuel a year are used in the United States for vehicle A/C, equivalent to 6.1% of the total national light-duty vehicle fuel use. This equates to 30.0 gallons/year per vehicle or 23.5 grams CO<sub>2</sub> per mile (g/mi) for an average U.S. light-duty vehicle. A/C is a significant contributor to national fuel use; therefore, technologies that reduce A/C loads have an opportunity to reduce fuel consumption, reduce imported oil, and improve energy security. Implementing solar control glass reduced the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.0 g/mi and the reduction due to solar reflective paint was 0.8 g/mi. The active and passive ventilation strategies as defined in this analysis only reduced emissions by 0.1 and 0.2 g/mi, respectively. This analysis shows the potential to reduce operational costs, A/C fuel use, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by implementing advanced vehicle climate control technologies including the solar/thermal technologies.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Examining the Potential for Agricultural Benefits from Pollinator Habitat at Solar Facilities in the United States","Walston, Leroy J.; Mishra, Shruti K.; Hartmann, Heidi M.; Hlohowskyj, Ihor; McCall, James; Macknick, Jordan","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; pollinators; agriculture; ecosystem services; solar energy; co-location; agrivoltaics","Of the many roles insects serve for ecosystem function, pollination is possibly the most important service directly linked to human well-being. However, land use changes have contributed to the decline of pollinators and their habitats. In agricultural landscapes that also support renewable energy developments such as utility-scale solar energy [USSE] facilities, opportunities may exist to conserve insect pollinators and locally restore their ecosystem services through the implementation of vegetation management approaches that aim to provide and maintain pollinator habitat at USSE facilities. As a first step toward understanding the potential agricultural benefits of solar-pollinator habitat, we identified areas of overlap between USSE facilities and surrounding pollinator-dependent crop types in the United States (U.S.). Using spatial data on solar energy developments and crop types across the U.S., and assuming a pollinator foraging distance of 1.5 km, we identified over 3,500 km2 of agricultural land near existing and planned USSE facilities that may benefit from increased pollination services through the creation of pollinator habitat at the USSE facilities. The following five pollinator-dependent crop types accounted for over 90% of the agriculture near USSE facilities, and these could benefit most from the creation of pollinator habitat at existing and planned USSE facilities: soybeans, alfalfa, cotton, almonds, and citrus. We discuss how our results may be used to understand potential agro-economic implications of solar-pollinator habitat. Our results show that ecosystem service restoration through the creation of pollinator habitat could improve the sustainability of large-scale renewable energy developments in agricultural landscapes.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, in this study, limited field data were collected on randomly selected new homes in eight US states with a goal of evaluating energy code compliance and energy savings potential. The limited data do not allow the derivation of comprehensive model inputs for each individual home sampled, let alone for the entire unknown residential construction stock. Therefore, we used prototype buildings to construct a large number of models and utilized bootstrap sampling to draw inputs from the limited data.

"Tariff Structures to Encourage Micro-Grid Deployment in Sub-Saharan Africa: Review and Recent Trends","Reber, Tim; Booth, Samuel","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; mini-grid; micro-grid; tariff; rural electrification; energy access","This article reviews trends for micro-grid tariffs in Sub-Saharan Africa from two perspectives: guidelines for setting tariffs and methods for structuring tariffs. Different approaches are briefly described, and general benefits and drawbacks presented based on recent experiences and available literature. The pace of micro-grid deployment has suffered from a lack of private sector investment, which is often inhibited by unfavorable policies and uncertainty around tariffs. Traditional utility tariffs are too low to allow micro-grid investors to recover their full costs, but a variety of new approaches can be applied to address these challenges. Broad consensus suggests that cost-reflective tariffs are a critical enabler for micro-grid scale-up. Such tariffs can be coupled with subsidies or with hybridized approaches as well as unique new methods of tapping alternative revenue streams to maintain affordability for low-income customers and financial sustainability for micro-grids. There is no one-size-fits-all approach so long as lifetime costs can be recouped.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Achieving innovation goals decreases CO2 emissions in all models, regardless of natural gas price, due to increased energy efficiency and low-carbon generation becoming more cost competitive. For the models that include domestic natural gas markets, achieving innovation goals lowers wholesale electricity prices, but this effect diminishes as projected natural gas prices increase. Higher natural gas prices lead to higher wholesale electricity prices but fewer coal capacity retirements. A CO2 electric power sector emissions cap influences electric sector evolution under reference technology assumptions but has little to no incremental influence when added to innovation goals. Long-term, meeting innovation goals achieves a generation mix with similar CO2 emissions compared to the CO2 policy but with smaller increases to wholesale electricity prices. In the short-term, the relative effect on wholesale prices differs by model. Finally, higher natural gas prices, achieving innovation goals, and the combination of the two, increases the amount of renewable generation that is cost-effective to build and operate while slowing the growth of natural-gas fired generation, which is the predominant generation type in 2050 under reference conditions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Forecasting Peak Electricity Demand for Los Angeles Considering Higher Air Temperatures due to Climate Change","Burillo, Daniel; Chester, Mikhail V.; Pincetl, Stephanie; Fournier, Eric D.; Reyna, Janet","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; building energy modeling; peak demand; demand forecasting; spatial analysis; heat waves; climate change","We report that Los Angeles County (LAC) is a large urbanized region with 9.7 million residents (as of 2010) and aging infrastructure. Population forecasts indicate that LAC will become home to an additional 1.2-3.1 million residents through 2060. Additionally, climate forecasts based upon representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5 and 8.5 indicate that average air temperatures will increase by 1-4 degrees C (2-7 degrees F) in the region. Both of these factors are expected to result in higher summertime peak electricity demand due to growth in the number of buildings, the percentage of installed air conditioners (ACs), and the additional cooling load on those air conditioners. In order to understand potential power reliability issues, and support infrastructure planning efforts, a long-term peak demand forecast was developed using hourly residential and commercial (R&C) building energy models. Peak hour electricity demand was estimated to increase from 9.5 to 12.8 GW for R&C sectors, to 13.0-17.3 GW (2-36%) and 14.7-19.2 GW (16-51%) by 2060 for the population forecasts from the California Department of Finance and the Southern California Association of Governments respectively. While marginal increases in ambient air temperature due to climate change accounted for only 4-8% of future increases in peak demand, differences in annual maximum temperatures within the 20-year periods affected results by 40-66% indicating a high sensitivity to heat waves. Population growth of at least 1 million people is anticipated to occur mostly in the northern cities of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Santa Clarita, bringing an additional 0.4-1 GW of peak demand in those regions. Building and AC efficiency are anticipated to improve as national and state efficiency standards increase, and as older, less efficient units are replaced; this could offset some of the projected increases in peak demand. Furthermore, development of shared wall, multi-family dwelling units could enable population growth of up to 3 million people without increasing peak demand.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A Greyrock Flare Gas-to-Fuels<sup>TM</sup> conversion process at an Ohio oil well was used as the base case for this LCA. The liquid fuel produced directly from associated gas is comprised primarily of premium synthetic diesel with a small amount of synthetic gasoline. In this LCA scenario, the synthetic diesel and synthetic gasoline are blended at 20 and 10 vol% with petroleum diesel and gasoline, respectively. While the synthetic diesel fuel can be used as is (100%), the 20 vol% synthetic diesel blend (with petroleum diesel) was found to significantly improve engine performance, increase fuel economy, and reduce emissions. The direct conversion of associated gas to synthetic diesel fuels globally could reduce emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> by up to 356 and 5.96 million metric tons/year, respectively, resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by about 113.3 and 92.2% (20 year global warming potential) and 73.8 and 50.7% (100 year global warming potential) for synthetic diesel and gasoline fuels when compared to petroleum-derived gasoline fuels, respectively. Likewise, diesel criteria emissions could be reduced globally by up to 23.3, 0.374, 42.4, and 61.3 million metric tons/year globally for CO, particulates, NOx, and hydrocarbons, respectively. The potential economic benefit of this approach is that up to 5.30 and 71.1 billion liters of synthetic fuels could be produced each year in the US and globally from associated gas, respectively.","Springer Science + Business Media","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These parallel efforts can provide an untapped synergistic opportunity for clean transportation to be an enabler for a clean electricity grid. To quantify this potential, we forecast the hourly system-wide balancing problems arising out to 2025 as more renewables are deployed and load continues to grow. We then quantify the system-wide balancing benefits from EVs modulating the charging or discharging of their batteries to mitigate renewable intermittency, without compromising the mobility needs of drivers. Our results show that with its EV deployment target and with only one-way charging control of EVs, California can achieve much of the same benefit of its Storage Mandate for mitigating renewable intermittency, but at a small fraction of the cost. Moreover, EVs provide many times these benefits if two-way charging control becomes widely available. Thus, EVs support the state's renewable integration targets while avoiding much of the tremendous capital investment of stationary storage that can instead be applied towards further deployment of clean vehicles.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A refueling infrastructure network that guarantees adequate coverage and expands in line with vehicle sales is required for FCEVs to be successfully adopted by private customers. In this article, we provide an overview of modelling methodologies used to project hydrogen refueling infrastructure requirements to support FCEV adoption, and we describe, in detail, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's scenario evaluation and regionalization analysis (SERA) model. As an example, we use SERA to explore two alternative scenarios of FCEV adoption: one in which FCEV deployment is limited to California and several major cities in the United States; and one in which FCEVs reach widespread adoption, becoming a major option as passenger vehicles across the entire country.

By reducing the thicknesses of the heterostructures, an enhancement in carrier-carrier scattering is observed in the Fermi liquid behavior, followed by a metal to insulator transition in the electrical transport. The insulating behavior is described by activated transport, and its onset occurs near 1 electron per Ti occupation within the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> well, providing evidence for a Mott driven transition. We also discuss the role that structure and gradients in strain could play in enhancing the carrier density. The manipulation of Mott metal-insulator behavior in oxides grown directly on Si opens the pathway to harnessing strongly correlated phenomena in device technologies.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

As a result, undesired situations may arise, such as those experienced by both systems during the winter of 2013/2014 in the northeastern United States. In this work, we consider the technical challenges and present a Combined Electricity and Gas Expansion (CEGE) planning model. The CEGE model minimizes the cost of meeting gas and electricity demand during high stress conditions and introduces an elasticity model for analysis of gas-price volatility caused by congestion. The underlying mathematical formulation considers recent advances in convex approximations to make the problem computationally tractable when applied to large-scale CEGE instances.

However, mobility demand has not yet been considered in electricity planning and management. Here, we present a method to estimate individual mobility of PEV drivers at fine temporal and spatial resolution, by integrating three unique datasets of mobile phone activity of 1.39 million Bay Area residents, census data and the PEV drivers survey data. Through coupling the uncovered patterns of PEV mobility with the charging activity of PEVs in 580,000 session profiles obtained in the same region, we recommend changes in PEV charging times of commuters at their work stations and shave the pronounced peak in power demand. Informed by the tariff of electricity, we calculate the monetary gains to incentivize the adoption of the recommendations. Furthermore, these results open avenues for planning for the future of coupled transportation and electricity needs using personalized data.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Energy; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 484-493","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 2058-7546; PII: 136; TRN: US1902295","10.1038/s41560-018-0136-x","","2022-05-24T00:00:00Z","1463391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1463391","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1463391","Nature Energy","6","3"

In this study, a multistage type-2-fuzzy interval-stochastic programming (MTIP) method is developed, which extends upon the existing multistage stochastic programming (MSP) by allowing uncertainties expressed as probabilistic distributions, interval values and type-2 fuzzy sets to be effectively incorporated within the optimization framework. Through coupling air quality index (AQI) with MTIP, an AQI-MTIP model is formulated for energy and environmental systems (EES) management of Tianjin. A number of scenarios based on changed AQIs are examined to analyze the impacts of environmental requirements on the city's energy system. Results indicate that (i) with the improvement of environmental requirement, utilization of clean energies (especially natural gas) is provoked markedly; (ii) PM{sub 2.5} is the primary pollutant, 64.50% of which should be reduced each period to maintain the city's air quality at a health-safe level. These findings can help decision makers adjust energy structure, make effective mitigation strategy, and gain deep insight into the relationship between energy consumption and environmental requirement.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.001","","","","United States","2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research; Journal Volume: 167; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of this market concentration on prices are tested using a rich dataset of residential solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. A novel hypothesis is explored that the effects of market concentration may be non-monotonic. Prices may decline in market concentration due to efficiency gains associated with returns to scale but increase in concentration in already concentrated markets due to increasing market power. Finally, the results of an econometric model provide evidence to support the non-monotonic hypothesis. However, the data suggest that the relationship between prices and firm scale is nuanced, and that both large- and small-scale PV installers may wield efficiency advantages.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With transportation accounting for 27 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, planning professionals are increasingly seeking ways to curb vehicular travel to advance sustainable, vibrant, and healthy communities. Although there is considerable understanding of the various factors that influence household vehicular travel, there is little knowledge of their relative contribution to explaining variance in household VMT. This paper presents a holistic analysis to identify the relative contribution of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, built environment attributes, residential self-selection effects, and social and spatial dependency effects in explaining household VMT production. The modeling framework employs a simultaneous equations model of residential location (density) choice and household VMT generation. The analysis is performed using household travel survey data from the New York metropolitan region. Model results showed insignificant spatial dependency effects, with socio-demographic variables explaining 33 percent, density (as a key measure of built environment attributes) explaining 12 percent, and self-selection effects explaining 11 percent of the total variance in the logarithm of household VMT. The remaining 44 percent remains unexplained and attributable to omitted variables and unobserved idiosyncratic factors, calling for further research in this domain to better understand the relative contribution of various drivers of household VMT.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These forecasts are an important input to integrated resource planning (IRP) processes involving utilities, regulators, and other stake-holders. Despite their importance, however, there has been little analysis of long term utility load forecasting accuracy. We conduct a retrospective analysis of long term load forecasts on twelve Western U. S. electric utilities in the mid-2000s to find that most overestimated both energy consumption and peak demand growth. A key reason for this was the use of assumptions that led to an overestimation of economic growth. We find that the complexity of forecast methods and the accuracy of these forecasts are mildly correlated. In addition, sensitivity and risk analysis of load growth and its implications for capacity expansion were not well integrated with subsequent implementation. As a result, we review changes in the utilities load forecasting methods over the subsequent decade, and discuss the policy implications of long term load forecast inaccuracy and its underlying causes.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Few studies have included the value of resilience when sizing PV and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), and none have included the cost to island a PV and BESS, grid-connected costs and benefits, and the value of resilience. This work presents a novel method for incorporating the value of resilience provided by a PV and BESS into a techno-economic optimization model. Including the value of resilience in the design of a cost-optimal PV and BESS generally increases the system capacities, and in some cases makes a system economical where it was not before. For example, for a large hotel in Anaheim, CA no system is economical without resilience valued; however, with a $5317/hr value of resilience a 363 kW and 60 kWh solar and BESS provides a net present value of $50,000. Lastly, we discuss the effect of the 'islandable premium', which must be balanced against the benefits from serving critical loads during outages. Case studies show that the islandable premium can vary widely, which highlights the necessity for case-by-case solutions in a rapidly developing market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Various transactive approaches are being developed for problems in power systems involving self-interested asset owners with privacy concerns. However, there has been very limited work on evaluating and comparing their performance. In this paper, a systematic performance evaluation procedure is presented for the comparison among different approaches in terms of their performance under practical conditions such as information uncertainties, individual rationality, network effects, and so on. This procedure is applied to evaluate and compare two existing transactive energy systems using double-auction market, where both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics are proposed. As a result, the detailed case studies also illustrate the performance limitations of existing double-auction-based transactive approaches, and provide useful insights on the necessary design improvements for practical applications.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The impact of planning reserve margins in long-term planning models of the electricity sector","Reimers, Andrew; Cole, Wesley; Frew, Bethany","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; planning reserve margin; NERC; capacity expansion","The planning reserve margin is the predominant metric used in long-term planning models to ensure the resource adequacy of projected power systems. Considerable work has been done to estimate the contribution of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, to the planning reserve margin, but little work has been done to assess what planning reserve margin should be used in planning models. Typically, U.S.-based models use the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)-recommended reserve margin levels. However, historical reserve margins have often exceeded the NERC-recommended levels, suggesting that the use of NERC-recommended levels in planning models may negatively bias projected future capacity investments relative to real-world trends. Using the Regional Energy Deployment System capacity expansion model, we show that setting the planning reserve margin to observed levels in lieu of the NERC-recommended levels leads to substantial differences in near-term capacity additions. Scenarios using alternative specifications for the reserve margin resulted in increased national solar builds of 20-100 GW. Given that the magnitude on results from altering the reserve margin level is similar to or greater than many policies frequently analyzed with planning models, careful consideration of the reserve margin level is crucial for developing accurate power sector projections.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As utilities, regulators, and policymakers determine how to achieve optimal levels of electricity reliability while considering how best to prepare for future disruptions in power, the related issue of how much it costs when customers lose power remains a largely unanswered question. In 2006, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory developed an end-use based framework that estimates the cost of power interruptions in the U.S that has served as a foundational paper using the best available, yet far from perfect, information at that time. Since then, an abundance of work has been done to improve the quality and availability of information that now allow us to make a much more robust assessment of the cost of power interruptions to U.S. customers. In this paper, we find that the total U.S. cost of sustained power interruptions is 44 billion dollars per year (2015-) -25% more than the 26 billion dollars per year in 2002- (or 35 billion dollars per year in 2015-) estimated in our 2006 study.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The Economic Impacts of High Wind Penetration Scenarios in the United States","Cohen, Stuart M.; Caron, Justin","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; electricity; wind; general equilibrium; capacity expansion; welfare; renewables; distributional effects","The U.S. electric sector is experiencing rapid increases in renewable generation with an expectation of continued growth. We examine the impacts of increased wind electricity on the U.S. economy using a hybrid model that links a detailed electric sector model (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System [ReEDS]) with a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's U.S. Regional Energy Policy [USREP] model). Increasing wind capacity displaces fossil fuels for electricity generation, which depresses fossil fuel prices and reduces economy-wide CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Competitive wind deployment in the reference scenario achieves these outcomes with lower electricity prices than a scenario with wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. Lower fossil fuel and electricity prices benefit low-income households, but the dominant economic impacts are driven by increased electric sector investment and capital returns, which primarily benefit those with higher incomes. Overall, cost-competitive wind provides benefits to the U.S. economy that are initially low but rise beyond 2030 to achieve cumulative welfare and GDP improvements of $110 and $111 billion through 2050. Prescribing additional wind deployment (meeting 35% of demand by 2050) increases post-2030 electricity prices but not more so than keeping wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. The negative effect of higher prices on welfare, however, is outweighed by higher returns from the additional wind investment. While these changes favor higher income classes, we find economy-wide benefits through 2040. These benefits diminish by 2050, but the cumulative additional gains through 2050, beyond the reference case, are $192 billion in welfare and $150 billion in GDP.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our results indicate that there is a bias between predicted and measured energy, even when controlling for factors like grid curtailment and resource variability. We also find that our results depend on the assumptions we make during analysis, which we quantify with a sensitivity analysis. This method allows the estimation of uncertainty we have in our findings. When we account for reasonable ranges of model assumptions, we find that, in the most optimistic case, there is still a bulk -5.5% bias when estimating pre-construction energy generation.

The strategy involves the pre-synthesis of 125 x 12 nm Sm(OH)<sub>3</sub> nanorods and 10 nm Co nanoparticles followed by self-assembly of these nanorods and nanoparticles into Sm(OH)<sub>3</sub>-Co nanocomposites. Once embedded in CaO matrix, the nanocomposite is subject to high temperature (850 °C) annealing in the presence of Ca, leading to the formation of 125 x 10 nm SmCo<sub>5</sub> nanoplates, which are dispersible in ethanol, allowing the alignment in epoxy resin under a 20 kOe magnetic field. The aligned SmCo<sub>5</sub> nanoplates show a square hysteresis behavior with room temperature coercivity reaching 30.1 kOe, which is among the highest values ever reported for SmCo<sub>5</sub> made from chemical methods. The work provides a new approach to high-performance anisotropic SmCo<sub>5</sub> for permanent magnet applications.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However price dispersion and limited customer access to PV quotes prevents some prospective customers from obtaining low price offers. This study shows that improved customer access to prices - also known as price transparency - is a potential policy lever for further PV price reductions. We use customer search and strategic pricing theory to show that PV installation companies face incentives to offer lower prices in markets with more price transparency. We test this theoretical framework using a unique residential PV quote dataset. Our results show that installers offer lower prices to customers that are expected to receive more quotes. Our study provides a rationale for policies to improve price transparency in residential PV markets.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In fact, 55 countries have included building energy efficiency in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This research uses building energy code implementation in six cities across different continents as case studies to assess what it may take for countries to implement the ambitions of their energy efficiency goals. Specifically, we look at the cases of Bogota, Colombia; Da Nang, Vietnam; Eskisehir, Turkey; Mexico City, Mexico; Rajkot, India; and Tshwane, South Africa, all of which are “deep dive” cities under the Sustainable Energy for All's Building Efficiency Accelerator. The research focuses on understanding the baseline with existing gaps in implementation and coordination. The methodology used a combination of surveys on code status and interviews with stakeholders at the local and national level, as well as review of published documents. We looked at code development, implementation, and evaluation. The cities are all working to improve implementation, however, the challenges they currently face include gaps in resources, capacity, tools, and institutions to check for compliance. Better coordination between national and local governments could help improve implementation, but that coordination is not yet well established. For example, all six of the cities reported that there was little to no involvement of local stakeholders in development of the national code; only one city reported that it had access to national funding to support code implementation. More robust coordination could better link cities with capacity building and funding for compliance, and ensure that the code reflects local priorities. By understanding gaps in implementation, it can also help in designing more targeted interventions to scale up energy savings.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Rules of the rooftop: Platform design and price reductions in an online solar photovoltaic marketplace in the United States","Leibowicz, Benjamin D.; Punjabi, Kunal; O’Shaughnessy, Eric; Margolis, Robert","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar energy; pricing; platform design; consumer search","Residential solar photovoltaic (PV) customers typically obtain price quotes directly from installers, a process with high consumer search costs that enable price dispersion and can discourage adoption. Recently, however, customers are increasingly shopping for PV using third-party online platforms that make it easier to obtain and compare quotes from multiple installers. While early evidence indicates that these platforms make the PV market more transparent and lower prices, the literature suggests that market outcomes are critically linked to detailed aspects of platform design. In this study, we econometrically analyze a unique dataset of quotes offered in the online PV marketplace EnergySage to investigate how four changes to the platform design have influenced quote prices and transaction prices. We find that the largest reductions in quote prices ($0.11/ W) and transaction prices ($0.15/W) were associated with the introduction of a price guidance information feature for installers. While educating and informing customers has repeatedly emerged as a policy priority for bolstering PV markets, these results suggest that the same should be true on the supply side. We also find that customers are willing to pay higher transaction prices for systems with higher-quality panels, dispelling concerns that online PV marketplaces lead to a 'race to the bottom' phenomenon by emphasizing price at the expense of quality.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The data on the map have been used to conduct the first regional analysis of soiling distribution in the United States. We found that most of the soiling occurs in the southwestern United States, with Southern California counties experiencing the greatest losses because of the high particulate matter concentrations and the long dry periods. Moreover, we employed five spatial-interpolation techniques to investigate the possibility of estimating soiling at a site using data from nearby sites. We found that coefficients of determination of up to 78% between estimated and measured soiling ratios, meaning that, by using selective sampling, soiling losses can be predicted using the data on the map with a root-mean-square error of as low as 1.1%.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As important members in the power system, both generators and loads should take the responsibility of carbon reduction and thus carbon obligation is supposed to be allocated between both sides. Consequently, the carbon obligation allocation between the generation side and the demand side is proposed, and the problem is modeled as a cooperative game based cost allocation problem. The Aumann-Shapley method is used to solve the problem. The mechanism of allocating carbon obligation in both generation side and load side is compared with the allocation only on the generation side and the load side. The results of case study show that both generators and loads take the responsibility of emission reduction of the power system in the proposed mechanism, which can stimulate the energy saving and consumption reduction behavior of generators and loads and reduce the carbon emission of the power system.","State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We present a methodology to quantify the amount and value of resiliency provided by REHS, and ways to monetize this resiliency value through insurance premium discounts. A case study of buildings in New York City demonstrates how implementing REHS in place of traditional backup diesel generators can double the amount of outage survivability, with an added value of $781,200. For a Superstorm Sandy type event, results indicate that insurance premium reductions could support up to 4% of the capital cost of REHS, and the potential exists to prevent up to $2.5 billion in business interruption losses with increased REHS deployment.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The wet resources considered in this study are wastewater sludge, animal manure, food waste, and FOG (fats, oils, and greases). This study is the first to achieve results below national level, at the finest geographic resolution. Our analysis indicates that about 566 teragrams (Tg) of wet WTE resources are generated annually in the United States.

One such avoided cost that has received little attention is the market price response, or how distributed PV generation reduces utilities' procurement costs and, consequently, consumers' costs through reduced wholesale electricity prices in the short-term. We quantify the reduction in day-ahead wholesale electricity prices to distributed PV generation in California (CA) from 2013 through 2015. Using a database of all distributed PV systems in the three CA investor owned utilities, we estimate historic hourly distributed PV generation using three methods that we validate with metered generation from 205 PV systems. Via multiple linear regression, we then estimate electricity price reductions due to distributed PV generation. Across the three methods used to estimate PV generation, distributed PV generation reduced hourly median (mean) wholesale electricity prices by up to $2.7-3.1/MWh ($2.9-3.2/MWh) ($2015), or by 7-8% (8-9%). Lower wholesale prices reduced utilities' energy procurement costs in the day-ahead market by up to $650-730 million ($2015) from 2013 through 2015. These avoided costs are similar to other avoided costs commonly included in value of solar studies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There is a growing body of literature evaluating the extent of this corresponding price reduction, termed 'incentive pass-through', typically finding nearly complete path-through for host-owned systems. However, few studies hitherto had the data to reliably estimate path-through for third-party owned systems, which comprise most of new installations over this period. This study evaluates incentive pass-through for third-party owned systems in California between 2010 and 2014. The estimation results show path-through rate is around 62%, suggesting that unlike host-owned systems, a portion of the incentive reduced the contract price of the system and the rest of the incentive was retained by the installer.

However, the potential value to the grid from managed charging has not been fully quantified. This paper adopts the tools used in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's California Low Carbon Grid Study to quantify value to the grid from managed charging by using three levels of managed loads for 13 terawatt-hours of annual load from three million EVs in a 2030 California grid scenario. Simulation results show that management of the EV fleet's aggregate load from unmanaged to 100% managed results in savings between 210 million and 660 million annually in generation system costs, depending on grid conditions. The simulation results also suggest that targeted EV supply equipment (EVSE) deployments at workplaces and other mid-day parking locations will be needed to support managed charging in a high-renewables California and enable the identified value to the grid. Although the value of generation to the grid from managed EV load paired with high renewables seems substantial, we estimate that the installed cost of an EVSE must be between 1,000 and 3,000 for a 10-year life to be cost neutral, depending on grid conditions.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A comparison of price-taker and production cost models for determining system value, revenue, and scheduling of concentrating solar power plants","Martinek, Janna; Jorgenson, Jennie; Mehos, Mark; Denholm, Paul","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; thermal energy storage; dispatch optimization; grid integration","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants convert solar energy into electricity and can be coupled with low-cost thermal energy storage to provide a dispatchable renewable resource. Maximizing the economic benefits of CSP systems requires deliberate selection of the timing of thermal energy dispatch to coincide with high-price or high-value periods. The performance and value of CSP systems have traditionally been evaluated using two distinct approaches: (1) production cost models (PCMs), which optimize commitment and dispatch schedules for an entire fleet of generators to minimize the cost of satisfying electricity demand; and (2) price-taker (PT) models, which optimize dispatch of the CSP system against historical or forecasted electricity prices to maximize revenue available to the CSP operator. The PCM approach is, in principle, superior because of the ability to capture system-level details such as transmission pathways and associated constraints, and feedback between CSP dispatch schedules and operation of other generators. The computationally simpler PT technique cannot explicitly address these concerns, but the comparative reduction in solution time is attractive for sensitivity analysis and rigorous optimization of CSP plant design and operation. In this work, we directly compare the dispatch profiles, net revenue, and operational value of CSP systems using implementations of each technique to assess how closely the solutions from the PT technique can approach those from the PCM for a specific market scenario. The PT implementation produced characteristically similar dispatch profiles as the PCM for both a large solar-multiple configuration and a small solar-multiple peaking configuration, while requiring only 1% of the computational time of the PCM. In addition, dispatching the CSP plant according to the self-scheduled PT solution - as opposed to the system-optimized PCM solution - only reduced the total CSP operational value by 1-5%, with consistent trends across CSP configurations and locations. This analysis validates the ability of the PT approach to substantially capture the economic benefits of CSP systems when pricing profiles are available, and indicates that the PT approach is suitable for initial design and optimization of CSP technologies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The transport of thermal effluents along river reaches may lead to plant-to-plant interferences by elevating condenser inlet temperatures at downstream locations, which lower thermal efficiencies and trigger regulatory-forced power curtailments. We evaluate thermal pollution impacts on rivers and power supply across 128 plants with once-through cooling technologies in the Mississippi River watershed. By leveraging river network topologies with higher resolutions (0.05 degrees) than previous studies, we reveal the need to address the issue in a more spatially resolved manner, capable of uncovering diverse impacts across individual plants, river reaches and sub-basins. Results show that the use of coarse river network resolutions may lead to substantial overestimations in magnitude and length of impaired river reaches. Overall, there is a modest limitation on power production due to thermal pollution, given existing infrastructure, regulatory and climate conditions. However, tradeoffs between thermal pollution and electricity generation show important implications for the role of alternative cooling technologies and environmental regulation under current and future climates. Recirculating cooling technologies may nearly eliminate thermal pollution and improve power system reliability under stressed climate-water conditions. Regulatory limits also reduce thermal pollution, but at the expense of significant reductions in electricity generation capacity. However, results show several instances when power production capacity rises at individual plants when regulatory limits reduce upstream thermal pollution. Furthermore, these dynamics across energy-water systems highlight the need for high-resolution simulations and the value of coherent planning and optimization across infrastructure with mutual dependencies on natural resources to overcome climate-water constraints on productivity and bring to fruition energy and environmental win-win opportunities.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Higher natural gas prices lead to higher wholesale electricity prices but fewer coal capacity retirements. A CO<sub>2</sub> electric power sector emissions cap influences electric sector evolution under reference technology assumptions but has little to no incremental influence when added to innovation goals. Long-term, meeting innovation goals achieves a generation mix with similar CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to the CO<sub>2</sub> policy but with smaller increases to wholesale electricity prices. In the short-term, the relative effect on wholesale prices differs by model. Finally, higher natural gas prices, achieving innovation goals, and the combination of the two, increases the amount of renewable generation that is cost-effective to build and operate while slowing the growth of natural-gas fired generation, which is the predominant generation type in 2050 under reference conditions.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While this presents a unique opportunity for broadening the use of sustainability assessments, this is constrained by the lack of commonly accepted processes and little empirical evidence on private sector practices. This study directly engages with this dilemma, examining the initiation step of the sustainability assessment from a procedural framework perspective. A multiple case study approach is utilised with semi-structured interviews of 32 respondents from nine multinational enterprises operating in the manufacturing industry of Indonesia. Findings indicate the initiation step is initially directed by regulatory compliance, with organisations using checklists based on mandatory sustainability issues to consider. The majority of organisations go beyond this compliance approach, however, with the role of the headquarters directing these organisations to more holistically consider sustainability issues through the use of established lists and materiality analysis. This is informed through headquarter commitments to voluntary international standards and global sustainability guidelines, which have translated into corporate practice through established policies and procedures. These findings highlight the importance of an emerging trend for the private sector to undertake voluntary activities beyond the regulatory context of the country they are operating within, and guided by corporate codes of conduct, when undertaking sustainability assessments.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.05.012","","","","United States","2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 72; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 99-107","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925517301816; TRN: US19W4078071157","10.1016/J.EIAR.2018.05.012","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","22826056","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22826056","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","72"
"Derived Optimal Linear Combination Evapotranspiration (DOLCE): a global gridded synthesis ET estimate","Hobeichi, Sanaa; Abramowitz, Gab; Evans, Jason; Ukkola, Anna","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","<p><p> Accurate global gridded estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are key to understanding water and energy budgets, in addition to being required for model evaluation. Several gridded ET products have already been developed which differ in their data requirements, the approaches used to derive them and their estimates, yet it is not clear which provides the most reliable estimates. This paper presents a new global ET dataset and associated uncertainty with monthly temporal resolution for 2000–2009. Six existing gridded ET products are combined using a weighting approach trained by observational datasets from 159 FLUXNET sites. The weighting method is based on a technique that provides an analytically optimal linear combination of ET products compared to site data and accounts for both the performance differences and error covariance between the participating ET products. We examine the performance of the weighting approach in several in-sample and out-of-sample tests that confirm that point-based estimates of flux towers provide information on the grid scale of these products. We also provide evidence that the weighted product performs better than its six constituent ET product members in four common metrics. Uncertainty in the ET estimate is derived by rescaling the spread of participating ET products so that their spread reflects the ability of the weighted mean estimate to match flux tower data. While issues in observational data and any common biases in participating ET datasets are limitations to the success of this approach, future datasets can easily be incorporated and enhance the derived product.</p></p>","European Geosciences Union (EGU)","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2018-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (Online); Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1317-1336","","","FG02-04ER63911; FG02-04ER63917","Journal ID: ISSN 1607-7938","10.5194/hess-22-1317-2018","","2022-01-03T00:00:00Z","1511441","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1511441","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1511441","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (Online)","2","22"

Energy storage (ES) can deliver value to utility customers by leveling building demand and reducing demand charges. With increasing distributed energy generation and greater building demand variability, utilities have raised demand charges and are even including them in residential electricity bills. This paper will present a comprehensive overview of electrical and thermal energy storage technologies but will focus on mid-size energy storage technologies for demand charge avoidance in commercial and industrial applications. Of the ES technologies surveyed, lithium ion batteries deliver the highest value for demand charge reduction especially with systems that have larger power to energy ratios.

In addition, potential economic incentives for participating biomass producers are quantified for different farm participation rates. The Monte Carlo simulation model, IBSAL-MC, is used to estimate the biomass delivered cost distribution, and a modified risk heat map is used to visualize the expected return on investment (ROI) for various combinations of the market price of the final product and the biomass delivered cost. The developed methodology is applied to an under-construction cellulosic sugar facility located in Sarnia, southwestern Ontario. Four farm participation rates of 20% (base-case scenario), 30%, 40% and 50% are studied. Additionally, the results show that the expected annual ROI for the base-case scenario is estimated to be 1.3%. As the farm participation rate increases, the expected annual ROI increases from 1.3% at 20% farm participation rate to 3.4%, 4.6% and 5.1% at 30%, 40% and 50% rates, respectively. At high sugar market prices ($375–$525/tonne), the overall expected annual ROI increases to 9.5%, 11.4%, 12.6% and 13.0% in 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% farm participation rates, respectively. In this case, the economic incentives to share with biomass producers are estimated to be $14.10/dry tonne (dt), $15.77/dt and $16.33/dt by increasing the farm participation rate from 20% to 30%, 40% and 50%, respectively.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Thus, M-N-C’s stability and selectivity have not been comparable to their noble metal counterparts. In this work, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous single-atom electrocatalysts (SAEs) were successfully prepared by simple pyrolysis procedure without any further post-treatment. Combining the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and electrochemical measurements, the SAEs have been identified with superior ORR activity and stability compared with Pt/C catalysts in alkaline condition. More impressively, the SAEs also show excellent ORR electrocatalytic performance in both acid and neutral media.

Since both technologies provide additional system flexibility they reduce operational costs and renewable curtailment for both generation mixes under study. Interestingly, the relative impacts are quite similar when both technologies are used together.

One of the predominant renewable energy sources, wind energy, possess a significant challenge for grid operations, due to its intermittency, uncertainty and variability. In changing operating conditions with wind uncertainty, part of wind may need to be curtailed for the safe utilization of the transmission system. In order to minimize the wind power curtailment and to keep the power flow on a transmission line under limits, a cyber resilient Distributed Remedial Action Scheme (DRAS) is developed in this paper. The RAS is formulated as an optimization problem, considering the real power flow constraints of the transmission lines and given wind variability. In this paper, DRAS is developed to operate even with failures in the computing nodes to make it cyber-resilient. Distributed simplex algorithm is used for optimization in the distributed RAS. The DRAS is implemented in a decentralized platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS) to enable cyber resiliency of DRAS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through offline simulations of the New England 39 bus system and online simulations of IEEE 14 bus test system. In conclusion, a cyber physical test bed utilizing Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS), Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), and BeagleBones has been used for the online simulation and validation of the developed cyber-resilient RAS.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-09-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 943-953","","DOE-VANDERBILT-0000666-24.pdf","AR0000666","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994","10.1109/TIA.2018.2868257","","2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","1483869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1483869","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1483869","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","1","55"

Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

After recognizing the limitations of current studies (i.e. unreasonable typical ECP (TECP) extraction method and the problem of multicollinearity and interpretability for regression and machine learning models), this paper proposes an association rule mining based quantitative analysis approach of household characteristics impact on residential ECPs trying to address them together. First, an adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to create seasonal TECP of each individual customer only for weekdays. K-means is then adopted to group all the TECPs into several clusters. An enhanced Apriori algorithm is proposed to reveal the relationships between TECPs and thirty five factors covering four categories of household characteristics including dwelling characteristics, socio-demographic, appliances and heating and attitudes towards energy. Results of the case study using 3326 records containing smart metering data and survey information in Ireland suggest that socio-demographic and cooking related factors such as employment status, occupants and whether cook by electricity have strong significant associations with TECPs, while attitudes related factors almost have no effect on TECPs. The results also indicate that those households with more than one person are more likely to change ECP across seasons. The proposed approach and the findings of this study can help to support decisions about how to reduce electricity consumption and CO2 emissions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This national estimate is based on an analysis of select US cities that combines light detection and ranging (lidar) data with a validated analytical method for determining rooftop PV suitability employing geographic information systems. We use statistical models to extend this analysis to estimate the quantity and characteristics of roofs in areas not covered by lidar data. Finally, we model PV generation for all rooftops to yield technical potential estimates. At the national level, 8.13 billion m<sup>2</sup> of suitable roof area could host 1118 GW of PV capacity, generating 1432 TWh of electricity per year. This would equate to 38.6% of the electricity that was sold in the contiguous United States in 2013. This estimate is substantially higher than a previous estimate made by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The difference can be attributed to increases in PV module power density, improved estimation of building suitability, higher estimates of total number of buildings, and improvements in PV performance simulation tools that previously tended to underestimate productivity. Also notable, the nationwide percentage of buildings suitable for at least some PV deployment is high—82% for buildings smaller than 5000 ft<sup>2</sup> and over 99% for buildings larger than that. In most states, rooftop PV could enable small, mostly residential buildings to offset the majority of average household electricity consumption. Even in some states with a relatively poor solar resource, such as those in the Northeast, the residential sector has the potential to offset around 100% of its total electricity consumption with rooftop PV.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind forecasting is one of the enablers to partially tackle challenges associated with wind power uncertainty. To improve the 'forecasting ability', defined as forecastability, different forecasting methods have been developed to assist grid integration of wind energy. However, forecasting performance not only relies on the power of forecasting models, but is also related to local weather conditions and (known as wind characteristics) wind farm properties. In this study, geospatial and instance spatial distributions of six wind characteristics and two forecasting error metrics are first analyzed based on 126,000 + wind sites in the United States. Forecasts in different look-ahead times are generated by using a machine learning based multi-model forecasting framework model and the Weather Research and Forecasting model. A forecastability quantification method is developed by characterizing the relationship between forecastability and wind series entropy using three regression methods, i.e., linear approximation, locally weighted scatterplot smoother nonlinear nonparametric regression, and quantile regression. It is found that the forecastability of a wind site can be successfully characterized by wind series characteristics, thereby providing valuable information at different stages of wind energy projects.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We then systemized the storage requirement per variable renewable energy (VRE) share and generation technology. Our synthesis reveals that with increasing VRE shares, the EES power capacity increases linearly; and the energy capacity, exponentially. Further, by analyzing the outliers, the EES energy requirements can be at least halved. It becomes clear that grids dominated by photovoltaic energy call for more EES, while large shares of wind rely more on transmission capacity. Taking into account the energy mix clarifies - to a large degree - the apparent conflict of the storage requirements between the existing studies. Finally, there might exist a negative bias towards storage because transmission costs are frequently optimistic (by neglecting execution delays and social opposition) and storage can cope with uncertainties, but these issues are rarely acknowledged in the planning process.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An updated assessment of oil market disruption risks","Beccue, Phillip C.; Huntington, Hillard G.; Leiby, Paul N.; Vincent, Kenneth R.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; oil disruption; risk analysis","The probability of the size and duration of another oil disruption is critical to estimating the value of any policies for reducing the economic damages from a sudden oil supply disruption. The Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University developed a risk assessment framework and evaluated the likelihood of one or more foreign oil disruptions over the next ten years. Leading geopolitical, military and oil-market experts provided their expertise on the probability of different events occurring, and their corresponding link to major disruptions in key oil market regions. The study evaluated 5 primary regions of production: Saudi Arabia, Other Persian Gulf, Africa, Latin America, and Russian / Caspian States. Disruptions are defined as being net of offsets (e.g., OPEC spare capacity), with the notable exception that the SPR is not included as a source of offsets. Furthermore, at least once during the 10-year time frame (2016–2025), there exists approximately an 80% probability of a net (of offsets) disruption of 2 MMBD (million barrels per day) or more lasting at least 1 month.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Totally different from the well-known knowledge that excellent ORR activity of Pt catalyst is caused by its partially-filled d-orbital, our first principle calculations suggest that the strong charge exchange between Pd-4d and Pb-(sp) orbitals on Pd3Pb TPs {110} facet results in the Pd-Pb local bonding unit with the orbital configuration similar to Pt. Consequently, the Pd3Pb TPs exhibit much higher ORR activities than commercial Pt/C and commercial Pd/C.

To inform WTE system design, fuel properties of seventeen components of synthetic contingency-base waste recipes from the literature were characterized for ultimate analysis, heating values, proximate analysis and reactivity in a steam atmosphere at three temperature typical of gasification conditions. A simple mathematical approach was applied to predict the properties and reactive behavior of composite mixtures using the weighted sum of the corresponding components, assuming negligible interaction between components. The method was validated using prepared composite mixture samples. In addition, chemical equilibrium calculations for steam gasification of the composite samples were conducted to explore the effects of waste composition variability on syngas production and composition.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.05.023","","","","United States","2018-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 78; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 16-30","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X18303180; TRN: US19V3857002748","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2018.05.023","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841190","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841190","","Waste Management","","78"

We implement various tax trajectories and options for using the revenue collected by the tax and describe their impact on household welfare and its distribution across income levels. Overall, we find that our top-down/bottom-up models affects estimates of the distribution and cost of emission reductions as well as the amount of revenue collected, but that these are mostly insensitive to the way the revenue is recycled. We find that substantial abatement opportunities through fuel switching and renewable penetration in the electricity sector allow the economy to accommodate extensive emissions reductions at relatively low cost. While welfare impacts are largely determined by the choice of revenue recycling scheme, all tax levels and schemes provide net benefits when accounting for the avoided global climate change benefits of emission reductions. Recycling revenue through capital income tax rebates is more efficient than labor income tax rebates or uniform transfers to households. While capital tax rebates substantially reduce the overall costs of emission abatement, they profit high income households the most and are regressive. We more generally identify a clear trade-off between equity and efficiency across the various recycling options. However, we show through a set of hybrid recycling schemes that it is possible to limit inequalities in impacts, particularly those on the lowest income households, at relatively little incremental cost.","World Scientific","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Comparing supply and demand models for future photovoltaic power generation in the USA","Basore, Paul A.; Cole, Wesley J.","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; deployment; future; modeling; photovoltaics","We explore the plausible range of future deployment of photovoltaic generation capacity in the USA using a supply-focused model based on supply-chain growth constraints and a demand-focused model based on minimizing the overall cost of the electricity system. Both approaches require assumptions based on previous experience and anticipated trends. For each of the models, we assign plausible ranges for the key assumptions and then compare the resulting PV deployment over time. Each model was applied to 2 different future scenarios: one in which PV market penetration is ultimately constrained by the uncontrolled variability of solar power and one in which low-cost energy storage or some equivalent measure largely alleviates this constraint. The supply-focused and demand-focused models are in substantial agreement, not just in the long term, where deployment is largely determined by the assumed market penetration constraints, but also in the interim years. For the future scenario without low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the 2 models give an average plausible range of PV generation capacity in the USA of 150 to 530 GWdc in 2030 and 260 to 810 GWdc in 2040. With low-cost energy storage or equivalent measures, the corresponding ranges are 160 to 630 GWdc in 2030 and 280 to 1200 GWdc in 2040. The latter range is enough to supply 10% to 40% of US electricity demand in 2040, based on current demand growth.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It has previously been shown that at the elevated pressures and temperatures of the deep subsurface, scCO<sub>2</sub> alters smectites (typical swelling phyllosilicates). However, less is known about the effects of scCO<sub>2</sub> on nonswelling phyllosilicates (illite and muscovite), despite the fact that the latter are the dominant clay minerals in deep subsurface shales and mudstones. Our studies conducted by using single crystals, combining reaction (incubation with scCO<sub>2</sub> ), visualization [atomic force microscopy (AFM)], and quantifications (AFM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and off-gassing measurements) revealed unexpectedly high CO<sub>2</sub> uptake that far exceeded its macroscopic surface area. Results from different methods collectively suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> partially entered the muscovite interlayers, although the pathways remain to be determined. We hypothesize that preferential dissolution at weaker surface defects and frayed edges allows CO<sub>2</sub> to enter the interlayers under elevated pressure and temperature, rather than by diffusing solely from edges deeply into interlayers. This unexpected uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>, can increase CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity by up to ~30% relative to the capacity associated with residual trapping in a 0.2-porosity sandstone reservoir containing up to 18 mass % of illite/muscovite.

"System Dynamics of Polysilicon for Solar Photovoltaics: A Framework for Investigating the Energy Security of Renewable Energy Supply Chains","Sandor, Debra; Fulton, Sadie; Engel-Cox, Jill; Peck, Corey; Peterson, Steve","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; photovoltaic; polysilicon; trade; energy security; advanced manufacturing","Renewable energy, produced with widely available low-cost energy resources, is often included as a component of national strategies to address energy security and sustainability. Market and political forces cannot disrupt the sun or wind, unlike oil and gas supplies. However, the cost of renewable energy is highly dependent on technologies manufactured through global supply chains in leading manufacturing countries. The countries that contribute to the global supply chains may take actions that, directly or indirectly, influence global access to materials and components. For example, high-purity polysilicon, a key material in solar photovoltaics, has experienced significant price fluctuations, affecting the manufacturing capacity and cost of both polysilicon and solar panels. This study has developed and validated an initial system dynamics framework to gain insights into global trade in polysilicon. The model represents an initial framework for exploration. Three regions were modeled-China, the United States, and the rest of the world - for a range of trade scenarios to understand the impacts of import duties and non-price drivers on the relative volumes of imports and domestic supply. The model was validated with the historical case of China imposing an import duty on polysilicon from the United States, the European Union, and South Korea, which altered the regional flows of polysilicon - in terms of imports, exports, and domestic production-to varying degrees. As expected, the model tracked how regional demand shares and influx volumes decrease as a duty on a region increases. Using 2016 as a reference point, in the scenarios examined for U.S. exports to China, each 10% increase in the import duty results in a 40% decrease in import volume. The model also indicates that, under the scenarios investigated, once a duty has been imposed on a region, the demand share from that region declines and does not achieve pre-duty levels, even as global demand increases. Adding additional countries and other components in the photovoltaic supply chain (panels, cells, wafers) to this model could enable policymakers to better understand the relative impact of trade measures across the entire photovoltaic module manufacturing supply chain and the conditions that encourage industry evolution and competitiveness.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed method utilizes pinning-based consensus algorithm to ensure explicit coordination between magnitude, frequency and phase angle regulation, while ensuring proportional power sharing. System frequency is regulated by all the DGs in proportion to their capacity, while a selected DG eliminates the phase and magnitude regulation errors.

A key smart ventilation concept is to use controls to ventilate more at times it provides either an energy or indoor air quality (IAQ) advantage (or both) and less when it provides a disadvantage. A favorable context exists in many countries to include some of the existing smart ventilation strategies in codes and standards. As a result, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) systems are widely and easily available on the market, with more than 20 DCV systems approved and available in countries such as Belgium, France and the Netherlands. This paper provides a literature review on smart ventilation used in residential buildings, based on energy and indoor air quality performance. This meta-analysis includes 38 studies of various smart ventilation systems with control based on CO<sub>2</sub>, humidity, combined CO<sub>2</sub> and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), occupancy, or outdoor temperature. In conclusion, these studies show that ventilation energy savings up to 60% can be obtained without compromising IAQ, even sometimes improving it. However, the meta-analysis included some less than favorable results, with 26% energy overconsumption in some cases.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The study comprises of two sections: simulation of wholesale electricity rates and retail rate modeling. In the first stage, wholesale prices were modeled using a bottom-up long term unit commitment optimization model for different energy mix scenarios based on increased solar penetration, ranging from 5 to 40% on energy basis. The simulations indicated a fall in wholesale prices with increased solar penetration, a result of merit order effect. The simulated wholesale prices were then used to model retail rates for residential consumers. Four different types of retail rates were designed: flat rate, real time pricing, time of use and critical peak pricing. The impact of these retail rate mechanisms on electricity bills of residential consumers was analyzed and it was found that the bill savings achieved from time varying rates are greater than for time invariant rates. With increased solar penetration, customers with time-varying rates are likely to benefit the most from electricity bill savings. Although consumers with flat rate gain bill savings with increased solar penetration, the savings are likely to be lower than with time-varying rates.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We sought information on a variety of topics, including procedural fairness and its relationship to project attitude, the foci of the present analysis. Here, we present a series of descriptive statistics and regression results, emphasizing those residents who were aware of their local project prior to construction. Sample weighting is employed to account for stratification and non-response. We find that a developer being open and transparent, a community being able to influence the outcome, and having a say in the planning process are all statistically significant predictors of a process perceived as being ‘fair,’ with an open and transparent developer having the largest effect. We also find developer transparency and ability to influence outcomes to have statistically significant relationships to a more positive attitude, with those findings holding when aesthetics, landscape, and wind turbine sound considerations are controlled for. The results indicate that jurisdictions might consider developing procedures, which ensure citizens are consulted and heard, and benchmarks or best practices for developer interaction with communities and citizens.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A bi-level fuzzy programming (BFLP) method was developed for energy systems planning (ESP) and carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) mitigation under uncertainty. BFLP could handle fuzzy information and leader-follower problem in decision-making processes. It could also address the tradeoffs among different decision makers in two decision-making levels through prioritizing the most important goal. Then, a BFLP-ESP model was formulated for planning energy system of Beijing, in which the upper-level objective is to minimize CO{sub 2} emission and the lower-level objective is to minimize the system cost. Results provided a range of decision alternatives that corresponded to a tradeoff between system optimality and reliability under uncertainty. Compared to the single-level model with a target to minimize system cost, the amounts of pollutant/CO{sub 2} emissions from BFLP-ESP were reduced since the study system would prefer more clean energies (i.e. natural gas, LPG and electricity) to replace coal fuel. Decision alternatives from BFLP were more beneficial for supporting Beijing to adjust its energy mix and enact its emission-abatement policy. Results also revealed that the low-carbon policy for power plants (e.g., shutting down all coal-fired power plants) could lead to a potentially increment of imported energy for Beijing, which would increase the risk of energy shortage. The findings could help decision makers analyze the interactions between different stakeholders in ESP and provide useful information for policy design under uncertainty.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.03.010","","","","United States","2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research; Journal Volume: 164; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"Modeling India’s Coal Production with a Negatively Skewed Curve-Fitting Model","Wang, Jianliang; Bentley, Yongmei; Bentley, Roger","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; COAL; DEMAND; ENERGY POLICY; INDIA; MEITNERIUM 268; PARTICLE PRODUCTION; RESOURCES; SIMULATION","India’s coal demand is forecast to increase at a rapid pace in the future due to the country’s economic and population growth. Analyzing the scope for future production of India’s domestic coal resources, therefore, plays a vital role in the country’s development of sound energy policies. This paper presents a quantitative scenario analysis of India’s potential future coal production by using a negatively skewed curve-fitting model and a range of estimates of the country’s ultimately recoverable resources (URR) of coal. The results show that the resource base is sufficient for India’s coal production to keep increasing over the next few decades, to reach between 2400 and 3200 Mt/y at 2050, depending on the assumed value of URR. A further analysis shows that the high end of this range, which corresponds to our ‘GSI’ scenario, can be considered as the probable upper-bound to India’s domestic coal production. Comparison of production based on the ‘GSI’ scenario with India’s predicted demand shows that the domestic production of coal will be insufficient to meet the country’s rising coal demand, with the gap between demand and production increasing from its current value of about 268 Mt/y to reach 300 Mt/y in 2035, and 700 Mt/y by 2050. This increasing gap will be challenging for the energy security of India.","","","","","","United States","2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2018 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 365-378","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US18K0750100927","10.1007/S11053-017-9356-1","","2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","22749938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22749938","","Natural Resources Research","3","27"
"Estimating the price (in)elasticity of off-grid electricity demand","Müller, Marc F.; Thompson, Sally E.; Gadgil, Ashok J.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; rural electrification; instrumental variable; unmetered connection; micro hydropower; Nepal","Community-scale power infrastructure may be the only electrification option for tens of millions households that remain out of reach from centralized power grids. The responsiveness of household electricity demand to price is a crucial design input for off-grid systems. While the price elasticity of electricity demand of grid-connected consumers has been abundantly studied, few studies focus on off-grid communities where substantial econometric challenges arise, including the absence of metered consumption data and electricity prices that are simultaneously determined by cost and demand considerations. This study attempts to address these challenges for the case of off-grid micro hydropower consumers. It makes two core contributions: First, we propose the surface area of the contributing hydrologic catchment as a new instrumental variable to estimate elasticity using a cross sectional dataset of existing micro hydropower infrastructure. Second, we provide a first price-elasticity estimate (-0.15) for off-grid electricity demand in Nepal. We surmise that the small (in absolute value) elasticity value found in this study arises from the low levels of consumption observed off-the-grid. We use a Monte Carlo analysis to show that failing to account for this disparity can lead to substantial financial losses caused by suboptimal power infrastructure design.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It considers the locational marginal price (LMP) forecast uncertainties in the DA and RT markets. The energy storage arbitrage risk associated with the LMP forecast uncertainty is explicitly modeled through the variance component in the objective function. The quadratic term of this variance is transformed into a second-order cone constraint using the charging and discharging power complementarity of the energy storage system. Finally, the proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer conic programming problem.

Current efforts mainly focus on optimal chemical doping and substituent to tune its electronic structures for enhanced activity. Here, we study its morphology control and elucidate the morphology-dependent catalyst performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Three types of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalysts with significantly distinct morphologies were prepared using temple-free, Pluronic-123 (P-123) soft, and SiO<sub>2</sub> hard templates, respectively, via hydrothermal methods following by a calcination. While the hard-template yields sphere-like dense structures, soft-template assists the formation of a unique nano-needle cluster assembly containing abundant meso- and macro pores. Furthermore, the effect of morphology of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> on their corresponding bifunctional catalytic performance was systematically investigated. The flower-like nano-needle assembly NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>catalyst via the soft template method exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability for both ORR and OER. In particular, it exhibited an onset and half-wave potentials of 0.94 and 0.82 V vs. RHE, respectively, for the ORR in alkaline media. Although it is still inferior to Pt, the NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> represents one of the best ORR catalyst compared to other reported carbon-free oxides. Meanwhile, remarkable OER activity and stability were achieved with an onset potential of 1.48 V and a current density of 15 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> at 1.6 V, showing no activity loss after 20,000 potential cycles (0 to 1.9 V). The demonstrated stability is even superior to Ir for the OER. The morphology-controlled approach provides an effective solution to create a robust 3D architecture with increased surface areas and enhanced mass transfer. More importantly, the soft template can yield high degree of spinel crystallinity with ideal stoichiometric ratios between Ni and Co, thus promoting structural integrity with enhanced electrical conductivity and catalytic properties.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Although the energy in the wastewater has been successfully utilized to condition buildings in other countries, it is barely utilized in the United States, until recently. In 2013, the Denver Museum of Nature & Science at Denver, the United States implemented a unique heat pump system that utilizes recycled wastewater from a municipal water system to cool and heat its 13,000 m<sup>2</sup> new addition. This recycled water heat pump (RWHP) system uses seven 105 kW (cooling capacity) modular water-to-water heat pumps (WWHPs). Each WWHP uses R-410A refrigerant, has two compressors, and can independently provide either 52 °C hot water (HW) or 7 °C chilled water (CHW) to the building. This paper presents performance characterization results of this RWHP system based on the measured data from December 2014 through August 2015. The annual energy consumption of the RWHP system was also calculated and compared with that of a baseline Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system which meets the minimum energy efficiencies that are allowed by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 90.1-2013. The performance analysis results indicate that recycled water temperatures were favorable for effective operation of heat pumps. As a result, on an annual basis, the RWHP system avoided 50% of source energy consumption (resulting from reduction in natural gas consumption although electricity consumption was increased slightly), reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 41%, and saved 34% in energy costs as compared with the baseline system.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As such, electrification-the conversion of previously fossil-fueled end-use processes to electricity-has been identified as a key pathway to a clean, reliable, and secure energy future. Electric vehicles are the most widely cited application of electrification, but technology improvements in electrically driven devices for buildings and industrial end uses, including heat pumps for space and water heating needs, induction stoves for cooking, infrared or ultraviolet curing processes, and electric arc furnaces for process heating, could lead to more widespread electrification across these sectors.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Envisioning a low-cost solar future: Exploring the potential impact of Achieving the SunShot 2030 targets for photovoltaics","Cole, Wesley; Frew, Bethany; Gagnon, Pieter; Reimers, Andrew; Zuboy, Jarett; Margolis, Robert","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; SunShot; PV; ReEDS; capacity expansion; renewable energy; energy storage","In the context of recent dramatic solar energy cost reductions, the U.S. Department of Energy set new levelized cost of energy goals for photovoltaics (PV) to achieve by 2030 to enable significantly greater PV adoption: $0.03/kWh for utility-scale, $0.04/kWh for commercial, and $0.05/kWh for residential PV systems. We analyze the potential impacts of achieving these 'SunShot 2030' cost targets for the contiguous United States using the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) and Distributed Generation (dGen) capacity expansion models. We consider the impacts under a wide range of future conditions. We find that PV could provide 13%-18% of U.S. electricity demand in 2030 and 28%-64% of demand if the SunShot 2030 goals are achieved, with PV deployment increasing in every state. The availability of low-cost storage has the largest impact on projected deployment, followed by natural gas prices and electricity demand. For comparison, PV deployed under a business-as-usual scenario could provide only 5% of generation in 2030 and 17% in 2050. We find that the high levels of PV deployment explored here lead to lower electricity prices and system costs, lower carbon dioxide emissions, lower water consumption, increased renewable energy curtailment, and increased storage deployment compared with the business-as-usual scenario.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In response to the growing BEV inter-city travel demand, the framework integrates both an optimization model for decisions on where and when to build charging stations and a stochastic queuing model to determine how many chargers are needed for each station. A genetic algorithm based heuristic method is developed to efficiently solve the problem. The model is applied to investigate the long-term infrastructure requirement in the state of California where significant growth in BEV demand is expected in coming decades. Our findings indicate that the charging infrastructure is expanded in both network coverage (number of stations) and service capacity (number of chargers per station) as the BEV demand grows. We also found that the infrastructure requirement is dependent on many factors, such as the BEV electrified range, the required level of service at charging stations, and the range anxiety cost. For most simulated scenarios, the results show that it is beneficial to invest in the inter-city fast charging infrastructure, even though the range anxiety cost is at its low end.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One option to improve the sector’s competitiveness is to increase cost efficiency. The goal of this study is to quantify the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency of individual firms by applying the generalized true random effects (GTRE) model introduced by Colombi et al. (Journal of Productivity Analysis 42(2): 123–136, 2014) and Filippini and Greene (Journal of Productivity Analysis 45(2): 187–196, 2016). Applying this newly developed GTRE model to a total cost function, the level of cost efficiency of 65 Swiss hydropower firms is analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2013. A true random effects specification is estimated as a benchmark for the transient level of cost efficiency. The results show the presence of both transient as well as persistent cost inefficiencies. The GTREM predicts the aggregate level of cost inefficiency to amount to 21.8% (8.0% transient, 13.8% persistent) on average between 2000 and 2013. These two components differ in interpretation and implication. From an individual firm’s perspective, the two types of cost inefficiencies might require a firm’s management to respond with different improvement strategies. The existing level of persistent inefficiency could prevent the hydropower firms from adjusting their production processes to new market environments. From a regulatory point of view, the results of this study could be used in the scope and determination of the amount of financial support given to struggling firms.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; District heating and cooling; Exergy analysis; Heat pumps; Urban buildings; Modelica","In this study, we evaluate an ambient, bidirectional thermal network, which uses a single circuit for both district heating and cooling. When in net more cooling is needed than heating, the system circulates from a central plant in one direction. When more heating is needed, the system circulates in the opposite direction. A large benefit of this design is that buildings can recover waste heat from each other directly. We analyze the thermodynamic performance of the bidirectional system. Because the bidirectional system represents the state-of-the-art in design for district systems, its peak energy efficiency represents an upper bound on the thermal performance of any district heating and cooling system. However, because any network has mechanical and thermal distribution losses, we develop a diversity criterion to understand when the bidirectional system may be a more energy-efficient alternative to modern individual-building systems. We show that a simple model of a low-density, high-distribution loss network is more efficient than aggregated individual buildings if there is at least 1 unit of cooling energy per 5.7 units of simultaneous heating energy (or vice versa). We apply this criterion to reference building profiles in three cities to look for promising clusters.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We outline a method to construct country-level wind resource supply curves, delineated by resource quality and other parameters. Using mesoscale reanalysis data, we generate estimates for wind quality, both terrestrial and offshore, across the globe. Because not all land or water area is suitable for development, appropriate database layers provide exclusions to reduce the total resource to its technical potential. We expand upon estimates from related studies by: using a globally consistent data source of uniquely detailed wind speed characterizations; assuming a non-constant coefficient of performance for adjusting power curves for altitude; categorizing the distance from resource sites to the electric power grid; and characterizing offshore exclusions on the basis of sea ice concentrations. The product, then, is technical potential by country, classified by resource quality as determined by net capacity factor. Additional classifications dimensions are available, including distance to transmission networks for terrestrial wind and distance to shore and water depth for offshore. We estimate the total global wind generation potential of 560 PWh for terrestrial wind with 90% of resource classified as low-to-mid quality, and 315 PWh for offshore wind with 67% classified as mid-to-high quality. These estimates are based on 3.5 MW composite wind turbines with 90 m hub heights, 0.95 availability, 90% array efficiency, and 5 MW/km<sup>2</sup> deployment density in non-excluded areas. We compare the underlying technical assumption and results with other global assessments.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

G.; O’Kelley, B.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; rare earth; wind energy; system dynamics; supply chain","Global initiatives are focused on deploying clean energy technologies that decrease greenhouse gas emissions. However, many of these technologies rely heavily on a volatile rare earth element (REE) supply chain. In 2016, the global supply of these REEs continues to be concentrated within a small number of countries while clean energy demand continues to grow. To address the critical nature of these REEs, global efforts have been made to diversify supply of REEs. However, it is unclear if the success of these efforts, combined with the most-promising domestic REO production capacity, will be enough to ensure REE supply for domestic clean energy technology demand, including wind energy. We apply a static and dynamic approach to estimate U.S. REE production capacity and its associated effect on U.S. wind energy growth out to 2030. Our static approach shows that U.S. light REE supply from the Mountain Pass, Bear Lodge and potential Phosphate mines operating at maximum production capacity could provide significant light REE supply to satisfy U.S. targets for wind energy REE consumption. Furthermore, when we consider market dynamics, domestic light REE production is inadequate for alleviating the supply constraint which limits overall U.S. wind energy growth out to 2030.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Both incineration and gasification alternatives are considered. The gasification option includes three different configurations: (1) a fluidized bed gasifier (FBG) with internal combustion engine (ICE), (2) a FBG with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and (3) a grate gasifier with steam Rankine cycle (SRC). The study is primarily applied to regions where the management system is based on Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) plants, generating a large share of refuse (>70%), which is currently landfilled. The specific case of Andalusia, a region in the south of Spain with 23 MBT plants distributed over a region of 87.000 km{sup 2}, where about 80% of municipal solid waste (MSW) is currently landfilled, is taken as main reference; thereafter, the study is further extended to preliminary assess other regions of some European landfill-dominated countries with similar characteristics. The results show that both incineration and gasification improve landfill disposal, contributing favorably to greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and fulfilling EU environmental regulations, although the three gasification options analyzed yield lower GHG emissions than incineration. In addition, gasification enables better integration of WtE into existing MBT plants, especially in the particular case of Andalusia, where MBT plants are widespread on the region, making it a more promising option than incineration, which is mainly based on large centralized plants, and less socially accepted. From the options analyzed, the WtE scheme based on FBG with ICE gives the highest profitability for a given gate fee, due to much higher electrical efficiency. However, FBG with ORC seems to be a better option in the short-term for landfill-dominated countries, due to its higher technical reliability and the low gate fee currently available in these countries.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.03.039","","","","United States","2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 76; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 443-456","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X18301818; TRN: US19V3775002742","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2018.03.039","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841184","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841184","","Waste Management","","76"

Nevertheless, the construction of WTE facilities faces considerable and strong opposition from local communities due to the perceived potential risks. The present study aims to understand whether, and how, community engagement improves local residents’ public acceptance towards waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration facilities using a questionnaire survey conducted with nearby residents of two selected WTE incineration plants located in Zhejiang province, China. The results of data analysis using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) reveal that firstly, a lower level of public acceptance exists among local residents of over the age of 35, of lower education levels, living within 3 km from the WTE Plant and from WTE incineration Plants which are under construction. Secondly, the public trust of local government and other authorities was positively associated with the public acceptance of the WTE incineration project, both directly and indirectly based on perceived risk. Thirdly, community engagement can effectively enhance public trust in local government and other authorities related to the WTE incineration project. The findings contribute to the literature on MSW treatment policy-making and potentially hazardous facility siting, by exploring the determinants of public acceptance towards WTE incineration projects.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.02.028","","","","United States","2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 76; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 431-442","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X18300941; TRN: US19V3719002737","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2018.02.028","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841179","","Waste Management","","76"

The ‘baseline’ recycling technology is the conventional thermolysis process via pyrolysis and the ‘alternative’ recycling technology is an emerging chemical treatment via solvolysis using supercritical water (SCW) to digest the thermoset matrix. Two Gate-to-Gate recycling models are developed using GaBi LCA platform. The selected functional unit (FU) is 1 kg CFRP waste and the geographical boundary of this comparative LCIA is defined to be within the U.S. The results of this comparative assessment brought to light new insights about the environmental and human health impacts of CFRP waste recycling via solvolysis using SCW and, therefore, helped close a gap in the current state of knowledge about sustainability of SCW-based solvolysis as compared to pyrolysis. Two research questions are posed to identify whether solvolysis recycling offers more environmental and human health gains relative to the conventional pyrolysis recycling. These research questions lay the basis for formulating two null hypotheses (H{sub 0,1} and H{sub 0,2}) and their associated research hypotheses (H{sub 1,1} and H{sub 1,2}). LCIA results interpretation included ‘base case’ scenarios, ‘sensitivity studies,’ and ‘scenarios analysis.’ The results revealed that: (a) recycling via solvolysis using SCW exhibits no gains in environmental and human health impacts relative to those impacts associated with recycling via pyrolysis and (b) use of natural gas in lieu of electricity for pyrolyzer’s heating reduces the environmental and human health impacts by 37% (lowest) and up to 95.7% (highest). It is recommended that on-going experimental efforts that focus only on identifying the best solvent for solvolysis-based recycling should also consider quantification of the energy intensity as well as environmental and human health impacts of the proposed solvents.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.03.026","","","","United States","2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 76; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 767-778","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956053X18301685; TRN: US19V3764002741","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2018.03.026","","2020-11-18T00:00:00Z","22841183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22841183","","Waste Management","","76"

While reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions is a common interest shared by major developed and developing countries, actions to enable these global reductions are generally implemented at the city scale. This is because baseline information from individual cities plays an important role in identifying economical options for improving building energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions. Numerous approaches have been proposed for modeling urban building energy use in the past decades. Our paper aims to provide an up-to-date review of the broad categories of energy models for urban buildings and describes the basic workflow of physics-based, bottom-up models and their applications in simulating urban-scale building energy use. Because there are significant differences across models with varied potential for application, strengths and weaknesses of the reviewed models are also presented. We then follow this with a discussion of challenging issues associated with model preparation and calibration.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Quantifying the benefits of a building retrofit using an integrated system approach: A case study","Regnier, Cynthia; Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen; Piette, Mary Ann","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Building retrofit; Integrated system; Energy savings; Energy conservation measures; Building simulation; Integrated design","Building retrofits provide a large opportunity to significantly reduce energy consumption in the buildings sector. Traditional building retrofits focus on equipment upgrades, often at the end of equipment life or failure, and result in replacement with marginally improved similar technology and limited energy savings. The Integrated System (IS) retrofit approach enables much greater energy savings by leveraging interactive effects between end use systems, enabling downsized or lower energy technologies. This work presents a case study in Hawaii quantifying the benefits of an IS retrofit approach compared to two traditional retrofit approaches: a Standard Practice of upgrading equipment to meet minimum code requirements, and an Improved Practice of upgrading equipment to a higher efficiency. The IS approach showed an energy savings of 84% over existing building energy use, much higher than the traditional approaches of 13% and 33%. The IS retrofit also demonstrated the greatest energy cost savings potential. While the degree of savings realized from the IS approach will vary by building and climate, these findings indicate that savings on the order of 50% and greater are not possible without an IS approach. It is therefore recommended that the IS approach be universally adopted to achieve deep energy savings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this work, transmission electron microscopy is used to investigate the crystallographic and electronic structural modifications of Ni-based cathode materials at a high charge/discharge rate of 10 C. It is found that the high-rate electrochemical reactions induce structural inhomogeneity near the surface of Ni-rich cathode materials, which limits Li transport and reduces their capacities. Furthermore, this study establishes a correlation between the high-rate electrochemical performance of the Ni-based materials and their structural evolution, which can provide profound insights for designing novel cathode materials having both high energy and power densities.","American Chemical Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Daytime radiative cooling is promising for building applications. Here, this paper estimates the energy savings from daytime radiative cooling, specifically based on photonic materials. A photonic radiative cooling system was proposed and modeled using the whole energy simulation program EnergyPlus. A typical medium-sized office building was used for the simulation analysis. Several reference systems were established to quantify the potential of energy savings from the photonic radiative cooling system. The reference systems include a variable-air-volume (VAV) system, a hydronic radiant system, and a nighttime radiative cooling system. The savings analysis was made for a number of locations with different climates. Simulation results showed that the photonic radiative cooling system saved between 45% and 68% cooling electricity relative to the VAV system and between 9% and 23% relative to the nighttime radiative cooling system featured with the best coating commercially available on market. Finally, a simple economic analysis was also made to estimate the maximum acceptable incremental cost for upgrading from nighttime cooling to photonic radiative cooling.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A regional analysis of excess capacity in China’s power systems","Lin, Jiang; Kahrl, Fredrich; Liu, Xu","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","China's economy has entered a “new normal,” characterized by slower economic growth and widespread overcapacity in its industrial sectors. Nevertheless, construction of power plants, especially coal-fired plants, continues at a rapid pace. Our analysis examines the extent of overcapacity in China's regional electricity grids. We show that already in 2014, the average reserve margin across China's regional grids was roughly 28%, almost twice as high as a standard planning reserve margin in the U.S. In addition, we find large variations in reserve margins across regional power grids in China, with the highest reserve margin (64%) in the Northeastern grid. This paper examines future reserve margins across regions in China under three growth scenarios. The results suggest that the majority of China will not need new baseload coal power (at least for reliability purposes) before 2020, and potentially not until 2025, under the low- and mid-growth scenarios. Under the high-growth scenario, China's central and eastern regions will need to import more power or built new capacity by 2020. As China's energy sector enters this new normal, our results highlight the growing importance of establishing mechanisms — planning processes and markets — that coordinate generation and transmission investments across grid regions, and that align the country's energy sector investments with its longer-term air quality and climate goals.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These facilities need large volumes of water and sufficiently cool temperatures for optimal operations, and projected climate conditions may lower their potential power output and affect reliability. We evaluate the performance of 1,080 thermoelectric plants across the contiguous US under future climates (2035-2064) and their collective performance at 19 North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) sub-regions. Joint consideration of engineering interactions with climate, hydrology and environmental regulations reveals the region-specific performance of energy systems and the need for regional energy security and climate-water adaptation strategies. Despite climate-water constraints on individual plants, the current power supply infrastructure shows potential for adaptation to future climates by capitalizing on the size of regional power systems, grid configuration and improvements in thermal efficiencies. Without placing climate-water impacts on individual plants in a broader power systems context, vulnerability assessments that aim to support adaptation and resilience strategies misgauge the extent to which regional energy systems are vulnerable. As a result, climate-water impacts can lower thermoelectric reserve margins, a measure of systems-level reliability, highlighting the need to integrate climate-water constraints on thermoelectric power supply into energy planning, risk assessments, and system reliability management.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cities and “budget-based” management of the energy-water-climate nexus: Case studies in transportation policy, infrastructure systems, and urban utility risk management","Sperling, Joshua B.; Ramaswami, Anu","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; INCENTIVES; INFRASTRUCTURE; MEASURING TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED; CARBON INTENSITY OF ENERGY; WATER SUPPLY; URBAN POLICY AND GOVERNANCE","This article reviews city case studies to inform a framework for developing urban infrastructure design standards and policy instruments that together aim to pursue energy efficiency and greenhouse gas mitigation through city carbon budgets and water use efficiency and climate risk adaptation through city water budgets. Here, this article also proposes combining carbon and water budgeting at the city-scale for achieving successful coupled city carbon and water budget (CCCWB) programs. Under a CCCWB program, key actors including local governments, infrastructure designers/operators, and households would be assigned a GHG emissions and water 'budget' and be required by state or federal levels to keep within this budget through the use of flexibility mechanisms, incentive programs, and sanctions. Multiple incentives and cross-scale governance arrangements would be tied to energy-water systems integration, resource-efficient transportation and infrastructure development, and effective monitoring and management of energy use, emissions, climate risks to, and security of energy-water-transport-food and other critical systems. As a first step to promote strategies for CCCWB development, we systematically review approaches of and shortcomings to existing budget-based programs in the UK and US, and suggest improvements in three areas: measurement, modeling effectiveness of interventions for staying within a budget, and governance. To date, the majority of climate action or sustainability plans by cities, while mentioning climate impacts as a premise for the plan, do not address these impacts in the plan. They focus primarily on GHG mitigation while ignoring resource depletion challenges and energy-climate-water linkages, whereby water supplies can begin to limit energy production and energy shifts to mitigate climate change can limit water availability. Coupled carbon-water budget plans, programs, and policies - described in this study- may address these concerns as well as the emerging trends that will exacerbate these problems - e.g., including population growth, climatic changes, and emerging policy choices that are not coordinated.

"Mapping water availability, cost and projected consumptive use in the Eastern United States with comparisons to the West","Tidwell, Vincent; Moreland, Barbara D.; Shaneyfelt, Calvin; Kobos, Peter H.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","The availability of freshwater supplies to meet future demand is a growing concern. Water availability metrics are needed to inform future water development decisions. Furthermore, with the help of water managers, water availability was mapped for over 1300 watersheds throughout the 31-contiguous states in the eastern U.S. complimenting a prior study of the west. The compiled set of water availability data is unique in that it considers multiple sources of water (fresh surface and groundwater, wastewater and brackish groundwater); accommodates institutional controls placed on water use; is accompanied by cost estimates to access, treat and convey each unique source of water, and; is compared to projected future growth in consumptive water use to 2030. Although few administrative limits have been set on water availability in the east, water managers have identified 315 fresh surface water and 398 fresh groundwater basins (with 151 overlapping basins) as Areas of Concern (AOCs) where water supply challenges exist due to drought related concerns, environmental flows, groundwater overdraft, or salt water intrusion. This highlights a difference in management where AOCs are identified in the east which simply require additional permitting, while in the west strict administrative limits are established. Although the east is generally considered ""water rich"" roughly a quarter of the basins were identified as AOCs; however, this is still in strong contrast to the west where 78% of the surface water basins are operating at or near their administrative limit. There was little effort noted on the part of eastern or western water managers to quantify non-fresh water resources.","IOP Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

While the range that BEVs can travel on a single recharge is improving, the rate at which these vehicles can be recharged is still much slower than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. To achieve comparable recharge times we explore the vehicle considerations of charge rates up to 350 kW. This faster recharge is expected to significantly mitigate the perceived deficiencies for long-distance transportation, to provide alternative charging in densely populated areas where overnight charging at home may not be possible, and to reduce range anxiety for travel within a city when unplanned charging maybe required. This substantial increase in the charging rate is expected to create technical issues in the design of the battery system and the vehicle electrical architecture that must be resolved.

While urban heat mitigation strategies have been shown to have beneficial effects on health, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, their implications for water conservation have not been widely examined. Here we use a suite of satellite-supported regional climate simulations in California to show that broad implementation of cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy, not only results in significant cooling, but can also meaningfully decrease outdoor water consumption by reducing evaporative and irrigation water demands. Irrigation water consumption across the major metropolitan areas is reduced by up to 9% and irrigation water savings per capita range from 1.8 to 15.4 gallons per day across 18 counties examined. Total water savings are found to be the highest in Los Angeles county, reaching about 83 million gallons per day.

(2015) is tested on a case study. • The strategic assessment of the proposed Browse LNG Precinct is evaluated. • The effectiveness framework is modified as a result of the analysis. • “Legitimacy” encompasses both pluralism and normative effectiveness. • Substantive effectiveness should include consideration of unintended consequences. - Abstract: The aim of this paper is to test the broader utility of the sustainability assessment effectiveness framework of Bond et al. (2015) by applying it to a controversial strategic assessment case study. The effectiveness framework comprises six dimensions: procedural effectiveness, substantive effectiveness, transactive effectiveness, normative effectiveness, pluralism, and knowledge and learning. It was originally developed to evaluate sustainability assessment at a system-wide level and it has not been previously applied to a specific case study. The analysis was conducted through document review and the first-hand experience of two of the authors who were involved in the case study in different capacities. The case study selected was the strategic assessment of the proposed Browse Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Precinct in Western Australia, which was conducted over the period 2007–2015 under the strategic assessment provisions of both the Western Australian and Australian Commonwealth environmental legislation. The framework provided a useful structure within which this complex case study could be explored, its strengths and weaknesses brought to light, and the interactions between the dimensions highlighted. We also found opportunities for refinement of the framework. As a result of this analysis we propose to replace the final three dimensions of the framework with legitimacy, where a legitimate process is one which all stakeholders agree is fair and which delivers an acceptable outcome for all parties, though we acknowledge the need for further conceptualisation of this dimension. We also suggest that the concept of substantive effectiveness should be expanded to incorporate the unintended consequences of impact assessment. Our research thus makes both a useful addition to the literature already published on the Browse case study, as well as to the literature on impact assessment effectiveness.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.01.004","","","","United States","2018-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 70; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34-44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925517303220; TRN: US19W4044071144","10.1016/J.EIAR.2018.01.004","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","22826043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22826043","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","70"
"The Impacts of Demand Response Participation in Capacity Markets","Lynch, Muireann A.; Nolan, Sheila; Devine, Mel T.; O'Malley, Mark J","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; demand response; load-shifting; markets; reserve; capacity","Demand Response is capable of reducing the total amount of generation capacity investment required to ensure electricity system security. We utilise this fact to devise a novel methodology to estimate the contribution of a load-shifting demand response resource to system adequacy. We then simulate an electricity market using mixed complementarity models to determine how the participation of demand response in capacity markets impacts on market outcomes. Demand response primarily affects the equilibrium outcome through the energy market, however demand response also reduces both equilibrium prices and consumer costs through its capacity market contribution. The effect is particularly pronounced when there is a high level of variable renewable generation and initial undercapacity. In the absence of demand response, increased wind generation leads to higher capacity prices as generators seek to offset depressed energy prices. However, we find that demand response's participation in the capacity market can combat these increased capacity prices. These results suggest that demand response participation in capacity markets can mitigate some of the market challenges of renewable integration, particularly that of the 'missing money' problem.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the problems of high cost and limited range associated with on-board batteries have substantially limited the popularity of battery electric buses. The technology of dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), which provides bus operators with the ability to charge buses while in motion, may be able to effectively alleviate the drawbacks of electric buses. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously selecting the optimal location of the DWPT facilities and designing the optimal battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system. The problem is first constructed as a deterministic model in which the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time of electric buses is neglected. The methodology of robust optimization (RO) is then adopted to address the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time. The affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the deterministic model is developed, and its equivalent tractable mathematical programming is derived. Both the deterministic model and the robust model are demonstrated with a real-world bus system. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed deterministic model can effectively determine the allocation of DWPT facilities and the battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system; and the robust model can further provide optimal designs that are robust against the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time for electric buses.","Elsevier","","Pacificorp, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOT; Mountain-Plains Consortium (MPC)","","United States","2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Journal Volume: 83; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 77-103","","","EE0007997","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X; PII: S0968090X17301985","10.1016/j.trc.2017.07.013","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1429115","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1429115","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1429115","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","C","83"

During its tenure, the subsidy was the subject of intense scrutiny concerning who benefited from its existence. Using commodity price data, we estimate the subsidy incidence accruing to corn farmers, ethanol producers, gasoline blenders, and gasoline consumers around the time of expiration. Our empirical approach contributes methodologically to the event studies literature by analyzing futures contract prices (as opposed to spot prices) when possible. Ultimately, we find compelling evidence that, at the date of VEETC expiration, ethanol producers captured about 25 cents of the 45 cents subsidy per gallon of ethanol blended. We find suggestive, albeit inconclusive, evidence that a portion of this benefit (about 5 cents per gallon) was passed further upstream from ethanol producers to corn farmers. Most of the remainder seems most likely to have been captured by the blenders themselves. On the petroleum side, we find no evidence that oil refiners captured any part of the subsidy. We also find no evidence that the subsidy was passed downstream to gasoline consumers in the form of lower gasoline prices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This article summarizes the first national-level, integrated assessment of the future costs and benefits of existing RPS policies; the same metrics are evaluated under a second scenario in which widespread expansion of these policies is assumed to occur. Depending on assumptions about renewable energy technology advancement and natural gas prices, existing RPS policies increase electric system costs by as much as $31 billion, on a present-value basis over 2015-2050. The expanded renewable deployment scenario yields incremental costs that range from $23 billion to $194 billion, depending on the assumptions employed. The monetized value of improved air quality and reduced climate damages exceed these costs. Using central assumptions, existing RPS policies yield $97 billion in air-pollution health benefits and $161 billion in climate damage reductions. Under the expanded RPS case, health benefits total $558 billion and climate benefits equal $599 billion. These scenarios also yield benefits in the form of reduced water use. RPS programs are not likely to represent the most cost effective path towards achieving air quality and climate benefits. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that US RPS programs are, on a national basis, cost effective when considering externalities.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP) has developed a suite of tools to assess and manage risk at CO2 sequestration sites. The NRAP tool suite includes the Aquifer Impact Model (AIM), which evaluates the potential for groundwater impacts from leaks of CO2 and brine through abandoned wellbores. There are two aquifer reduced-order models (ROMs) included with the AIM tool, a confined alluvium aquifer, and an unconfined carbonate aquifer. The models accept aquifer parameters as a range of variable inputs so they may have broad applicability. The generic aquifer models may be used at the early stages of site selection, when site-specific data is not available. Guidelines have been developed for determining when the generic ROMs might be applicable to a new site. This paper considers the application of the AIM to predicting the impact of CO2 or brine leakage were it to occur at the Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP). Results of the model sensitivity analysis can help guide characterization efforts; the hydraulic parameters and leakage source term magnitude are more sensitive than clay fraction or cation exchange capacity. Sand permeability was the only hydraulic parameter measured at the IBDP site. More information on the other hydraulic parameters could reduce uncertainty in risk estimates. Some non-adjustable parameters are significantly different for the ROM than for the observations at the IBDP site. The generic ROMs could be made more useful to a wider range of sites if the initial conditions and no-impact threshold values were adjustable parameters. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Society of Chemical Industry, Wiley","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Economic Justification of Concentrating Solar Power in High Renewable Energy Penetrated Power Systems","Hodge, Brian S; Kroposki, Benjamin D; Du, Ershun; Zhang, Ning; Kang, Chongqing; Xia, Qing","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; concentrating solar power; variable renewable energy; operational flexibility; break-even cost; economic justification","Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants are able to provide both renewable energy and operational flexibility at the same time due to its thermal energy storage (TES). It is ideal generation to power systems lacking in flexibility to accommodate variable renewable energy (VRE) generation such as wind power and photovoltaics. However, its investment cost currently is too high to justify its benefit in terms of providing renewable energy only. In this paper we evaluate the economic benefit of CSP in high renewable energy penetrated power systems from two aspects: generating renewable energy and providing operational flexibility to help accommodating VRE. In order to keep the same renewable energy penetration level during evaluation, we compare the economic costs between the system with a high share of VRE and another in which some part of the VRE generation is replaced by CSP generation. The generation cost of a power system is analyzed through chronological operation simulation over a whole year. The benefit of CSP is quantified into two parts: (1) energy benefit - the saving investment of substituted VRE generation and (2) flexibility benefit - the reduction in operating cost due to substituting VRE with CSP. The break-even investment cost of CSP is further discussed. The methodology is tested on a modified IEEE RTS-79 system. The economic justifications of CSP are demonstrated in two practical provincial power systems with high penetration of renewable energy in northwestern China, Qinghai and Gansu, where the former province has massive inflexible thermal power plants but later one has high share of flexible hydro power. The results suggest that the CSP is more beneficial in Gansu system than in Qinghai. The levelized benefit of CSP, including both energy benefit and flexibility benefit, is about 0.177-0.191 $/kWh in Qinghai and about 0.238-0.300 $/kWh in Gansu, when replacing 5-20% VRE generation with CSP generation.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We report a high-performance atomic Fe catalyst derived from chemically Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) by directly bonding Fe ions to imidazolate ligands within 3D frameworks. Although the ZIF was identified as a promising precursor, the new synthetic chemistry enables the creation of well-dispersed atomic Fe sites embedded into porous carbon without the formation of aggregates. The size of catalyst particles is tunable through synthesizing Fe-doped ZIF nanocrystal precursors in a wide range from 20 to 1000 nm followed by one-step thermal activation. Similar to Pt nanoparticles, the unique size control without altering chemical properties afforded by this approach is able to increase the number of PGM-free active sites. The best ORR activity is measured with the catalyst at a size of 50 nm. Further size reduction to 20 nm leads to significant particle agglomeration, thus decreasing the activity. In using the homogeneous atomic Fe model catalysts, we elucidated the active site formation process through correlating measured ORR activity with the change of chemical bonds in precursors during thermal activation up to 1100 °C. The critical temperature to form active sites is 800 °C, which is associated with a new Fe species with a reduced oxidation number (from Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>) likely bonded with pyridinic N (FeN<sub>4</sub>) embedded into the carbon planes. Further increasing the temperature leads to continuously enhanced activity, linked to the rise of graphitic N and Fe–N species. The new atomic Fe catalyst has achieved respectable ORR activity in challenging acidic media (0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), showing a half-wave potential of 0.85 V vs RHE and leaving only a 30 mV gap with Pt/C (60 μg<sub>P</sub>t/cm<sup>2</sup>). Finally, enhanced stability is attained with the same catalyst, which loses only 20 mV after 10 000 potential cycles (0.6–1.0 V) in O<sub>2</sub> saturated acid. The high-performance atomic Fe PGM-free catalyst holds great promise as a replacement for Pt in future PEMFCs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Evaluation of Data-Driven Models for Predicting Solar Photovoltaics Power Output","Moslehi, Salim; Reddy, T. Agami; Katipamula, Srinivas","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar photovoltaics; PV power prediction; data-driven modeling; renewable energy; sustainable energy","This research was undertaken to evaluate different inverse models for predicting power output of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems under different practical scenarios. In particular, we have investigated whether PV power output prediction accuracy can be improved if module/cell temperature was measured in addition to climatic variables, and also the extent to which prediction accuracy degrades if solar irradiation is not measured on the plane of array but only on a horizontal surface. We have also investigated the significance of different independent or regressor variables, such as wind velocity and incident angle modifier in predicting PV power output and cell temperature. The inverse regression model forms have been evaluated both in terms of their goodness-of-fit, and their accuracy and robustness in terms of their predictive performance. Given the accuracy of the measurements, expected CV-RMSE of hourly power output prediction over the year varies between 3.2% and 8.6% when only climatic data are used. Depending on what type of measured climatic and PV performance data is available, different scenarios have been identified and the corresponding appropriate modeling pathways have been proposed. The corresponding models are to be implemented on a controller platform for optimum operational planning of microgrids and integrated energy systems.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Sensitivity of natural gas deployment in the US power sector to future carbon policy expectations","Mignone, Bryan K.; Showalter, Sharon; Wood, Frances; McJeon, Haewon; Steinberg, Daniel","03 NATURAL GAS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Natural gas; Climate change mitigation; Energy system transformation; Energy modeling; natural gas; climate change mitigation; energy system transformation; energy modeling","One option for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector is replacement of coal-fired generation with less carbon-intensive natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generation. In the United States, where there is abundant, low-cost natural gas supply, increased NGCC deployment could be a cost-effective emissions abatement opportunity at relatively modest carbon prices. However, under scenarios in which carbon prices rise and deeper emissions reductions are achieved, other technologies may be more cost-effective than NGCC in the future. In this analysis, using a US energy system model with foresight (a version of the National Energy Modeling System or 'NEMS' model), we find that varying expectations about carbon prices after 2030 does not materially affect NGCC deployment prior to 2030, all else equal. An important implication of this result is that, under the set of natural gas and carbon price trajectories explored here, myopic behavior or other imperfect expectations about potential future carbon policy do not change the natural gas deployment path or lead to stranded natural gas generation infrastructure. We explain these results in terms of the underlying economic competition between available generation technologies and discuss the broader relevance to US climate change mitigation policy.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Biorefinery for combined production of jet fuel and ethanol from lipid‐producing sugarcane: a techno‐economic evaluation","Kumar, Deepak; Long, Stephen P.; Singh, Vijay","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; bioethanol; biojet fuel; lipid; sugarcane; techno-economic; transgenic","Replacing fossil fuels with an economically viable green alternative at scale has proved most challenging in the aviation sector. Recently sugarcane, the most productive crop on the planet, has been engineered to accumulate lipids. This opens the way for production of far more industrial vegetable oil per acre than previously possible. This study performs techno-economic feasibility analysis of jet fuel production from this new cost efficient and high yield feedstock. A comprehensive process model for biorefinery producing hydrotreated jet fuel (from lipids) and ethanol (from sugars), with 1 600 000 MT yr<sup>-1</sup> lipid-cane processing capacity, was developed in SuperPro Designer. Considering lipid-cane development is continuing for higher oil concentrations, analysis was performed with lipid-cane containing 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% lipids. Capital investments for the biorefinery ranged from 238.1 to 351.2 million USD, with jet fuel capacities of 12.6–50.5 million liters (correspondingly ethanol production of nil to 102.6 million liters). The production cost of jet fuel for different scenarios was estimated 0.73 to 1.79 per liter (2.74 to 6.76 per gal) of jet fuel. In all cases, the cost of raw materials accounted for more than 70% of total operational cost. Biorefinery was observed self-sustainable for steam and electricity requirement, because of in-house steam and electricity generation from burning of bagasse. Minimum fuel selling prices with a 10% discount rate for 20% lipid case was estimated 1.40/L ($5.31/gal), which was lower than most of the reported prices of renewable jet fuel produced from other oil crops and algae. Along with lower production costs, lipid-cane could produce as high as 16 times the jet fuel (6307 L ha<sup>-1</sup>) per unit land than that of other oil crops and do so using low-value land unsuited to most other crops, while being highly water and nitrogen use efficient.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United Kingdom","2017-09-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Global Change Biology.

Metal hydride thermal energy storage systems have demonstrated the potential to achieve very high volumetric energy densities, high exergetic efficiencies, and low costs. The current work analyzes the technical feasibility and the performance of a storage system based on the high temperature Mg<sub>2</sub>FeH<sub>6</sub> hydride coupled with the low temperature Na<sub>3</sub>AlH<sub>6</sub> hydride. To accomplish this, a detailed transport model has been set up and the coupled metal hydride system has been simulated based on a laboratory scale experimental configuration. Proper kinetics expressions have been developed and included in the model to replicate the absorption and desorption process in the high temperature and low temperature hydride materials. The system showed adequate hydrogen transfer between the two metal hydrides, with almost complete charging and discharging, during both thermal energy storage and thermal energy release. The system operating temperatures varied from 450°C to 500°C, with hydrogen pressures between 30 bar and 70 bar. This makes the thermal energy storage system a suitable candidate for pairing with a solar driven steam power plant. The model results, obtained for the selected experimental configuration, showed an actual thermal energy storage system volumetric energy density of about 132 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>, which is more than 5 times the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot target (25 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>).","Elsevier","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Hydrogen Energy; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 35","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 22518-22529","","SRNL-STI-2018-00039","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-3199; PII: S036031991731683X; TRN: US1802841","10.1016/j.ijhydene.2017.04.231","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1426657","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1426657","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1426657","International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","35","42"
"The human dimensions of energy use in buildings: A review","D'Oca, Simona; Hong, Tianzhen; Langevin, Jared","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Human dimensions; Energy use; Occupant behavior; Building life cycle; Energy performance; Stakeholders","The “human dimensions” of energy use in buildings refer to the energy-related behaviors of key stakeholders that affect energy use over the building life cycle. Stakeholders include building designers, operators, managers, engineers, occupants, industry, vendors, and policymakers, who directly or indirectly influence the acts of designing, constructing, living, operating, managing, and regulating the built environments, from individual building up to the urban scale. Among factors driving high-performance buildings, human dimensions play a role that is as significant as that of technological advances. However, this factor is not well understood, and, as a result, human dimensions are often ignored or simplified by stakeholders. This work presents a review of the literature on human dimensions of building energy use to assess the state-of-the-art in this topic area. The paper highlights research needs for fully integrating human dimensions into the building design and operation processes with the goal of reducing energy use in buildings while enhancing occupant comfort and productivity. This research focuses on identifying key needs for each stakeholder involved in a building's life cycle and takes an interdisciplinary focus that spans the fields of architecture and engineering design, sociology, data science, energy policy, codes, and standards to provide targeted insights. Greater understanding of the human dimensions of energy use has several potential benefits including reductions in operating cost for building owners; enhanced comfort conditions and productivity for building occupants; more effective building energy management and automation systems for building operators and energy managers; and the integration of more accurate control logic into the next generation of human-in-the-loop technologies. The review concludes by summarizing recommendations for policy makers and industry stakeholders for developing codes, standards, and technologies that can leverage the human dimensions of energy use to reliably predict and achieve energy use reductions in the residential and commercial buildings sectors.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

These infrastructures extend well outside metropolitan boundaries and impact distal river ecosystems. We used a comprehensive model to quantify the roles of anthropogenic stressors on hydrologic alteration and biodiversity in US streams and isolated the impacts stemming from hard infrastructure developments in cities. Across the conterminous US, cities’ hard infrastructures have significantly altered at least 7% of streams, which influence habitats for over 60% of North America’s fish, mussel, and crayfish species. Additionally, city infrastructures have contributed to local extinctions in 260 species and currently influence 970 indigenous species, 27% of which are in jeopardy. We find that ecosystem impacts do not scale with city size but are instead proportionate to infrastructure decisions. For example, Atlanta’s impacts by hard infrastructures extend across four major river basins, 12,500 stream km, and contribute to 100 local extinctions of aquatic species. In contrast, Las Vegas, a similar size city, impacts < 1000 stream km, leading to only 7 local extinctions. So, cities have local policy choices that can reduce future impacts to regional aquatic ecosystems as cities grow. Furthermore, by coordinating policy and communication between hard infrastructure sectors, local city governments and utilities can directly improve environmental quality in a significant fraction of the nation’s streams and aquatic biota reaching far beyond their city boundaries.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Prediction of Individual Social-Demographic Role Based on Travel Behavior Variability Using Long-Term GPS Data","Zhu, Lei; Gonder, Jeffrey; Lin, Lei","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; travel behavior; GPS; travel pattern; sensitivity analysis; Puget Sound Regional Council","<p>With the development of and advances in smartphones and global positioning system (GPS) devices, travelers’ long-term travel behaviors are not impossible to obtain. This study investigates the pattern of individual travel behavior and its correlation with social-demographic features. For different social-demographic groups (e.g., full-time employees and students), the individual travel behavior may have specific temporal-spatial-mobile constraints. The study first extracts the home-based tours, including Home-to-Home and Home-to-Non-Home, from long-term raw GPS data. The travel behavior pattern is then delineated by home-based tour features, such as departure time, destination location entropy, travel time, and driving time ratio. The travel behavior variability describes the variances of travelers’ activity behavior features for an extended period. After that, the variability pattern of an individual’s travel behavior is used for estimating the individual’s social-demographic information, such as social-demographic role, by a supervised learning approach, support vector machine. In this study, a long-term (18-month) recorded GPS data set from Puget Sound Regional Council is used. The experiment’s result is very promising. In conclusion, the sensitivity analysis shows that as the number of tours thresholds increases, the variability of most travel behavior features converges, while the prediction performance may not change for the fixed test data.</p>","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Urban Nexus Science for Future Cities: Focus on the Energy-Water-Food-X Nexus","Sperling, Joshua B.; Berke, Philip R.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; water-energy-food systems; urban nexus science","Rapid urban expansion of the world's cities is placing unprecedented demands on the energy, water, food, and other (X) systems (e.g., mobility) that each offer multiple life-supporting services. Coordination that considers inter-sectoral connections among these urban systems and services remains nascent in practice, yet are critical to the future well-being, resource/operational efficiency, and resilience of urban areas. This paper therefore proposes an applied 'urban nexus science' framework to identify integrated and synergistic pathways toward achieving urban sustainability. The design, planning, and operation of urban W-E-F systems can benefit from integrated analyses to accelerate infrastructure, land use, and hazard mitigation planning and decision-making. New knowledge quantifying the key effects of W-E-F systems designed in isolation versus an increasingly integrated systems, especially when exposed to hazards, health risks, or extreme events, are a critical need. Interactive system modeling and participatory technologies are needed to support stakeholder engagement and two-way (and multi-directional) information flow, for exploring outcomes of alternative solutions for integrating W-E-F sectors. To support such important efforts, research is needed to fill critical gaps in data, identify tradeoffs, and develop synergistic solutions that measure sustainability co-benefits based on different levels of urban integration among W-E-F systems and services.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this market environment driven by persistently low natural gas prices and stagnant electricity demand, we estimate that about two thirds of the 100 GW nuclear capacity are uncompetitive over the next few years under the current trajectory. Among those, 18 GW are retiring or are merchant plants at high risk of retiring prematurely. The potential consequences of the hypothetical withdrawal of 20 GW of nuclear capacity include: 1) a ~3.2% increase in carbon emissions if replaced by gas-fired units or 2) a significant increase in cost if replaced by renewables. Without a carbon price, out-of-the-market payments would be needed to effectively maintain merchant nuclear capacity. Filling the revenue gap would come at a fleet-average cost of 3.5-5.5/ MWh for these plants, which is much lower than the cost of subsidizing wind power. The policy support could take the form of direct zero-emission credits, renewable portfolio standard expansion, or clean capacity market mechanisms. As a last resort, the exercise of a new mothballing status could prevent the irreversible retirement of nuclear power assets.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Despite research that has quantified the costs, benefits, and energy savings of MBCx, the process remains under-utilized. To understand why MBCx is not more frequently adopted and how to encourage its use, this research synthesizes qualitative data from over 40 organizations, currently engaging in MBCx. The outcome of this research is a framework containing variables that emerged from the qualitative data, marked as barriers or enablers, organized by phases of the MBCx process. The framework is comprised of 51 emergent variables that fall within 13 different categories. The variables that most frequently act as barriers are data configuration, measurement & verification (M&V), developing specifications for EMIS, and data architecture. Although some variables that act as barriers for one organization were identified as enablers for another. For example, payback/ROI was considered a barrier 7 times and an enabler 3 times. One organization had difficulty making the business case for the initial investment for MBCx due to lack of cost information, while another was able to justify large investments with documented savings of previously implemented measures identified through MBCx. The framework formally validates barriers found in previous research, and can be used by practitioners to better understand common experiences with MBCx. This research also highlights the need for a similar collective data set to validate common enablers to MBCx and also the need for empirical research to determine relationships between variables.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Although this chronic energy scarcity has not impeded the economic trajectory of either country, it has influenced their industrial structures in strikingly different ways – with Korea nevertheless developing a vast energy-intensive manufacturing sector, while Israel has largely relied on its service sector to support a growing consumer society. While different in industrial structure, however, the two economies have been connected by intensive trade relations, meaning that energy is consumed in one country for the production of goods used in the other. In order to examine the economic and environmental implications of the two economies' structural divergence and bilateral trade relations, we use economic input-output analysis to track the life cycle (LC) energy consumption of passenger cars – a product which has significant environmental impact due to energy consumption in both its production and use stages – which were manufactured in Korea and exported to Israel during the period of 1997–2011. Our findings show that while most of the LC energy consumption of the vehicles occurs in Israel where the vehicle operation takes place, this does not mean that Israel's “avoided energy” by importing the Korean cars is insignificant. The embodied energy of vehicles traded in 2011 reached 3179 TJ, exceeding the amount of energy used by Israel's entire on-site building construction sector over the same period. If the Israeli economy had hypothetically developed its own auto manufacturing industry including secondary suppliers to meet domestic demand as well as exports – as was done in Korea – the energy consumption in those industries would be equivalent to about half of the current energy use by Israel's entire industrial sector.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.12.001","","","","United States","2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 61-69","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925517302536; TRN: US19W4040035611","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.12.001","","2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","22791396","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22791396","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","69"
"Exploring pluralism – Different stakeholder views of the expected and realised value of strategic environmental assessment (SEA)","Cape, Lydia; Retief, Francois; Lochner, Paul; Fischer, Thomas; Bond, Alan; School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia (United Kingdom)]","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; DECISION MAKING; EFFICIENCY; ENERGY POLICY; INDUSTRY; LEARNING; PLANNING; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES; SOUTH AFRICA","This paper explores the concept of pluralism by evaluating different stakeholder views on the expected and realised value of strategic environmental assessment (SEA). The research followed a single embedded case study approach (of a national-level SEA for renewable energy planning in South Africa) and engaged with four different stakeholder groups, namely government, industry, conservation groups, and interested and affected parties (IAPs). A total of 21 different value expectations (VEs) across all four stakeholder groups were identified. However, stakeholder groups contrast significantly in terms of VEs, with government concerned more with process and mandate; industry with cost, efficiency and certainty; conservation groups with data and technical aspects; and the IAPs with local scale issues. In terms of realisation of VEs the results suggest that SEA does provide opportunities for learning; focussing project level EIA and providing spatial guidance on the location of projects. However, SEA was less successful in realising integration of decision making and alignment of policy within government. Recognition and better understanding of the pluralistic nature of expected and realised VEs could potentially improve the legitimacy of SEA processes and methodologies if they are designed and implemented to accommodate pluralism.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.11.005","","","","United States","2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 69; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 32-41","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925517302378; TRN: US19W4036071142","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.11.005","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","22826041","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22826041","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","69"

This article provides details on changes made to the FLORIS model to make the model more suitable for gradient-based optimization. Changes to the FLORIS model were made to remove discontinuities and add curvature to regions of non-physical zero gradient. Exact gradients for the FLORIS model were obtained using algorithmic differentiation. A set of three case studies demonstrate that using exact gradients with gradient-based optimization reduces the number of function calls by several orders of magnitude. The case studies also show that adding curvature improves convergence behavior, allowing gradient-based optimization algorithms used with the FLORIS model to more reliably find better solutions to wind farm optimization problems.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Electric load shape benchmarking for small- and medium-sized commercial buildings","Luo, Xuan; Hong, Tianzhen; Chen, Yixing; Piette, Mary Ann","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Small- and medium-sized commercial buildings owners and utility managers often look for opportunities for energy cost savings through energy efficiency and energy waste minimization. However, they currently lack easy access to low-cost tools that help interpret the massive amount of data needed to improve understanding of their energy use behaviors. Benchmarking is one of the techniques used in energy audits to identify which buildings are priorities for an energy analysis. Traditional energy performance indicators, such as the energy use intensity (annual energy per unit of floor area), consider only the total annual energy consumption, lacking consideration of the fluctuation of energy use behavior over time, which reveals the time of use information and represents distinct energy use behaviors during different time spans. To fill the gap, this study developed a general statistical method using 24-hour electric load shape benchmarking to compare a building or business/tenant space against peers. Specifically, the study developed new forms of benchmarking metrics and data analysis methods to infer the energy performance of a building based on its load shape. We first performed a data experiment with collected smart meter data using over 2,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in California. We then conducted a cluster analysis of the source data, and determined and interpreted the load shape features and parameters with peer group analysis. Finally, we implemented the load shape benchmarking feature in an open-access web-based toolkit (the Commercial Building Energy Saver) to provide straightforward and practical recommendations to users. The analysis techniques were generic and flexible for future datasets of other building types and in other utility territories.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Potential Arbitrage Revenue of Energy Storage Systems in PJM","Salles, Mauricio; Huang, Junling; Aziz, Michael; Hogan, William","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; battery; electricity market; energy arbitrage; energy storage; real-time market","The volatility of electricity prices is attracting interest in the opportunity of providing net revenue by energy arbitrage. We analyzed the potential revenue of a generic Energy Storage System (ESS) in 7395 different locations within the electricity markets of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland interconnection (PJM), the largest U.S. regional transmission organization, using hourly locational marginal prices over the seven-year period 2008–2014. Assuming a price-taking ESS with perfect foresight in the real-time market, we optimized the charge-discharge profile to determine the maximum potential revenue for a 1 MW system as a function of energy/power ratio, or rated discharge duration, from 1 to 14 h, including a limited analysis of sensitivity to round-trip efficiency. We determined minimum potential revenue with a similar analysis of the day-ahead market. We presented the distribution over the set of nodes and years of price, price volatility, and maximum potential arbitrage revenue. From these results, we determined the break even overnight installed cost of an ESS below which arbitrage would be profitable, its dependence on rated discharge duration, its distribution over grid nodes, and its variation over the years. We showed that dispatch into real-time markets based on day-ahead market settlement prices is a simple, feasible method that raises the lower bound on the achievable arbitrage revenue.","MDPI AG","","Harvard Univ., Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-07-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel); Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1100","","","AR0000348","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en10081100","10.3390/en10081100","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1424748","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1424748","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424748","Energies (Basel)","12","10"

Yet, building energy codes can only deliver results when the codes are implemented. For this reason, studies of building energy codes need to consider implementation of building energy codes in a consistent and comprehensive way. This research identifies elements and practices in implementing building energy codes, covering codes in 22 countries that account for 70% of global energy use in buildings. These elements and practices include: comprehensive coverage of buildings by type, age, size, and geographic location; an implementation framework that involves a certified agency to inspect construction at critical stages; and building materials that are independently tested, rated, and labeled. Training and supporting tools are another element of successful code implementation. Some countries have also introduced compliance evaluation studies, which suggested that tightening energy requirements would only be meaningful when also addressing gaps in implementation (Pitt&Sherry, 2014; U.S. DOE, 2016b). Here, this article provides examples of practices that countries have adopted to assist with implementation of building energy codes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that occurs at the anode side requires a four-electron transfer under highly oxidizing conditions. OER has a large overpotential and therefore determines the overall efficiency. Certain electrocatalysts can efficiently help to improve the reaction kinetics. Owing to the high cost of precious metals such as Pt, Ru, and Ir, non-precious metal oxide catalysts have been vigorously investigated under alkaline conditions. Herein, we synthesized novel highly dispersed amorphous CoO<sub>x</sub> for the first time in the form of a cluster favorable to enhance the OER activity using a facile method via the air dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Compared with the pristine biopolymer–cobalt complex, the amorphous CoO<sub>x</sub> cluster exhibits a much higher current density and a lower overpotential for OER, e.g., the overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and the overpotential of only 350 mV at 300 mA cm<sup>-1</sup>. The excellent electrocatalytic OER activity was attributed to the unsaturated catalytic sites on the amorphous CoO<sub>x</sub> cluster. In addition, we studied the reaction mechanism, and it was observed that pure O<sub>2</sub> DBD plasma could lead to the evolution of crystalline CoO<sub>x</sub>; however, the presence of N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in DBD plasma could ensure the facile evolution of amorphous CoO<sub>x</sub> clusters. This study provides a new strategy, therefore, to design amorphous materials for electrocatalysis and beyond.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Evaluation of alternative filter media for particulate matter emission testing of residential wood heating devices","Allen, George; Rector, Lisa; Butcher, Thomas; Trojanowski, Rebecca","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY","The performance of Teflon-coated glass fiber filter media (Pallflex Emfab TX40) is evaluated for particulate matter (PM) sampling of residential wood heating devices in a dilution tunnel. Thirty samples of varying duration and PM loading and concentration were collected from an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 28 dilution tunnel using dual Method 5G sample trains with untreated glass fiber and Emfab filters. Filters were weighed soon after the end of sampling and again the next day after equilibration at 35% relative humidity (RH). PM concentrations from both types of filters agreed very well with 1-day equilibration, demonstrating that Emfab filters are appropriate for use in measuring PM from residential wood burning appliances in a dilution tunnel and have performance equal to or better than the glass fiber filter media. Agreement between filter media without equilibration was erratic, with PM from glass fiber filter samples varying from slightly less than the Emfab samples to as much as 2.8 times higher. Some of the glass fiber filters lost substantial mass with equilibration, with the highest percent loss at lower filter mass loadings. Mass loss for Emfab samples was a small percentage of the mass and very consistent across the range of mass loadings. Taken together, these results may indicate water uptake on the glass fiber media that is readily removed with 1-day equilibration at moderate RH conditions. Implications: EPA regulations now allow the use of either glass fiber or Teflon filter media for wood appliance PM emission testing. Teflon filter media minimizes the potential for acid-gas PM artifacts on glass fiber filters; this is important as EPA moves toward the use of locally sourced cordwood for testing that may have higher sulfur content. This work demonstrates that the use of Teflon-coated glass fiber filters can give similar PM measurement results to glass fiber filters after 1 day of equilibration. With no equilibration, measured PM from glass fiber filters was usually higher than from Teflon-coated glass fiber filters.","Taylor and Francis","","Brookhaven National Lab.

We report that there is compelling evidence, from both cross-sectional and intervention studies, of an association of increased student performance with increased ventilation rates. There is evidence that reduced respiratory health effects and reduced student absence are associated with increased ventilation rates. Increasing ventilation rates in schools imposes energy costs and can increase heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system capital costs. The net annual costs, ranging from a few dollars to about 10 dollars per person, are less than 0.1% of typical public spending on elementary and secondary education in the United States. Finally, such expenditures seem like a small price to pay given the evidence of health and performance benefits.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Potential adopters navigate increasingly complex decision-making landscapes in their path to adoption. Much is known about the individual-level drivers of solar PV diffusion that steer adopters through this process, but relatively little is known about the evolution of these drivers as solar PV markets mature. By understanding the evolution of emerging solar PV markets over time, stakeholders in the diffusion of solar PV can increase policy effectiveness and reduce costs. This analysis uses survey data to compare two adjacent markets across a range of relevant characteristics, then models changes in the importance of local vs cosmopolitan information sources by combining theory relating market maturity to adopter behavior with event-history techniques. In younger markets, earlier, innovative adoptions that are tied to a preference for cosmopolitan information sources are more prevalent than expected, suggesting a frustrated demand for solar PV that segues into adoptions fueled by local information preferences contemporary with similar adoptions in older markets. Furthermore, the analysis concludes with policy recommendations to leverage changing consumer information preferences as markets mature.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Is current irrigation sustainable in the United States? An integrated assessment of climate change impact on water resources and irrigated crop yields","Blanc, Elodie; Caron, Justin; Fant, Charles; Monier, Erwan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; crop yields; irrigation; climate change; mitigation policy","While climate change impacts on crop yields has been extensively studied, estimating the impact of water shortages on irrigated crop yields is challenging because the water resources management system is complex. To investigate this issue, we integrate a crop yield reduction module and a water resources model into the MIT Integrated Global System Modeling framework, an integrated assessment model linking a global economic model to an Earth system model. We assess the effects of climate and socioeconomic changes on water availability for irrigation in the U.S. as well as subsequent impacts on crop yields by 2050, while accounting for climate change projection uncertainty. We find that climate and socioeconomic changes will increase water shortages and strongly reduce irrigated yields for specific crops (i.e., cotton and forage), or in specific regions (i.e., the Southwest) where irrigation is not sustainable. Crop modeling studies that do not represent changes in irrigation availability can thus be misleading. Yet, since the most water-stressed basins represent a relatively small share of U.S. irrigated areas, the overall reduction in U.S. crop yields is small. The response of crop yields to climate change and water stress also suggests that some level of adaptation will be feasible, like relocating croplands to regions with sustainable irrigation or switching to less irrigation intensive crops. Finally, additional simulations show that greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation can alleviate the effect of water stress on irrigated crop yields, enough to offset the reduced CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effect compared to an unconstrained GHG emission scenario.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USEPA","","United States","2017-06-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Earth's Future; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 877-892","","","FG02-94ER61937; XA-83600001","Journal ID: ISSN 2328-4277","10.1002/2016EF000473","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1424381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1424381","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424381","Earth's Future","8","5"

A new service cost allocation mechanism is proposed to award PEVs based on the amount of service they provided, while considering compensations for delayed-charging and reduction of battery lifetime due to participation of the service. The GIDP transforms the optimal dispatch problem from a high-dimensional space into a one-dimensional space while preserving the solution optimality. When solving the transformed problem in real-time, the global optimality of the GIDP solution can be guaranteed by mathematically proved “indexability”. Because the GIDP index can be calculated upon the PEV’s arrival and used for the entire decision making process till its departure, the computational burden is minimized and the complexity of the aggregator dispatch process is significantly reduced. Finally, simulation results are used to evaluate the proposed GIDP, and to demonstrate the potential profitability from providing frequency regulation service by using PEVs.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We find that rooftop PV's ability to meet estimated city electricity consumption varies widely - from meeting 16% of annual consumption (in Washington, DC) to meeting 88% (in Mission Viejo, CA). Important drivers include average rooftop suitability, household footprint/per-capita roof space, the quality of the solar resource, and the city's estimated electricity consumption. In addition to city-wide results, we also estimate the ability of aggregations of households to offset their electricity consumption with PV. In a companion article, we will use statistical modeling to extend our results and estimate national rooftop PV technical potential. In addition, our publically available data and methods may help policy makers, utilities, researchers, and others perform customized analyses to meet their specific needs.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Electricity generation is simulated using GridView, then used to scale electricity-sector emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) from an existing gridded inventory of air emissions. This approach offers a novel method to leverage advanced electricity simulations with state-of-the-art emissions inventories, without necessitating recalculation of emissions for each facility. The baseline and perturbed emissions are input to the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ version 4.7.1) for a full accounting of time- and space-varying air quality changes associated with the 17% PV scenario. These results offer a high-value opportunity to evaluate the reduced-form AVoided Emissions and geneRation Tool (AVERT), while using AVERT to test the sensitivity of results to changing base-years and levels of solar integration. We find that average NOX and SO2 emissions across the region decrease 20% and 15%, respectively. PM2.5 concentrations decreased on average 4.7% across the Eastern U.S., with nitrate (NO3-) PM2.5 decreasing 3.7% and sulfate (SO42-) PM2.5 decreasing 9.1%. In the five largest cities in the region, we find that the most polluted days show the most significant PM2.5 decrease under the 17% PV generation scenario, and that the greatest benefits are accrued to cities in or near the Ohio River Valley. We find summer health benefits from reduced PM2.5 exposure estimated as 1424 avoided premature deaths (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 284 deaths, 2 732 deaths) or a health savings of $13.1 billion (95% CI: $0.6 billion, $43.9 billion) These results highlight the potential for renewable energy as a tool for air quality managers to support current and future health-based air quality regulations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The analysis addressed both fuel cycle and vehicle manufacturing cycle for the following vehicle types: gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), flex fuel vehicles, compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Gasoline ICEVs using current technology have C2G emissions of ~450 gCO2e/mi (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per mile), while C2G emissions from HEVs, PHEVs, H2 FCEVs, and BEVs range from 300-350 gCO2e/mi. Future vehicle efficiency gains are expected to reduce emissions to ~350 gCO2/mi for ICEVs and ~250 gCO2e/mi for HEVs, PHEVs, FCEVs, and BEVs. Utilizing low-carbon fuel pathways yields GHG reductions more than double those achieved by vehicle efficiency gains alone. Levelized costs of driving (LCDs) are in the range $0.25-$1.00/mi depending on time frame and vehicle-fuel technology. In all cases, vehicle cost represents the major (60-90%) contribution to LCDs. Currently, HEV and PHEV petroleum-fueled vehicles provide the most attractive cost in terms of avoided carbon emissions, although they offer lower potential GHG reductions. The ranges of LCD and cost of avoided carbon are narrower for the future technology pathways, reflecting the expected economic competitiveness of these alternative vehicles and fuels.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The geography of solar energy in the United States: Market definition, industry structure, and choice in solar PV adoption","O’Shaughnessy, Eric; Nemet, Gregory F.; Darghouth, Naïm","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar; market definition; spatial analysis; industry","© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The solar photovoltaic (PV) installation industry comprises thousands of firms around the world who collectively installed nearly 200 million panels in 2015. Spatial analysis of the emerging industry has received considerable attention from the literature, especially on the demand side concerning peer effects and adopter clustering. However this research area does not include similarly sophisticated spatial analysis on the supply side of the installation industry. The lack of understanding of the spatial structure of the PV installation industry leaves PV market research to rely on jurisdictional lines, such as counties, to define geographic PV markets. We develop an approach that uses the spatial distribution of installers’ activity to define geographic boundaries for PV markets. Our method is useful for PV market research and applicable in the contexts of other industries. We use our approach to demonstrate that the PV industry in the United States is spatially heterogeneous. Despite the emergence of some national-scale PV installers, installers are largely local and installer communities are unique from one region to the next. The social implications of the spatial heterogeneity of the emerging PV industry involve improving understanding of issues such as market power, industry consolidation, and how much choice potential adopters have.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A formal method to compute the optimal sub-hourly power trajectory is derived for a system when the price of energy and ramping are both significant. Optimal control functions are obtained in both time and frequency domains, and a discrete-time solution suitable for periodic feedback control systems is presented. The method is applied to North America Western Interconnection for the planning year 2024, and it is shown that an optimal dispatch strategy that simultaneously considers both the cost of energy and the cost of ramping leads to significant cost savings in systems with high levels of renewable generation: the savings exceed 25% of the total system operating cost for a 50% renewables scenario.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE; California Energy Commission; University of Victoria","","United States","2018-01-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 213; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 262-271","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918300424; TRN: US1802133","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.01.041","","2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","1425624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1425624","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1425624","Applied Energy","C","213"

"A roadmap for nuclear energy technology","Sofu, Tanju","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","The prospects for the future use of nuclear energy worldwide can best be understood within the context of global population growth, urbanization, rising energy need and associated pollution concerns. As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development challenges are expected to be concentrated in cities of the lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is fastest. As these countries continue their trajectory of economic development, their energy need will also outpace their population growth adding to the increased demand for electricity. OECD IEA’s energy system deployment pathway foresees doubling of the current global nuclear capacity by 2050 to reduce the impact of rapid urbanization. The pending “retirement cliff” of the existing U.S. nuclear fleet, representing over 60 percent of the nation’s emission-free electricity, also poses a large economic and environmental challenge. To meet the challenge, the U.S. DOE has developed the vision and strategy for development and deployment of advanced reactors. As part of that vision, the U.S. government pursues programs that aim to expand the use of nuclear power by supporting sustainability of the existing nuclear fleet, deploying new water-cooled large and small modular reactors to enable nuclear energy to help meet the energy security and climate change goals, conducting R&D for advanced reactor technologies with alternative coolants, and developing sustainable nuclear fuel cycle strategies. Since the current path relying heavily on water-cooled reactors and “once-through” fuel cycle is not sustainable, next generation nuclear energy systems under consideration aim for significant advances over existing and evolutionary water-cooled reactors. Among the spectrum of advanced reactor options, closed-fuel-cycle systems using reactors with fast-neutron spectrum to meet the sustainability goals offer the most attractive alternatives. However, given these circumstances, unless the new public-private partnership models emerge to tackle the licensing and demonstration challenges for these advanced reactor concepts, realization of their enormous potential is not likely, at least in the U.S.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Argonne National Lab.

To shed some light on the economic viability of REE recycling from HDDs, this paper combines techno-economic information of a hydrometallurgical process with end-of-life HDD availability in a simulation model. Results showed that adding REEs to HDD recycling was profitable given current prices. As a result, recovered REEs could meet up to 5.1% rest of world (excluding China) magnet demand. Aluminum, gold, copper scrap and REEs were the primary main revenue streams from HDD recycling.","Springer","","Idaho National Lab.

Understanding the consumer behavior in DCFC usage is critical in successful deployment of DCFC. This paper analyzes real-world field data to examine DCFC usage in the U.S. In particular, it examines the effect of a flat-rate fee on the changes in the rate of charge. Furthermore, the result from regression analysis shows evidence that a flat-rate fee has a negative effect on efficient DCFC stations usage.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Modeling of HVAC operational faults in building performance simulation","Zhang, Rongpeng; Hong, Tianzhen","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Operational fault; HVAC system; EnergyPlus; Modeling and simulation; Energy performance; Thermal comfort","Operational faults are common in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of existing buildings, leading to a decrease in energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Various fault detection and diagnostic methods have been developed to identify and analyze HVAC operational faults at the component or subsystem level. However, current methods lack a holistic approach to predicting the overall impacts of faults at the building level—an approach that adequately addresses the coupling between various operational components, the synchronized effect between simultaneous faults, and the dynamic nature of fault severity. This study introduces the novel development of a fault-modeling feature in EnergyPlus which fills in the knowledge gap left by previous studies. This paper presents the design and implementation of the new feature in EnergyPlus and discusses in detail the fault-modeling challenges faced. The new fault-modeling feature enables EnergyPlus to quantify the impacts of faults on building energy use and occupant comfort, thus supporting the decision making of timely fault corrections. Including actual building operational faults in energy models also improves the accuracy of the baseline model, which is critical in the measurement and verification of retrofit or commissioning projects. As an example, EnergyPlus version 8.6 was used to investigate the impacts of a number of typical operational faults in an office building across several U.S. climate zones. Finally, the results demonstrate that the faults have significant impacts on building energy performance as well as on occupant thermal comfort. Finally, the paper introduces future development plans for EnergyPlus fault-modeling capability.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Evaluating the CO 2 emissions reduction potential and cost of power sector re-dispatch","Steinberg, Daniel C.; Bielen, David A.; Townsend, Aaron","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; natural gas; climate change mitigation; energy modeling; electricity","Prior studies of the U.S. electricity sector have recognized the potential to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by substituting generation from coal-fired units with generation from under-utilized and lower-emitting natural gas-fired units; in fact, this type of 're-dispatch' was invoked as one of the three building blocks used to set the emissions targets under the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. Despite the existence of surplus natural gas capacity in the U.S., power system operational constraints not often considered in power sector policy analyses, such as transmission congestion, generator ramping constraints, minimum generation constraints, planned and unplanned generator outages, and ancillary service requirements, could limit the potential and increase the cost of coal-to-gas re-dispatch. Using a highly detailed power system unit commitment and dispatch model, we estimate the maximum potential for re-dispatch in the Eastern Interconnection, which accounts for the majority of coal capacity and generation in the U.S. Under our reference assumptions, we find that maximizing coal-to-gas re-dispatch yields emissions reductions of 230 million metric tons (Mt), or 13% of power sector emissions in the Eastern Interconnection, with a corresponding average abatement cost of $15-$44 per metric ton of CO2, depending on the assumed supply elasticity of natural gas.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This research investigates the optimal balance between the risk of overinvesting in non-carbon sources that are ultimately not needed and the risk of underinvesting in non-carbon sources and subsequently needing to reduce carbon emissions dramatically. We employ a novel framework that incorporates a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U.S. into a two-stage stochastic approximate dynamic program (ADP) focused on decisions in the electric power sector. We solve the model using an ADP algorithm that is computationally tractable while exploring the decisions and sampling the uncertain carbon limits from continuous distributions. The results of the model demonstrate that an optimal hedge is in the direction of more non-carbon investment in the near-term, in the range of 20–30% of new generation. We also demonstrate that the optimal share of non-carbon generation is increasing in the variance of the uncertainty about the long-term carbon targets, and that with greater uncertainty in the future policy regime, a balanced portfolio of non-carbon, natural gas, and coal generation is desirable.","International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE)","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","National Science Foundation (NSF), Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 101-122","","","FG02-94ER61937; SC0003906; GEO-1240507","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574","10.5547/01956574.39.1.jmor","","2019-05-06T00:00:00Z","1509872","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1509872","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1509872","Energy Journal","1","39"

Grid scale energy storage systems are increasingly being deployed to provide grid operators the flexibility needed to maintain this balance. Energy storage also imparts resiliency and robustness to the grid infrastructure. Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the deployment of large scale energy storage systems. This growth has been driven by improvements in the cost and performance of energy storage technologies and the need to accommodate distributed generation, as well as incentives and government mandates. Energy management systems (EMSs) and optimization methods are required to effectively and safely utilize energy storage as a flexible grid asset that can provide multiple grid services. The EMS needs to be able to accommodate a variety of use cases and regulatory environments. In this paper, we provide a brief history of grid-scale energy storage, an overview of EMS architectures, and a summary of the leading applications for storage. These serve as a foundation for a discussion of EMS optimization methods and design.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Sandia National Lab.

In seasons for which drought is the overriding factor, performance is further improved. Historical counterfactual scenarios for the 1988 and 2012 droughts show that changes in agricultural technologies and management have reduced system-level drought sensitivity in US maize production by about 25% in the intervening years. Finally, we estimate the economic costs of the two droughts in terms of insured and uninsured crop losses in each US county (for a total, adjusted for inflation, of $9 billion in 1988 and $21.6 billion in 2012). We compare these with cost estimates from the counterfactual scenarios and with crop indemnity data where available. Model-based measures are capable of accurately reproducing the direct agro-economic losses associated with extreme drought and can be used to characterize and compare events that occurred under very different conditions. This work suggests new approaches to modeling, monitoring, forecasting, and evaluating drought impacts on agriculture, as well as evaluating technological changes to inform adaptation strategies for future climate change and extreme events.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This has an impact on the private investments in distributed energy resources (DER), since it occurs exactly when the PV prices are becoming attractive, and the opportunity to an energy transition based on solar technologies is being wasted. In particular, this limitation of the networks is a barrier for larger consumers, such as commercial and public buildings, aiming at investing in PV capacity and start operating as microgrids connected to the MV network. To address this challenge, this paper presents a coordinated approach to the microgrid investment and planning problem, where the system operator and the microgrid owner collaborate to improve the voltage control capabilities of the distribution network, increasing the PV potential. The results prove that this collaboration has the benefit of increasing the value of the microgrid investments while improving the quality of service of the system and it should be considered in the future regulatory framework.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The first is the sensitivity to using hourly averaged as opposed to subhourly solar-insolation data. The second is the sensitivity to errors in recording and interpreting load data. The third is the sensitivity to using modeled as opposed to measured solar-insolation data. We demonstrate that capacity-value estimates of solar are sensitive to all three of these factors, with potentially large errors in the capacity-value estimate in a particular year. If multiple years of data are available, the biases introduced by using hourly averaged solar-insolation can be smoothed out. Multiple years of data will not necessarily address the other data-related issues that we examine. Our analysis calls into question the accuracy of a number of solar capacity-value estimates relying exclusively on modeled solar-insolation data that are reported in the literature (including our own previous works). Our analysis also suggests that multiple years' historical data should be used for remunerating solar generators for their capacity value in organized wholesale electricity markets.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The electric power sector in the United States recently experienced a significant cost escalation: e.g. construction costs for large plants such as nuclear and coal-fired power plants doubled between 2003 and 2007. In this work, we assess the main drivers of this escalation. While many factors have affected costs, some of the most significant include cost of materials, particularly the price of metals and to a lesser extent cement, possible increases in labor quantity requirements, the aggressive worldwide competition for power plant design and construction resources, driven by high demand in Asia, regulatory tightening, and general uncertainty about future regulations and climate policies. We recalibrate power sector technology costs in the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) based on an extensive literature review of recent (post-2010) studies and in the process develop a coherent and updated set of current cost and performance assumptions for all major electricity-generating technologies. While current cost and performance assumptions of electricity-generating technologies are key drivers of short-term technology deployment and technology mix in the electricity sector, medium- and long-term deployment pathways are significantly affected by assumed efficiency improvement rates and cost reductions. Furthermore, we develop and demonstrate a method to forecast efficiency and construction cost of power plants and a sensitivity analysis to explore the importance of such assumptions in future scenarios generated by GCAM.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the understanding of the limitations of the energy modelling programs, their capability of predicting energy performance early in the design process, and the complicated functionality of these programs makes the software programs harder to use and less practical. The interactive tool developed in this study seeks to provide analysis information in a straightforward manner that is inexpensive, convenient, and sophisticated. This tool uses an inclusive approach to assess the feasibility of GSHPs by prescreening critical factors such as climate conditions, ground temperatures, energy use, and cost savings. It is interactive and enables the user to do a feasibility analysis with a weighting factor for each feasibility criterion based on the user’s preference and interests.

Thus, systems based on Earth-abundant elements deserve much attention. Potassium-ion batteries represent a promising candidate because of the abundance of potassium resources. As for the choices of anodes, graphite exhibits encouraging potassium-ion storage properties; however, it suffers limited rate capability and poor cycling stability. Here in this paper, nongraphitic carbons as K-ion anodes with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the binder are systematically investigated. Compared to hard carbon and soft carbon, a hard–soft composite carbon with 20 wt% soft carbon distributed in the matrix phase of hard carbon microspheres exhibits highly amenable performance: high capacity, high rate capability, and very stable long-term cycling. In contrast, pure hard carbon suffers limited rate capability, while the capacity of pure soft carbon fades more rapidly.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

A double-tilt TEM heating holder was used to directly characterize the changes in the morphology and the crystallographic and electronic structures of the materials with increase in temperature. The electron diffraction patterns and the electron energy loss spectra demonstrated the presence of cobalt oxides (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CoO) and even metallic cobalt (Co) at higher temperatures as a result of reduction of Co ions and loss of oxygen. The bright-field TEM images revealed that the surface of Na<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> becomes porous at high temperatures.

Based on the results from five energy-economic modeling teams, the paper explores the implications of economic growth, power plant cooling policies, and electricity CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions on water withdrawals and consumption. To understand how different modeling approaches derive different results for energy-water interactions, the five teams used harmonized assumptions regarding economic and population growth, the distribution of power plants by cooling technologies, and withdrawals and consumption intensities. The multi-model study provides robust results regarding the different but potentially complementary implications of cooling technology policies and efforts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The water implications of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions depend critically on the approach to these reductions. Focusing on wind and solar power reduces consumption and withdrawals, a focus on nuclear power increases both, and a focus on hydroelectric power could increase consumptive losses through evaporation. Policies focused specifically on cooling water can have substantial and complementary impacts.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Connecting the resource nexus to basic urban service provision – with a focus on water-energy interactions in New York City","Engström, Rebecka Ericsdotter; Howells, Mark; Destouni, Georgia; Bhatt, Vatsal; Bazilian, Morgan; Rogner, Hans-Holger","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY","Urban water and energy systems are crucial for sustainably meeting basic service demands in cities. Therefore, this paper proposes and applies a technology-independent “reference resource-to-service system” framework for concurrent evaluation of urban water and energy system interventions and their ‘nexus’ or ‘interlinkages’. In a concrete application, data that approximate New York City conditions are used to evaluate a limited set of interventions in the residential sector, spanning from low-flow toilet shifts to extensive green roof installations. Results indicate that interventions motivated primarily by water management goals can considerably reduce energy use and contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, energy efficiency interventions can considerably reduce water use in addition to lowering emissions. However, interventions yielding the greatest reductions in energy use and emissions are not necessarily the most water conserving ones, and vice versa. Useful further research, expanding the present analysis should consider a broader set of resource interactions, towards a full climate, land, energy and water (CLEW) nexus approach. Overall, assessing the impacts, trade-offs and co-benefits from interventions in one urban resource system on others also holds promise as support for increased resource efficiency through integrated decision making.","Elseiver","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"The impact of ancillary services in optimal DER investment decisions","Cardoso, Goncalo; Stadler, Michael; Mashayekh, Salman; Hartvigsson, Elias","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Microgrid resource sizing problems typically include the analysis of a combination of value streams such as peak shaving, load shifting, or load scheduling, which support the economic feasibility of the microgrid deployment. However, microgrid benefits can go beyond these, and the ability to provide ancillary grid services such as frequency regulation or spinning and non-spinning reserves is well known, despite typically not being considered in resource sizing problems. This paper proposes the expansion of the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM), a state-of-the-art microgrid resource sizing model, to include revenue streams resulting from the participation in ancillary service markets. Results suggest that participation in such markets may not only influence the optimum resource sizing, but also the operational dispatch, with results being strongly influenced by the exact market requirements and clearing prices.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The data employed were collected by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and consist of a cross-section of seven utilities observed over 13 years. A series of tests are performed that resulted in estimating a demand equation using the one-way cross-section random effects model. As expected, we find that demand is highly price inelastic. More interestingly though, is that elasticity with respect to number of customers is 0.52 leading to the conclusion that new subscribers tend to purchase less green power on average than the existing customers. Another compelling finding is that obtaining accreditation will have a 28.5% positive impact on consumption. Knowing that gaining green accreditation is important to the success of programs, utilities may want to seek certification and highlight it in their advertising campaigns.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that V is in a 3+ charge state implying that Ti also needs to adopt a 3+ charge state in order for the corundum structure to form. However, the Ti-2p XPS, while clearly broadened to the lower binding energy side compared to TiO<sub>2</sub>, also exhibits a pronounced Ti<sup>4+</sup> component.

To be practical, the benefit of the technology must be greater than its cost. Here, this report provides simple methods for quantifying the maxima of some benefits that albedo increases may provide. The method used is an extension of an earlier paper that estimated the maximum possible electrical energy saving achievable in an entire city in a year by a change of albedo of its surfaces. The present report estimates the maximum amounts and monetary savings of avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and the decreases in peak power demands. As examples, for several warm cities in California, a 0.2 increase in albedo of pavements is found to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by < 1 kg per m<sup>2</sup> per year. At the current price of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in California, the monetary saving is < US$ 0.01 per year per m<sup>2</sup> modified. The resulting maximum peak-power reductions are estimated to be < 7% of the base power of the city. In conclusion, the magnitudes of the savings are such that decision-makers should choose carefully which urban heat island mitigation techniques are cost effective.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The attractive concept of simplicity in environmental impact assessment: Perceptions of outcomes in southeastern Brazil","Fonseca, Alberto; Rodrigues, Sander Elias","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; BRAZIL; DEVELOPERS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; IMPLEMENTATION; LEGAL ASPECTS; LICENSE APPLICATIONS; MATHEMATICAL SOLUTIONS","Pressures are mounting for the simplification of environmental impact assessment (EIA). This phenomenon is drawing increasing scholarly attention, but studies have not gone far beyond speculating what could happen as a result of recently implemented or proposed regulatory changes. This paper takes a more longitudinal look at simplified EIAs. The main objective was to analyze the perceived outcomes of a number of simplified EIA processes, using Brazil as the empirical context. More specifically, this paper aimed at understanding: 1) how simplified EIAs have been conceptualized and implemented in southeastern Brazil; and 2) how developers and civil servants in that region perceive the outcomes of simplified EIAs. This study adopted a sequential mixed method research approach. Data was collected through literature reviews, 261 telephone-based interviews and 10 face-to-face interviews. Degrees of EIA simplification can vary significantly within and across jurisdictions. In any case, simplification is often framed as a win-win solution to EIA ineffectiveness, through which regulatory and procedural changes are made to ease the process, while, at the same time, maintaining or providing better environmental protection. This approach is more frequently applied to potentially low-impact processes. Chi-square tests of the data collected through telephone interviews in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais indicated that developers tend to perceive EIA processes as difficult and slow regardless of how simplified it is. Most civil servants, who were directly involved in the implementation of simplified EIAs in state environmental agencies, argued that simplified EIAs are driven mostly by environmental agencies, as these institutions have long been unable to cope with an ever-increasing load of license applications. Policy outcomes of simplified EIAs in the territory are not sufficiently monitored by state agencies. Civil servants revealed concerns about the potential long term effects of EIA simplification on the ground, as they have had limited resources for audits and inspections. - Highlights: •Simplified EIA is conceptualized. •We analyze how simplified EIA is implemented and perceived in Brazil. •Developers perceived EIA as difficult and slow regardless of how simplified it was. •State agencies' low institutional capacity is a key driver of simplification. •Policy outcomes of simplified EIAs in the territory are not monitored.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.09.001","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 101-108","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(17)30203-2; TRN: US17R4134051425","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.09.001","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701688","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","67"
"Healthcare Building Sustainability Assessment tool - Sustainable Effective Design criteria in the Portuguese context","Castro, Maria de Fátima, E-mail: info@mfcastro.com; Mateus, Ricardo; Bragança, Luís","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; DECISION MAKING; DESIGN; ENERGY POLICY; INDICATORS; LIFE CYCLE; PROPOSALS; SUSTAINABILITY; TOOLS; URBAN AREAS","Tools and methods to improve current practices and quality in the healthcare building sector are necessary to support decision-making at different building life cycle phases. Furthermore, Healthcare Building Sustainability Assessment (HBSA) Methods are based on criteria organised into different levels, such as categories and indicators. These criteria highlight aspects of significant importance when designing and operating a sustainable healthcare building. To bring more objectivity to the sustainability assessments, the standardisation bodies (CEN and ISO) proposed core indicators that should be used in the evaluation of the environmental, societal and economic performances of buildings. Nevertheless, relying on state of the art analysis, it is possible to conclude that there are aspects of major importance for the operation of healthcare buildings that are not considered in the HBSA methods. Thus, the aim of this paper is to discuss the context of sustainability assessment methods in the field of healthcare buildings and to present a proposal for the incorporation of Sustainable-Effective Design (SED) criteria in a new HBSA method. The used research method is innovative since in the development of the list of sustainability criteria it considers the opinion of main healthcare buildings' stakeholders, the existing healthcare assessment methods and the ISO and CEN standardisation works in the field of the methods to assess the sustainability of construction works. As a result, the proposed method is composed of fifty-two sustainability indicators that cover the different dimensions of the sustainability concept to support decision making during the design of a new or retrofitted healthcare building in urban areas. - Highlights: •A new system to assess the sustainability of healthcare buildings is presented. •We propose a method to develop the list of sustainability indicators for hospitals. •We propose a new concept – Sustainable-Effective Design (SED). •The system is adapted to the Portuguese building sector sustainability contexts. •The approach can be used to develop similar systems in other countries.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.08.005","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 49-60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30313-4; TRN: US17R4130051422","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.08.005","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701685","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701685","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","67"

Smart buildings for energy management are one means of decarbonisation, by reducing energy consumption and related emissions. This study investigated the environmental impacts of smart house automation using life cycle impact assessment. The ReCiPe method was selected for use, in combination with dynamic emissions factors for electricity in Finland. The results indicated that a high level of technology deployment may be counter-effective, due to high electricity consumption by the sensor network, automation system and computing devices. The results also indicated that number of inhabitants per household directly affected the environmental impacts of home automation. A single-person household saw its environmental impacts increase by 15%, while those of a five-person household increased by 3% in the worst-case scenario. The manufacturing phase contributed the major share of environmental impacts, exceeding the use phase in multiple categories. These findings indicate that finding the sweet spot in which technology can promote decarbonisation will be crucial to achieving the goal of a low‑carbon economy. - Highlights: •HEMS did not reduce the overall environmental impact of households. •Environmental impacts of HEMS are greater for single inhabitant households. •Energy efficiency of sensing devices must drastically increase to promote decarbonisation. •The highest life cycle environmental impacts of electronics are during the manufacturing phase. •Raising awareness is a critical part in decreasing the environmental impact of households.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.08.009","","","","United States","2017-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 67; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 109-116","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30404-8; TRN: US17R4135051426","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.08.009","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701689","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701689","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","67"
"Smart building management vs. intuitive human control—Lessons learnt from an office building in Hungary","Belafi, Zsofia; Hong, Tianzhen; Reith, Andras","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; occupant behaviour; case study; building operation; optimization; building performance simulation","We report that smart building management and control are adopted nowadays to achieve zero-net energy use in buildings. However, without considering the human dimension, technologies alone do not necessarily guarantee high performance in buildings. An office building was designed and built according to state-of-the-art design and energy management principles in 2008. Despite the expectations of high performance, the owner was facing high utility bills and low user comfort in the building located in Budapest, Hungary. The objective of the project was to evaluate the energy performance and comfort indices of the building, to identify the causes of malfunction and to elaborate a comprehensive energy concept. Firstly, current building conditions and operation parameters were evaluated. Our investigation found that the state-of-the-art building management system was in good conditions but it was operated by building operators and occupants who are not aware of the building management practice. The energy consumption patterns of the building were simulated with energy modelling software. The baseline model was calibrated to annual measured energy consumption, using actual occupant behaviour and presence, based on results of self-reported surveys, occupancy sensors and fan-coil usage data. Realistic occupant behaviour models can capture diversity of occupant behaviour and better represent the real energy use of the building. This way our findings and the effect of our proposed improvements could be more reliable. As part of our final comprehensive energy concept, we proposed intervention measures that would increase indoor thermal comfort and decrease energy consumption of the building. A parametric study was carried out to evaluate and quantify energy, comfort and return on investment of each measure. It was found that in the best case the building could save 23% of annual energy use. Lastly, future work includes the follow-up of: occupant reactions to intervention measures, the realized energy savings, the measurement of occupant satisfaction and behavioural changes.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Recent studies suggest that the presence of structural defects (e.g. vacancies and interstitials) in metal oxides may enhance the material's electrochemical charge storage capacity. A new approach to introduce defects in electrode materials is to use ion irradiation as it can produce a supersaturation of point defects in the target material. In this work we report the effect of low-energy proton irradiation on amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube electrodes at both room temperature and high temperature (250 °C). Upon room temperature irradiation the nanotubes demonstrate an irradiation-induced phase transformation to a mixture of amorphous, anatase, and rutile domains while showing a 35% reduction in capacity compared to anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, the high temperature proton irradiation induced a disordered rutile phase within the nanotubes as characterized by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which displays an improved capacity by 20% at ~240 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> as well as improved rate capability compared to an unirradiated anatase sample. Voltammetric sweep data were used to determine the contributions from diffusion-limited intercalation and capacitive processes and it was found that the electrodes after irradiation had more contributions from diffusion in lithium charge storage. Finally, our work suggests that tailoring the defect generation through ion irradiation within metal oxide electrodes could present a new avenue for designing advanced electrode materials.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Our multicriteria assessment of wind and solar potential for large regions of Africa shows how economically competitive and low-environmental– impact renewable resources can significantly contribute to meeting this demand. We created the Multicriteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) framework to map and characterize solar and wind energy zones in 21 countries in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) and the Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) and find that potential is several times greater than demand in many countries. Significant fractions of demand can be quickly served with “no-regrets” options—or zones that are low-cost, low-environmental impact, and highly accessible. Because no-regrets options are spatially heterogeneous, international interconnections are necessary to help achieve low-carbon development for the region as a whole, and interconnections that support the best renewable options may differ from those planned for hydropower expansion. Additionally, interconnections and selecting wind sites to match demand reduce the need for SAPP-wide conventional generation capacity by 9.5% in a high-wind scenario, resulting in a 6–20% cost savings, depending on the avoided conventional technology. Strategic selection of low-impact and accessible zones is more cost effective with interconnections compared with solutions without interconnections. In conclusion, the overall results are robust to multiple load growth scenarios. Together, results show that multicriteria site selection and deliberate planning of interconnections may significantly increase the economic and environmental competitiveness of renewable alternatives relative to conventional generation.","National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC (United States)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Reducing Cascading Failure Risk by Increasing Infrastructure Network Interdependence","Korkali, Mert; Veneman, Jason G.; Tivnan, Brian F.; Bagrow, James P.; Hines, Paul D. H.","42 ENGINEERING; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Complex networks; Computational science; Energy grids and networks","Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power and communication systems, has important implications for the reliability and security of these systems. To understand the effects of power-communication coupling, several researchers have studied models of interdependent networks and reported that increased coupling can increase vulnerability. However, these conclusions come largely from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading failure, relative to those found in actual power and communication networks, and that do not capture the benefits of connecting systems with complementary capabilities. In order to understand the importance of these details, this paper compares network vulnerability in simple topological models and in models that more accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we compare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in power systems and find that the power grid model shows a higher level of vulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a percolation model of topological cascading in coupled networks to three different models of power networks coupled to communication systems. Again, the more accurate models suggest very different conclusions than the percolation model. In all but the most extreme case, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased power-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from what one would conclude from the percolation model, in which zero coupling is optimal. Only in an extreme case, in which communication failures immediately cause grid failures, did we find that increased coupling can be harmful. Together, these results suggest design strategies for reducing the risk of cascades in interdependent infrastructure systems.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

We extend and analyze a previously proposed stochastic clearing formulation in which the social surplus function induces penalties between day-ahead and real-time quantities. We prove that the formulation yields price bounded price distortions, and we show that adding a similar penalty term to transmission flows and phase angles ensures boundedness throughout the network. We prove that when the price distortions are zero, day-ahead quantities equal a quantile of their real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of price distortions suggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over deterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements. Finally, we propose additional metrics to evaluate these benefits.","Informs","","Argonne National Lab.

Coal remains the predominant fuel source and limited success has to date been achieved in the renewable energy sector. The electricity generation sector is therefore hindered from moving towards an electricity generation landscape where alternative fuel sources is utilised. This research is aimed at gaining insight into the enablers that led towards an increasing trend (observed globally) in exploiting waste as a fuel for electricity generation, and to outline the presence of obstacles that hinder separation of waste for electricity use in the South African context. Furthermore it is an attempt at informing what appropriate interventions (operational and policy) may be considered suitable for South Africa to overcome these barriers in order to enable a sustainable South African waste to electricity (WTE) Industry. Findings show that numerous barriers to a WTE exists in the South African context, however overcoming these barriers is not as simple as adopting the European model with the aim to modify the electricity generation mix and waste management landscape. Selected enablers deemed appropriate in the South African context are adapted from the European model, and are greatly influenced by the prevailing socio-economic status of South Africa. Primary enablers identified were, (i) government support is needed especially in the form of subsidisation for green energy, (ii) increase landfill costs through the implementation of a landfill tax, (iii) streamline the process for Independent Private Power Producers (IPPPs) to connect to the national grid with off-take guaranteed and the inclusion of WTE into an electricity roadmap (effectively government’s strategy). The proposed enabling interventions would help in overcoming the barriers for a South African WTE industry.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.051","","","","United States","2017-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 68; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 774-785","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(17)30492-0; TRN: US17R4426093105","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2017.06.051","","2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","22742161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22742161","","Waste Management","","68"

Central supply systems can be very efficient due to diverse energy demand profiles which may lead to reduced installed equipment capacity. Load diversity in buildings has been investigated in former studies, especially for the electricity demand. However, little is known about the influence of single building characteristics (such as building envelope or hot water demand) on the overall heating peak load of a residential district. For measuring the diversity, the peak load ratio (PLR) index is used to represent the percentage reduction of peak load of a district system from a simple sum of individual peak loads of buildings. A total of 144 residential building load profiles have been created with the dynamic building simulation software IDA ICE for a theoretical analysis in which the PLR reaches 15%. Within this study, certain district features are identified which lead to higher diversity. Furthermore, these results are used in a district heating simulation model which confronts the possible advantage of reduced installed capacity with the practical disadvantage of heat distribution losses. Likewise, the influence of load density and the districts building structure can be analyzed. This study shows that especially in districts with high load density, which consist of newly constructed buildings with low supply temperature and high influence of the hot water demand, the advantages of load diversity can be exploited.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Our objective is to minimize the total operation cost, including generation cost and spinning reserve cost of local resources as well as purchasing cost of energy from the main grid. In order to ensure the resiliency of a microgrid and improve the reliability of the local electricity supply, the microgrid is required to maintain enough spinning reserve (both up and down) to meet local demand and accommodate local renewable generation when the supply of power from the main grid is interrupted suddenly, i.e., microgrid transitions from grid-connected into islanded mode. Prevailing operational uncertainties in renewable energy resources and load are considered and captured using a robust optimization method. With proper robust level, the solution of the proposed scheduling model ensures successful islanding of the microgrid with minimum load curtailment and guarantees robustness against all possible realizations of the modeled operational uncertainties. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a PV panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator and a battery demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling model.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"An In-depth Review On the Scientific and Policy Issues Associated with Additive Manufacturing","Love, Lonnie J.; Nycz, Andrzej; Adediran, Adeola I.","42 ENGINEERING; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Additive Manufacturing, 3D printing, 3D Printing Cost, Error Risk, Part Failure, Manufacturing Regulation, Direct Metal Laser Sintering, Manufacturing Optimization","Historically, manufacturing processes have been predominantly subtractive, i.e. three-dimensional objects were created by successively cutting material away from a solid block, by scraping, machining, turning or dissolving. Additive manufacturing (AM) or three-dimensional (3D) printing, in contrast, is controlled material addition, implemented by successively depositing layers of material until a predesigned shape is formed. AM represents an innovative manufacturing technology, and is set to transform production processes from design to manufacture, and to eventual distribution to end users, ultimately leading to an increase in energy efficiency and a reduction in gas emissions for future generation of industries. The unique capability of this technology to produce intricate geometries with customizable material properties has made it a widely interesting and welcome development among scientists, industry and the general public. Its wide acceptance has continued to make 3D printing technology more openly accessible, and low-cost desktop printing, with the capability to reproduce 3D objects from medical prostheses to weapons, is rapidly increasing in availability to the public. However, most research and media attention has been focused on the ingenuity of this ground-breaking technology and its wide range of possibilities. Very little consideration is being given to the adverse effects of the seemingly unstoppable advancement of AM technology and unrestricted access to 3D printing techniques. Also, proponents of AM technology rarely take into account the overall life-cycle cost and risks of failure of the manufactured part. Despite the promising prospects of this novel development, there are still concerns about how printed products will perform over time, the consistency of their quality, and the types and safety of materials used with this technology, especially with very large scale additive-manufactured products. This paper brings to light some scientific and policy risks and challenges concerning the material science and engineering aspects of these issues. Matters discussed include life-cycle cost analysis, end-product safety and quality assurance/control, regulation gaps, digital piracy, and resulting loopholes in safety and national security. The paper also presents potential options for curbing these risks, and otherwise adapting to the eventualities which, with certain inevitable factors in play, may lie beyond control.","JSPG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We examine spatial and temporal variations in generation mix across the region and year using the PLEXOS unit commitment and dispatch model with a production cost model database adapted from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Emissions estimates are computed by combining the dispatch model results with unit-specific, emissions-load relationships. Wind energy displaces natural gas and coal in scenarios with relatively expensive natural gas or with GHG fees. Correspondingly, annual emissions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 are reduced by 20-40% in these cases. NOx emissions, which are a concern as a precursor of ground-level ozone, are relatively high and consistent across scenarios during summer, when peak electricity loads occur and wind resources in the region are comparatively weak. Accounting for the difference in start-up versus stabilized NOx emissions rates for natural gas plants had little impact on region-wide emissions estimates due to the dominant contribution from coal-fired plants, but would be more important in the vicinity of the natural gas units.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

What are the characteristics of the systems with low-prices? Using detailed characteristics of 42,611 small-scale (<15 kW) PV systems installed in 15 U.S. states during 2013, we identify the most important factors that make a system likely to be low-priced (LP). Comparing LP and non-LP systems, we find statistically significant differences in nearly all characteristics for which we have data. Logit and probit model results robustly indicate that LP systems are associated with: markets with few active installers; experienced installers; customer ownership; large systems; retrofits; and thin-film, low-efficiency, and Chinese modules. We also find significant differences across states, with LP systems much more likely to occur in some states, such as Arizona, New Jersey, and New Mexico, and less likely in others, such as California. Our focus on the left tail of the price distribution provides implications for policy that are distinct from recent studies of mean prices. While those studies find that PV subsidies increase mean prices, we find that subsidies also generate LP systems. PV subsidies appear to simultaneously shift and broaden the price distribution. Much of this broadening occurs in a particular location, northern California.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, a new hollandite K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> with large (2 × 2) tunnels is synthesized by a facile carbothermal reduction method, and its sodium storage performance is investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses illustrate the formation mechanism of the hollandite K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> upon the carbothermal reduction process. Compared to the traditional layered or small (1 × 1) tunnel-type Ti-based materials, the hollandite K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> with large (2 × 2) tunnels may accommodate more sodium ions and facilitate the Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion in the structure; thus, it is expected to get a large capacity and realize high rate capability. The synthesized K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> with large (2 × 2) tunnels shows a stable reversible capacity of 131 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> (nearly 3 times of (1 × 1) tunnel-structured Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>6</sub>O<sub>13</sub>) and superior cycling stability with no obvious capacity decay even after 1000 cycles, which is significantly better than the traditional layered Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (only 40% of capacity retention in 20 cycles). Moreover, the carbothermal process can naturally introduce oxygen vacancy and low-valent titanium as well as the surface carbon coating layer to the structure, which would greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> and thus endow this material high rate capability. With a good rate capability and long cyclability, this hollandite K<sub><i>x</i></sub>TiO<sub>2</sub> can serve as a new promising anode material for room-temperature long-life sodium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems, and the carbothermal reduction method is believed to be an effective and facile way to develop novel Ti-based anodes with simultaneous carbon coating and Ti(III) self-doping.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Consequently, it is very important to quantify and report their Carbon Footprint (CF) for implementing national and international policies/strategies aimed at mitigating and adapting these concerns. The Urban Carbon Footprint (UCF), indeed, has been recognized as the more valuable choice to inform, specifically, decision makers about city environmental sustainability. Several accounting systems and inventory methods have been taken into account to perform UCF, highlighting the complexity of the topic and generating very often confusion among users. In this context, the authors aim to summarize what has been done and what is going on with UCFs, trying to classify them according to some principal dimensions. Thus, they divide UFCs in two main categories namely: “spatial” or “direct”, with a limited amount of data requested, and “economic” or “life cycle based”, more or less data inclusive according to the accounting systems considered. Furthermore, they observe that there is not a “global agreed-upon protocol” yet, neither is there a specific model shared among researchers, even if some steps have been made towards this direction (Relative Carbon Footprint - RCF, Publicly Available Specification – PAS 2070 and Global Protocol for Community scale - GPC). Consequently, it is necessary to complete and standardize, in the short term, the accounting and reporting frameworks, in order to compare different UCFs for adopting shared climate strategies and actions at global level. - Highlights: •Cities present environmental sustainability issues. •GHG emissions - specifically carbon dioxide - directly affect climate change. •UCF is a tool to support policy makers towards city environmental sustainability. •There is not a “global agreed-upon protocol” to perform UFC. •There are still missing points to be considered to provide a sharing model.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.06.005","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 43-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(17)30124-5; TRN: US17R4115051407","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.06.005","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701670","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","66"

Local balance of electricity by transporting coal has resulted in dense concentration of coal-fired power plants in load centers and caused severe environmental problems. Electricity relocation through interregional transmission is another choice for energy transportation to achieve electricity balance across regions and pollution mitigation. Using interregional electricity transmission (IRET) lines in China as a quasi-natural experiment, this paper assesses the environmental impact of electricity relocation. In the assessment, the grid organization of “province as executor” in China is considered because it affects the sphere of IRET's influence on pollution mitigation. Here we show the environmental benefits of electricity relocation. We find that, electricity relocation through interregional transmission leads to the growth rate of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) emission decreasing 7% in landing areas and Sichuan province benefits most from electricity relocation. It is interesting that there is no significant increase of SO{sub 2} emission growth rate in sending areas compared to counterfactuals if there had no IRET due to more integration of clean energy and improved emission efficiency in sending areas. Placebo study and robustness check show that the results are quite convincing. Therefore, IRET provides an appealing choice for China's environmental control in eastern region, and it is not necessarily at the cost of pollution in western region. The methodology can be applied to assess the environmental impacts of other program or policy elsewhere. - Highlights: •Proposing a model to assess the environmental impact of electricity relocation •Interregional electricity transmission in China provides a quasi-natural experiment. •Grid organization of “province as executor” is considered that affects sphere of IRET. •Providing insight about environmental necessity of IRET using China as a case study •The model can be used to assess environmental impacts of other program or policy.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.07.002","","","","United States","2017-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 66; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 151-161","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30226-8; TRN: US17R4124051416","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.07.002","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701679","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701679","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","66"

"Spatial distribution of internal heat gains: A probabilistic representation and evaluation of its influence on cooling equipment sizing in large office buildings","Zhang, Qi; Yan, Da; An, Jingjing; Hong, Tianzhen; Tian, Wei; Sun, Kaiyu","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 42 ENGINEERING","Internal heat gains from occupants, lighting, and plug loads are significant components of the space cooling load in an office building. Internal heat gains vary with time and space. The spatial diversity is significant, even for spaces with the same function in the same building. The stochastic nature of internal heat gains makes determining the peak cooling load to size air-conditioning systems a challenge. The traditional conservative practice of considering the largest internal heat gain among spaces and applying safety factors overestimates the space cooling load, which leads to oversized air-conditioning equipment and chiller plants. In this study, a field investigation of several large office buildings in China led to the development of a new probabilistic approach that represents the spatial diversity of the design internal heat gain of each tenant as a probability distribution function. In a large office building, a central chiller plant serves all air handling units (AHUs), with each AHU serving one or more floors of the building. Therefore, the spatial diversity should be considered differently when the peak cooling loads to size the AHUs and chillers are calculated. Finally, the proposed approach considers two different levels of internal heat gains to calculate the peak cooling loads and size the AHUs and chillers in order to avoid oversizing, improve the overall operating efficiency, and thus reduce energy use.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Microgrid Optimal Scheduling With Chance-Constrained Islanding Capability","Liu, Guodong; Starke, Michael R.; Xiao, B.; Zhang, Xiaohu; Tomsovic, Kevin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Microgrid; optimal scheduling; spinning reserve; islanding capability; chance constraints; mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)","To facilitate the integration of variable renewable generation and improve the resilience of electricity sup-ply in a microgrid, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling strategy for microgrid operation considering constraints of islanding capability. A new concept, probability of successful islanding (PSI), indicating the probability that a microgrid maintains enough spinning reserve (both up and down) to meet local demand and accommodate local renewable generation after instantaneously islanding from the main grid, is developed. The PSI is formulated as mixed-integer linear program using multi-interval approximation taking into account the probability distributions of forecast errors of wind, PV and load. With the goal of minimizing the total operating cost while preserving user specified PSI, a chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated for the optimal scheduling of mirogrids and solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a PV panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator and a battery demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy. Lastly, we verify the relationship between PSI and various factors.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Energy Efficiency and Emissions Intensity Standards","Fell, Harrison; Kaffine, Daniel; Steinberg, Daniel","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; emissions standards; emissions tax; energy efficiency","We investigate the role of energy efficiency in rate-based emissions intensity standards, a particularly policy-relevant consideration given that the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan allows crediting of electricity savings as a means of complying with state-specific emissions standards. We show that with perfectly inelastic energy services demand, crediting efficiency measures can recover the first-best allocation. However, when demand for energy services exhibits some elasticity, crediting energy efficiency can no longer recover first-best. While crediting removes the relative distortion between energy generation and energy efficiency, it distorts the absolute level of energy services. Building on these results, we derive the conditions determining the second-best intensity standard and crediting rule. Simulations calibrated to the electricity sector in Texas find that while some form of crediting is generally welfare-improving, the proposed one-for-one crediting of energy savings is unlikely to achieve efficient outcomes.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Estimating the implied cost of carbon in future scenarios using a CGE model: The Case of Colorado","Hannum, Christopher; Cutler, Harvey; Iverson, Terrence; Keyser, David","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable portfolio standard; computable general equilibrium","We develop a state-level computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that reflects the roles of coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and hydroelectricity in supplying electricity, using Colorado as a case study. Also, we focus on the economic impact of implementing Colorado's existing Renewable Portfolio Standard, updated in 2013. This requires that 25% of state generation come from qualifying renewable sources by 2020. We evaluate the policy under a variety of assumptions regarding wind integration costs and assumptions on the persistence of federal subsidies for wind. Specifically, we estimate the implied price of carbon as the carbon price at which a state-level policy would pass a state-level cost-benefit analysis, taking account of estimated greenhouse gas emission reductions and ancillary benefits from corresponding reductions in criteria pollutants. Our findings suggest that without the Production Tax Credit (federal aid), the state policy of mandating renewable power generation (RPS) is costly to state actors, with an implied cost of carbon of about $17 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub> with a 3% discount rate. Federal aid makes the decision between natural gas and wind nearly cost neutral for Colorado.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) and energy system models have been widely used to evaluate climate policy at a global level, and include a representation of industrial energy use. In this study, the projected industrial energy use and accompanying GHG emissions, as well as the model structure of multiple long-term energy models are compared. The models show varying degrees to which energy consumption is decoupled from GDP growth in the future. In all models, the sector remains mostly (>50%) reliant on fossil energy through 2100 in a reference scenario (i.e., absent emissions mitigation policies), though there is significant divergence in the projected ability to switch to alternative fuels to mitigate GHG emissions. Among the set analyzed here, the more technologically detailed models tend to have less capacity for switching from fossil fuels to electricity. This highlights the importance of understanding of economy-wide mitigation responses and costs as an area for future improvement. Analyzing industry subsector material and energy use details can improve the ability to interpret results, and provide insight in feasibility of how emissions reduction can be achieved.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluating opportunities to improve material and energy impacts in commodity supply chains","Hanes, Rebecca J.; Carpenter, Alberta","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; supply chain modeling; manufacturing; energy efficiency; materials","When evaluated at the scale of individual processes, next-generation technologies may be more energy and emissions intensive than current technology. Furthermore, many advanced technologies have the potential to reduce material and energy consumption in upstream or downstream processing stages. In order to fully understand the benefits and consequences of technology deployment, next-generation technologies should be evaluated in context, as part of a supply chain. This work presents the Materials Flow through Industry (MFI) supply chain modeling tool. The MFI tool is a cradle-to-gate linear network model of the US industrial sector that can model a wide range of manufacturing scenarios, including changes in production technology and increases in industrial energy efficiency. The MFI tool was developed to perform supply chain scale analyses in order to quantify the impacts and benefits of next-generation technologies and materials at that scale. For the analysis presented in this paper, the MFI tool is utilized to explore a case study comparing three lightweight vehicle supply chains to the supply chain of a conventional, standard weight vehicle. Several of the lightweight vehicle supply chains are evaluated under manufacturing scenarios that include next-generation production technologies and next-generation materials. Results indicate that producing lightweight vehicles is more energy and emission intensive than producing the non-lightweight vehicle, but the fuel saved during vehicle use offsets this increase. In this case study, greater reductions in supply chain energy and emissions were achieved through the application of the next-generation technologies than from application of energy efficiency increases.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have carefully analysed this paper, and found methodological inconsistencies and calculation errors that, in combination, render its conclusions not scientifically sound. Ferroni and Hopkirk adopt 'extended' boundaries for their analysis of PV without acknowledging that such choice of boundaries makes their results incompatible with those for all other technologies that have been analysed using more conventional boundaries, including nuclear energy with which the authors engage in multiple inconsistent comparisons. In addition, they use out-dated information, make invalid assumptions on PV specifications and other key parameters, and conduct calculation errors, including double counting.

Effective planning and management of limited WEF resources to meet current and future socioeconomic demands for sustainable development is challenging. WEF production/delivery may also produce environmental impacts; as a result, green-house-gas emission control will impact WEF nexus management as well. Nexus management for WEF security necessitates integrated tools for predictive analysis that are capable of identifying the tradeoffs among various sectors, generating cost-effective planning and management strategies and policies. To address these needs, we have developed an integrated model analysis framework and tool called WEFO. WEFO provides a multi-period socioeconomic model for predicting how to satisfy WEF demands based on model inputs representing productions costs, socioeconomic demands, and environmental controls. WEFO is applied to quantitatively analyze the interrelationships and trade-offs among system components including energy supply, electricity generation, water supply-demand, food production as well as mitigation of environmental impacts. WEFO is demonstrated to solve a hypothetical nexus management problem consistent with real-world management scenarios. Model parameters are analyzed using global sensitivity analysis and their effects on total system cost are quantified. Lastly, the obtained results demonstrate how these types of analyses can be helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders to make cost-effective decisions for optimal WEF management.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Interconnection-wide hour-ahead scheduling in the presence of intermittent renewables and demand response: A surplus maximizing approach","Behboodi, Sahand; Chassin, David P.; Djilali, Ned; Crawford, Curran","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; demand response; energy market; renewable intermittency; resource allocation; western interconnection","This study describes a new approach for solving the multi-area electricity resource allocation problem when considering both intermittent renewables and demand response. The method determines the hourly inter-area export/import set that maximizes the interconnection (global) surplus satisfying transmission, generation and load constraints. The optimal inter-area transfer set effectively makes the electricity price uniform over the interconnection apart from constrained areas, which overall increases the consumer surplus more than it decreases the producer surplus. The method is computationally efficient and suitable for use in simulations that depend on optimal scheduling models. The method is demonstrated on a system that represents North America Western Interconnection for the planning year of 2024. Simulation results indicate that effective use of interties reduces the system operation cost substantially. Excluding demand response, both the unconstrained and the constrained scheduling solutions decrease the global production cost (and equivalently increase the global economic surplus) by 12.30B and 10.67B per year, respectively, when compared to the standalone case in which each control area relies only on its local supply resources. This cost saving is equal to 25% and 22% of the annual production cost. Including 5% demand response, the constrained solution decreases the annual production cost by 10.70B, while increases the annual surplus by 9.32B in comparison to the standalone case.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 336-351","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261916318165; TRN: US1701100","10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.12.052","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1347441","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1347441","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1347441","Applied Energy","C","189"

"A simulation approach to estimate energy savings potential of occupant behavior measures","Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","Occupant behavior in buildings is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. Low-cost behavioral solutions have demonstrated significant potential energy savings. Estimating the behavioral savings potential is important for a more effective design of behavior change interventions, which in turn will support more effective energy-efficiency policies. This study introduces a simulation approach to estimate the energy savings potential of occupant behavior measures. First it defines five typical occupant behavior measures in office buildings, then simulates and analyzes their individual and integrated impact on energy use in buildings. The energy performance of the five behavior measures was evaluated using EnergyPlus simulation for a real office building across four typical U.S. climates and two vintages. The Occupancy Simulator was used to simulate the occupant movement in each zone with inputs from the site survey of the case building. Based on the simulation results, the occupant behavior measures can achieve overall site energy savings as high as 22.9% for individual measures and up to 41.0% for integrated measures. Although energy savings of behavior measures would vary depending upon many factors, the presented simulation approach is robust and can be adopted for other studies aiming to quantify occupant behavior impact on building performance.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We present a case study to show how this methodology is applied to a multi-use/ multi-function telecommunications facility in southern California. In the case study, we first identify photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) technologies that minimize the lifecycle cost of energy at the site under normal, grid-connected operation. We then evaluate how those technologies could be incorporated alongside existing diesel generators in a microgrid to increase resiliency at the site, where resiliency is quantified in terms of the amount of time that the microgrid can sustain the critical load during a grid outage. We find that adding PV and BESS to the existing backup diesel generators with a fixed fuel supply extends the amount of time the site could survive an outage by 1.8 days, from 1.7 days for the existing diesel-only backup system to 3.5 days for the PV/diesel/BESS hybrid system. Furthermore, even after diesel fuel supplies are exhausted, the site can continue to operate critical loads during daytime hours using just the PV/BESS when there is sufficient solar resource. We find that the site can save approximately 100,000 dollars in energy costs over the 25-year lifecycle while doubling the amount of time they can survive an outage. Here, the methodology presented here provides a template for increasing resiliency at telecomm sites by implementing renewable energy solutions, which provide additional benefits of carbon emission reduction and energy cost savings.","Emerald Publishing Ltd.","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Reducing this energy consumption will be critical for countries to achieve their national greenhouse gas reduction commitments. Several national policies already support ISO 50001; however, there is no transparent, consistent process to estimate the potential impacts of its implementation. This paper presents the ISO 50001 Impacts Methodology, an internationally-developed methodology to calculate these impacts at a national, regional, or global scale suitable for use by policymakers. The recently-formed ISO 50001 Global Impacts Research Network provides a forum for policymakers to refine and encourage use of the methodology. Using this methodology, a scenario with 50% of projected global industrial and service sector energy consumption under ISO 50001 management by 2030 would generate cumulative primary energy savings of approximately 105 EJ, cost savings of nearly US $700 billion (discounted to 2016 net present value), and 6500 million metric tons (Mt) of avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The avoided annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2030 alone are equivalent to removing 210 million passenger vehicles from the road.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Forecasting residential solar photovoltaic deployment in California","Dong, Changgui; Sigrin, Benjamin; Brinkman, Gregory","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; solar PV; forecasting; diffusion models; policy impact; policies; California","Residential distributed photovoltaic (PV) deployment in the United States has experienced robust growth, and policy changes impacting the value of solar are likely to occur at the federal and state levels. To establish a credible baseline and evaluate impacts of potential new policies, this analysis employs multiple methods to forecast residential PV deployment in California, including a time-series forecasting model, a threshold heterogeneity diffusion model, a Bass diffusion model, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory's dSolar model. As a baseline, the residential PV market in California is modeled to peak in the early 2020s, with a peak annual installation of 1.5-2 GW across models. We then use the baseline results from the dSolar model and the threshold model to gauge the impact of the recent federal investment tax credit (ITC) extension, the newly approved California net energy metering (NEM) policy, and a hypothetical value-of-solar (VOS) compensation scheme. We find that the recent ITC extension may increase annual PV installations by 12%-18% (roughly 500 MW, MW) for the California residential sector in 2019-2020. The new NEM policy only has a negligible effect in California due to the relatively small new charges (< 100 MW in 2019-2020). Moreover, impacts of the VOS compensation scheme (0.12 cents per kilowatt-hour) are larger, reducing annual PV adoption by 32% (or 900-1300 MW) in 2019-2020.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Biomass supply chain design and operational planning models are often formulated and studied using deterministic mathematical models. While these models are beneficial for making decisions, their applicability to real world problems may be limited because they do not capture all the complexities in the supply chain, including uncertainties in the parameters. This study develops a statistically robust quantile-based approach for stochastic optimization under uncertainty, which builds upon scenario analysis. We apply and evaluate the performance of our approach to address the problem of analyzing competing biomass supply chains subject to stochastic demand and supply. Finally, the proposed approach was found to outperform alternative methods in terms of computational efficiency and ability to meet the stochastic problem requirements.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One of the most widespread legal instruments to prevent negative impacts on the environment is Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Almost all countries have an EIA system in place aimed at mitigating the diverse impacts causing by development projects. A common drawback of such systems is that they are often ineffective and time-consuming, and are therefore frequently viewed by politicians as “in the way” of development. This is the case in Brazil, where EIA has had a very limited influence on decision-making and where environment reforms (e.g. the new Forest Code) have often been strongly influenced by powerful lobbies (e.g. agribusiness groups, industry actors, etc.) and conservative legislators. Continuing this trend, the most recent political developments have seen the proposal of a series of amendments aimed at “streamlining” the Brazilian EIA system. In this viewpoint, we provide an in depth analysis of the proposed changes, highlighting the serious consequences that would accompany the weakening of environmental licensing and EIA legislation in Brazil.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.04.010","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 86-90","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30358-4; TRN: US17R4100051392","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.04.010","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701655","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","65"

Conventional risk assessment (RA) is limited in scope, i.e. it usually does not cover the entire life cycle of a substance, nor does it take into account sustainability aspects such as the amount of raw materials and energy required to produce the substance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can provide this pivotal information to support an informed decision on the sustainability of a new substance. Unfortunately, LCA has had little regulatory application up to now. We believe that increasing the focus on combined use of LCA and life cycle-based RA could lead to improved regulatory long-term decisions for marketed chemicals. Inclusion of human biomonitoring could increase the robustness of such decisions even further. In addition, the combined use of the three methods allows a robust search for sustainable alternatives of currently marketed chemicals that have an unfavourable risk profile. - Highlights: •We recommend a framework of three approaches for a chemical safety assessment. •LCA evaluates the sustainability of chemicals in comparison to alternatives. •Human biomonitoring allows the assessment of total exposure to critical chemicals. •A case study on nanomaterials demonstrates the value of the combined approach.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.05.004","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 156-163","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30402-4; TRN: US17R4108051400","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.05.004","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701663","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","65"

Several other issues also emerged from our study that have received limited attention, including the non-commitment to early and ongoing participation by smaller project proponents, and the EA exemption of exploration projects; the limited availability of information to project developers on local right holders and Aboriginal interests; expectations about the integration of traditional knowledge and land use in EA not aligning with the information that is available to proponents; confusion about who is responsible for initiating early participation and consultation processes; the lack of early relationship building with potentially affected communities, particularly by governments; and the lack of other viable avenues, outside EA, for Aboriginal communities to raise more strategic issues of concern that affect traditional lands and treaty rights.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.04.008","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 164-174","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)30053-6; TRN: US17R4109051401","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.04.008","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701664","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701664","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","65"

Although HIA has gained importance over the past two decades, it is unclear whether and to what extent HIA practice has been established and institutionalised in Latin America. To address this issue, the current practice and prospects of HIA in Latin America was assessed in the peer-reviewed literature and existing guidelines. Methodology: The peer-reviewed literature was systematically searched using five electronic databases until February 2016. Studies were included on a set of pre-defined criteria. The search was carried out in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. Additionally, a search for HIA guidelines used in Latin American countries and territories was performed by means of a Google search and on websites of government departments and institutions that may promote HIA. Results: The search yielded 167 hits in the peer-reviewed literature of which 17 articles met inclusion criteria. Only four peer-reviewed articles described prospective HIAs and four featured a discussion of the HIA approach. The remaining nine articles presented health impact evaluations. Most studies were published only recently, after 2012 (88%). Seven HIA guideline documents were identified, two of which were country-specific (i.e. Brazil and Mexico) and the remaining five addressed HIA at the regional level. Conclusions: This study confirmed the paucity of literature pertaining to HIA implementation, as well as HIA guidelines in Latin America. Mexico, Brazil and Cuba have the longest track record in scientific literature and guidelines on HIA. In order to better understand current barriers and limitations to practice and institutionalisation of HIA in Latin American countries, a broad discussion among policy makers, academic institutions and HIA practitioners is warranted nationally and regionally. - Highlights: •We conducted a systematic review pertaining to HIA and a search for guidelines on HIA in use in Latin America. •We identified 17 peer-reviewed articles, four of which were prospective HIAs. •Seven HIA guideline documents were identified, with two country-specific pieces. •There is a paucity of HIA articles in the peer-reviewed literature and guidelines in Latin America, but the situation is improving.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.09.005","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 175-185","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30233-5; TRN: US17R4110051402","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.09.005","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701665","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701665","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","65"

Their usefulness, however, depends on how they are implemented and on whether findings are used in public decision-making. Given the notorious vulnerability of public-private interactions to corrupt practices, we examine potential and actual corruption risks across four stages of a generic EIA process. Combined with case analysis of the EIA process in Albania, a Southeastern European context experiencing serious governance challenges, we reflect on the vulnerabilities of EIAs to various forms of corruption from a principal-agent perspective. We concur with earlier research suggesting that the fundamentally rationalist approach behind EIAs do not necessarily match the empirical realities of public environmental decision-making, particularly in less mature EIA systems. We conclude with suggestions for framing a future research agenda in this area and touch on tentative policy remedies.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.05.002","","","","United States","2017-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 65; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 118-124","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30327-4; TRN: US17R4104051396","10.1016/J.EIAR.2017.05.002","","2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","22701659","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22701659","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","65"

Two alternative biomass availability scenarios in 2030, defined as the (i) Business-as-usual (598 million dry tons) and (ii) Billion Ton (1042 million dry tons), establish a range of possible outcomes for the future bioeconomy. The biomass utilized in the current (2014) (365 million dry tons) economy is estimated to displace approximately 2.4% of fossil energy consumption and avoid 116 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions, whereas the Billion Ton bioeconomy of 2030 could displace 9.5% of fossil energy consumption and avoid as much as 446 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions annually. Developing the integrated systems, supply chains, and infrastructure to efficiently grow, harvest, transport, and convert large quantities of biomass in a sustainable way could support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Bio-based activities in the current (2014) economy are estimated to have directly generated more than 48 billion in revenue and 285 000 jobs. Our estimates show that developing biomass resources and addressing current limitations to achieve a Billion Ton bioeconomy could expand direct bioeconomy revenue by a factor of 5 to contribute nearly 259 billion and 1.1 million jobs to the US economy by 2030.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Capturing the value these PV systems add to home sales is therefore important. Our study enhances the PV-home-valuation literature by analyzing 22,822 home sales, of which 3951 have PV, and which span eight states during 2002–2013. We also, for the first time, compare premiums with contributory value estimates derived from the present value of saved energy costs (income approach) and, separately, the replacement cost of systems at the time of sale (cost approach) to examine market signals. We find home buyers are consistently willing to pay PV home premiums across various states, housing and PV markets, and home types; average premiums equate to approximately $4/W or $15,000 for an average-sized 3.6-kW PV system. We find that a replacement cost net of state and federal incentives is a better proxy for premiums than gross installed costs, and that the income approach is a good signal if it accounts for tiered volumetric retail rates. Finally, other results include detailed premium analyses for PV home sub-populations.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The worldwide capacity encompassed 135 GW in 2013 and is estimated to increase to 1721 GW in 2030 and 4674 GW in 2050, according to a prospective high-renewable scenario. To achieve this production level while minimizing environmental impacts, decision makers must have access to environmental performance data that reflect their high spatial variability accurately. We propose ENVI-PV (http://viewer.webservice-energy.org/project_iea), a new interactive tool that provides maps and screening level data, based on weighted average supply chains, for the environmental performance of common PV technologies. Environmental impacts of PV systems are evaluated according to a life cycle assessment approach. ENVI-PV was developed using a state-of-the-art interoperable and open standard Web Service framework from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It combines the latest life cycle inventories, published in 2015 by the International Energy Agency (IEA) under the Photovoltaic Power Systems Program (PVPS) Task 12, and some inventories previously published from Ecoinvent v2.2 database with solar irradiation estimates computed from the worldwide NASA SSE database. ENVI-PV is the first tool to propose a worldwide coverage of environmental performance of PV systems using a multi-criteria assessment. The user can compare the PV environmental performance to the environmental footprint of country electricity mixes. ENVI-PV is designed as an environmental interactive tool to generate PV technological options and evaluate their performance in different spatial and techno-economic contexts. Its potential applications are illustrated in this paper with several examples.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To study different scenarios for possible evolutions of the energy market that assume a certain renewable penetration and the possible introduction of hybrid nuclear reactors, the HYBRID modeling and simulation project has been initiated by INL. The term hybrid nuclear reactor here refers to nuclear power plants that not only produce electricity, but can also sell heat to an industrial process, like a hydrogen generation or water desalination plant. The RAVEN (Risk Analysis Virtual Environment) code developed at INL together with the modeling language Modelica (the Dymola compiler is used) have been selected as the main modeling tools for the HYBRID modeling and simulation project. This summary outlines the challenge, presents an overview of the developments in the RAVEN code needed to solve it and shows an illustrative example calculation.

This shift in the market conditions, especially in deregulated markets, has already resulted in the closing of coal power plants. Previously these coal plants served to balance variation in load. The resulting loss of electricity production is being made up in part with increased renewable generation. This set of governmental policy changes potentially presents expanded opportunities for both renewable energy and nuclear energy to become significant energy sources in the future. Potential synergies exist that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and provide affordable, sustainable energy. Combining multiple energy production, conversion, storage, and consumption facilities can leverage these potential synergies. This research focuses on integrating nuclear power plants within systems with increased renewable penetration, referred to as a nuclear renewable hybrid energy system (NRHES). Industrial-scale nuclear renewable hybrid energy systems have the potential to provide grid services such as dispatchable generation, storage, ancillary services, and power regulation. The problem of designing, analyzing, and optimizing the NHRES is being undertaken by a multi-laboratory team. The effort requires the collaboration of experts across engineering disciplines with methods and results to be shared by these experts. To facilitate collaborations a common system modeling and analysis language is adopted along with open-source libraries and interface standards that support data exchange among the models. Modelica was selected as the common language based on its prior use by team members at each of Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Argonne National Laboratory.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 6 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 845-848","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3065090654","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050269","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050269","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"Using Dynamic Line Rating to Enhance Flexibility of Wind-involved Hybrid Energy System","Zhang, Wei; Blanc, Katya L.; McJunkin, Timothy R.; Gentle, Jake P.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 17 WIND ENERGY; CARBON; COOLING; EFFICIENCY; ELECTRICITY; ENERGY SYSTEMS; FLEXIBILITY; FOSSIL FUELS; HYBRID SYSTEMS; IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY; NUCLEAR POWER; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; OPERATION; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; WIND; WIND TURBINES","By providing real-time overhead line ampacity, Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) is a potential technique to solve the transmission congestion issues that are threatening NPPs, especially when a nuclear plant is coupled with wind turbine generators. First, DLR can utilize the concurrent cooling effect and dynamic monitors on transmission lines to increase the line carry capacity and reduce congestion. Second, more frequent interactions between transmission lines and operators can increase the flexibility and create a more dynamic and responsive hybrid system. In general, DLR can increase the flexibility and optimize the efficiency of a hybrid system utilizing wind energy. DLR helps meet continuously fluctuating electricity demands with real-time observation of transmission lines for more accurate estimation of line carry capacity. For the fuel energy, DLR can contribute greatly in saving fuels and reducing carbon emission by providing timely information for adjusting generation levels. For HES's including NPPs, transmission congestion could be more serious and needs attention. Therefore, by providing additional transmission capacity, DLR can contribute to alleviate the congestion and congestion pricing impact that is threatening the current NPPs and prevent potential congestion that may constrain the operation of future hybrid system involved with a nuclear plant. However, either a fuel plant or nuclear plant is better coupled with a wind turbine to take advantage of the concurrent cooling effect and dynamic monitoring. The research team at Idaho National Laboratory, currently focused on the benefit of DLR technology to assist wind generation, is now exploring the feasibility of implementing the same technology into such HES and NPP. Future work will focus on the analysis of technique feasibility, challenges and benefit-cost analysis of integrating DLR into HES. Detailed studies are anticipated to evaluate the benefits of DLR on HES and NPP with transmission constraints. This paper explores a potential utilization of DLR in hybrid energy systems, especially those involving traditional fossil fuels or nuclear power coupled with wind energy. The goal is to increase the efficiency and flexibility of these types of hybrid systems in order to provide more secure, reliable and low-carbon energy.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 8 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 849-851","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3066090655","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050270","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Variable electricity and industrial energy demands have been met with storable fossil fuels-systems with low-capital costs and high-operating costs. In contrast, the low-carbon energy sources (nuclear, wind and solar) are characterized by high-capital-costs and low-operating costs. High utilization is required to produce economic energy. The addition of large quantities of wind or solar changes the market. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Future of Solar Energy study examined the solar option and the challenge of moving from an electricity grid dominated by fossil fuel generation to a grid with significant solar capacity. As more solar plants are built, electricity prices at times of high solar output collapse; thus, solar revenue collapses as solar production increases. This limits unsubsidized solar capacity to a relatively small fraction of total electricity production even if there are large decreases in solar capital costs. The same occurs with the large-scale use of wind. This results in increasing number of hours of near-zero wholesale prices for electricity that has been seen in multiple electricity markets in Europe and the United States. This is bad economic news for nuclear, wind and solar for revenue collapse limits the use of low-carbon technologies. It favors lower-capital-cost higher-operating-cost natural gas plants with their capability to cycle up and down quickly. New technologies are required to store or use this electricity at times of low prices to produce electricity at times of high prices. The use of gas-turbines with Firebrick Resistance-Heated Energy Storage (FIRES) is proposed herein to address this challenge as part of a broader strategy to develop nuclear power systems with three goals: (1) compete with natural gas, (2) prosper with subsidized wind and solar and (3) enable a low-cost low-carbon nuclear-renewable energy system.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 11 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 857-861","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3067090656","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050271","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050271","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"The Impact of CCS Readiness on the Evolution of China's Electric Power Sector","Dahowski, Robert T.; Davidson, Casie L.; Yu, Sha; Horing, Jill D.; Wei, Ning; Clarke, Leon E.; Bender, Sadie R.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; CCS; China; electric power sector; INDC: climate change; technological readiness; GCAM-China; COP-21","In this study, GCAM-China is exercised to examine the impact of CCS availability on the projected evolution of China’s electric power sector under the Paris Increased Ambition policy scenario developed by Fawcett et al. based on the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted under the COP-21 Paris Agreement. This policy scenario provides a backdrop for understanding China’s electric generation mix over the coming century under several CCS availability scenarios: CCS is fully available for commercial-scale deployment by 2025; by 2050; by 2075; and CCS is unavailable for use in meeting the modelled mitigation targets through 2100. Without having CCS available, the Chinese electric power sector turns to significant use of nuclear, wind, and solar to meet growing demands and emissions targets, at a cost. Should large-scale CCS deployment be delayed in China by 25 years, the modeled per-ton cost of climate change mitigation is projected to be roughly $420/tC (2010 US dollars) by 2050, relative to $360/tC in the case in which CCS is available to deploy by 2025, a 16% increase. Once CCS is available for commercial use, mitigation costs for the two cases converge, equilibrating by 2085. However, should CCS be entirely unavailable to deploy in China, the mitigation cost spread, compared to the 2025 case, doubles by 2075 ($580/tC and $1130/tC respectively), and triples by 2100 ($1050/tC vs. $3200/tC). However, while delays in CCS availability may have short-term impacts on China’s overall per-ton cost of meeting the emissions reduction target evaluated here, as well as total mitigation costs, the carbon price is likely to approach the price path associated with the full CCS availability case within a decade of CCS deployment. Having CCS available before the end of the century, even under the delays examined here, could reduce the total amount of nuclear and renewable energy that must deploy, reducing the overall cost of meeting the emissions mitigation targets.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The Value of CCS under Current Policy Scenarios: NDCs and Beyond","Davidson, Casie L.; Dahowski, Robert T.; McJeon, Haewon C.; Clarke, Leon E.; Iyer, Gokul C.; Muratori, Matteo","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","This paper describes preliminary results of analysis using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to evaluate the potential role of CCS in addressing emissions reduction targets. Scenarios are modelled using the Paris-Increased Ambition (PIA) case developed by Fawcett et al. (2015), and a more aggressive Paris Two-Degree Ambition (P2A) case. Both cases are based upon nationally determined contributions (NDCs) agreed to at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP-21) in December 2015, coupled with additional mitigation effort beyond the 2030 Paris timeframe, through the end of the century. Analysis of CCS deployment and abatement costs under both policy scenarios suggests that, as modelled, having CCS in the technological portfolio could reduce the global cost of addressing emissions reduction targets specified under the policy scenario by trillions of dollars, primarily by enabling a smoother and lower-cost transition to next-generation technologies. Through the end of the century, total global abatement costs associated with the PIA case – with five percent annual reduction in emission intensity and reaching 2.2 degrees by 2100 – are reduced by $15 trillion USD in the scenario where CCS is available to deploy by 2025 and remains available through 2100, reflecting a 47 percent savings in the cost of climate change abatement. Under the more ambitious P2A case, with 8 percent annual reduction in emission intensity and reaching 1.9 degrees by 2100, the availability of CCS reduces global abatement costs by $22 trillion USD through the end of the century, again nearly halving the costs of addressing the policy, relative to achieving the same target using an energy portfolio that does not include CCS. PIA and P2A scenarios with CCS result in 1,250 and 1,580 GtCO2 of global geologic storage by the end of the century, respectively.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Impact of decadal cloud variations on the Earth’s energy budget","Zhou, Chen; Zelinka, Mark D.; Klein, Stephen A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 58 GEOSCIENCES","Feedbacks of clouds on climate change strongly influence the magnitude of global warming. Cloud feedbacks, in turn, depend on the spatial patterns of surface warming, which vary on decadal timescales. Therefore, the magnitude of the decadal cloud feedback could deviate from the long-term cloud feedback. We present climate model simulations to show that the global mean cloud feedback in response to decadal temperature fluctuations varies dramatically due to time variations in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature. Here, we find that cloud anomalies associated with these patterns significantly modify the Earth’s energy budget. Specifically, the decadal cloud feedback between the 1980s and 2000s is substantially more negative than the long-term cloud feedback. This is a result of cooling in tropical regions where air descends, relative to warming in tropical ascent regions, which strengthens low-level atmospheric stability. Under these conditions, low-level cloud cover and its reflection of solar radiation increase, despite an increase in global mean surface temperature. Our results suggest that sea surface temperature pattern-induced low cloud anomalies could have contributed to the period of reduced warming between 1998 and 2013, and o er a physical explanation of why climate sensitivities estimated from recently observed trends are probably biased low.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Previous work has shown that high-order statistics of present-day rainfall intensity are significantly improved with superparameterization, especially in regions of tropical convection. Globally, the two modeling approaches project a similar future increase in mean rainfall, especially across the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and at high latitudes, but over land, SPCAM predicts a smaller mean change than CAM. Changes in high-order statistics are similar at high latitudes in the two models but diverge at lower latitudes. In the tropics, SPCAM projects a large intensification of moderate and extreme rain rates in regions of organized convection associated with the Madden Julian Oscillation, ITCZ, monsoons, and tropical waves. In contrast, this signal is missing in all versions of CAM, which are found to be prone to predicting increases in the amount but not intensity of moderate rates. Predictions from SPCAM exhibit a scale-insensitive behavior with little dependence on horizontal resolution for extreme rates, while lower resolution (~2°) versions of CAM are not able to capture the response simulated with higher resolution (~1°).

"Interaction of Black Phosphorus with Oxygen and Water","Huang, Yuan; Qiao, Jingsi; He, Kai; Bliznakov, Stoyan; Sutter, Eli; Chen, Xianjue; Luo, Da; Meng, Fanke; Su, Dong; Decker, Jeremy; Ji, Wei; Ruoff, Rodney S.; Sutter, Peter","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; black phosphorus; field-effect transistors","Black phosphorus (BP) has attracted significant interest as a monolayer or few-layer material with extraordinary electrical and optoelectronic properties. Chemical reactions with different ambient species, notably oxygen and water, are important as they govern key properties such as stability in air, electronic structure and charge transport, wetting by aqueous solutions, etc. Here, we report experiments combined with ab-initio calculations that address the effects of oxygen and water in contact with BP. Our results show that the reaction with oxygen is primarily responsible for changing properties of BP. Oxidation involving the dissociative chemisorption of O<sub>2</sub> causes the decomposition of BP and continuously lowers the conductance of BP field-effect transistors (FETs). In contrast, BP is stable in contact with deaerated (i.e., O<sub>2</sub> depleted) water and the carrier mobility in BP FETs gated by H<sub>2</sub>O increases significantly due to efficient dielectric screening of scattering centers by the high-k dielectric. Isotope labeling experiments, contact angle measurements and calculations show that the pristine BP surface is hydrophobic, but is turned progressively hydrophilic by oxidation. Lastly, our results open new avenues for exploring applications that require contact of BP with aqueous solutions including solution gating, electrochemistry, and solution-phase approaches for exfoliation, dispersion, and delivery of BP.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"A retrospective analysis of compact fluorescent lamp experience curves and their correlations to deployment programs","Smith, Sarah Josephine; Wei, Max; Sohn, Michael D.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Experience curve; Learning curve; CFL","Experience curves are useful for understanding technology development and can aid in the design and analysis of market transformation programs. Here, we employ a novel approach to create experience curves, to examine both global and North American compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) data for the years 1990–2007. We move away from the prevailing method of fitting a single, constant, exponential curve to data and instead search for break points where changes in the learning rate may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a learning rate of approximately 21% for the period of 1990–1997, and 51% and 79% in global and North American datasets, respectively, after 1998. We use price data for this analysis; therefore our learning rates encompass developments beyond typical “learning by doing”, including supply chain impacts such as market competition. We examine correlations between North American learning rates and the initiation of new programs, abrupt technological advances, and economic and political events, and find an increased learning rate associated with design advancements and federal standards programs. Our findings support the use of segmented experience curves for retrospective and prospective technology analysis, and may imply that investments in technology programs have contributed to an increase of the CFL learning rate.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Known unknowns: indirect energy effects of information and communication technology","Horner, Nathaniel C.; Shehabi, Arman; Azevedo, Ines L.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; ICT; indirect energy effects; green computing; e-services","There has been sustained and growing interest in characterizing the net energy impact of information and communication technology (ICT), which results from indirect effects offsetting (or amplifying) the energy directly consumed by ICT equipment. These indirect effects may be either positive or negative, and there is considerable disagreement as to the direction of this sign as well as the effect magnitude. Literature in this area ranges from studies focused on a single service (such as e-commerce versus traditional retail) to macroeconomic studies attempting to characterize the overall impact of ICT. Methods. We review the literature on the indirect energy effect of ICT found via Google Scholar, our own research, and input from other researchers in the field. The various studies are linked to an effect taxonomy, which is synthesized from several different hierarchies present in the literature. References are further grouped according to ICT service (e.g., e-commerce, telework) and summarized by scope, method, and quantitative and qualitative findings. Review results. Uncertainty persists in understanding the net energy effects of ICT. Results of indirect energy effect studies are highly sensitive to scoping decisions and assumptions made by the analyst. Uncertainty increases as the impact scope broadens, due to complex and interconnected effects. However, there is general agreement that ICT has large energy savings potential, but that the realization of this potential is highly dependent on deployment details and user behavior. Discussion. While the overall net effect of ICT is likely to remain unknown, this review suggests several guidelines for improving research quality in this area, including increased data collection, enhancing traditional modeling studies with sensitivity analysis, greater care in scoping, less confidence in characterizing aggregate impacts, more effort on understanding user behavior, and more contextual integration across the different levels of the effect taxonomy.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this work, dynamic optimization exploits the flexibility of thermal energy storage by determining optimal times to store and extract excess energy. This concept is applied to a polygeneration distributed energy system with combined heat and power, district heating, district cooling, and chilled water thermal energy storage. The system is a university campus responsible for meeting the energy needs of tens of thousands of people. The objective for the dynamic optimization problem is to minimize cost over a 24-h period while meeting multiple loads in real time. The paper presents a novel algorithm to solve this dynamic optimization problem with energy storage by decomposing the problem into multiple static mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. Another innovative feature of this work is the study of a large, complex energy network which includes the interrelations of a wide variety of energy technologies. Results indicate that a cost savings of 16.5% is realized when the system can participate in the wholesale electricity market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Small and frequent events are also significant in the aggregate. This article explores the role that insurance claims data can play in better defining the broader economic impacts of grid disruptions in the U.S. context. We developed four case studies, using previously unpublished data for specific actual grid disruptions. The cases include the 1977 New York City blackout, the 2003 Northeast blackout, multi-year national annual lightning-related electrical damage and multi-year national line-disturbance events. Insured losses represent between 3 and 64 per cent of total loss costs across the case studies. Here, the household sector emerges as a larger locus of costs than indicated in previous studies, and short-lived events emerge as important sources of loss costs.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Comparative study of the cooling energy performance of variable refrigerant flow systems and variable air volume systems in office buildings","Yu, Xinqiao; Yan, Da; Sun, Kaiyu; Hong, Tianzhen; Zhu, Dandan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Variable air volume (VAV) and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems are widely used in office buildings. This study investigated VAV and VRF systems in five typical office buildings in China, and compared their cooling energy use. Site survey and field measurements were conducted to collect the data of building characteristics and operation. Measured cooling electricity use was collected from sub-metering in the five buildings. The sub-metering data normalized by climate and operating hours indicated that the cooling energy consumed by VRF systems was up to 70% lower than that consumed by VAV systems. This was mainly because of the different operation modes of both system types that led to significantly fewer operating hours for the VRF systems. Building simulations were used to quantify the impact of operation modes of VRF and VAV systems on cooling loads. A prototype office building in China was used as the model. The simulation results showed that the VRF operation mode required much lower cooling load when compared to the VAV operation mode. For example, the cooling loads decreased by 42% in Hong Kong and 53% in Qingdao. Key findings include the following: the VRF systems operated in the part-time-part-space mode enabling occupants to turn on the air-conditioning only when needed and when the spaces were occupied. However, the VAV systems operated in the full-time-full-space mode limiting occupants’ control of operation. These findings provide insights into VRF systems operation and controls as well as their energy performance, which could help guide HVAC designers on system selection and building operators or facility managers on system operations to achieve low- or zero-net energy buildings.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Understanding the kinetics of the lithiation process in this compound is crucial to optimize its performance and cyclability. In this work, we have utilized a low-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy method to visualize the dynamic reaction process in real time and study the reaction kinetics at different rates. We show that the particles undergo a two-step reaction at the single-particle level, which includes an initial intercalation reaction followed by a conversion reaction. At low rates, the conversion reaction starts after the intercalation reaction has fully finished, consistent with the prediction of density functional theoretical calculations. At high rates, the intercalation reaction is overwhelmed by the subsequently nucleated conversion reaction, and the reaction speeds of both the intercalation and conversion reactions are increased. Phase-field simulations show the crucial role of surface diffusion rates of lithium ions in controlling this process. Furthermore, this work provides microscopic insights into the reaction dynamics in non-equilibrium conditions and highlights the effect of lithium diffusion rates on the overall reaction homogeneity as well as the performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The system is intended to be assembled and operated by developing-world households that lack sufficient access to electricity, thereby enabling LED lighting or mobile phone charging on demand. Lab-scale hardware is used to assess the performance of individual cell components. It is found that coffee filter paper is an effective low-cost separator. Carbon felt is a low-cost electrode material, and its performance and wetting by the electrolyte solution is greatly improved by pre-treatment with sulfuric acid. The carbon felt does not degrade after a week of daily use. By using these components, performance of the system is significantly improved over the previous baseline, with power density more than doubling to 40 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, and iron utilization improving from 78% to 88%. The operating cost is estimated to be less than US$0.03 per mobile phone charge. Based on the lab-scale results, a stand-alone prototype consumer product is designed, fabricated, and tested.

The analysis is based on hygroscopicity measurements by a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA), physical phase state investigations by an Aerosol Bounce Instrument (ABI) and composition measurements using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). To study the effect of atmospheric aging on these properties, an OH-radical oxidation flow reactor (OFR) was used to simulate longer atmospheric aging times of up to 3 weeks. Hygroscopicity and bounce behavior of the particles had a clear relationship showing higher bounce at elevated relative humidity (RH) values for less hygroscopic particles, which agrees well with earlier laboratory studies. Additional OH oxidation of the aerosol particles in the OFR increased the O:C and the hygroscopicity resulting in liquefying of the particles at lower RH values. At the highest OH exposures, the inorganic fraction starts to dominate the bounce process due to production of inorganics and concurrent loss of organics in the OFR. Our results indicate that at typical ambient RH and temperature, organic-dominated particles stay mostly liquid in the atmospheric conditions in the southeastern US, but they often turn semisolid when dried below ~50 % RH in the sampling inlets. Furthermore, while the liquid phase state suggests solution behavior and equilibrium partitioning for the SOA particles in ambient air, the possible phase change in the drying process highlights the importance of thoroughly considered sampling techniques of SOA particles.","European Geosciences Union","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2016-09-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (Online); Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 17","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11163-11176","","","SC0011105","Journal ID: ISSN 1680-7324","10.5194/acp-16-11163-2016","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1360105","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1360105","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1360105","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (Online)","17","16"

Moreover, as direct measurement of GPU power is necessary for model evaluation and parameter initiation, internal and external power sensors are discussed. Hardware counters, which are low-level tallies of hardware events, share strong correlation to power use and performance. Statistical correlation between power and performance counters has yielded worthwhile GPU power models, yet the complexity inherent to GPU architectures presents new hurdles for power modeling. Developments and challenges of counter-based GPU power modeling is discussed. Often building on the counter-based models, research efforts for GPU power simulation, which make power predictions from input code and hardware knowledge, provide opportunities for optimization in programming or architectural design. Noteworthy strides in power simulations for GPUs are included along with their performance or functional simulator counterparts when appropriate. Lastly, possible directions for future research are discussed.","Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

This work presents new experimental data on ethanol ignition, including stable species measurements, obtained with the University of Michigan rapid compression facility. Ignition delay times were determined from pressure histories of ignition experiments with stoichiometric ethanol–air mixtures at pressures of ~3–10 atm. Temperatures (880–1150 K) were controlled by varying buffer gas composition (Ar, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>). High-speed imaging was used to record chemiluminescence during the experiments, which showed homogeneous ignition events. The results for ignition delay time agreed well with trends on the basis of previous experimental measurements. Speciation experiments were performed using fast gas sampling and gas chromatography to identify and quantify ethanol and 11 stable intermediate species formed during the ignition delay period. Simulations were carried out using a chemical kinetic mechanism available in the literature, and the agreement with the experimental results for ignition delay time and the intermediate species measured was excellent for the majority of the conditions studied. From the simulation results, ethanol + HO<sub>2</sub> was identified as an important reaction at the experimental conditions for both the ignition delay time and intermediate species measurements. Further studies to improve the accuracy of the rate coefficient for ethanol + HO<sub>2</sub> would improve the predictive understanding of intermediate and low-temperature ethanol combustion.","American Chemical Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In the first case, a building model is de-tuned by deliberately injecting faults into more than 60 parameters. This model was then calibrated using Autotune and its accuracy with respect to the original model was evaluated in terms of the industry-standard normalized mean bias error and coefficient of variation of root mean squared error metrics set forth in ASHRAE Guideline 14. In addition to whole-building energy consumption, outputs including lighting, plug load profiles, HVAC energy consumption, zone temperatures, and other variables were analyzed. In the second case, Autotune calibration is compared directly to experts’ manual calibration of an emulated-occupancy, full-size residential building with comparable calibration results in much less time. Lastly, our paper concludes with a discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of auto-calibration approaches.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A reduced-form approach for representing the impacts of wind and solar PV deployment on the structure and operation of the electricity system","Johnson, Nils; Strubegger, Manfred; McPherson, Madeleine; Parkinson, Simon C.; Krey, Volker; Sullivan, Patrick","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; integrated assessment modeling; integration of renewables; residual load duration curves","In many climate change mitigation scenarios, integrated assessment models of the energy and climate systems rely heavily on renewable energy technologies with variable and uncertain generation, such as wind and solar PV, to achieve substantial decarbonization of the electricity sector. However, these models often include very little temporal resolution and thus have difficulty in representing the integration costs that arise from mismatches between electricity supply and demand. The global integrated assessment model, MESSAGE, has been updated to explicitly model the trade-offs between variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment and its impacts on the electricity system, including the implications for electricity curtailment, backup capacity, and system flexibility. These impacts have been parameterized using a reduced-form approach, which allows VRE integration impacts to be quantified on a regional basis. In addition, thermoelectric technologies were updated to include two modes of operation, baseload and flexible, to better account for the cost, efficiency, and availability penalties associated with flexible operation. In this paper, the modeling approach used in MESSAGE is explained and the implications for VRE deployment in mitigation scenarios are assessed. Three important stylized facts associated with integrating high VRE shares are successfully reproduced by our modeling approach: (1) the significant reduction in the utilization of non-VRE power plants; (2) the diminishing role for traditional baseload generators, such as nuclear and coal, and the transition to more flexible technologies; and (3) the importance of electricity storage and hydrogen electrolysis in facilitating the deployment of VRE.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Due to their substantial temporal and spatial aggregation, IAMs cannot explicitly represent all detailed challenges of integrating the variable renewable energies (VRE) wind and solar in power systems, but rather rely on parameterized modeling approaches. In the ADVANCE project, six international modeling teams have developed new approaches to improve the representation of power sector dynamics and VRE integration in IAMs. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the last years' modeling progress and study the impact of VRE integration modeling on VRE deployment in IAM scenarios. For a comprehensive and transparent qualitative evaluation, we first develop a framework of 18 features of power sector dynamics and VRE integration. We then apply this framework to the newly-developed modeling approaches to derive a detailed map of strengths and limitations of the different approaches. For the quantitative evaluation, we compare the IAMs to the detailed hourly-resolution power sector model REMIX. We find that the new modeling approaches manage to represent a large number of features of the power sector, and the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with those derived from the detailed power sector model. Updating the power sector representation and the cost and resources of wind and solar substantially increased wind and solar shares across models: Under a carbon price of 30$/tCO2 in 2020 (increasing by 5% per year), the model-average cost-minimizing VRE share over the period 2050-2100 is 62% of electricity generation, 24%-points higher than with the old model version.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a demonstration, a simple empirical model for wind plant cost of energy is used in an optimization under uncertainty to examine how different risk appetites affect the optimal selection of a turbine configuration for sites of different wind resource profiles. Lastly, if there is unusually high uncertainty in the site wind resource, the optimal turbine configuration diverges from the deterministic case and a generally more conservative design is obtained with increasing risk aversion on the part of the designer.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, to explore in detail the relationships connecting materials to the products that require them, we map supply chains for five product platforms (a cadmium telluride solar cell, a germanium solar cell, a turbine blade, a lead acid battery, and a hard drive (HD) magnet) using a data ontology that specifies the supply chain actors (nodes) and linkages (e.g., material exchange and contractual relationships) among them. We then propose a set of network indicators (product complexity, producer diversity, supply chain length, and potential bottlenecks) to assess the situation for each platform in the overall supply chain networks. Among the results of interest are the following: (1) the turbine blade displays a high product complexity, defined by the material linkages to the platform; (2) the germanium solar cell is produced by only a few manufacturers globally and requires more physical transformation steps than do the other project platforms; (3) including production quantity and sourcing countries in the assessment shows that a large portion of nodes of the supply chain of the hard-drive magnet are located in potentially unreliable countries. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the network analysis of supply chains could be combined with criticality and scenario analyses of abiotic raw materials to comprise a comprehensive picture of product platform risk.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"On representation of temporal variability in electricity capacity planning models","Merrick, James H.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Electricity; Investment; Optimisation; Variability; Renewables","This study systematically investigates how to represent intra-annual temporal variability in models of optimum electricity capacity investment. Inappropriate aggregation of temporal resolution can introduce substantial error into model outputs and associated economic insight. The mechanisms underlying the introduction of this error are shown. How many representative periods are needed to fully capture the variability is then investigated. For a sample dataset, a scenario-robust aggregation of hourly (8760) resolution is possible in the order of 10 representative hours when electricity demand is the only source of variability. The inclusion of wind and solar supply variability increases the resolution of the robust aggregation to the order of 1000. A similar scale of expansion is shown for representative days and weeks. These concepts can be applied to any such temporal dataset, providing, at the least, a benchmark that any other aggregation method can aim to emulate. Finally, how prior information about peak pricing hours can potentially reduce resolution further is also discussed.","Elsevier","","Stanford Univ., CA (United States).

The future evolution of the scale and character of the energy system will be fundamentally shaped by socioeconomic conditions and drivers, available energy resources, technologies of energy supply and transformation, and end-use energy demand. However, because energy-related activities are significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental and social externalities, energy system development will also be influenced by social acceptance and strategic policy choices. All of these uncertainties have important implications for many aspects of economic and environmental sustainability, and climate change in particular. In the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) framework these uncertainties are structured into five narratives, arranged according to the challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study we explore future energy sector developments across the five SSPs using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and we also provide summary output and analysis for selected scenarios of global emissions mitigation policies. The mitigation challenge strongly corresponds with global baseline energy sector growth over the 21st century, which varies between 40% and 230% depending on final energy consumer behavior, technological improvements, resource availability and policies. The future baseline CO<sub>2</sub>-emission range is even larger, as the most energy-intensive SSP also incorporates a comparatively high share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and vice versa. Inter-regional disparities in the SSPs are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic assumptions; these differences are particularly strong in the SSPs with large adaptation challenges, which have little inter-regional convergence in long-term income and final energy demand levels. The scenarios presented do not include feedbacks of climate change on energy sector development. The energy sector SSPs with and without emissions mitigation policies are introduced and analyzed here in order to contribute to future research in climate sciences, mitigation analysis, and studies on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.","Elsevier","","Potsdam Inst. for CIimate Impact Research (Germany); National Inst. for Environmental Studies (NIES), Tsukuba (Japan); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Aggregate modeling of fast-acting demand response and control under real-time pricing","Chassin, David P.; Rondeau, Daniel","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; electricity demand response; demand elasticity; real-time pricing; indirect load control; transactive systems; random utility model","This paper develops and assesses the performance of a short-term demand response (DR) model for utility load control with applications to resource planning and control design. Long term response models tend to underestimate short-term demand response when induced by prices. This has two important consequences. First, planning studies tend to undervalue DR and often overlook its benefits in utility demand management program development. Second, when DR is not overlooked, the open-loop DR control gain estimate may be too low. This can result in overuse of load resources, control instability and excessive price volatility. Our objective is therefore to develop a more accurate and better performing short-term demand response model. We construct the model from first principles about the nature of thermostatic load control and show that the resulting formulation corresponds exactly to the Random Utility Model employed in economics to study consumer choice. The model is tested against empirical data collected from field demonstration projects and is shown to perform better than alternative models commonly used to forecast demand in normal operating conditions. Finally, the results suggest that (1) existing utility tariffs appear to be inadequate to incentivize demand response, particularly in the presence of high renewables, and (2) existing load control systems run the risk of becoming unstable if utilities close the loop on real-time prices.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 181; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 288-298","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261916311588; TRN: US1701696","10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.071","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1347548","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1347548","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1347548","Applied Energy","C","181"

Management of this energy-water nexus requires a clear understanding of the inter-related demands of these resources as well as their regional distribution. Toward this need the fresh water consumed for energy production was mapped for almost 12 000 watersheds distributed across the 21-economies comprising the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Fresh water consumption was estimated for ten different sectors including thermoelectric and hydroelectric power; energy extraction including coal, oil, natural gas, uranium and unconventional oil/gas; energy processing including oil and biofuels; and biofuel feedstock irrigation. These measures of water consumption were put in context by drawing comparison with published measures of water risk. In total 791 watersheds (32%) of the 2511 watersheds where energy related water consumption occurred were also characterized by high to extreme water risk, these watersheds were designated as being at energy-water risk. Furthermore, for six economies watersheds at energy-water risk represented half or more of all basins where energy related water consumption occurred, while four additional economies exceeded 30%.","IOP Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

"Online purchasing creates opportunities to lower the life cycle carbon footprints of consumer products","Isley, Steven C.; Stern, Paul C.; Carmichael, Scott P.; Joseph, Karun M.; Arent, Douglas J.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; carbon footprint; online experiments; carbon offset; ecolabels; consumer behavior","A major barrier to transitions to environmental sustainability is that consumers lack information about the full environmental footprints of their purchases. Sellers' incentives do not support reducing the footprints unless customers have such information and are willing to act on it. We explore the potential of modern information technology to lower this barrier by enabling firms to inform customers of products' environmental footprints at the point of purchase and easily offset consumers' contributions through bundled purchases of carbon offsets. Using online stated choice experiments, we evaluated the effectiveness of several inexpensive features that firms in four industries could implement with existing online user interfaces for consumers. These examples illustrate the potential for firms to lower their overall carbon footprints while improving customer satisfaction by lowering the 'soft costs' to consumers of pro-environmental choices. Lastly, opportunities such as these likely exist wherever firms possess environmentally relevant data not accessible to consumers or when transaction costs make pro-environmental action difficult.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Energy and Environmental Performance of Ground-Mounted Photovoltaic Systems—A Timely Update","Leccisi, Enrica; Raugei, Marco; Fthenakis, Vasilis","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY","Given photovoltaics’ (PVs) constant improvements in terms of material usage and energy efficiency, this work provides a timely update on their life-cycle energy and environmental performance. Single-crystalline Si (sc-Si), multi-crystalline Si (mc-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) systems are analysed, considering the actual country of production and adapting the input electricity mix accordingly. Energy pay-back time (EPBT) results for fixed-tilt ground mounted installations range from 0.5 years for CdTe PV at high-irradiation (2300 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·yr)) to 2.8 years for sc-Si PV at low-irradiation (1000 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>·yr)), with corresponding quality-adjusted energy return on investment (EROI<sub>PE-eq</sub>) values ranging from over 60 to ~10. Global warming potential (GWP) per kWh<sub>el</sub> averages out at ~30 g(CO<sub>2</sub>-eq), with lower values (down to ~10 g) for CdTe PV at high irradiation, and up to ~80 g for Chinese sc-Si PV at low irradiation. In general, results point to CdTe PV as the best performing technology from an environmental life-cycle perspective, also showing a remarkable improvement for current production modules in comparison with previous generations. Finally, we determined that one-axis tracking installations can improve the environmental profile of PV systems by approximately 10% for most impact metrics.","MDPI AG","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Life Cycle Assessment of Vehicle Lightweighting: A Physics-Based Model To Estimate Use-Phase Fuel Consumption of Electrified Vehicles","Kim, Hyung Chul; Wallington, Timothy J.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Assessing the life-cycle benefits of vehicle lightweighting requires a quantitative description of mass-induced fuel consumption (MIF) and fuel reduction values (FRVs). We have extended our physics-based model of MIF and FRVs for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electrified vehicles (EVs) including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We illustrate the utility of the model by calculating MIFs and FRVs for 37 EVs and 13 ICEVs. BEVs have much smaller MIF and FRVs, both in the range 0.04-0.07 L<sub>e</sub>/(100 km 100 kg), than those for ICEVs which are in the ranges 0.19-0.32 and 0.16-0.22 L/(100 km 100 kg), respectively. The MIF and FRVs for HEVs and PHEVs mostly lie between those for ICEVs and BEVs. Powertrain resizing increases the FRVs for ICEVs, HEVs and PHEVs. Lightweighting EVs is less effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions than lightweighting ICEVs, however the benefits differ substantially for different vehicle models. The physics-based approach outlined here enables model specific assessments for ICEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs required to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the life-cycle benefits of lightweighting the light-duty vehicle fleet.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Magna/Vehma International Inc., Troy, MI (United States); Ford Motor Company, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 50; Journal Issue: 20","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11226-11233","","","EE0005574","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.6b02059","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1424998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1424998","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424998","Environmental Science and Technology","20","50"

Using Bayesian statistical modeling on past and present water use, we project domestic water demand in the context of four climate scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as part of the their Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). We compare 2010 demand to projections of domestic water demand for the years 2030, 2060 and 2090 for the four SRES scenarios. Results indicate that the number of counties exceeding fifty percent or greater demand over 2010 levels increases through 2090 for two of the scenarios and plateaus around 2050 for the other two. Counties experiencing the largest increases in water demand are concentrated in the states of California, Texas, and isolated portions of the Mid-West, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic. Closer examination of the spatial distribution of high demand counties reveals that they are typically found near or adjacent to metropolitan centers, potentially placing greater stress on already taxed systems. Identifying these counties allows for targeted adaptive management and policies, economic incentives, and legislation to be focused towards locations that are potentially the most vulnerable.","","","Oak Ridge Inst. for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE; USEPA","","Netherlands","2016-11-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Landscape and Urban Planning Journal Volume: 158 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: p. 75-86","","","SC0014664","Journal ID: ISSN 0169-2046; S0169204616301499; PII: S0169204616301499","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.07.014","","2020-11-28T00:00:00Z","1378377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1378377","","Landscape and Urban Planning","C","158"
"Spatially explicit global population scenarios consistent with the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Jones, B.; O’Neill, B. C.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; spatial population; population projections; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Here we report that the projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.","IOP Publishing","","National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United Kingdom","2016-07-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research Letters Journal Volume: 11 Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 084003","","","SC0006704; CHE-1314040","Journal ID: ISSN 1748-9326","10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084003","","2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","1275965","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1275965","","Environmental Research Letters","8","11"

Wind power adoption in Portugal began in the early 2000s, incentivized by a continuous feed-in tariff policy mechanism, coupled with public tenders for connection licenses in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These policies led to an enormous success in terms of having a large share of renewables providing electricity services: wind alone accounts today for ~23.5% of electricity demand in Portugal. We explain the reasons wind power became a key part of Portugal's strategy to comply with European Commission climate and energy goals, and provide a detailed review of the wind feed-in tariff mechanism. We describe the actors involved in wind power production growth. We estimate the environmental and energy dependency gains achieved through wind power generation, and highlight the correlation between wind electricity generation and electricity exports. Finally, we compare the Portuguese wind policies with others countries' policy designs and discuss the relevance of a feed-in tariff reform for subsequent wind power additions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurate prediction is a Big Data problem that requires disparate data, multiple models that are each applicable for a specific time frame, and application of computational intelligence techniques to successfully blend all of the model and observational information in real-time and deliver it to the decision makers at utilities and grid operators.

Cumulus and convection parameterizations are natural culprits but the effect of bypassing them with explicitly resolved convection on global land-atmosphere coupling dynamics has not been explored systematically. We apply a suite of modern land-atmosphere coupling diagnostics to isolate the effect of cloud Superparameterization in the Community Atmosphere Model (SPCAM) v3.5, focusing on both the terrestrial segment (i.e., soil moisture and surface turbulent fluxes interaction) and atmospheric segment (i.e., surface turbulent fluxes and precipitation interaction) in the water pathway of the landatmosphere feedback loop. At daily timescales, SPCAM produces stronger uncoupled terrestrial signals (negative sign) over tropical rainforests in wet seasons, reduces the terrestrial coupling strength in the Central Great Plain in American, and reverses the coupling sign (from negative to positive) over India in the boreal summer season—all favorable improvements relative to reanalysis-forced land modeling. Analysis of the triggering feedback strength (TFS) and amplification feedback strength (AFS) shows that SPCAM favorably reproduces the observed geographic patterns of these indices over North America, with the probability of afternoon precipitation enhanced by high evaporative fraction along the eastern United States and Mexico, while conventional CAM does not capture this signal. We introduce a new diagnostic called the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) Feedback Strength (PFS), which reveals that SPCAM exhibits a tight connection between the responses of the lifting condensation level, the PBL height, and the rainfall triggering to surface turbulent fluxes; a triggering disconnect is found in CAM.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2016-07-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1248-1269","","","SC0012152","Journal ID: ISSN 1942-2466","10.1002/2016MS000689","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1360137","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1360137","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1360137","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","3","8"

"A robust approach to chance constrained optimal power flow with renewable generation","Lubin, Miles; Dvorkin, Yury; Backhaus, Scott N.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; Energy Sciences","Optimal Power Flow (OPF) dispatches controllable generation at minimum cost subject to operational constraints on generation and transmission assets. The uncertainty and variability of intermittent renewable generation is challenging current deterministic OPF approaches. Recent formulations of OPF use chance constraints to limit the risk from renewable generation uncertainty, however, these new approaches typically assume the probability distributions which characterize the uncertainty and variability are known exactly. We formulate a robust chance constrained (RCC) OPF that accounts for uncertainty in the parameters of these probability distributions by allowing them to be within an uncertainty set. The RCC OPF is solved using a cutting-plane algorithm that scales to large power systems. We demonstrate the RRC OPF on a modified model of the Bonneville Power Administration network, which includes 2209 buses and 176 controllable generators. In conclusion, deterministic, chance constrained (CC), and RCC OPF formulations are compared using several metrics including cost of generation, area control error, ramping of controllable generators, and occurrence of transmission line overloads as well as the respective computational performance.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here, a microstructured prismatic film designed for such use was characterized using goniophotometric measurements and ray tracing simulations. The synthetically-generated bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) data were shown to have good agreement with limited measured data for normal incident angles (0–60°). Measured data indicated that the prismatic film was most efficient when vertical angles of incidence were between 18 and 35° and within ±45° of normal incidence to the plane of the window so maximum energy savings across the full depth of the zone occurred over the equinox to winter solstice period. Annual lighting energy use and visual comfort in a deep open plan office zone were evaluated using the Radiance three-phase method in several climates and for south and east-facing window orientations. Lighting energy savings were 39–43% for a 12 m (40 ft) deep south-facing perimeter zone compared to the same zone with no lighting controls.

At mature market costs, the system was projected to have a simple payback of 2–6 years. Technical challenges encountered throughout the evaluation led to improvements in measurement and modeling tools and stressed the importance of having accurate input data for product development.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The aggregation reduces a distribution network having thousands of nodes to an equivalent network with a few aggregated nodes, thereby enabling distribution system operators (DSOs) to make faster operational decisions. Moreover, the aggregation enables flexibility from small distributed flexible resources to be traded to different power and energy markets. A hierarchical control architecture comprising a combination of centralized and decentralized control approaches is proposed to practically deploy the aggregated flexibility. The proposed method serves as a great operational tool for DSOs to decide the exact amount of required flexibilities from different network section(s) for solving grid constraint violations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation of three operational scenarios in a real low voltage distribution system having high penetrations of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Finally, the simulation results demonstrated that the aggregation helps DSOs not only in taking faster operational decisions, but also in effectively utilizing the available flexibility.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

This research is structured in two parts: the design of a new methodological framework and the pilot application for an Italian municipality. The methodological framework designed supports Initial Environmental Analysis at the territorial level thanks to the results derived from the impact assessment phase. The pilot application in an Italian municipality EMAS registered demonstrates the applicability of the framework and its effectiveness in evaluating the environmental impact assessment for direct and indirect aspects. Through the discussion of the results, we underline the growing knowledge derived by this research in terms of the reproducibility and consistency of the criteria to define the significance of the direct and indirect environmental aspects for a local public administration. - Highlights: • The combination between Environmental Management System and LCA is studied. • A methodological framework is elaborated and tested at the territorial level. • Life Cycle Impact Assessment supports the evaluation of aspects significance. • The framework assures consistency of evaluation criteria on the studied territory.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.11.004","","","","United States","2017-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 63; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 59-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30267-0; TRN: US17R2070036997","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.11.004","","2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","22687988","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22687988","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","63"
"Modeling the value of integrated U.S. and Canadian power sector expansion","Beiter, Philipp; Cole, Wesley J.; Steinberg, Daniel C.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; United States; Canada; cross-border transmission capacity expansion under a carbon cap scenario; integrated U.S. - Canada ReEDS modeling; transmission capacity expansion; carbon cap scenario; regional impacts; value of U.S.-Canada cross-border transmission expansion; regional impacts of U.S.-Canada transmission capacity expansion","The U.S.-Canadian power system has evolved into a highly integrated grid. Cross-border transmission and coordination of system operations create an interconnected power system with combined imports and exports of electricity of greater than 77 TWh per year. Currently, more than 5 GW of new international transmission lines are in various stages of permitting and development. These transmission lines may enable even greater integration and coordination of the U.S. and Canadian systems, which can in turn increase the reliability and flexibility of North America's electricity grid and help address challenges associated with integrating high levels of variable renewables. Using a version of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model that incorporates Canada, this analysis quantifies the differences in the evolution of the power system under scenarios in which cross-border transmission capacity is restricted to today's levels, and scenarios in which new transmission is less restricted. These impacts are analyzed under a 'business-as-usual' reference scenario and a scenario in which deep cuts in power sector carbon dioxide emissions levels are achieved. A set of key impact metrics is analyzed, including 1) the composition of generating capacity by technology, 2) system costs, 3) wholesale electricity prices, 4) international electricity exports and imports, 5) transmission capacity, and 6) carbon dioxide emission levels. When new cross-border transmission is not allowed, the United States needs additional capacity (primarily natural gas and renewable energy) to meet domestic needs, while total Canadian capacity is lower because less capacity is needed to export to the United States. This effect is amplified under the carbon cap scenario. Impacts vary on a regional basis, largely due to the different relative sizes of the generation portfolio between countries and regions and the relative impact from cross-border electricity trade. The total impact from restricting cross-border trade on carbon emissions and average wholesale electricity prices is limited, due to the relative size of the domestic power systems and the cross-border trade volume. Lastly, cross-border transmission capacity is projected to more than double under the unrestricted transmission capacity scenarios, which exceeds the rate of projected domestic transmission capacity additions in each country.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Progressing quality control in environmental impact assessment beyond legislative compliance: An evaluation of the IEMA EIA Quality Mark certification scheme","Bond, Alan; Research Unit for Environmental Sciences and Management, North-West University (South Africa)]; Fischer, Thomas B, E-mail: fischer@liverpool.ac.uk; Fothergill, Josh","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CERTIFICATION; COMPLIANCE; CONTROL SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS; EUROPEAN UNION; EVALUATION; MARKET; QUALITY CONTROL","The effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) systems is contingent on a number of control mechanisms: procedural; judicial; evaluative; public and government agency; professional; and development aid agency. If we assume that procedural and judicial controls are guaranteed in developed EIA systems, then progressing effectiveness towards an acceptable level depends on improving the performance of other control mechanisms over time. These other control mechanisms are either absent, or are typically centrally controlled, requiring public finances; this we argue is an unpopular model in times of greater Government austerity. Here we evaluate a market-based mechanism for improving the performance of evaluative and professional control mechanisms, the UK Institute of Environmental Management and Assessments' EIA Quality Mark. We do this by defining dimensions of effectiveness for the purposes of our evaluation, and by identifying international examples of the approaches taken to delivering the other control measures to validate the approach taken in the EIA Quality Mark. We then evaluate the EIA Quality Mark, when used in combination with legal procedures and an active judiciary, against the effectiveness dimensions and use time-series analysis of registrant data to examine its ability to progress practice. We conclude that the EIA Quality Mark has merit as a model for a market-based mechanism, and may prove a more financially palatable approach for delivering effective EIA in mature systems in countries that lack centralised agency oversight. It may, therefore, be of particular interest to some Member States of the European Union for ensuring forthcoming certification requirements stemming from recent amendments to the EIA Directive. - Highlights: • Quality control mechanisms in EIA are identified. • Effectiveness of EIA is conceptualised for evaluation purposes. • The UK IEMA EIA Quality Mark is introduced as a market-based mechanism. • The EIA Quality Mark is found to progress quality in many, but not all, areas.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.12.001","","","","United States","2017-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 63; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 160-171","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30390-0; TRN: US17R2079037006","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.12.001","","2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","22687997","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22687997","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","63"
"Improving the accuracy of energy baseline models for commercial buildings with occupancy data","Liang, Xin; Hong, Tianzhen; Shen, Geoffrey Qiping","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Baseline model; Occupancy; Building energy use; Measurement and verification; Energy efficiency retrofit","More than 80% of energy is consumed during operation phase of a building's life cycle, so energy efficiency retrofit for existing buildings is considered a promising way to reduce energy use in buildings. The investment strategies of retrofit depend on the ability to quantify energy savings by “measurement and verification” (M&V), which compares actual energy consumption to how much energy would have been used without retrofit (called the “baseline” of energy use). Although numerous models exist for predicting baseline of energy use, a critical limitation is that occupancy has not been included as a variable. However, occupancy rate is essential for energy consumption and was emphasized by previous studies. This study develops a new baseline model which is built upon the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) model but includes the use of building occupancy data. The study also proposes metrics to quantify the accuracy of prediction and the impacts of variables. However, the results show that including occupancy data does not significantly improve the accuracy of the baseline model, especially for HVAC load. The reasons are discussed further. In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the influence of parameters in baseline models. To conclude, the results from this study can help us understand the influence of occupancy on energy use, improve energy baseline prediction by including the occupancy factor, reduce risks of M&V and facilitate investment strategies of energy efficiency retrofit.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Economic implications of incorporating emission controls to mitigate air pollutants emitted from a modeled hydrocarbon-fuel biorefinery in the United States","Bhatt, Arpit; Zhang, Yimin; Davis, Ryan; Eberle, Annika; Heath, Garvin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; hydrocarbon biofuel; air pollutant emissions; minimum fuel selling price; air regulations; permitting; emission controls; techno-economic analysis","The implementation of the US Renewable Fuel Standard is expected to increase the construction and operation of new biofuel facilities. Allowing this industry to grow without adversely affecting air quality is an important sustainability goal sought by multiple stakeholders. However, little is known about how the emission controls potentially required to comply with air quality regulations might impact biorefinery cost and deployment strategies such as siting and sizing. In this study, we use a baseline design for a lignocellulosic hydrocarbon biofuel production process to assess how the integration of emission controls impacts the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of the biofuel produced. We evaluate the change in MFSP for two cases as compared to the baseline design by incorporating (i) emission controls that ensure compliance with applicable federal air regulations and (ii) advanced control options that could be used to achieve potential best available control technology (BACT) emission limits. Our results indicate that compliance with federal air regulations can be achieved with minimal impact on biofuel cost (~$0.02 per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) higher than the baseline price of $5.10 GGE<sup>-1</sup>). However, if air emissions must be further reduced to meet potential BACT emission limits, the cost could increase nontrivially. For example, the MFSP could increase to $5.50 GGE<sup>-1</sup> by adopting advanced emission controls to meet potential boiler BACT limits. Finally, given tradeoffs among emission control costs, permitting requirements, and economies of scale, these results could help inform decisions about biorefinery siting and sizing and mitigate risks associated with air permitting.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, a data-driven multi-model wind forecasting methodology is developed with a two-layer ensemble machine learning technique. The first layer is composed of multiple machine learning models that generate individual forecasts. A deep feature selection framework is developed to determine the most suitable inputs to the first layer machine learning models. Then, a blending algorithm is applied in the second layer to create an ensemble of the forecasts produced by first layer models and generate both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. This two-layer model seeks to utilize the statistically different characteristics of each machine learning algorithm. A number of machine learning algorithms are selected and compared in both layers. This developed multi-model wind forecasting methodology is compared to several benchmarks.

Several countries already meet or come close to achieving this goal. Iceland, for example, supplies 100% of its electricity needs with either geothermal or hydropower. Other countries that have electric grids with high fractions of renewables based on hydropower include Norway (97%), Costa Rica (93%), Brazil (76%), and Canada (62%). Hydropower plants have been used for decades to create a relatively inexpensive, renewable form of energy, but these systems are limited by natural rainfall and geographic topology. Around the world, most good sites for large hydropower resources have already been developed. So how do other areas achieve 100% renewable grids? Variable renewable energy (VRE), such as wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, will be a major contributor, and with the reduction in costs for these technologies during the last five years, large-scale deployments are happening around the world.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Experience curve development and cost reduction disaggregation for fuel cell markets in Japan and the US","Wei, Max; Smith, Sarah J.; Sohn, Michael D.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Technology learning rates can be dynamic quantities as a technology moves from early development to piloting and from low volume manufacturing to high volume manufacturing. This work describes a generalizable technology analysis approach for disaggregating observed technology cost reductions and presents results of this approach for one specific case study (micro-combined heat and power fuel cell systems in Japan). We build upon earlier reports that combine discussion of fuel cell experience curves and qualitative discussion of cost components by providing greater detail on the contributing mechanisms to observed cost reductions, which were not quantified in earlier reports. Greater standardization is added to the analysis approach, which can be applied to other technologies. This paper thus provides a key linkage that has been missing from earlier literature on energy-related technologies by integrating the output of earlier manufacturing cost studies with observed learning rates to quantitatively estimate the different components of cost reduction including economies of scale and cost reductions due to product performance and product design improvements. This work also provides updated fuel cell technology price versus volume trends from the California Self-Generation Incentive Program, including extensive data for solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) reported here for the first time. The Japanese micro-CHP market is found to have a learning rate of 18% from 2005 to 2015, while larger SOFC fuel cell systems (200 kW and above) in the California market are found to have a flat (near-zero) learning rate, and these are attributed to a combination of exogenous, market, and policy factors.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Our paper investigates the operations flexibility of HES, and develops a methodology for operations optimization for maximizing economic value based on predicted renewable generation and market information. A multi-environment computational platform for performing such operations optimization is also developed. In order to compensate for prediction error, a control strategy is accordingly designed to operate a standby energy storage element (ESE) to avoid energy imbalance within HES. The proposed operations optimizer allows systematic control of energy conversion for maximal economic value. Simulation results of two specific HES configurations are included to illustrate the proposed methodology and computational capability. These results demonstrate the economic viability of HES under proposed operations optimizer, suggesting the diversion of energy for alternative energy output while participating in the ancillary service market. Economic advantages of such operations optimizer and associated flexible operations are illustrated by comparing the economic performance of flexible operations against that of constant operations. Sensitivity analysis with respect to market variability and prediction error, are also performed.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Our case study is the Italian regional level, examined to identify eventual flaws and areas for improvement for each regional legislative framework. For this purpose, this study refers to a selection of analytical criteria recurring in the international debate on sustainability assessments. Statistical multi-dimensional analysis is used to identify Italian regions with similar SEA legislation. We recognize four taxonomies, depending on the way regional legislation provides information about i) legislation and guidelines, ii) integration between SEA and PPPs, iii) sustainability goals, iv) technical organization, v) participatory organization, and vi) monitoring. The results suggest that Italian administrators should cooperate to improve legislation at the regional level. Acknowledging the institution-centred nature of SEA, this methodology could drive the EU to better support SEA development in countries with diversified traditions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.09.002","","","","United States","2017-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 62; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(16)30134-2; TRN: US17R2041036970","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.09.002","","2018-05-25T00:00:00Z","22687961","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22687961","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","62"

Relatively few research studies, however, have approached EIA as an instrument of environmental governance, and have explored the mechanisms through which EIA influences the behaviour of actors involved in planning processes. Consequently, theory in this area is underspecified. In this paper we contribute to theory-building by analysing the effectiveness of a unique EIA system: the Danish system. In this system the competent authority, instead of the project proponent, undertakes EIA reporting. Additionally, the public, rather than experts, play a central role in quality control and the Danish EIA community is relatively small which influences community dynamics in particular ways. A nation-wide survey and expert interviews were undertaken in order to examine the views of actors involved in EIA on the effectiveness of this anomalous system. The empirical data are compared with similar studies on governance mechanisms in other countries, especially the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as with earlier evaluations of EIA effectiveness in Denmark. The results indicate that the more extensive role attributed to the competent authority may lead to higher EIA effectiveness when this aligns with their interests; the influence of the public is amplified by a powerful complaints system; and, the size of the EIA community appears to have no substantial influence on EIA effectiveness. We discuss how the research findings might enhance our theoretical understanding of the operation and effectiveness of governance mechanisms in EIA. - Highlights: • The effectiveness of the unique Danish EIA system is explored. • Results are compared with similar studies in the Netherlands and the UK. • Findings lead to hypotheses that contribute to theorising EIA effectiveness.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2015.12.002","","","","United States","2017-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 62; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 240-249","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)00129-8; TRN: US17R2063036990","10.1016/J.EIAR.2015.12.002","","2018-05-18T00:00:00Z","22687981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22687981","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","62"

Use of agriculturally marginal land avoids the food vs. fuel problems of food price rises and carbon debt that are associated with crop and forestland. Recent remote sensing studies have identified large areas of US marginal land deemed suitable for bioenergy crops. Yet the sustainability benefits of growing bioenergy crops on marginal land only pertain if land is economically available. Scant attention has been paid to the willingness of landowners to supply land for bioenergy crops. Focusing on the northern tier of the Great Lakes, where grassland transitions to forest and land prices are low, this contingent valuation study reports on the willingness of a representative sample of 1124 private, noncorporate landowners to rent land for three bioenergy crops: corn, switchgrass, and poplar. Of the 11% of land that was agriculturally marginal, they were willing to make available no more than 21% for any bioenergy crop (switchgrass preferred on marginal land) at double the prevailing land rental rate in the region. At the same generous rental rate, of the 28% that is cropland, they would rent up to 23% for bioenergy crops (corn preferred), while of the 55% that is forestland, they would rent up to 15% for bioenergy crops (poplar preferred). Regression results identified deterrents to land rental for bioenergy purposes included appreciation of environmental amenities and concern about rental disamenities. In sum, like landowners in the southern Great Lakes region, landowners in the Northern Tier are reluctant to supply marginal land for bioenergy crops. If rental markets existed, they would rent more crop and forestland for bioenergy crops than they would marginal land, which would generate carbon debt and opportunity costs in wood product and food markets.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); US Dept. of Agriculture (USDA); Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI (United States)","","United Kingdom","2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Global Change Biology.

Analysis of whether current technology can scale, in an economically sustainable way, to sufficient levels to meet these targets has not yet been undertaken, nor have tools to perform this analysis been presented. Here, we use bottom-up cost modeling to predict cumulative capacity as a function of technological and economic variables. We find that today's technology falls short in two ways: profits are too small relative to upfront factory costs to grow manufacturing capacity rapidly enough to meet climate targets, and costs are too high to generate enough demand to meet climate targets. We show that decreasing the capital intensity (capex) of PV manufacturing to increase manufacturing capacity and effectively reducing cost (e.g., through higher efficiency) to increase demand are the most effective and least risky ways to address these barriers to scale. We also assess the effects of variations in demand due to hard-to-predict factors, like public policy, on the necessary reductions in cost.Lastly, we review examples of redundant technology pathways for crystalline silicon PV to achieve the necessary innovations in capex, performance, and price.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We use county-level panel data and control for demographic characteristics, solar resources, and pro-environmental preferences. Results show that among financial incentives, rebates have the most impact with an additional $1 per watt rebate increasing annual PV capacity additions by close to 50%. Factors that affect financial returns to solar PV such as electricity price and solar insolation are also found to be significant. Results also point to a significant positive relationship between hybrid vehicle sales and residential PV capacity growth, indicating the importance of pro-environmental preferences as a predictor of solar PV demand. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that the cost of carbon mitigation through rebates is around $184 per ton of CO2.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This methodology embeds two algorithms. The first provides a means of allocating non-home-based trips to residential zones that are the source of such trips, whereas the second provides a mechanism for incorporating the effects of household vehicle fleet composition on fuel consumption. The methodology is applied to the greater Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan region in the United States and is found to offer a robust mechanism for calculating the footprint of household travel energy at the level of the individual TAZ; this mechanism makes possible the study of variations in the energy footprint across space. The travel energy footprint is strongly correlated with the density of the built environment, although socioeconomic differences across TAZs also likely contribute to differences in travel energy footprints. The TAZ-level calculator of the footprint of household travel energy can be used to analyze alternative futures and relate differences in the energy footprint to differences in a number of contributing factors and thus enables the design of urban form, formulation of policy interventions, and implementation of awareness campaigns that may produce more-sustainable patterns of energy consumption.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

From this perspective, we define 'social energy' as a complex sociotechnical system of energy systems, social systems and the derived artificial virtual systems which characterize the intense intersystem and intra-system interactions. The recent advancement in intelligent technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, sensing and communication in Internet of Things technologies, and massive high performance computing and extreme-scale data analytics technologies, enables the possibility of substantial advancement in socio-technical system optimization, scheduling, control and management. In this paper, we provide a discussion on the nature of energy, and then propose the concept and intention of social energy systems for electrical power. A general methodology of establishing and investigating social energy is proposed, which is based on the ACP approach, i.e., 'artificial systems' (A), 'computational experiments' (C) and 'parallel execution' (P), and parallel system methodology. A case study on the University of Denver (DU) campus grid is provided and studied to demonstrate the social energy concept. In the concluding remarks, we discuss the technical pathway, in both social and nature sciences, to social energy, and our vision on its future.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It was assumed that functional class (medium and low) along with other road characteristics (such as weighted average of the annual average daily traffic, average signal density, average access point density, and average speed) were available as correlation factors to estimate the accuracy of probe traffic data. This study tested these factors as predictors of the fidelity of probe traffic data by using the results of an extensive validation exercise. This study showed strong correlations between these geometric attributes and the accuracy of probe data when they were assessed by using average absolute speed error. Linear models were regressed to existing data to estimate appropriate models for medium- and low-type arterial corridors. The proposed models for medium- and low-type arterials were validated further on the basis of the results of a slowdown analysis. These models can be used to predict the accuracy of probe data indirectly in medium and low types of arterial corridors.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These graphical performance measures are revealed through overlay charts and statistical distribution as revealed through cumulative frequency diagrams (CFDs). With overlays of vehicle travel times from multiple days, dominant traffic patterns over a 24-h period are reinforced and reveal the traffic behavior induced primarily by the operation of traffic control at signalized intersections. A cumulative distribution function in the statistical literature provides a method for comparing traffic patterns from various time frames or locations in a compact visual format that provides intuitive feedback on arterial performance. The CFD may be accumulated hourly, by peak periods, or by time periods specific to signal timing plans that are in effect. Combined, overlay charts and CFDs provide visual tools with which to assess the quality and consistency of traffic movement for various periods throughout the day efficiently, without sacrificing detail, which is a typical byproduct of numeric-based performance measures. These methods are particularly effective for comparing before-and-after median travel times, as well as changes in interquartile range, to assess travel time reliability.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The integrated eVoucher program entails demand side management, either in the positive or negative direction, following a popular customer-centric design principle. It provides the extra economic benefit to end-users and reduces the risk associated with the wholesale electricity market for electric distribution companies (EDCs), meanwhile improving the potential resilience of the distribution networks with consideration for frequency deviations. When implemented, the eVoucher program allows typical flexible loads, such as electric vehicle parking lots, to adjust their demand and consumption behavior according to financial incentives from an EDC. A distribution system operator (DSO) works as a third party to hasten negotiations between such parking lots and EDCs, as well as the price clearing process. Eventually, both electricity retailers and power system operators will benefit from the active participation of the flexible loads and energy customers.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","University of Michigan-Dearborn, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Access Journal Volume: 5","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2101-2110","","","EE0005565","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-3536; 7835154","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2659704","","2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","1346439","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1346439","","IEEE Access","","5"

In this paper, we study a security-constrained coal-fired stochastic unit commitment model, which we use to enhance the reliability unit commitment process for day-ahead power system operations. In our approach, we first develop a deterministic equivalent formulation for the problem, which leads to a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. Then, we verify that the turn on/off inequalities provide a convex hull representation of the minimum-up/down time polytope under the stochastic setting. Next, we develop several families of strong valid inequalities mainly through lifting schemes. In particular, by exploring sequence independent lifting and subadditive approximation lifting properties for the lifting schemes, we obtain strong valid inequalities for the ramping and general load balance polytopes. Finally, branch-and-cut algorithms are developed to employ these valid inequalities as cutting planes to solve the problem. As a result, our computational results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Springer","","Sandia National Lab.

To achieve a distribution system self-healing against power outages, emerging technologies and devices, such as remote-controlled switches (RCSs) and smart meters, are being deployed. The higher level of automation is transforming traditional distribution systems into the smart distribution systems (SDSs) of the future. The availability of data and remote control capability in SDSs provides distribution operators with an opportunity to optimize system operation and control. In this paper, the development of SDSs and resulting benefits of enhanced system capabilities are discussed. A comprehensive survey is conducted on the state-of-the-art applications of RCSs and smart meters in SDSs. Specifically, a new method, called Temporal Causal Diagram (TCD), is used to incorporate outage notifications from smart meters for enhanced outage management. To fully utilize the fast operation of RCSs, the spanning tree search algorithm is used to develop service restoration strategies. Optimal placement of RCSs and the resulting enhancement of system reliability are discussed. Distribution system resilience with respect to extreme events is presented. Furthermore, test cases are used to demonstrate the benefit of SDSs. Active management of distributed generators (DGs) is introduced. Future research in a smart distribution environment is proposed.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

C.; Zhang, Liwei","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; role of chemistry; mechanics; transport; well integrity in CO2 storage environments; reactive transport; mechanical deformation; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; well integrity","Among the various risks associated with CO<sub>2</sub> storage in deep geologic formations, wells are important potential pathways for fluid leaks and groundwater contamination. Injection of CO<sub>2</sub> will perturb the storage reservoir and any wells that penetrate the CO<sub>2</sub> or pressure footprints are potential pathways for leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> and/or reservoir brine. Well leakage is of particular concern for regions with a long history of oil and gas exploration because they are top candidates for geologic CO<sub>2</sub>storage sites. This review explores in detail the ability of wells to retain their integrity against leakage with careful examination of the coupled physical and chemical processes involved. Understanding time-dependent leakage is complicated by the changes in fluid flow, solute transport, chemical reactions, and mechanical stresses over decade or longer time frames for site operations and monitoring. Almost all studies of the potential for well leakage have been laboratory based, as there are limited data on field-scale leakage. When leakage occurs by diffusion only, laboratory experiments show that while CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated brine react with cement and casing, the rate of degradation is transport-limited and alteration of cement and casing properties is low. When a leakage path is already present due to cement shrinkage or fracturing, gaps along interfaces (e.g. casing/cement or cement/rock), or casing failures, chemical and mechanical alteration have the potential to decrease or increase leakage risks. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have shown that mineral precipitation or closure of strain-induced fractures can seal a leak pathway over time or conversely open pathways depending on flow-rate, chemistry, and the stress state. Experiments with steel/cement and cement/rock interfaces have indicated that protective mechanisms such as metal passivation, chemical alteration, mechanical deformation, and pore clogging can also help mitigate leakage. The specific rate and nature of alteration depends on the cement, brine, and injected fluid compositions. For example, the presence of co-injected gases (e.g. O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and SO<sub>2</sub>) and pozzolan amendments (fly ash) to cement influences the rate and the nature of cement reactions. A more complete understanding of the coupled physical-chemical mechanisms involved with sealing and opening of leakage pathways is needed. An important challenge is to take empirically based chemical, mechanical, and transport models reviewed here and assess leakage risk for carbon storage at the field scale. Furthermore, field observations to accompany laboratory and modeling studies are critical to validating understanding of leakage risk. Long-term risk at the field scale is an area of active research made difficult by the large variability of material types (cement, geologic material, casing), field conditions (pressure, temperature, gradient in potential, residence time), and leaking fluid composition (CO<sub>2</sub>, co-injected gases, brine). Of particular interest are the circumstances when sealing and other protective mechanisms are likely to be effective, when they are likely to fail, and the zone of uncertainty between these two extremes.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Trustworthy savings calculations are critical to convincing investors in energy efficiency projects of the benefit and cost-effectiveness of such investments and their ability to replace or defer supply-side capital investments. However, today's methods for measurement and verification (M & V) of energy savings constitute a significant portion of the total costs of efficiency projects. They also require time-consuming manual data acquisition and often do not deliver results until years after the program period has ended. The rising availability of ""smart"" meters, combined with new analytical approaches to quantifying savings, has opened the door to conducting M & V more quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy. These meter- and software-based approaches, increasingly referred to as ""M & V 2.0"", are the subject of surging industry interest, particularly in the context of utility energy efficiency programs. Program administrators, evaluators, and regulators are asking how M & V 2.0 compares with more traditional methods, how proprietary software can be transparently performance tested, how these techniques can be integrated into the next generation of whole-building focused efficiency programs.This paper expands recent analyses of public-domain whole-building M & V methods, focusing on more novel M & V 2.0 modeling approaches that are used in commercial technologies, as well as approaches that are documented in the literature, and/or developed by the academic building research community. We present a testing procedure and metrics to assess the performance of whole-building M & V methods. We then illustrate the test procedure by evaluating the accuracy of ten baseline energy use models, against measured data from a large dataset of 537 buildings. The results of this study show that the already available advanced interval data baseline models hold great promise for scaling the adoption of building measured savings calculations using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data. Median coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error (CV(RMSE)) was less than 25% for every model tested when twelve months of training data were used. With even six months of training data, median CV(RMSE) for daily energy total was under 25% for all models tested. These findings can be used to build confidence in model robustness, and the readiness of these approaches for industry uptake and adoption.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this paper, we investigate the future trajectory of AFOLU GHG emissions in Latin America, with and without efforts to mitigate, using a multi-model comparison approach. We find significant uncertainty in future emissions with and without climate policy. This uncertainty is due to differences in a variety of assumptions including (1) the role of bioenergy, (2) where and how bioenergy is produced, (3) the availability of afforestation options in climate mitigation policy, and (4) N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions intensity.

"Emissions reduction scenarios in the Argentinean Energy Sector","Di Sbroiavacca, Nicolás; Nadal, Gustavo; Lallana, Francisco; Falzon, James; Calvin, Katherine","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Argentina; energy sector; mitigation measures; CO₂ control policies","Here in this paper the LEAP, TIAM-ECN, and GCAM models were applied to evaluate the impact of a variety of climate change control policies (including carbon pricing and emission constraints relative to a base year) on primary energy consumption, final energy consumption, electricity sector development, and CO<sub>2</sub> emission savings of the energy sector in Argentina over the 2010-2050 period. The LEAP model results indicate that if Argentina fully implements the most feasible mitigation measures currently under consideration by official bodies and key academic institutions on energy supply and demand, such as the ProBiomass program, a cumulative incremental economic cost of 22.8 billion US$(2005) to 2050 is expected, resulting in a 16% reduction in GHG emissions compared to a business-as-usual scenario. These measures also bring economic co-benefits, such as a reduction of energy imports improving the balance of trade. A Low CO<sub>2</sub> price scenario in LEAP results in the replacement of coal by nuclear and wind energy in electricity expansion. A High CO<sub>2</sub> price leverages additional investments in hydropower. An emission cap scenario (2050 emissions 20% lower than 2010 emissions) is feasible by including such measures as CCS and Bio CCS, but at a significant cost. By way of cross-model comparison with the TIAM-ECN and GCAM global integrated assessment models, significant variation in projected emissions reductions in the carbon price scenarios was observed, which illustrates the inherent uncertainties associated with such long-term projections. These models predict approximately 37% and 94% reductions under the High CO<sub>2</sub> price scenario, respectively. By comparison, the LEAP model, using an approach based on the assessment of a limited set of mitigation options, predicts a 11.3% reduction under the ‘high’ carbon tax. The main reasons for this difference are differences in assumptions about technology cost and availability, CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity, and the ability to import bioenergy. In terms of technology pathways, the models agree that fossil fuels, in particular natural gas, will remain an important part of the electricity mix in the core baseline scenario. Finally, according to the models there is agreement that the introduction of a carbon price will lead to a decline in absolute and relative shares of aggregate fossil fuel generation. However, predictions vary as to the extent to which coal, nuclear and renewable energy play a role.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we compare optical, electrical, and morphological properties of P3HT films doped with F4TCNQ, both from mixed solutions and using sequential solution processing with orthogonal solvents. We demonstrate that sequential doping occurs rapidly (<1 s), and that the film doping level can be precisely controlled by varying the concentration of the doping solution. Furthermore, the choice of sequential doping solvent controls whether dopant anions are included or excluded from polymer crystallites. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that sequential doping produces significantly more uniform films on the nanoscale than the mixed-solution method. In addition, we show that mixed-solution doping induces the formation of aggregates even at low doping levels, resulting in drastic changes to film morphology. Sequentially coated films show 3–15 times higher conductivities at a given doping level than solution-doped films, with sequentially doped films processed to exclude dopant anions from polymer crystallites showing the highest conductivities. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism for doping induced aggregation in which the shift of the polymer HOMO level upon aggregation couples ionization and solvation energies. To show that the methodology is widely applicable, we demonstrate that several different polymer:dopant systems can be prepared by sequential doping.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Incorporating bioenergy into sustainable landscape designs","Dale, Virginia H.; Kline, Keith L.; Buford, Marilyn A.; Volk, Timothy A.; Tattersall Smith, C.; Stupak, Inge","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Adaptive management; Biofuel; Planning; Resource management; Scale; Stakeholder","In this paper, we describe an approach to landscape design that focuses on integrating bioenergy production with other components of environmental, social and economic systems. Landscape design as used here refers to a spatially explicit, collaborative plan for management of landscapes and supply chains. Landscape design can involve multiple scales and build on existing practices to reduce costs or enhance services. Appropriately applied to a specific context, landscape design can help people assess trade-offs when making choices about locations, types of feedstock, transport, refining and distribution of bioenergy products and services. The approach includes performance monitoring and reporting along the bioenergy supply chain. Examples of landscape design applied to bioenergy production systems are presented. Barriers to implementation of landscape design include high costs, the need to consider diverse land-management objectives from a wide array of stakeholders, up-front planning requirements, and the complexity and level of effort needed for successful stakeholder involvement. A landscape design process may be stymied by insufficient data or participation. An impetus for coordination is critical, and incentives may be required to engage landowners and the private sector. In conclusion, devising and implementing landscape designs for more sustainable outcomes require clear communication of environmental, social, and economic opportunities and concerns.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"China’s rare earth supply chain: Illegal production, and response to new cerium demand","Nguyen, Ruby Thuy; Imholte, D. Devin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; China’s supply chain; rare earth; illegal production; system dynamics; simulation model","As the demand for personal electronic devices, wind turbines, and electric vehicles increases, the world becomes more dependent on rare earth elements. Given the volatile, Chinese-concentrated supply chain, global attempts have been made to diversify supply of these materials. However, the overall effect of supply diversification on the entire supply chain, including increasing low-value rare earth demand, is not fully understood. This paper is the first attempt to shed some light on China’s supply chain from both demand and supply perspectives, taking into account different Chinese policies such as mining quotas, separation quotas, export quotas, and resource taxes. We constructed a simulation model using Powersim Studio that analyzes production (both legal and illegal), production costs, Chinese and rest-of-world demand, and market dynamics. We also simulated new demand of an automotive aluminum-cerium alloy in the U.S. market starting from 2018. Results showed that market share of the illegal sector has grown since 2007 to 2015, ranging between 22% and 25% of China’s rare earth supply, translating into 59–65% illegal heavy rare earths and 14–16% illegal light rare earths. There would be a shortage in certain light and heavy rare earths given three production quota scenarios and constant demand growth rate from 2015 to 2030. The new simulated Ce demand would require supply beyond that produced in China. Lastly, we illustrated revenue streams for different ore compositions in China in 2015.","Springer","","Idaho National Lab.

Traditional building power profiles are changing. Currently, there is an increased use of energy-efficient building materials and designs, which decreases building loads. In addition, there is an increased adoption of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV), which leads to bidirectional power flow and significant power ramps as PV output decreases in the late afternoon. Building power profiles are likely to change even more as residential energy storage products proliferate. Therefore, a better understanding of residential electricity demand is key to addressing the envisioned transition of the electric power system from its traditional structure to one that is transactive.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level formulation, in which the upper level determines the optimal selection of logistics infrastructure investments and subsidies for green transport modes such that the benefit-cost ratio of the entire logistics system is maximized. The lower level describes the selected service routes of logistics users. A genetic and Frank-Wolfe hybrid algorithm is introduced to solve the proposed model. The proposed model is applied to the regional logistics network of Changsha City, China. Findings show that using the joint scheme of the selection of logistics infrastructure investments and green subsidies is more effective than using them solely. In conclusion, carbon emission reduction targets can significantly affect logistics infrastructure investments and subsidy levels.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Choices made today will likely be choices that impact the next 20 or perhaps even 40 years. For example, we can expect the best LED lighting available today to maintain 90% of initial light output for 100,000 hours or more. Compare this to a fluorescent lighting system that needs regular maintenance after only 30,000 hours due to lamp burn-outs. The simple act of choosing a LED system over a fluorescent one alone can begin to reduce life cycle costs by saving future maintenance costs. However, the choice of LED over fluorescent is just the beginning. Here, let’s look at other future-proofing decisions that should be considered when choosing your next lighting system.","PennWell Corp.","","RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: LEDs Magazine; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 9; Related Information: http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-13/issue-9/features/tunable-lighting/future-proof-tunable-white-lighting-is-a-smart-choice-for-classrooms.html","","Medium: ED; Size: 4 p.","","","EE0005124","Journal ID: ISSN 2156-633X","","","2017-08-03T00:00:00Z","1363915","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1363915","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1363915","LEDs Magazine","9","13"

The RWGTM passes electricity-sector natural gas prices to the ReEDS model, while the ReEDS model returns electricity-sector natural gas demand to the RWGTM. The two models successfully converge to a solution under reference scenario conditions. We present electricity-sector and natural gas sector evolution using the integrated models for this reference scenario. This paper demonstrates that the integrated models produced similar national-level results as when running in a stand-alone form, but that regional and state-level results can vary considerably. As we highlight, these regional differences have potentially significant implications for electric sector planners especially in the wake of substantive policy changes for the sector (e.g., the Clean Power Plan).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We also find significant relationships between the average number of minutes of power interruptions experienced and above average wind speeds, precipitation, cooling degree-days, and one strategy used to mitigate the impacts of severe weather: the amount of underground transmission and distribution line miles. Perhaps most importantly, we find a significant time trend of increasing annual average number of minutes of power interruptions over time—especially when interruptions associated with extreme weather are included.

Humans withdraw, use, and consume water and return waste water to the environment for a variety of socioeconomic purposes, including domestic, commercial, and industrial use, production of energy resources and cooling thermal-electric power plants, and growing food, fiber, and chemical feed stocks for human consumption. Uncertainties in the future human demand for water interact with future impacts of climatic change on water supplies to impinge on water management decisions at the international, national, regional, and local level, but until recently tools were not available to assess the uncertainties surrounding these decisions. This paper demonstrates the use of a multi-model framework in a structured sensitivity analysis to project and quantify the sensitivity of future deficits in surface water in the context of climate and socioeconomic change for all U.S. states and sub-basins. The framework treats all sources of water demand and supply consistently from the world to local level.

"Can developing countries leapfrog the centralized electrification paradigm?","Levin, Todd; Thomas, Valerie M.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Decentralized electrification; Global energy access; Grid extension; International energy development; Solar home system","Due to the rapidly decreasing costs of small renewable electricity generation systems, centralized power systems are no longer a necessary condition of universal access to modern energy services. Developing countries, where centralized electricity infrastructures are less developed, may be able to adopt these new technologies more quickly. We first review the costs of grid extension and distributed solar home systems (SHSs) as reported by a number of different studies. We then present a general analytic framework for analyzing the choice between extending the grid and implementing distributed solar home systems. Drawing upon reported grid expansion cost data for three specific regions, we demonstrate this framework by determining the electricity consumption levels at which the costs of provision through centralized and decentralized approaches are equivalent in these regions. We then calculate SHS capital costs that are necessary for these technologies provide each of five tiers of energy access, as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Our results suggest that solar home systems can play an important role in achieving universal access to basic energy services. The extent of this role depends on three primary factors: SHS costs, grid expansion costs, and centralized generation costs. Given current technology costs, centralized systems will still be required to enable higher levels of consumption; however, cost reduction trends have the potential to disrupt this paradigm. Furthermore, by looking ahead rather than replicating older infrastructure styles, developing countries can leapfrog to a more distributed electricity service model.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Results from these models provide useful insights in terms of the transformations in the energy system required, including efficiency improvements in cars, trucks, and buildings, electrification of end-uses, low- or zero-carbon electricity and fuels, aggressive adoptions of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), demand reduction, and large reductions of non-energy GHG emissions. Some of these studies also suggest that the direct economic costs can be fairly modest or even generate net savings, while the indirect macroeconomic benefits are large, as shifts in employment and capital investments could have higher economic returns than conventional energy expenditures. These models, however, often assume perfect markets, perfect competition, and zero transaction costs. They also do not provide specific policy guidance on how these transformative changes can be achieved. Greater emphasis on modeling uncertainty, consumer behaviors, heterogeneity of impacts, and spatial modeling would further enhance policymakers' ability to design more effective and targeted policies. Here, this paper presents an example of how policymakers, energy system modelers and stakeholders interact and work together to develop and evaluate long-term state climate policy targets. Lastly, even though this paper focuses on California, the process of dialogue and interactions, modeling results, and lessons learned can be generally adopted across different regions and scales.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Initially, the Au atoms derived from the reduction of Au<sup>3+</sup> by AA are conformally deposited on the entire surface of a Ag cuboctahedron. Upon the formation of a complete Au shell, however, the subsequently formed Au atoms are preferentially deposited onto the Au{100} facets, resulting in the formation of a Ag@Au cuboctahedron with concave structures at the sites of {111} facets. The concave cuboctahedra embrace excellent SERS activity that is more than 70-fold stronger than that of the original Ag cuboctahedra at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. The concave cuboctahedra also exhibit remarkable stability in the presence of an oxidant such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> because of the protection by a complete Au shell. These two unique attributes enable <i>in-situ</i> SERS monitoring of the reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP) to 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) by NaBH4 through a 4,4'-dimercaptoazobenzene (<i>trans</i>-DMAB) intermediate and the subsequent oxidation of 4-ATP back to <i>trans</i>-DMAB upon the introduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.","American Chemical Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Reducing black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles in Russia: An assessment and policy recommendations","Kholod, Nazar; Evans, Meredydd","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Black carbon; Diesel; Transport; Russia","This article assesses options and challenges of reducing black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles in Russia. Black carbon is a product of incomplete diesel combustion and is a component of fine particulate matter. Particulate matter emissions have adverse health impacts, causing cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer; black carbon is also a large climate forcer. Black carbon emissions from Russian diesel sources affect not only the Russian territory but also contribute to overall pollution. Here, this paper analyzes current ecological standards for vehicles and fuel, evaluates policies for emission reductions from existing diesel vehicle fleet, and assesses Russia’s attempts to encourage the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. Based on best practices of black carbon emission reductions, this paper provides a number of policy recommendations for Russia.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Wind power forecasts have been used operatively for over 20 years. Despite this fact, there are still several possibilities to improve the forecasts, both from the weather prediction side and from the usage of the forecasts. The new International Energy Agency (IEA) Task on Forecasting for Wind Energy tries to organise international collaboration, among national meteorological centres with an interest and/or large projects on wind forecast improvements (NOAA, DWD, MetOffice, met.no, DMI,...), operational forecaster and forecast users. The Task is divided in three work packages: Firstly, a collaboration on the improvement of the scientific basis for the wind predictions themselves. This includes numerical weather prediction model physics, but also widely distributed information on accessible datasets. Secondly, we will be aiming at an international pre-standard (an IEA Recommended Practice) on benchmarking and comparing wind power forecasts, including probabilistic forecasts. This WP will also organise benchmarks, in cooperation with the IEA Task WakeBench. Thirdly, we will be engaging end users aiming at dissemination of the best practice in the usage of wind power predictions. As first results, an overview of current issues for research in short-term forecasting of wind power is presented.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The use of gas-fired generators for peak load and reserve provision causes high intraday variability in withdrawals from high-pressure gas transmission systems. Such variability can lead to gas price fluctuations and supply disruptions that affect electric generator dispatch, electricity prices, and threaten the security of power systems and gas pipelines. These infrastructures function on vastly different spatio-temporal scales, which prevents current practices for separate operations and market clearing from being coordinated. Here in this article, we apply new techniques for control of dynamic gas flows on pipeline networks to examine day-ahead scheduling of electric generator dispatch and gas compressor operation for different levels of integration, spanning from separate forecasting, and simulation to combined optimal control. We formulate multiple coordination scenarios and develop tractable physically accurate computational implementations. These scenarios are compared using an integrated model of test networks for power and gas systems with 24 nodes and 24 pipes, respectively, which are coupled through gas-fired generators. The analysis quantifies the economic efficiency and security benefits of gas-electric coordination and dynamic gas system operation.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Quantifying the value of investing in distributed natural gas and renewable electricity systems as complements: Applications of discounted cash flow and real options analysis with stochastic inputs","Pless, Jacquelyn; Arent, Douglas J.; Logan, Jeffrey; Cochran, Jaquelin; Zinaman, Owen","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; real options; project valuation; energy sector; renewable electricity; natural gas","One energy policy objective in the United States is to promote the adoption of technologies that provide consumers with stable, secure, and clean energy. Recent work provides anecdotal evidence of natural gas (NG) and renewable electricity (RE) synergies in the power sector, however few studies quantify the value of investing in NG and RE systems together as complements. This paper uses discounted cash flow analysis and real options analysis to value hybrid NG-RE systems in distributed applications, focusing on residential and commercial projects assumed to be located in the states of New York and Texas. Technology performance and operational risk profiles are modeled at the hourly level to capture variable RE output and NG prices are modeled stochastically as geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes to capture NG price uncertainty. The findings consistently suggest that NG-RE hybrid distributed systems are more favorable investments in the applications studied relative to their single-technology alternatives when incentives for renewables are available. In some cases, NG-only systems are the favorable investments. Understanding the value of investing in NG-RE hybrid systems provides insights into one avenue towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, given the important role of NG and RE in the power sector.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Building energy information systems: Synthesis of costs, savings, and best-practice uses","Granderson, Jessica; Lin, Guanjing","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; energy efficiency; energy information systems; commercial buildings; costs and savings; best practices","Building energy information systems (EIS) are a powerful customer-facing monitoring and analytical technology that can enable up to 20 % site energy savings for buildings. Few technologies are as heavily marketed, but in spite of their potential, EIS remain an underadopted emerging technology. One reason is the lack of information on purchase costs and associated energy savings. While insightful, the growing body of individual case studies has not provided industry the information needed to establish the business case for investment. Vastly different energy and economic metrics prevent generalizable conclusions. This paper addresses three common questions concerning EIS use: what are the costs, what have users saved, and which best practices drive deeper savings? We present a large-scale assessment of the value proposition for EIS use based on data from over two-dozen organizations. Participants achieved year-over-year median site and portfolio savings of 17 and 8 %, respectively; they reported that this performance would not have been possible without the EIS. The median 5-year cost of EIS software ownership (up-front and ongoing costs) was calculated to be $1800 per monitoring point (kilowatt meter points were most common), with a median portfolio-wide implementation size of approximately 200 points. In this paper, we present an analysis of the relationship between key implementation factors and achieved energy reductions. Extent of efficiency projects, building energy performance prior to EIS installation, depth of metering, and duration of EIS were strongly correlated with greater savings. We also identify the best practices use of EIS associated with greater energy savings.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Applied to the battery cathode material Li<sub>X</sub>FePO<sub>4</sub> as an example, the theoretical analysis reveals that small, defect-induced deviations from an ideal interface can lead to dramatic shifts in the orientations of phase boundaries between Li-rich and Li-lean phases, stabilizing otherwise unfavorable orientations. Significantly, this stabilization arises predominantly from configurational entropic factors associated with the presence of the interfacial defects rather than from absolute energetic considerations. The specific entropic factors pertain to the diversity of defect configurations and their contributions to rotational/orientational rigidity of phase boundaries. Comparison of the predictions with experimental observations indicates that the additional entropy contributions indeed play a dominant role under actual cycling conditions, leading to the conclusion that interfacial defects must be considered when analyzing the stability and evolution kinetics of the internal phase microstructure of strongly phase-separating systems. Possible implications for tuning the kinetics of (de)lithiation based on selective defect incorporation are discussed. Ultimately, this understanding can be generalized to the chemomechanics of other defective solid phase boundaries.","Wiley","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Dispatchability Maximization for Co-Optimized Energy and Reserve Dispatch With Explicit Reliability Guarantee","Wei, Wei; Wang, Jianhui; Mei, Shengwei","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Affine policy; convex optimization; dispatchability; energy and reserve dispatch; uncertainty; wind generation","In this paper, we consider dispatchability as the set of all admissible nodal wind power injections that will not cause infeasibility in real-time dispatch (RTD). Our work reveals that the dispatchability of the affine policy based RTD (AF-RTD) is a polytope whose coefficients are linear functions of the generation schedule and the gain matrix of affine policy. Two mathematical formulations of the dispatchability maximized energy and reserve dispatch (DM-ERD) are proposed. The first one maximizes the distance from the forecast to the boundaries of the dispatchability polytope subject to the available production cost or reserve cost. Provided the forecast value and variance of wind power, the generalized Gauss inequality (GGI) is adopted to evaluate the probability of infeasible RTD without the exact probability distribution of wind power. Combining the first formulation and the GGI approach, the second one minimizes the total cost subject to a desired reliability level through dispatchability maximization. Efficient convex optimization based algorithms are developed to solve these two models. Different from the conventional robust optimization method, our model does not rely on the specific uncertainty set of wind generation and directly optimizes the uncertainty accommodation capability of the power system. The proposed method is also compared with the affine policy based robust energy and reserve dispatch (AR-ERD). Case studies on the PJM 5-bus system illustrate the proposed concept and method. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the applicability of our method on moderate sized systems and its scalability to large dimensional uncertainty.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

For him, the saying encapsulated the idea that a good treaty would require rigorous inspections, to insure that neither side was dragging its feet or, worse, disposing of decoy bombs, rather than real ones. But how should the process of verification work? If a U.S. scientist were allowed to dismantle a Russian warhead personally, he or she could identify it as legitimate fairly easily, even if it differed in design from American models. But, in doing so, the scientist would necessarily learn many classified details about the weapon, something that the Russians would never consent to.

Among the available options, solar energy is one of the promising targets because of the high abundance of solar photons over much of the globe. Similarly, decarbonization of the global energy supply will require clean sources of hydrogen to use as reducing equivalents for fuel and chemical feedstocks.

Attention should be drawn to the possible shift in environmental impact between various life cycle stages, e.g., raw material production, asphalt production, or waste treatment. Life cycle assessment is necessary to adequately assess the environmental impact of these approaches over the entire service life of the bituminous pavement. The three approaches and their implementation in the road sector in Flanders (region in Belgium) are described and the main findings from life cycle assessment studies on these subjects are discussed. It was found from the review that using reclaimed asphalt pavement in new bituminous mixtures might yield significant environmental gains. The environmental impact of the application of warm mix asphalt technologies, on the other hand, depends on the technique used. - Highlights: • Recycling, lower production temperature and durability of asphalt are investigated. • The use of RAP in new asphalt mixtures yields significant environmental advantages. • It would be beneficial to allow RAP in asphalt mixtures for wearing courses. • The use of particular additives might counteract the environmental gain from WMA. • The service life and the environmental data source influence the LCA results.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.04.005","","","","United States","2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 60; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 139-147","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)30037-8; TRN: US16R4806033751","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.04.005","","2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","22589263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22589263","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","60"
"Bidding strategy for microgrid in day-ahead market based on hybrid stochastic/robust optimization","Liu, Guodong; Xu, Yan; Tomsovic, Kevin","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Microgrid; stochastic optimization; robust optimization; uncertainty; market bidding strategy; Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)","In this paper, we propose an optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead market of a microgrid consisting of intermittent distributed generation (DG), storage, dispatchable DG and price responsive loads. The microgrid coordinates the energy consumption or production of its components and trades electricity in both the day-ahead and real-time markets to minimize its operating cost as a single entity. The bidding problem is challenging due to a variety of uncertainties, including power output of intermittent DG, load variation, day-ahead and real-time market prices. A hybrid stochastic/robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the expected net cost, i.e., expected total cost of operation minus total benefit of demand. This formulation can be solved by mixed integer linear programming. The uncertain output of intermittent DG and day-ahead market price are modeled via scenarios based on forecast results, while a robust optimization is proposed to limit the unbalanced power in real-time market taking account of the uncertainty of real-time market price. Numerical simulations on a microgrid consisting of a wind turbine, a PV panel, a fuel cell, a micro-turbine, a diesel generator, a battery and a responsive load show the advantage of stochastic optimization in addition to robust optimization.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Photovoltaic frequency–watt curve design for frequency regulation and fast contingency reserves","Johnson, Jay; Neely, Jason C.; Delhotal, Jarod J.; Lave, Matthew","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","When renewable energy resources are installed in electricity grids, they typically increase generation variability and displace thermal generator control action and inertia. Grid operators combat these emerging challenges with advanced distributed energy resource (DER) functions to support frequency and provide voltage regulation and protection mechanisms. This paper focuses on providing frequency reserves using autonomous IEC TR 61850-90-7 pointwise frequency-watt (FW) functions that adjust DER active power as a function of measured grid frequency. The importance of incorporating FW functions into a fleet of photovoltaic (PV) systems is demonstrated in simulation. Effects of FW curve design, including curtailment, deadband, and droop, were analyzed against performance metrics using Latin hypercube sampling for 20%, 70%, and 120% PV penetration scenarios on the Hawaiian island of Lanai. Finally, to understand the financial implications of FW functions to utilities, a performance function was defined based on monetary costs attributable to curtailed PV production, load shedding, and generator wear. An optimization wrapper was then created to find the best FW function curve for each penetration level. Lastly, it was found that in all cases, the utility would save money by implementing appropriate FW functions.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

We present the first U. S. national-level assessment of state RPS program benefits and impacts, focusing on new renewable electricity resources used to meet RPS compliance obligations in 2013. In our central-case scenario, reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions from displaced fossil fuel-generated electricity resulted in $2.2 billion of global benefits. Health and environmental benefits from reductions in criteria air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter 2.5) were even greater, estimated at $5.2 billion in the central case. Further benefits accrued in the form of reductions in water withdrawals and consumption for power generation. Finally, although best considered resource transfers rather than net societal benefits, new renewable electricity generation used for RPS compliance in 2013 also supported nearly 200,000 U. S.-based gross jobs and reduced wholesale electricity prices and natural gas prices, saving consumers a combined $1.3-$4.9 billion. In total, the estimated benefits and impacts well-exceed previous estimates of RPS compliance costs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents a mathematical model for the optimal energy management of a residential building and proposes a centralized energy management system (CEMS) framework for off-grid operation. The model of each component of the hub is integrated within the CEMS. The optimal decisions are determined in real-time by considering these models with realistic parameter settings and customer preferences. Model predictive control (MPC) is used to adapt the optimal decisions on a receding horizon to account for the deviations in the system inputs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed CEMS framework. Results show that the proposed CEMS can reduce the energy cost and energy consumption of the customers by approximately 17% and 8%, respectively, over a day. In conclusion, using the proposed CEMS, the total charging cycles of the ESS were reduced by more than 50% in a day.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, to truly measure the improvements that any new solar forecasting methods provide, it is important to develop a methodology for determining baseline and target values for the accuracy of solar forecasting at different spatial and temporal scales. This paper aims at developing a framework to derive baseline and target values for a suite of generally applicable, value-based, and custom-designed solar forecasting metrics. The work was informed by close collaboration with utility and independent system operator partners. The baseline values are established based on state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models and persistence models in combination with a radiative transfer model. The target values are determined based on the reduction in the amount of reserves that must be held to accommodate the uncertainty of PV power output. The proposed reserve-based methodology is a reasonable and practical approach that can be used to assess the economic benefits gained from improvements in accuracy of solar forecasting. Lastly, the financial baseline and targets can be translated back to forecasting accuracy metrics and requirements, which will guide research on solar forecasting improvements toward the areas that are most beneficial to power systems operations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","Despite their centrality to life on Earth, we know little about how microbes interact with each other, their hosts, or their environment. Although DNA sequencing technologies have enabled a new view of the ubiquity and diversity of microorganisms, this has mainly yielded snapshots that shed limited light on microbial functions or community dynamics. Given that nearly every habitat and organism hosts a diverse constellation of microorganisms—its “microbiome”—such knowledge could transform our understanding of the world and launch innovations in agriculture, energy, health, the environment, and more (see the photo). Here, we propose an interdisciplinary Unified Microbiome Initiative (UMI) to discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems. The impacts of oceans and soil microbes on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> are critical for understanding climate change. By manipulating interactions at the root-soil-microbe interface, we may reduce agricultural pesticide, fertilizer, and water use enrich marginal land and rehabilitate degraded soils. Microbes can degrade plant cell walls (for biofuels), and synthesize myriad small molecules for new bioproducts, including antibiotics. Restoring normal human microbial ecosystems can save lives [e.g., fecal microbiome transplantation for <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infections]. Rational management of microbial communities in and around us has implications for asthma, diabetes, obesity, infectious diseases, psychiatric illnesses, and other afflictions. The human microbiome is a target and a source for new drugs and an essential tool for precision medicine. The National Science Foundation's Microbial Observatories, the U.S. Department of Energy's Genomic Sciences program, the National Institutes of Health's Human Microbiome Project, and other efforts in the United States and abroad have served as critical first steps in revealing the diversity of microbes and their communities. However, we lack many tools required to advance beyond descriptive approaches to studies that enable a mechanistic, predictive, and actionable understanding of global microbiome processes. Developing these tools requires new collaborations between physical, life, and biomedical sciences; engineering; and other disciplines.","AAAS","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Customer economics of residential photovoltaic systems: Sensitivities to changes in wholesale market design and rate structures","Darghouth, Naïm R.; Wiser, Ryan H.; Barbose, Galen","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; photovoltaics; net metering; electricity rate design","We report that the customer economics of U.S. residential photovoltaics (PV) often depend on retail electricity rates, because most utilities compensate customer-sited PV generation via net metering. The future bill savings from net metering are uncertain and dependent on retail rate structures, wholesale market design, and renewable penetration levels, among other factors. We explore the impact of the following assumptions on the bill savings from residential PV: a wholesale electricity market design with a price cap (as opposed to an energy-only market); a retail rate with a fixed customer charge (as opposed to a fully volumetric rate); and increasing-block pricing (as opposed to a non-varying flat rate). A wholesale price cap can dampen the expected bill-savings erosion due to moving from a low to a high renewables scenario for customers with time-varying rates and net metering. Moving from a fully volumetric rate to a two-part tariff rate with a fixed customer charge could severely Erode the bill savings under net metering, because PV generation could only displace the (reduced) volumetric portion of the rate. Lastly, increasing-block pricing might have an even greater impact on the bill savings from behind-the-meter PV than the other uncertainties explored in this paper.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We call the approach the Permafrost Carbon Network Incubation-Panarctic Thermal scaling approach (PInc-PanTher). The approach assumes that C stocks do not decompose at all when frozen, but once thawed follow set decomposition trajectories as a function of soil temperature. The trajectories are determined according to a three-pool decomposition model fitted to incubation data using parameters specific to soil horizon types. We calculate litterfall C inputs required to maintain steady-state C balance for the current climate, and hold those inputs constant. Soil temperatures are taken from the soil thermal modules of ecosystem model simulations forced by a common set of future climate change anomalies under two warming scenarios over the period 2010 to 2100. Under a medium warming scenario (RCP4.5), the approach projects permafrost soil C losses of 12.2-33.4 Pg C; under a high warming scenario (RCP8.5), the approach projects C losses of 27.9-112.6 Pg C. Projected C losses are roughly linearly proportional to global temperature changes across the two scenarios. These results indicate a global sensitivity of frozen soil C to climate change (γ sensitivity) of -14 to -19 PgC°C -1 on a 100 year time scale. For CH 4 emissions, our approach assumes a fixed saturated area and that increases in CH 4 emissions are related to increased heterotrophic respiration in anoxic soil, yielding CH 4 emission increases of 7% and 35% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, which add an additional greenhouse gas forcing of approximately 10-18%. The simplified approach presented here neglects many important processes that may amplify or mitigate C release from permafrost soils, but serves as a data-constrained estimate on the forced, large-scale permafrost C response to warming.","The Royal Society Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The Economic and Societal Impact of Baseload Power Generation on Local Communities","Carless, Travis S.; Fischbeck, Paul S.; Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 (United States)]","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; ACID RAIN; AIR POLLUTION; COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS; ELECTRICITY; EXTERNAL COST; GREENHOUSE EFFECT; GREENHOUSE GASES; NATURAL GAS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; POWER GENERATION; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; REACTOR SAFETY; SMOG; SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS","In the United States (US), energy from coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants produced approximately 3,500 TWh of electricity and accounted for 85% of total net generation in 2015. In 2015, coal and natural gas power plants each contributed about 33% of all generation in the US. generation II nuclear power plants represents about 20% of all electricity produced in the US and 62.4% of emission-free electricity in 2015. As a byproduct of electricity, combustion fossil fuel plants release hazardous emissions such as CO{sub 2}, N{sub 2}O, NOx and SO{sub 2}. CO{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}, and N{sub 2}O. Many of these emissions are major greenhouse gases (GHG) that have been linked to contributing to global climate change. The release of NOx and SO{sub 2} have a negative impact on human health and contribute to smog and acid rain. As a result, communities are often subjected to negative externalities such as pollution, noise, undesirable visuals, and safety concerns when sited near power plants. Though nuclear power plants do not produce any air emissions, there are concerns of nuclear waste, radiation leaks into the environment, and Fukushima-level accidents. With electricity generation, there are economic, safety, and environmental tradeoffs between the three technologies. These factors can contribute to negative and positive externalities for communities that are sited near baseload power plants. Davis (2010) using the hedonic price method found that communities living within 2 miles of power plants experience a 3-7% decrease in housing values. There is further evidence that those that live even closer experience larger decreases. While several studies focus on hedonic price methods and health effects, none have investigated and compared the socioeconomic indicators of communities near baseload power plants. The goal of this work is to investigate and examine relationship between societal and economic community indicators with respect to distance and generation technology. From a cost benefit standpoint an argument can be made based on the externalities from these power plants. Positive externalities that improve median incomes and home values could mean added tax revenue for local municipalities and governments. Typically, comparisons between generating technologies are made using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and life cycle GHG emissions, however the impacts on local communities can also be used as a metric when comparing technologies.

"Assessing Government and Industry Roles to Accelerate Commercialization of Advanced Reactors and Supporting Fuel Cycles","Krahn, Steven; Burkhardt, Bethany; Sowder, Andrew","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; COMMERCIALIZATION; DECARBONIZATION; FUEL CYCLE; GAS COOLED REACTORS; HEAVY WATER; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR INDUSTRY; REACTOR DESIGN; SIGNALS; WATER COOLED REACTORS; WATER MODERATED REACTORS","Recent growth in private sector interest and investment in advanced reactor designs signals a new period in the greater than six decade pursuit of commercial nuclear technology. This nuclear entrepreneurship is primarily centered in the North America; meanwhile, national programs in China, France, India, Russia, and South Korea also feature active efforts to design, construct, operate and export advanced reactors .The business case for most private ventures calls for an aggressive commercialization timeline-tied to expectations for returns on investment. Finally, strategic energy portfolio projections and utility resource planning point to the 2030 - 2050 window as the period of greatest need for dispatchable, energy intensive, low-carbon generation options to address retirement of baseload capacity, increased penetration of renewables and economy-scale decarbonization. However, lead times for commercialization range from 30 to 50 years based on more traditional government-centric timelines. Fuel development and fuel cycle infrastructure deployment represent parallel timelines that directly influence the timeline for commercialization of many advanced reactor concepts. While multi-decade development periods appear to be commonplace for new nuclear projects, such timelines were not always the norm-three separate countries set out to develop civilian commercial power from fundamental nuclear principles, in just over a decade, on average. The US led light-water reactor (LWR) development in the 1950's, the UK pioneered a gas-cooled reactor (GCR) concept in the same time period, and Canada forged the path to commercializing the heavy-water reactor (HWR) starting in the mid-1950's and into the mid-1960's. The necessary fuel cycle facilities to support the commercial reactor design also did not appear suddenly, but were a collaborative effort between government and private partners. In this paper, the efforts of these three governments and their private industry partnerships in reactor and fuel cycle development are explored, and a select sample of representative milestones for each is presented, with the roles that each group played.

The UK has a long history of using nuclear energy and has a long standing world class expertise in the recycling of used nuclear fuel with three generations of industrial scale reprocessing plant operating on the Sellafield site, as well as the Thorp Miniature Pilot Plant in the 1980's, and a vibrant, internationally recognised R and D capability at the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). However, the reprocessing plants at Sellafield are both scheduled to finish around 2020 with Thorp and Magnox plants moving to post operational clean out (POCO). This will move the UK from a closed fuel cycle to an open one. Within the UK a decision has been made to refresh the current nuclear energy plants to at least replacement of the existing nuclear fleet. This will mean the building of new nuclear power plant to ensure energy production of 16 GWe per annum. With the closure of the UK's reprocessing plants, these new nuclear power plants will operate on an open fuel cycle with long term storage of used fuel followed by disposal. However it is also recognised that this may not be enough and as such expansion scenarios ranging from 16 to 75 GWe nuclear energy production are being considered through the development of a UK Road map. Within these energy scenarios, a variety of options are being evaluated including electricity generation only, electricity generation plus heat, open versus closed fuel cycles, Generation III versus Generation IV systems and combinations of the above. What is clear is that the deciding factor on the type and mix of any energy programme will not be on technology choice alone. Instead a complex mix of Government policy, relative cost of nuclear power, market decisions and public opinion will influence the rate and direction of growth of any future energy programme. At the ANS Winter Meeting 2013 a number of these techniques were presented. What was clear from the fuel cycle scenario modelling was the requirement for the utilisation of a closed fuel cycle to enable the expansion beyond 16 GWe. It is therefore a necessity for the UK to keep options open for a potential return to a closed fuel cycle in the future. The requirement to maintain the skills and capabilities to do so will be an essential part of any future nuclear strategy.

Solar, wind, and nuclear generators all have great potential for growth and will eventually be the dominant generating technologies. The dramatic improvements in nuclear plant capacity factors over the last {approx}20 years have resulted in substantially better economic utilization of our most capital-intensive plants, and this high level of economic utilization needs to continue if we want to avoid major increases in long-term cost of electricity generation. The goal to reduce carbon emissions without substantial long-term cost increases in electricity generation sets up a couple technology development goals. We must develop methods to integrate and control different types of primary energy generators; we must investigate options to couple the primary energy sources used for electricity generation to other sectors of the economy; and we must identify the lowest-capital-cost energy storage system options.

Furthermore, the Ecotricity UK report based on the CIA World Factbook states that with the current rate of consumption of fossil fuels, petroleum would run out by 2052, natural gas by 2060, and coal by 2088. No fossil fuel will remain by the next century. Besides the limited reserves of fossil fuel, massive consumption of fossil fuel also raises concerns about global warming and pollution. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in reducing fossil fuel consumption in the energy structure and in increasing the proportion of clean energy. Renewable energy (e.g. wind, solar) has the potential for distributed generation. However, the availability for renewable energy fluctuates and is uncontrollable. Therefore, additional energy sources need to be coupled with renewable energy to produce a stable electricity generation profile. Nuclear energy can serve this purpose as it is a clean energy source, has low greenhouse gas emission and possesses high power density and baseload power supply with low fuel cost. It is desirable to develop a hybrid energy system that combines both renewable energy and nuclear energy to meet low carbon emission goals and to utilize renewable energy. Such a nuclear hybrid energy system, consisting of different energy subsystems such as nuclear, solar, and wind, involves frequent switching between different energy subsystems. Since the primary loop in a nuclear power plant generates constant heat, the turbine bypass line in the secondary loop is required to switch frequently to meet the gap in the energy demand and that generated by the renewables. The increased usage of the turbine bypass system is considered to be the major difference between a nuclear hybrid energy system and a traditional nuclear power plant. Reliability analysis for designing such a complex system involves both high level fault propagation analysis at the conceptual design stage and low level failure prediction for specific components. The main focus of this summary to derive a degradation model of hardware components which can later help in the high level fault propagation analysis. The degradation model is a low level failure mode model that combines the effects of natural aging and frequent switching. The model can be used for predicting components' failure due to specific failure modes. The results can serve as indicators for conducting repair actions and maintenance to minimize Operation and Maintenance (O and M) costs.

Even the total safety has been assured by the safety design based on defense in depth concept, operational problem would occur by the chain of the fallacy of the defense in depth, then safety culture degradation, and finely organizational accident eventually happened. Probabilistic approach is required to the problem. We should answer to the question 'Safety Goal: How safe is safe enough?' for public acceptance. To respond to the operational problem and safety goal question, PRA, Probabilistic Risk Analysis is required. Further, Risk Communication should include comparison and selection among technical systems by risk and benefit analysis. Therefore, systems safety consideration is important based on systems thinking with considering following characteristics: - Goal-oriented- Optimization, Alternative proposals; - Global perspective- Bird's Eye; - Hierarchy- Isomorphism; - Life Cycle: Plan-Design-Construction-Use-Disposal; - Learning and Evolution.

"Implications of Zero-Carbon Nuclear Renewable Economy: Equity, Economics, and Social Costs","Forsberg, Charles","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; BIOMASS; CARBON; COAL; ELECTRIC POTENTIAL; ENERGY ACCOUNTING; GREENHOUSE GASES; NATURAL GAS; PETROLEUM; POWER GENERATION; STANDARD OF LIVING","Different energy systems have different impacts on equity, economics, and social costs of energy. This leads to alternative strategies for a zero-carbon economy from considering all options to a renewables-only strategy. We examine implications of different choices from a long-term perspective. This is coupled to but separate from the discussion of how to transition to a low-carbon energy system. If we are to stop greenhouse gas emissions with current goals, the transition must be fast. That requires a large nuclear contribution. Experiences in France and Sweden indicate that one can transition the electric grid from fossil fuels to nuclear in 20 to 25 years if it is a priority. Neither renewables with associated storage and transmission nor carbon capture and sequestration for fossil fuel use in electricity generation are available today at competitive costs to do that. The cost of energy has historically been a major factor in determining where industry and cities are built because it is a large fraction of the global economy. The development of low-cost methods to transport coal, oil, and natural gas partly broke that connection by enabling relatively uniform global energy costs. Nuclear energy because of the low-cost of fuel transport has the same characteristic. Renewables are location dependent. In a renewables-only future, the renewable resources distribution determines local energy costs that directly impacts where there is future economic growth and where there will be lower costs of living. In the U.S. today solar is generally uneconomic. Some Great Plains wind is competitive. Offshore wind is uneconomic. Based on projections of renewables costs, an all-renewable U.S. would see (1) movement of industry and people to between the Mississippi River (water and transportation) and the high plains (high wind velocities and low construction costs) and the southwest and (2) growing regional differences in standards of living. The costs of moving energy from renewables long distances is partly because of the high cost of transport systems (high-voltage lines with low capacity factors, hydrogen inter-conversion losses, etc.) and partly because of the non-dispatchability of renewables. A nuclear renewable world will have large variations in the relative amounts of nuclear, wind and solar with location-reflecting local cost of renewable resources. The deployment of wind and solar would be similar to hydro and geothermal-deployed where there is a concentrated resource. In the U.S. and globally this will likely be the norm because countries with limited access to low-cost renewables will not accept lower standards of living. The relative quantities of nuclear, wind and solar will change with relative advances in energy technologies. Energy is a large fraction of the economy; thus, energy choices have major economic, equity, and social implications. That, in turn, impacts standards of living and economic competitiveness.

Thus, the modeling capability and precise parameterizations of the physical characteristics needed to estimate projected active layer thickness (ALT) are limited in Earth system models (ESMs). In particular, discrepancies in spatial scale between field measurements and Earth system models challenge validation and parameterization of hydrothermal models. A recently developed surface–subsurface model for permafrost thermal hydrology, the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), is used in combination with field measurements to achieve the goals of constructing a process-rich model based on plausible parameters and to identify fine-scale controls of ALT in ice-wedge polygon tundra in Barrow, Alaska. An iterative model refinement procedure that cycles between borehole temperature and snow cover measurements and simulations functions to evaluate and parameterize different model processes necessary to simulate freeze–thaw processes and ALT formation. After model refinement and calibration, reasonable matches between simulated and measured soil temperatures are obtained, with the largest errors occurring during early summer above ice wedges (e.g., troughs). The results suggest that properly constructed and calibrated one-dimensional thermal hydrology models have the potential to provide reasonable representation of the subsurface thermal response and can be used to infer model input parameters and process representations. The models for soil thermal conductivity and snow distribution were found to be the most sensitive process representations. However, information on lateral flow and snowpack evolution might be needed to constrain model representations of surface hydrology and snow depth.</p>","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Exploring Citizen Infrastructure and Environmental Priorities in Mumbai, India","Sperling, Joshua; Romero-Lankao, Patricia; Beig, Gufran","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; sustainable urbanization; priorities; infrastructure; environment; equity","Many cities worldwide seek to understand local policy priorities among their general populations. This study explores how differences in local conditions and among citizens within and across Mumbai, India shape local infrastructure (e.g. energy, water, transport) and environmental (e.g. managing pollution, climate-related extreme weather events) policy priorities for change that may or may not be aligned with local government action or global environmental sustainability concerns such as low-carbon development. In this rapidly urbanizing city, multiple issues compete for prominence, ranging from improved management of pollution and extreme weather to energy and other infrastructure services. To inform a broader perspective of policy priorities for urban development and risk mitigation, a survey was conducted among over 1200 citizens. The survey explored the state of local conditions, the challenges citizens face, and the ways in which differences in local conditions (socio-institutional, infrastructure, and health-related) demonstrate inequities and influence how citizens perceive risks and rank priorities for the future design and implementation of local planning, policy, and community-based efforts. With growing discussion and tensions surrounding the new urban sustainable development goal, announced by the UN in late September 2015, and a new global urban agenda document to be agreed upon at 'Habitat III', issues on whether sustainable urbanization priorities should be set at the international, national or local level remain controversial. As such, this study aims to first understand determinants of and variations in local priorities across one city, with implications discussed for local-to-global urban sustainability. Findings from survey results indicate the determinants and variation in conditions such as age, assets, levels of participation in residential action groups, the health outcome of chronic asthma, and the infrastructure service of piped water provision to homes are significant in shaping the top infrastructure and environmental policy priorities that include water supply and sanitation, air pollution, waste, and extreme heat.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficiency improvement and CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction potentials in the United States petroleum refining industry","Morrow, III, William R.; Marano, John; Hasanbeigi, Ali; Masanet, Eric; Sathaye, Jayant","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Energy-efficiency; CO2 emissions; Petroleum refining","The U.S. EPA is in the final stages of promulgating regulations to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the electricity generating industry. A major component of EPA's regulatory strategy targets improvements to power plant operating efficiencies. As the EPA expands regulatory requirements to other industries, including petroleum refining, it is likely that plant efficiency improvements will be critical to achieving CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions. This paper identifies efficiency improvement measures applicable to refining, and quantifies potential cost of conserved energy for these measures. Analysis is at the U.S. petroleum refining sector national-level employing an aggregated notional refinery model (NRM), with the aim of estimating the efficacy of efficiency improvements for reducing emissions. Using this method, roughly 1500 petajoules per year (PJ/yr) of plant fuel savings and 650 gigawatt-hour per year (GWh/yr) of electricity savings (representing 54% and 2% of U.S. refining industry consumption, respectively) are potentially cost-effective. This equates to a potential 85 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>/yr reduction. An additional 458 PJ/yr fuel reduction and close to 2750 GWh/yr of electricity reduction (27 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>/yr) are not cost-effective at prevailing natural gas market prices. Furthermore, results are presented as a supply-curve ordering measures from low to high cost of fuel savings versus cumulative energy reduction.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It is found that the cycle can meet the loads by setting speed and mass flow-rate apportionment between the power and cooling functional sections. The associated energy costs appear elevated when compared to the cost of operating individual components or a more conventional, absorption-based CHP system.

The standard baseline is a randomized control group, however, a good control group is hard to design. This motivates us to devlop data-driven approaches. We explored many techniques and designed a strategy, named LTAP, that could predict the hourly usage years ahead. The key challenge in this process is that the daily cycle of electricity demand peaks a few hours after the temperature reaching its peak. Existing methods rely on the lagged variables of recent past usages to enforce this daily cycle. These methods have trouble making predictions years ahead. LTAP avoids this trouble by assuming the daily usage profile is determined by temperature and other factors. In a comparison against a well-designed control group, LTAP is found to produce accurate predictions.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, we characterize several major themes emerging from this research and highlight some of the uptake of this work in both scientific and public spheres. Underpinning much of this research is the recognition that water resources are expected to undergo substantial changes based on the global warming that results primarily from fossil energy-based carbon emissions. At the same time, the production of electricity from fossil fuels, nuclear power, and some renewable technologies (biomass, geothermal and concentrating solar power) can be highly water-intensive. Energy choices now and in the near future will have a major impact not just on the global climate, but also on water supplies and the resilience of energy systems that currently depend heavily on them.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Operational flexibility can refer to many aspects of a resource's capability to support the power system, such as the speed, range, and duration of power output, as well as the ability to autonomously respond to frequency or voltage changes. Inefficient utilization of existing flexibility, or unwillingness of resources to provide flexibility, can compromise system reliability by not meeting the changing net load, and it can also lead to higher costs when an inefficient use of flexibility resources occurs. There are many existing characteristics of market design that incentivize flexibility in some manner. How they incentivize the provision of flexibility as well as the level of flexibility is still debated. We explore some of these existing market designs, as well as new market mechanisms, such as pay-for-performance regulating reserve and flexible ramping products, that aim to explicitly incentivize the provision of more flexibility to the system, particularly as a result of increasing VG penetration levels.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

P.; Octaviano, Claudia; Di Sbroiavacca, Nicolas","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Climate policy; Low-carbon energy; Technological innovation; Latin America","In this paper we investigate opportunities for energy technology deployment under climate change mitigation efforts in Latin America. Through several carbon tax and CO<sub>2</sub> abatement scenarios until 2050 we analyze what resources and technologies, notably for electricity generation, could be cost-optimal in the energy sector to significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the region. By way of sensitivity test we perform a cross-model comparison study and inspect whether robust conclusions can be drawn across results from different models as well as different types of models (general versus partial equilibrium). Given the abundance of biomass resources in Latin America, they play a large role in energy supply in all scenarios we inspect. This is especially true for stringent climate policy scenarios, for instance because the use of biomass in power plants in combination with CCS can yield negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. We find that hydropower, which today contributes about 800 TWh to overall power production in Latin America, could be significantly expanded to meet the climate policies we investigate, typically by about 50%, but potentially by as much as 75%. According to all models, electricity generation increases exponentially with a two- to three-fold expansion between 2010 and 2050.Wefind that in our climate policy scenarios renewable energy overall expands typically at double-digit growth rates annually, but there is substantial spread in model results for specific options such as wind and solar power: the climate policies that we simulate raise wind power in 2050 on average to half the production level that hydropower provides today, while they raise solar power to either a substantially higher or a much lower level than hydropower supplies at present, depending on which model is used. Also for CCS we observe large diversity in model outcomes, which reflects the uncertainties with regard to its future implementation potential as a result of the challenges this CO<sub>2</sub> abatement technology experiences. The extent to which different mitigation options can be used in practice varies greatly between countries within Latin America, depending on factors such as resource potentials, economic performance, environmental impacts, and availability of technical expertise. We provide concise assessments of possible deployment opportunities for some low-carbon energy options, for the region at large and with occasional country-level detail in specific cases.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we report our development of a core–shell structured catalyst, Ru@Pt/C, generated by a novel and facile pulse electrochemical deposition (PED) approach. We demonstrate that compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyst, this novel catalyst achieves over four times higher mass activity towards the anodic oxidation of methanol, and 3.6 times higher mass activity towards the cathodic reduction of oxygen. Importantly, we find that the intrinsic activity of Pt in this Ru@Pt/C catalyst is doubled due to the formation of the core–shell structure. The catalyst also shows superior stability: even after 2000 scans, it still retains up to 90% of the peak current. As a result, our findings demonstrate that this novel PED approach is a promising method for preparing high-performance core–shell catalysts for fuel cell applications.","Nature Publishing Group","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Dynamic EROI Assessment of the IPCC 21st Century Electricity Production Scenario","Neumeyer, Charles; Goldston, Robert","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; dynamic EROI; energy payback; electricity generation; climate change","Abstract: The Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is an important measure of the energy gain of an electrical power generating facility that is typically evaluated based on the life cycle energy balance of a single facility. The EROI concept can be extended to cover a collection of facilities that comprise a complete power system and used to assess the expansion and evolution of a power system as it transitions from one portfolio mix of technologies to another over time. In this study we develop a dynamic EROI model that simulates the evolution of a power system and we perform an EROI simulation of one of the electricity production scenarios developed under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) covering the global supply of electricity in the 21st century. Our analytic tool provides the means for evaluation of dynamic EROI based on arbitrary time-dependent demand scenarios by modeling the required expansion of power generation, including the plowback needed for new construction and to replace facilities as they are retired. The results provide insight into the level of installed and delivered power, above and beyond basic consumer demand, that is required to support construction during expansion, as well as the supplementary power that may be required if plowback constraints are imposed. In addition, sensitivity to EROI parameters, and the impact of energy storage efficiency are addressed.","MDPI","© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

"Opportunities and Challenges in the Design and Analysis of Biomass Supply Chains","Lautala, Pasi T.; Hilliard, Michael R.; Webb, Erin; Busch, Ingrid; Richard Hess, J.; Roni, Mohammad S.; Hilbert, Jorge; Handler, Robert M.; Bittencourt, Roger; Valente, Amir; Laitinen, Tuuli","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Bioenergy; Supply chain; Transportation; Logistics; Sustainability; Pan American","The biomass supply chain is one of the most critical elements of large scale bioenergy production and in many cases a key barrier for procuring initial funding for new developments on specific energy crops. Most of the large scale productions of liquid biofuels rely on complex transforming chains linked to feed and food markets. The term ’supply chain’ covers various aspects from cultivation and harvesting of the biomass, to treatment, transportation and storage. After the energy conversion, the product must be delivered to final consumption, whether it is in the form of electricity, heat, or more tangible products, such as pellets or ethanol. Effective supply chains are of utmost importance for bioenergy production, as biomass tends to possess challenging spatial distribution and low mass, energy and bulk densities. Additionally, the demand for final products is often dispersed, further complicating the supply chain. The goal of this paper is to introduce key components of biomass supply chains and provide examples of modeling applications available for supply chain investigations. The paper will introduce a concept of integrated supply systems for sustainable biomass trade, followed by three modeling tools developed to help users to understand the factors influencing the biofuel supply chain landscape. The final section will concentrate on various aspects of transportation logistics, ranging from alternative modal / multimodal arrangements to introduction of two analytical support tools, one from U.S. and one from Brazil. Conclusions and research recommendations are also outlined to facilitate the future direction for this area of study.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Since 2005, increased domestic production and decreased oil use have cut U.S. import dependence in half. The direct costs of oil dependence to the U.S. economy are estimated under four U.S. Energy Information Administration Scenarios to 2040. The key premises of the analysis are that the primary oil market failure is the use of market power by OPEC and that U.S. economic vulnerability is a result of the quantity of oil consumed, the lack of readily available, economical substitutes and the quantity of oil imported. Monte Carlo simulations of future oil market conditions indicate that the costs of U.S. oil dependence are likely to increase in constant dollars but decrease relative to U.S. gross domestic product unless oil resources are larger than estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In conclusion, reducing oil dependence therefore remains a valuable goal for U.S. energy policy and an important co-benefit of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Numerous studies highlight the potential of the power sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fewer studies have explored the physical impacts of climate change on the power sector. Our present analysis examines how projected rising temperatures affect the demand for and supply of electricity. We apply a common set of temperature projections to three well-known electric sector models in the United States: the US version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA), the Regional Electricity Deployment System model (ReEDS), and the Integrated Planning Model (IPM®). Incorporating the effects of rising temperatures from a control scenario without emission mitigation into the models raises electricity demand by 1.6 to 6.5 % in 2050 with similar changes in emissions. Moreover, the increase in system costs in the reference scenario to meet this additional demand is comparable to the change in system costs associated with decreasing power sector emissions by approximately 50 % in 2050. This result underscores the importance of adequately incorporating the effects of long-run temperature change in climate policy analysis.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Currently, water is the only fracturing fluid regularly used in commercial shale oil and gas production. Industry and researchers are interested in non-aqueous working fluids due to their potential to increase production, reduce water requirements, and to minimize environmental impacts. Using a combination of new experimental and modeling data at multiple scales, we analyze the benefits and drawbacks of using CO₂ as a working fluid for shale gas production. We theorize and outline potential advantages of CO₂ including enhanced fracturing and fracture propagation, reduction of flow-blocking mechanisms, increased desorption of methane adsorbed in organic-rich parts of the shale, and a reduction or elimination of the deep re-injection of flow-back water that has been linked to induced seismicity and other environmental concerns. We also examine likely disadvantages including costs and safety issues associated with handling large volumes of supercritical CO₂. The advantages could have a significant impact over time leading to substantially increased gas production. In addition, if CO₂ proves to be an effective fracturing fluid, then shale gas formations could become a major utilization option for carbon sequestration.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

To evaluate how PV's changing demand for silver might affect future silver prices, and the impact in terms of manufacturing costs, some scenarios of silver's contribution to c-Si PV cell manufacturing costs are compiled on the basis of projected changes in demand and price as a result of changes in material intensity. The analysis indicates that an expansion of c-Si production from 55GW/year to 250GW/year results in a 0.05-0.7 cent/W increase in manufacturing costs because of higher silver prices.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Defined as the proportion of distance traveled in the electric mode, the utility factor (UF) depends mostly on the battery capacity, but also on many other factors, such as travel pattern and recharging pattern. Conventionally, the UFs are calculated based on the daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) by assuming motorists leave home in the morning with a full battery, and no charge occurs before returning home in the evening. Such an assumption, however, ignores the impact of the heterogeneity in both travel and charging behavior, such as going back home more than once in a day, the impact of available charging time, and the price of gasoline. In addition, the conventional UFs are based on the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data, which are one-day travel data of each sample vehicle. A motorist's daily distance variation is ignored. This paper employs the GPS-based longitudinal travel data (covering 3-18 months) collected from 403 vehicles in the Seattle metropolitan area to investigate how such travel and charging behavior affects UFs. To do this, for each vehicle, we organized trips to a series of home and work related tours. The UFs based on the DVMT are found close to those based on home-to-home tours. However, it is seen that the workplace charge opportunities significantly increase UFs if the CD range is no more than 40 miles.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Wind resource quality affected by high levels of renewables","Diakov, Victor","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; renewable energy; curtailment; capacity factor","For solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind resources, the capacity factor is an important parameter describing the quality of the resource. As the share of variable renewable resources (such as PV and wind) on the electric system is increasing, so does curtailment (and the fraction of time when it cannot be avoided). At high levels of renewable generation, curtailments effectively change the practical measure of resource quality from capacity factor to the incremental capacity factor. The latter accounts only for generation during hours of no curtailment and is directly connected with the marginal capital cost of renewable generators for a given level of renewable generation during the year. The Western U.S. wind generation is analyzed hourly for a system with 75% of annual generation from wind, and it is found that the value for the system of resources with equal capacity factors can vary by a factor of 2, which highlights the importance of using the incremental capacity factor instead. Finally, the effect is expected to be more pronounced in smaller geographic areas (or when transmission limitations imposed) and less pronounced at lower levels of renewable energy in the system with less curtailment.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For these reasons, AM has been adopted by a growing number of aircraft component manufacturers to achieve more lightweight, cost-effective designs. This study estimates the net changes in life-cycle primary energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with AM technologies for lightweight metallic aircraft components through the year 2050, to shed light on the environmental benefits of a shift from CM to AM processes in the U.S. aircraft industry. A systems modeling framework is presented, with integrates engineering criteria, life-cycle environmental data, and aircraft fleet stock and fuel use models under different AM adoption scenarios. Estimated fleetwide life-cycle primary energy savings in a rapid adoption scenario reach 70-174 million GJ/year in 2050, with cumulative savings of 1.2-2.8 billion GJ. Associated cumulative emission reduction potentials of CO2e were estimated at 92.8-217.4 million metric tons. About 95% of the savings is attributed to airplane fuel consumption reductions due to lightweighting.

"ORNL Experience and Challenges Facing Dynamic Wireless Power Charging of EV's","Miller, John M.; Jones, Perry T.; Li, Jan-Mou; Onar, Omer C.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","As visionary as dynamic, or in-motion, wireless charging of electric vehicles appears the concept is well over a century old as this paper will show. This is because the concept of magnetic induction dates back to the pioneering work of physicist Michael Faraday in the early 19th century. Today wireless power transfer (WPT) is being standardized for stationary and quasi-stationary charging of electric vehicles (EV). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has undertaken the standardization of stationary charging and will make this public during 2016. In addition to this the IEEE-SA (Standards Activities) initiated standards development for EV?s in their EVWPT working group in 2012. This study introduces the many challenges facing EVWPT in not only high power transfer to a moving vehicle and energy management at a utility scale, but communications in a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) environment and management of high data rates, ultra-low latency, and dealing with communications loss in dense urban areas. Finally, future concepts such as guideway powering of EV?s are presented to illustrate one technical trajectory EVWPT may take.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Achieving CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in Colombia: Effects of carbon taxes and abatement targets","Calderón, Silvia; Alvarez, Andrés Camilo; Loboguerrero, Ana MarÃ­a; Arango, Santiago; Calvin, Katherine; Kober, Tom; Daenzer, Kathryn; Fisher-Vanden, Karen","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; climate change mitigation; carbon taxes; CO₂ abatement targets; energy modeling; CO<sub>2</sub> abatement targets","In this paper we investigate CO<sub>2</sub> emission scenarios for Colombia and the effects of implementing carbon taxes and abatement targets on the energy system. By comparing baseline and policy scenario results from two integrated assessment partial equilibrium models TIAM-ECN and GCAM and two general equilibrium models Phoenix and MEG4C, we provide an indication of future developments and dynamics in the Colombian energy system. Currently, the carbon intensity of the energy system in Colombia is low compared to other countries in Latin America. However, this trend may change given the projected rapid growth of the economy and the potential increase in the use of carbon-based technologies. Climate policy in Colombia is under development and has yet to consider economic instruments such as taxes and abatement targets. This paper shows how taxes or abatement targets can achieve significant CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in Colombia. Though abatement may be achieved through different pathways, taxes and targets promote the entry of cleaner energy sources into the market and reduce final energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and other demand-side responses. The electric power sector plays an important role in achieving CO<sub>2</sub> emission reductions in Colombia, through the increase of hydropower, the introduction of wind technologies, and the deployment of biomass, coal and natural gas with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage (CCS). Uncertainty over the prevailing mitigation pathway reinforces the importance of climate policy to guide sectors toward low-carbon technologies. This paper also assesses the economy-wide implications of mitigation policies such as potential losses in GDP and consumption. As a result, an assessment of the legal, institutional, social and environmental barriers to economy-wide mitigation policies is critical yet beyond the scope of this paper.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We suggest that developing a large-scale, visible, and financially viable CCUS network could potentially overcome many barriers to deployment and jumpstart commercial-scale CCUS. To date, substantial effort has focused on technology development to reduce the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> capture from coal-fired power plants. Here, we propose that near-term investment could focus on implementing CO<sub>2</sub> capture on facilities that produce high-value chemicals/products. These facilities can absorb the expected impact of the marginal increase in the cost of production on the price of their product, due to the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, more than coal-fired power plants. A financially viable demonstration of a large-scale CCUS network requires offsetting the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> capture by using the CO<sub>2</sub> as an input to the production of market-viable products. As a result, we demonstrate this alternative development path with the example of an integrated CCUS system where CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from ethylene producers and used for enhanced oil recovery in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.","Society of Chemical Industry, Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Of particular importance to the molecular ecologist are new technologies and analytical approaches that provide opportunities to address questions previously unapproachable.The Arctic provides a unique and rapidly changing environment with a suite of emerging research needs that can be addressed through genetics and genomics. Here we highlight recent research on boreal and tundra ecosystems and put forth a series of questions related to plant and microbial responses to climate change that can benefit from technologies and analytical approaches contained within the molecular ecologist's toolbox. These questions include understanding (i) the mechanisms of plant acquisition and uptake of N in cold soils, (ii) how these processes are mediated by root traits, (iii) the role played by the plant microbiome in cycling C and nutrients within high-latitude ecosystems and (iv) plant adaptation to extreme Arctic climates. We highlight how contributions can be made in these areas through studies that target model and nonmodel organisms and emphasize that the sequencing of the Populus and Salix genomes provides a valuable resource for scientific discoveries related to the plant microbiome and plant adaptation in the Arctic. Moreover, there exists an exciting role to play in model development, including incorporating genetic and evolutionary knowledge into ecosystem and Earth System Models. In this regard, the molecular ecologist provides a valuable perspective on plant genetics as a driver for community biodiversity, and how ecological and evolutionary forces govern community dynamics in a rapidly changing climate.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Assessing the sustainability performance of events involves environmental, social and economic aspects; their impacts are complex and a quantitative assessment is often difficult. This paper presents a new quali-quantitative method developed to measure the sustainability of events, taking into account all its potential impacts. The 2014 World Orienteering Championship, held in Italy, was selected to test the proposed evaluation methodology. The total carbon footprint of the event was 165.34 tCO{sub 2}eq and the avoided emissions were estimated as being 46 tCO{sub 2}eq. The adopted quali-quantitative method resulted to be efficient in assessing the sustainability impacts and can be applied for the evaluation of similar events. - Highlights: • A quali-quantitative method to assess events' sustainability is presented. • All the methodological issues related to the method are explained. • The method is used to evaluate the sustainability of an international sports event. • The method resulted to be valid to assess the event's sustainability level. • The carbon footprint of the event has been calculated.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2015.08.002","","","","United States","2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 56; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)00077-3; TRN: US16R4745033695","10.1016/J.EIAR.2015.08.002","","2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","22589207","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22589207","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","56"

This study analysed the content, structure, weighting and indicators of two established certification systems for sustainable urban development – BREEAM Communities and LEED for Neighborhood Development. Several limitations of these systems were identified: both have a bias for procedure and feature indicators over indicators that assess actual performance; performance demands are set according to a relative understanding of sustainable development; the focus is on internal sustainability, while upstream and downstream impacts of construction are disregarded; the number and distribution of mandatory issues do not cover essential sustainability aspects; and the disproportionately large number of non-mandatory issues makes benchmarking difficult and signals that sustainability aspects are exchangeable. Altogether, this means that an area can be certified without being sustainable. Moreover, the lack of continuous development of certification requirements in the systems means that they risk exerting a conservative effect on urban development, rather than pushing it forward. - Highlights: • BREEAM-C and LEED-ND were analysed in terms of content and structure. • Specific attention was given to the type of indicators used for showing compliance. • In both systems procedure and feature indicators dominate over performance indicators. • Several other limitations of these certification systems were also identified. • Altogether the limitations imply that a certificate does not warrant sustainability.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2015.10.003","","","","United States","2016-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 56; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 200-213","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)00103-1; TRN: US16R4764033714","10.1016/J.EIAR.2015.10.003","","2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","22589226","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22589226","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","56"

H.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; aggregation functions; compensatory functions; distance to target; indicators; mathematical aggregation theory; sustainability assessment; uncertainty; weak versus strong sustainability","In order to aid in transition towards operations that promote sustainability goals, researchers and stakeholders use sustainability assessments. Although assessments take various forms, many utilize diverse sets of indicators that can number anywhere from two to over 2000. Indices, composite indicators, or aggregate values are used to simplify high dimensional and complex data sets and to clarify assessment results. Although the choice of aggregation function is a key component in the development of the assessment, there are few examples to be found in literature to guide appropriate aggregation function selection. This paper develops a connection between the mathematical study of aggregation functions and sustainability assessment in order to aid in providing criteria for aggregation function selection. Relevant mathematical properties of aggregation functions are presented and interpreted. Lastly, we provide cases of these properties and their relation to previous sustainability assessment research. Examples show that mathematical aggregation properties can be used to address the topics of compensatory behavior and weak versus strong sustainability, aggregation of data under varying units of measurements, multiple site multiple indicator aggregation, and the determination of error bounds in aggregate output for normalized and non-normalized indicator measures.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The chief goal of this current study is to compare the already rapid pace of fuel economy improvement and technological change over the previous decade to the needed rate of change to meet regulations over the next decade. EPA and NHTSA comparisons of the MY 2004 US light-duty vehicle fleet to the MY 2014 fleet shows improved fuel economy (FE) of approximately 28% using the same FE estimating method mandated for CAFE regulations. Future predictions by EPA and NHTSA concerning ensemble fleet fuel economy are examined as an indicator of needed vehicle rate-of-change. A set of 40 same-model vehicle pairs for MY 2005 and MY 2015 is compared to examine changes in energy use and related technological change over the 10 year period. Powertrain improvements measured as increased vehicle efficiency, and vehicle mass-glider improvements measured as decreased tractive work requirements are quantified. The focus is first on conventional gasoline powertrain vehicles which currently dominate the market, with hybrids also examined due to their high potential importance for CAFE compliance. Most hybrid vehicles with significant sales in 2014 were represented in the study. Results show 10 years of progress for the studied vehicle set includes lowered tractive effort of about 5.6% and improved powertrain efficiency of about 16.5%. Further analysis shows that this high rate of past progress must increase by about 50% in order to meet the 2025 CAFE standards. Examination of where certain MY 2015 vehicle compare to CAFE regulations is offered as well as some simple conjecture on what is needed to meet regulations under reasonable assumptions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Scaling up the energy service company business: market status and company feedback in the Russian Federation","Roshchanka, Volha; Evans, Meredydd","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Many energy efficiency professionals have proposed using Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) as a mechanism to improve public sector energy efficiency in countries with restrictive government budgets. However, in practice, most middle-income countries have used this mechanism only in a limited way. Russia offers an interesting case study because of its huge energy savings opportunities, increasing energy prices, robust political backing for public sector energy efficiency, and evolving legislation that supports EPCs. In 2009, the Russian Federation launched a program to reduce the energy intensity of the country’s large public sector, which accounts for 9 percent of Russia’s total energy consumption. To achieve energy efficiency goals, Russia experimented with its public procurement rules, adjusting them to encourage EPCs. We conducted structured interviews with Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in Russia and supplemented them with online research. Our review shows that, to date, nearly 50 ESCOs signed about 150 contracts in public facilities. Most ESCO contracts in Russia are for 5 years, and they generally are small (under $100,000). ESCOs in Russia face a challenging environment, which leads to smaller projects. ESCOs also are concerned about costly and risky tender procedures, uncertainty regarding repayment from public facilities, the inability to expand projects, and financing. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions at policy and company levels. The ESCOs feedback regarding Russia’s experimental model can inform the country’s program for public sector energy efficiency and offer lessons for other countries attempting to develop the EPC mechanism.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The objective of this study was to measure energy security of Indonesia quantitatively by comparing it with other countries and provide some recommendations for enhancing the energy security. In this study, the database was developed from various sources and was cross-checked to confirm validity of the data. Then the parameters of energy security were defined, where all of data will be processed towards the selected parameters. These parameters (e.g. Primary Energy mix, TPES/capita, FEC/capita, Self Sufficiency, Refining capacity, Overseas Energy Resources, Resources diversification) are the standards used to produce an analysis or evaluation of national energy management. Energy balances for Indonesia and 10 selected countries (USA, Germany, Russia, England, Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and India) were presented from 2009 to 2013. With a base index of 1.0 for Indonesia, calculated energy security index capable of representing Indonesia energy security compared relatively to other countries were also presented and discussed in detail. In 2012, Indonesia security index is ranked 11 from 11 countries, while USA and South Korea are the highest with security index of 3.36 and 2.89, respectively. According to prediction for 2025, Indonesia energy security is ranked 10 from 11 countries with only Thailand has lower security index (0.98). This result shows that Indonesia energy security was vulnerable to crisis and must be improved. Therefore this study proposed some recommendations to improve Indonesia energy security. Indonesia need to increase oil production by constructing new refinery plants, developing infrastructure for energy distribution to reduce the potential of energy shortage and accelerating the utilization of renewable energy to reduce the excessive use of primary energy. From energy policy proposed in this study, Indonesia energy security for 2025 could be improved to ranked 8 of 11 countries, better than Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.","","","","","","United States","2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference of chemical and material engineering (ICCME) 2015: Green technology for sustainable chemical products and processes, Semarang (Indonesia), 29-30 Sep 2015; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 030027-030027.10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US16A2988064665","10.1063/1.4938312","","2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","22494463","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22494463","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1699"

Through design and functionality, the passive house can make maximum use of all available energy resources. One of the solutions to supply energy of these types of buildings is the fuel cell, using this technology integrated into a system for generating electricity from renewable primary sources, which take the function of backup power (energy reserve) to cover peak load and meteorological intermittents. In this paper is presented the results of the case study that provide an analysis of the energy, environmental and financial performances regarding energy supply of passive house by power generation systems with fuel cell fed with electrolytic hydrogen produced by harnessing renewable energy sources available. Hybrid systems have been configured and operate in various conditions of use for five differentiated locations according to the main areas of solar irradiation from the Romanian map. Global performance of hybrid systems is directly influenced by the availability of renewable primary energy sources - particular geo-climatic characteristics of the building emplacement.","","","","","","United States","2015-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1700; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: PIM 2015: 10. international conference on processes in isotopes and molecules, Cluj-Napoca (Romania), 23-25 Sep 2015; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 050010-050010.5","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US16A3074064694","10.1063/1.4938448","","2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","22494492","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22494492","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1700"

Reflecting alternative policy goals, building energy codes differ significantly across the United States, the European Union, and China. This review uncovers numerous innovative practices including greenhouse gas emissions caps per square meter of building space, energy performance certificates with retrofit recommendations, and inclusion of renewable energy to achieve “nearly zero-energy buildings”. These innovations motivated an assessment of an aggressive commercial building code applied to all US states, requiring both new construction and buildings with major modifications to comply with the latest version of the ASHRAE 90.1 Standards. Using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), we estimate that by 2035, such building codes in the United States could reduce energy for space heating, cooling, water heating and lighting in commercial buildings by 16%, 15%, 20% and 5%, respectively. Impacts on different fuels and building types, energy rates and bills as well as pollution emission reductions are also examined.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Therefore, in this paper, we present applications of remote sensing data for mapping suitability areas for concentrated solar power plants. Our approach uses digital elevation model derived from NASA s Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) at a resolution of 3 arc second (approx. 90m resolution) for estimating global solar radiation for the study area. Then, we develop a computational model built on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform that divides the study area into a grid of cells and estimates site suitability value for each cell by computing a list of metrics based on applicable siting requirements using GIS data. The computed metrics include population density, solar energy potential, federal lands, and hazardous facilities. Overall, some 30 GIS data are used to compute eight metrics. The site suitability value for each cell is computed as an algebraic sum of all metrics for the cell with the assumption that all metrics have equal weight. Finally, we color each cell according to its suitability value. Furthermore, we present results for concentrated solar power that drives a stream turbine and parabolic mirror connected to a Stirling Engine.","SPIE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One of the forecasting approaches that based on judgemental or subjective factors is normally used to forecast the demand. As a result, demand could be overstock that eventually will increase the operation cost; or the company will face understock, which resulted losing their customers. Due to automotive industry is very challenging process because of high level of complexity and uncertainty involved in the system, an accurate tool to forecast the future of automotive demand from the modelling perspective is required. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to forecast the demand of automotive Proton car industry in Malaysia using system dynamics approach. Two types of intervention namely optimistic and pessimistic experiments scenarios have been tested to determine the capacity expansion that can prevent the company from overstocking. Finding from this study highlighted that the management needs to expand their production for optimistic scenario, whilst pessimistic give results that would otherwise. Finally, this study could help Proton Edar Sdn. Bhd (PESB) to manage the long-term capacity planning in order to meet the future demand of the Proton cars.","","","","","","United States","2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1691; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IACE 2015: 2. innovation and analytics conference and exhibition, Kedah (Malaysia), 29 Sep - 1 Oct 2015; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 030031-030031.7","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US16A2488064504","10.1063/1.4937050","","2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","22494302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22494302","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1691"
"B2, B7 or B10: Which palm-based blend mandate wise to be chosen in Malaysia?","Applanaidu, Shri-Dewi; Ali, Anizah Md., E-mail: anizah@uum.edu.my; Abidin, Norhaslinda Zainal, E-mail: nhaslinda@uum.edu.my","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; BIODIESEL FUELS; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS; ECONOMICS; ENERGY SECURITY; FEASIBILITY STUDIES; GREENHOUSE GASES; LEAST SQUARE FIT; MALAYSIA; PALM OIL; PRICES; SIMULATION","The diminishing fossil energy resources, coupled with heightened interest in the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about energy security have motivated Malaysia to produce palm-based biodiesel and it has been started to be exported since 2006. In line with this issue, the government in Malaysia launched the palm-based biodiesel blending mandate of five percent (B5) in the federal administration of Putrajaya on 1{sup st} June 2011. This was then followed by four states: Malacca on July 11, Negeri Sembilan on August 1, Kuala Lumpur on September 1 and Selangor on October 1 of the same year but it is yet to be implemented nationwide. However what is the wise blend mandate to be chosen? Thus, this paper seeks to examine the possible impact of various blend mandates implementation (B2, B7 and B10) on the palm oil industry market variables (stock and price) since the main aim of biodiesel industry in Malaysia is to reduce domestic palm oil stock to below one million tones and provide a floor price to support Crude Palm Oil (CPO) prices at RM2,000 per tonne. A structural econometric model consisting of nine structural equations and three identities was proposed in this study. The model has been estimated by two stage least squares (2SLS) method using annual data for the period 1976-2013. The study indicates that counterfactual simulation of a decrease from B5 to B2 predicts a decrease (11.2 per cent) in CPO domestic consumption for biodiesel usage, 731.02 per cent reduction in CPO stock and an increase of 27.41 percent in domestic price of CPO. However the increase in the blend mandate from B5 to B7 and B10 suggest that domestic consumption of CPO for biodiesel purpose increase 7.40 and 18.55 percent respectively. The interesting findings in this study suggest that no matter whether Malaysian government increase or decrease the blend mandate the increase in the price of CPO are the same with an increase of is 27.41 percent. Hence, this study suggests that the lower blend mandate is the most favourable on.+-e compared to increasing it in this short period due to high production cost of CPO prices. However, future study on economic feasibility of palm-based biodiesel has to be conducted to support this study.","","","","","","United States","2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1691; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IACE 2015: 2. innovation and analytics conference and exhibition, Kedah (Malaysia), 29 Sep - 1 Oct 2015; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 030002-030002.8","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US16A2459066448","10.1063/1.4937021","","2016-06-13T00:00:00Z","22496243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22496243","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1691"

Methods and Materials: A 20-question survey was distributed to members of the Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the Indian Brachytherapy Society between November 2013 and May 2014. Results: We received a total of 132 responses. Over 50% of the physicians treat more than 200 patients per day, use 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional treatment planning techniques, and approximately 50% use image guided techniques. For education needs, most respondents agreed that further education in intensity modulated radiation therapy, image guided radiation therapy, stereotactic radiation therapy, biostatistics, and research methods for medical residents would be useful areas of collaboration with institutions in the United States. Other areas of collaboration include developing a structured training module for nursing, physics training, and developing a second-opinion clinic for difficult cases with faculty in the United States. Conclusion: Various areas of potential collaboration in radiation oncology education were identified through this survey. These include the following: establishing education programs focused on current technology, facilitating exchange programs for trainees in India to the United States, promoting training in research methods, establishing training modules for physicists and oncology nurses, and creating an Indo–US. Tumor Board. It would require collaboration between the Association of Indian Radiation Oncologists and the American Society for Radiation Oncology to develop these educational initiatives.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.08.009","","","","United States","2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 957-960","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-3016; CODEN: IOBPD3; PII: S0360-3016(15)03122-3; TRN: US16R4860093616","10.1016/J.IJROBP.2015.08.009","","2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","22645020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22645020","","International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics","5","93"
"The political economy of noncompliance in China: The case of industrial energy policy","Van Aken, Tucker; Lewis, Orion A.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","One of the greatest challenges facing China today is the central government's ability to ensure that policies are implemented effectively at the local level, particularly policies that seek to make China's economic growth model more sustainable. These policies face resistance from local authorities and enterprises that benefit from the status quo. This raises a key research question: why do some provinces more fully implement these central policies? We argue the extent of local implementation is best conceptualized as a rational balance between economic and political incentives: localities with regulatory autonomy, low regulatory capacity and alternative interests will not fully implement policies that are at odds with local economic imperatives. By examining a critical case of central policy implementation—industrial energy intensity reduction in the eleventh five-year plan—this article demonstrates that, regardless of industrial makeup or economic development, provinces that have greater regulatory autonomy for noncompliance coupled with alternative economic interests do not, on average, perform as well. As a result, using a nested analysis approach this study illustrates this argument with both quantitative analysis and original case study evidence from fieldwork interviews.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The practical application of the selection (decision making) of structural alternatives made by one-way slabs leads to an intermediate level between the product and the building. Thus the present study addresses this problem of decision making, following the CEN guidelines and incorporating relevant aspects of architectural design into residential construction. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is developed in order to obtain valid information for the decision making process (the LCA was developed applying CML methodology although Ecoindicator99 was used in order to facilitate the comparison of the values); this information (the carbon footprint values) is contrasted with other databases and with the information from the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) of one of the lightening materials (expanded polystyrene), in order to validate the results. Solutions of different column disposition and geometries are evaluated in the three pillars of sustainable construction on residential construction: social, economic and environmental. The quantitative analysis of the variables used in this study enables and facilitates an objective comparison in the design stage by a responsible technician; the application of the proposed methodology reduces the possible solutions to be evaluated by the expert to 12.22% of the options in the case of low values of the column index and to 26.67% for the highest values. - Highlights: • Methodology for selection of structural alternatives in buildings with one-way slabs • Adapted to CEN guidelines (CEN/TC-350) for assessing the building sustainability • LCA is developed in order to obtain valid information for the decision making process. • Results validated comparing carbon footprint, databases and Env.

"New prospects for PV powered water desalination plants: case studies in Saudi Arabia: New prospects for PV powered water desalination plants","Fthenakis, Vasilis; Atia, Adam A.; Morin, Olivier; Bkayrat, Raed; Sinha, Parikhit","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY","Increased water demand and increased drought episodes in the Middle East and other regions necessitate an expansion in desalination projects and create a great market opportunity for photovoltaics (PV). PV-powered desalination has previously been regarded as not being a cost-competitive solution when compared with conventionally powered desalination; however, the decline in PV costs over the last few years has changed this outlook. Here, this article presents up-to-date performance and cost analysis of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination powered with PV connected to the Saudi Arabian grid. Reference cases include relatively small (i.e., producing 6550 m<sup>3</sup> water per day) and large (i.e., 190 000 m<sup>3</sup>/day) desalination plants using seawater at a salinity of 40 000 ppm. We used data from a King Abdullah University for Science and Technology presentation and Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables 2.81 Energy Modeling Software (HOMER Energy LLC) in tandem with Desalination Economic Evaluation Program 4.0 (International Atomic Energy Agency) desalination software to analyze the techno-economic feasibility of these plants. The first phase of our work entailed a comparison between dual-axis high concentration PV (CPV) equipped with triple junction III/V solar cells and CdTe PV-powered RO systems. The estimated levelized cost of electricity from CPV is 0.16/kWh dollars, whereas that from CdTe PV is $0.10/kWh dollars and 0.09/kWh dollars for fixed-tilt and one-axis tracking systems, respectively. These costs are higher than the price of diesel-based grid electricity in the region because diesel fuel is heavily subsidized in Saudi Arabia.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this paper, we discuss long-term energy developments in Africa using the results of the LIMITS model inter-comparison study. The analysis focusses on the position of Africa in the wider global energy system and climate mitigation. The results show a considerable spread in model outcomes. Without specific climate policy, Africa’s share in global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is projected to increase from around 1-4% today to 3-23% by 2100. In all models, emissions only start to become really significant on a global scale after 2050. Furthermore, by 2030 still around 50% of total household energy use is supplied through traditional bio-energy, in contrast to existing ambitions from international organisations to provide access to modern energy for all. After 2050, the energy mix is projected to converge towards a global average energy mix with high shares of fossil fuels and electricity use. Finally, although the continent is now a large net exporter of oil and gas, towards 2050 it most likely needs most of its resources to meet its rapidly growing domestic demand. With respect to climate policy, the rapid expansion of the industrial and the power sector also create large mitigation potential and thereby the possibility to align the investment peak in the energy system with climate policy and potential revenues from international carbon trading.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Exploring the market for third-party-owned residential photovoltaic systems: insights from lease and power-purchase agreement contract structures and costs in California","Davidson, Carolyn; Steinberg, Daniel; Margolis, Robert","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; residential solar; third-party ownership; lease cost","We report that over the past several years, third-party-ownership (TPO) structures for residential photovoltaic (PV) systems have become the predominant ownership model in the US residential market. Under a TPO contract, the PV system host typically makes payments to the third-party owner of the system. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the total TPO contract payments made by the customer can differ significantly from payments in which the system host directly purchases the system. Furthermore, payments can vary depending on TPO contract structure. To date, a paucity of data on TPO contracts has precluded studies evaluating trends in TPO contract cost. This study relies on a sample of 1113 contracts for residential PV systems installed in 2010–2012 under the California Solar Initiative to evaluate how the timing of payments under a TPO contract impacts the ultimate cost of the system to the customer. Furthermore, we evaluate how the total cost of TPO systems to customers has changed through time, and the degree to which contract costs have tracked trends in the installed costs of a PV system. We find that the structure of the contract and the timing of the payments have financial implications for the customer: (1) power-purchase contracts, on average, cost more than leases, (2) no-money-down contracts are more costly than prepaid contracts, assuming a customer's discount rate is lower than 17% and (3) contracts that include escalator clauses cost more, for both power-purchase agreements and leases, at most plausible discount rates. Additionally, all contract costs exhibit a wide range, and do not parallel trends in installed costs over time.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In Financial Mathematics the question of optimal use of computational resources should also take into account the limitations on space, because in many use cases the servers are deployed close to the exchanges. In this work we evaluate various algorithms for option pricing that we have implemented for different target architectures in terms of their energy and space efficiency. Since it has been established that low-discrepancy sequences may be better than pseudorandom numbers for these types of algorithms, we also test the Sobol and Halton sequences.

Evolution from a metallic to an insulating behavior is observed as the film thickness decreases from 20 to 4 unit cells. In films thicker than 4 unit cells, the transport behavior obeys the Drude low temperature conductivity with quantum corrections, which can be attributed to weak localization. Fitting the data with 2-dimensional localization model indicates that electron-phonon collisions are the main inelastic relaxation mechanism. In the film of 4 unit cells in thickness, the transport behavior follows variable range hopping model, indicating a strongly localized state. As a result, magnetoresistance measurements reveal a likely magnetic anisotropy with the magnetic easy axis along the out-of-plane direction.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Under idealized conditions climate policies significantly reduce coal use in the short- and long-term. Reductions in oil and gas use are much smaller, particularly until 2030, but revenues decrease much more because oil and gas prices are higher than coal prices. A first deviation from optimal transition pathways is delayed action that relaxes global emission targets until 2030 in accordance with the Copenhagen pledges. Fossil fuel markets revert back to the no-policy case: though coal use increases strongest, revenue gains are higher for oil and gas. To balance the carbon budget over the 21st century, the long-term reallocation of fossil fuels is significantly larger—twice and more—than the short-term distortion. This amplifying effect results from coal lock-in and inter-fuel substitution effects to balance the full-century carbon budget. The second deviation from the optimal transition pathway relaxes the global participation assumption. The result here is less clear-cut across models, as we find carbon leakage effects ranging from positive to negative because trade and substitution patterns of coal, oil, and gas differ across models. In summary, distortions of fossil fuel markets resulting from relaxed short-term global emission targets are more important and less uncertain than the issue of carbon leakage from early mover action.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Are State-Sponsored New Radiation Therapy Facilities Economically Viable in Low- and Middle-Income Countries?","Datta, Niloy R., E-mail: nrdatta@yahoo.com; Samiei, Massoud; Bodis, Stephan","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 62 RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE; BREAKEVEN; CALCULATION METHODS; COST; ECONOMICS; EMPLOYMENT; HOSPITALS; INCOME; INVESTMENT; PATIENTS; POPULATIONS; RADIOTHERAPY; WORLD BANK","Purpose: The economic viability of establishing a state-funded radiation therapy (RT) infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in accordance with the World Bank definition has been assessed through computation of a return on investment (ROI). Methods and Materials: Of the 139 LMICs, 100 were evaluated according to their RT facilities, gross national income (GNI) per capita, and employment/population ratio. The assumption was an investment of US$5 million for a basic RT center able to treat 1000 patients annually. The national breakeven points and percentage of ROI (%ROI) were calculated according to the GNI per capita and patient survival rates of 10% to 50% at 2 years. It was assumed that 50% of these patients would be of working age and that, if employed and able to work after treatment, they would contribute to the country's GNI for at least 2 years. The cumulative GNI after attaining the breakeven point until the end of the 15-year lifespan of the teletherapy unit was calculated to estimate the %ROI. The recurring and overhead costs were assumed to vary from 5.5% to 15% of the capital investment. Results: The %ROI was dependent on the GNI per capita, employment/population ratio and 2-year patient survival (all P<.001). Accordingly, none of the low-income countries would attain an ROI. If 50% of the patients survived for 2 years, the %ROI in the lower-middle and upper-middle income countries could range from 0% to 159.9% and 11.2% to 844.7%, respectively. Patient user fees to offset recurring and overhead costs could vary from “nil” to US$750, depending on state subsidies. Conclusions: Countries with a greater GNI per capita, higher employment/population ratio, and better survival could achieve a faster breakeven point, resulting in a higher %ROI. Additional factors such as user fees have also been considered. These can be tailored to the patient's ability to pay to cover the recurring costs. Certain pragmatic steps that could be undertaken to address these issues are discussed in the present study.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.05.036","","","","United States","2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 229-240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-3016; CODEN: IOBPD3; PII: S0360-3016(15)00564-7; TRN: US16R2132028345","10.1016/J.IJROBP.2015.05.036","","2016-03-25T00:00:00Z","22458769","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22458769","","International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics","2","93"

Methods and Materials: A fill-in-the-blank spreadsheet was distributed to all RO program directors in December 2013 and June 2014, requesting the employment status and location of their graduates over the last 3 years. Visa trainee graduates were excluded. Results: Response rate from program directors was 100% for both survey administrations. Of 101 graduates identified, 99 (98%) had known employment status and location. In the December survey, 5 2013 graduates (16%), 17 2012 graduates (59%), and 18 2011 graduates (75%) had permanent staff employment. Six months later, 5 2014 graduates (29%), 15 2013 graduates (48%), 24 2012 graduates (83%), and 21 2011 graduates (88%) had secured staff positions. Fellowships and temporary locums were common for those without staff employment. The proportion of graduates with staff positions abroad increased from 22% to 26% 6 months later. Conclusions: Workforce entry for most RO graduates was delayed but showed steady improvement with longer time after graduation. High emigration rates for jobs abroad signify domestic employment challenges for newly certified, Canadian-trained radiation oncologists.

Although many energy-efficiency measures have been proposed by the Chinese government to mitigate GHG emissions and to improve air quality, lacking full understanding of the costs and benefits has created barriers against implementing these measures widely. This paper sets out to advance the understanding by addressing the knowledge gap in costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of energy-efficiency measures in iron and steel production. Specifically, we build a new evaluation framework to quantify energy benefits and environmental benefits (i.e., CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction, air-pollutants emission reduction and water savings) associated with 36 energy-efficiency measures. Results show that inclusion of benefits from CO<sub>2</sub> and air-pollutants emission reduction affects the cost-effectiveness of energy-efficiency measures significantly, while impacts from water-savings benefits are moderate but notable when compared to the effects by considering energy benefits alone. The new information resulted from this study should be used to augment future programs and efforts in reducing energy use and environmental impacts associated with steel production.","Springer","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The analysis is done using a direct costs/revenues approach and the stochastic uncertainties are handled using Monte Carlo simulation. Two remediation scenarios are applied to a hypothetical landfill. One scenario includes only remediation, while the second scenario adds resource recovery to the remediation project. Moreover, the second scenario is divided into two cases, case A and B. In case A, the landfill tax needs to be paid for re-deposited material and the landfill holder does not own a combined heat and power plant (CHP), which leads to disposal costs in the form of gate fees. In case B, the landfill tax is waived on the re-deposited material and the landfill holder owns its own CHP. Results show that the remediation project in the first scenario costs about €23/ton. Adding resource recovery as in case A worsens the result to −€36/ton, while for case B the result improves to −€14/ton. This shows the importance of landfill tax and the access to a CHP. Other important factors for the result are the material composition in the landfill, the efficiency of the separation technology used, and the price of the saleable material.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.04.008","","","","United States","2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 42; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-147","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00280-9; TRN: US16R2244042349","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.04.008","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472535","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472535","","Waste Management","","42"

"Grain Handling and Transportation Policy in Canada: Implications for the United States","Nolan, James; Peterson, Steven K","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Grain handling; Interswitching; Revenue sharing; Supply chain; Rail regulation","The grain handling and transportation system in Canada (GHTS) is currently going through a major transition, both with respect to handling and transportation. Historically, the system has pitted farmers against the railways with respect to securing individual fair shares of grain revenues. But with the removal of the single desk marketing and logistics function of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) in late 2012, a very interesting and potentially game-changing outcome is emerging with respect to the new functionality of the grain companies in the Canadian system. While historical awareness of rail s natural monopoly position in the grain handling system has kept that sector regulated (in several ways) for close to a century, we are now starting to see the effects of a less than competitive Canadian grain handling sector on revenue sharing, along with renewed movement in the industry with respect to buyouts and potential mergers. This overview will highlight some of the changes now occurring and how they are potentially going to interact or evolve as the system moves forward. For example, the on-going regulatory instrument used to regulate grain transportation rates in Canada (called the maximum revenue entitlement (MRE) or revenue cap) is under current debate because of the introduction a few months ago of a modification to an old regulatory instrument known as extended (or reciprocal) interswitching. As opposed to the revenue cap which is a direct intervention on monopoly behavior, extended interswitching is designed to encourage the major Canadian grain carriers to compete with one another and potentially seek out new traffic (Nolan and Skotheim, 2008). But the most intriguing aspect of extended interswitching is how it might allow a major rail carrier from the U.S. to solicit grain traffic in some areas of the Canadian grain transportation system.","AAEA (Agricultural & Applied Economics Association)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Scale and the representation of human agency in the modeling of agroecosystems","Preston, Benjamin L.; King, Anthony W.; Ernst, Kathleen M.; Absar, Syeda Mariya; Nair, Sujithkumar Surendran; Parish, Esther S.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; agriculture; scale; human agency; sustainability; modeling; climate change","Human agency is an essential determinant of the dynamics of agroecosystems. However, the manner in which agency is represented within different approaches to agroecosystem modeling is largely contingent on the scales of analysis and the conceptualization of the system of interest. While appropriate at times, narrow conceptualizations of agroecosystems can preclude consideration for how agency manifests at different scales, thereby marginalizing processes, feedbacks, and constraints that would otherwise affect model results. Modifications to the existing modeling toolkit may therefore enable more holistic representations of human agency. Model integration can assist with the development of multi-scale agroecosystem modeling frameworks that capture different aspects of agency. In addition, expanding the use of socioeconomic scenarios and stakeholder participation can assist in explicitly defining context-dependent elements of scale and agency. Finally, such approaches, however, should be accompanied by greater recognition of the meta agency of model users and the need for more critical evaluation of model selection and application.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Effectiveness of the food recovery at the retailing stage under shelf life uncertainty: An application to Italian food chains","Muriana, Cinzia","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; COST; FOOD CHAINS; FRUITS; HYPOTHESIS; ITALY; MATERIALS RECOVERY; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; STOCHASTIC PROCESSES; STORAGE LIFE; VEGETABLES","Highlights: • The food recovery is seen as suitable way to manage food near to its expiry date. • The variability of the products shelf life must be taken into account. • The paper addresses the mathematic modeling of the profit related to food recovery. • The optimal time to withdraw the products is determinant for food recovery. - Abstract: Food losses represent a significant issue affecting food supply chains. The possibility of recovering such products can be seen as an effective way to reduce such a phenomenon, improve supply chain performances and ameliorate the conditions of undernourished people. The topic has been already investigated by a previous paper enforcing the hypothesis of deterministic and constant Shelf Life (SL) of products. However, such a model cannot be properly extended to products affected by uncertainties of the SL as it does not take into account the deterioration costs and loss of profits due to the overcoming of the SL within the cycle time. Thus the present paper presents an extension of the previous one under stochastic conditions of the food quality. Differently from the previous publication, this work represents a general model applicable to all supply chains, especially to those managing fresh products characterized by uncertain SL such as fruits and vegetables. The deterioration costs and loss of profits are included in the model and the optimal time at which to withdraw the products from the shelves as well as the quantities to be shipped at each alternative destination have been determined. A comparison of the proposed model with that reported in the previous publication has been carried out in order to underline the impact of the SL variability on the optimality conditions. The results show that the food recovery strategy in the presence of uncertainty of the food quality is rewarding, even if the optimal profit is lower than that of the deterministic case.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.028","","","","United States","2015-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 41; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 159-168","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00222-6; TRN: US16R2238042343","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.028","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472529","","Waste Management","","41"

Sustainable and cost efficient solutions need to be developed to solve this problem. This study evaluates the feasibility of using dark fermentation (DF) to convert the OFMSW to volatile fatty acids (VFAs), fertilizer and H{sub 2}. The VFAs in the DF effluent can be used directly as substrate for subsequent bioprocesses or purified from the effluent for industrial use. DF of the OFMSW in Abu Dhabi will be economically sustainable once VFA purification can be accomplished on large scale for less than 15 USD/m{sup 3}{sub effluent}. With a VFA minimum selling price of 330 USD/t{sub COD}, DF provides a competitive carbon source to sugar. Furthermore, DF is likely to use less energy than conventional processes that produce VFAs, fertilizer and H{sub 2}. This makes DF of OFMSW a promising waste treatment technology and biorefinery platform.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.03.008","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 40; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 82-91","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00149-X; TRN: US16R2222042327","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.03.008","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","22472513","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22472513","","Waste Management","","40"

In combination with production concentrated in China, this caused strong and unpredicted price movements in recent years. As a result, manufacturing companies have to cope with additional risks. However, the detailed reasons for the price development are only partially understood. Therefore, we analyzed empirically which determinants can be assigned to price movements and performed an event study on the high-tech metals neodymium, indium, and gallium. Based on our dataset of news items, we were able to find coinciding events to almost 90% of all price jumps (recall). We showed that if any information about these events occurred with a probability of over 50% there would also be a price jump within 10 days (precision). However, the classical set of price determinants has to be extended for these specific markets, as we found unorthodox factors like holidays or weather that may be indicators for price movements. Therefore, we hope that our study supports industry for instance in performing more informed short-term planning of metals purchasing based on information about specific events.","","","","","","United States","2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.); Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences; http://www.springer-ny.com; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 139-159","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1520-7439; TRN: US16K1057039698","10.1007/S11053-014-9244-X","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22469913","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22469913","","Natural Resources Research (New York, N.Y.)","2","24"

Customer-sited PV, especially under a net-metering arrangement, may result in revenue erosion and lost earnings opportunities for utility shareholders as well as increases in average retail rates for utility ratepayers. Regulators are considering alternative regulatory and ratemaking approaches to mitigate these financial impacts. We performed here a scoping analysis using a financial model to quantify the efficacy of mitigation approaches in reducing financial impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers. We find that impacts can be mitigated through various incremental changes to utility regulatory and business models, though the efficacy varies considerably depending on design and particular utility circumstances. Based on this analysis, we discuss tradeoffs policymakers should consider, which ultimately might need to be resolved within broader policy contexts.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The implementation of these waste-to-energy (WTE) projects would lead to the improvement of campus sustainability by minimizing waste management efforts and reducing GHG emissions via the displacement of fossil fuel usage. Technical and economic aspects of their implementation were assessed and the corresponding GHG reduction was estimated. Results showed that on-site implementation of these projects would: (1) divert 3682 L (974 gallons) of waste cooking oil to 3712 L (982 gallons) of biodiesel; (2) produce 138 tonnes of fuel pellets from 133 tonnes of waste paper (with the addition of 20.75 tonnes of plastics) to replace121 tonnes of coal; and (3) produce biogas that would be enough to replace 12,767 m{sup 3} natural gas every year from 146 tonnes of food waste. The economic analysis determined that the payback periods for the three projects would be 16 months for the biodiesel, 155 months for the fuel pellet, and 74 months for the biogas projects. The reduction of GHG emission from the implementation of the three WTE projects was determined to be 9.37 (biodiesel), 260.49 (fuel pellets), and 11.36 (biogas) tonnes of CO{sub 2}-eq per year, respectively.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.016","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 258-265","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00053-7; TRN: US16R2215040028","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.016","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470243","","Waste Management","","39"

Moreover, municipal waste services have typically been provided through natural or legal monopolies, where few incentives exist to reduce costs. It is thus vital to examine empirically the cost structure of these services in order to develop effective public policies which can make these services more cost efficient. Accordingly, this paper considers economies of size and economies of output density in the municipal waste collection sector in the New South Wales (NSW) local government system in an effort to identify the optimal size of utilities from the perspective of cost efficiency. Our results show that – as presently constituted – NSW municipal waste services are not efficient in terms of costs, thereby demonstrating that ‘bigger is not better.’ The optimal size of waste utilities is estimated to fall in the range 12,000–20,000 inhabitants. However, significant economies of output density for unsorted (residual) municipal waste collection and recycling waste collection were found, which means it is advantageous to increase the amount of waste collected, but maintaining constant the number of customers and the intervention area.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.024","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 277-286","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00063-X; TRN: US16R2217040030","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.024","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470245","","Waste Management","","39"
"Impacts of policy and market incentives for solid waste recycling in Dhaka, Bangladesh","Matter, Anne; Swisscontact: Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation, South Asian Regional Office, House No. 19, Road No. 11, Baridhara, Dhaka 1212 (Bangladesh)]; Ahsan, Mehedi; Marbach, Michelle; Zurbrügg, Christian","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; AIR POLLUTION; BANGLADESH; COAL; COMPOST; ENERGY POLICY; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; INDUSTRY; LAND POLLUTION; MARKET; METHANE; MUNICIPAL WASTES; NATURAL GAS; ORGANIC MATTER; PLASTICS; RECYCLING; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES; SANITARY LANDFILLS; SOLID WASTES","Highlights: • Bangladesh’s industry and population are growing rapidly, producing more urban waste. • Recycling reduces the solid waste management burden of Municipalities. • A wide array of informal and formal actors is involved in collection and recycling. • Demand for recycled materials and renewable energy creates market incentives. • Policy incentives exist, but they only reach the formal industry. - Abstract: Solid waste mismanagement in Dhaka, Bangladesh, illustrates a well-known market failure which can be summarized as: waste is a resource in the wrong place. Inorganic materials such as plastic or paper can be used to feed the demand for recycled materials in the industrial sector. Organic materials can be converted and used in the nutrient-starved agricultural sector which is currently heavily depending on chemical fertilizers. They are also a feedstock to generate renewable energy in the form of biogas for this energy-starved country relying on diminishing natural gas reserves and increasing import of coal. Reality however does not capitalize on this potential; instead the waste is a burden for municipal authorities who spend large portions of their budgets attempting to transport it out of the city for discharge into landfills. The major part of these materials still remains uncollected in the residential areas and is discarded indiscriminately in open spaces, polluting the residents’ living environment including water, soil and air resources, in the city and beyond. Bangladeshi authorities have, to some extent, recognized this market failure and have developed policies to encourage the development of waste recycling activities. It is also important to note that this market failure is only partial: a large, mostly informal recycling sector has developed in Bangladesh, focusing on inorganic recyclables of market value. The fact that this sector remains largely informal means that these actors perceive significant barriers to formalization. Comparatively, the organic waste recycling sector is less driven by market mechanisms. Competition from chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels is fierce and hinders the development of market opportunities for compost and renewable energy. Nevertheless commercial production of compost and biogas from organic municipal waste is formalized and benefiting from policy incentives.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.01.032","","","","United States","2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 39; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 321-328","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(15)00071-9; TRN: US16R2218040031","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2015.01.032","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470246","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470246","","Waste Management","","39"

Among the viable options is nuclear energy, enabling us to meet energy needs and sustain national development in the twenty-first century. Three essential steps Malaysia must take to introduce nuclear power into its energy mix are: energy planning, infrastructure development, and deployment. Malaysia has to face a series of challenges, including public acceptance, waste management, minimizing proliferation risk, and ensuring the security of nuclear plants and materials. Timely development of qualified and competent manpower is a key limiting factor in the development and transfer of nuclear technologies — and education and training take time, effort and money. There is a need for political will. Within the Asian region, China, Korea and Japan are in the forefront in utilizing nuclear power to meet electricity demands. Countries such as UAE, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Turkey are moving ahead with the nuclear option for electricity generation and they have begun planning and construction of nuclear power plants. Against this backdrop, what are Malaysia’s moves?

"Decentralized control of units in smart grids for the support of renewable energy supply","Sonnenschein, Michael; Lünsdorf, Ontje; Bremer, Jörg; Tröschel, Martin","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; FOSSIL FUELS; GRIDS; LOAD MANAGEMENT; PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECT; POWER PLANTS; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES; SMART GRIDS","Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand–supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10{sup 100} feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets. - Highlights: • Distributed load management for electrical vehicles supports local supply from PV. • Appliances can self-organize into so called virtual appliances for load control. • Dynamic VPPs can be controlled by extensively decentralized control centers. • Flexibilities of units can efficiently be represented by support-vector descriptions.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2014.08.004","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 52; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 40-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(14)00072-9; TRN: US16R1819049629","10.1016/J.EIAR.2014.08.004","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","22479735","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22479735","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","52"

As part of the optimization, the model identifies the most attractive waste management options. The model renders it possible to apply different optimization objectives such as minimizing costs or greenhouse gas emissions or to prioritize several objectives given different weights. A simple illustrative case is analysed, covering alternative treatments of one tonne of residual household waste: incineration of the full amount or sorting out organic waste for biogas production for either combined heat and power generation or as fuel in vehicles. The case study illustrates that the optimal solution depends on the objective and assumptions regarding the background system – illustrated with different assumptions regarding displaced electricity production. The article shows that it is feasible to combine LCA methodology with optimization. Furthermore, it highlights the need for including the integrated waste and energy system into the model.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.12.005","","","","United States","2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 38; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 486-495","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00582-0; TRN: US16R2203040017","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.12.005","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","22470232","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22470232","","Waste Management","","38"

Dean; Thomas, John F.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; Fuel economy; Emissions; Engine efficiency; Hybrid vehicle; Drive cycle","We present fuel economy and engine-out emissions for light-duty (LD) conventional and hybrid vehicles powered by conventional and high-efficiency combustion engines. Engine technologies include port fuel-injected (PFI), direct gasoline injection (GDI), reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and conventional diesel combustion (CDC). In the case of RCCI, the engine utilized CDC combustion at speed/load points not feasible with RCCI. The results, without emissions considered, show that the best fuel economies can be achieved with CDC/RCCI, with CDC/RCCI, CDC-only, and lean GDI all surpassing PFI fuel economy significantly. In all cases, hybridization significantly improved fuel economy. The engine-out hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions varied remarkably with combustion mode. The simulated engine-out CO and HC emissions from RCCI are significantly higher than CDC, but RCCI makes less NOx and PM emissions. Hybridization can improve lean GDI and RCCI cases by increasing time percentage for these more fuel efficient modes. Moreover, hybridization can dramatically decreases the lean GDI and RCCI engine out emissions. Importantly, lean GDI and RCCI combustion modes decrease exhaust temperatures, especially for RCCI, which limits aftertreatment performance to control tailpipe emissions. Overall, the combination of engine and hybrid drivetrain selected greatly affects the emissions challenges required to meet emission regulations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Energy efficiency, human behavior, and economic growth: Challenges to cutting energy demand to sustainable levels","Santarius, Tilman","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; ENERGY DEMAND; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; ENERGY POLICY; ENERGY SYSTEMS; GLOBAL ASPECTS; GREENHOUSE GASES; HOUSEHOLDS; MARKET","Increasing energy efficiency in households, transportation, industries, and services is an important strategy to reduce energy service demand to levels that allow the steep reduction of greenhouse gases, and a full fledged switch of energy systems to a renewable basis. Yet, technological efficiency improvements may generate so-called rebound effects, which may ‘eat up’ parts of the technical savings potential. This article provides a comprehensive review of existing research on these effects, raises critiques, and points out open questions. It introduces micro-economic rebound effect and suggests extending consumer-side analysis to incorporate potential ‘psychological rebound effects.’ It then discusses meso-economic rebound effects, i.e. producer-side and market-level rebounds, which so far have achieved little attention in the literature. Finally, the article critically reviews evidence for macro-economic rebound effects as energy efficiency-induced economic growth impacts. For all three categories, the article summarizes assessments of their potential quantitative scope, while pointing out remaining methodological weaknesses and open questions. As a rough “rule of thumb”, in the long term and on gross average, only half the technical savings potential of across-the-board efficiency improvements may actually be achieved in the real world. Policies that aim at cutting energy service demand to sustainable levels are well advised to take due note of detrimental behavioral and economic growth impacts, and should foster policies and measures that can contain them.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1652; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 3.

Semi-empiric numerical models of the plant components are used to predict their performances as a function of their set-point and the environmental and occupied space conditions. The optimization is performed through a graph-based algorithm that finds the set-points of the system components that minimize energy consumption and/or energy costs, while matching the user energy demands. The resulting model can be used with systems of almost any complexity, featuring both HVAC components and energy systems, and is sufficiently fast to make it applicable to real-time setting.","","","","","","United States","2015-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1648; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICNAAM-2014: International Conference on Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics 2014, Rhodes (Greece), 22-28 Sep 2014; Other Information: (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: vpage(s)","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; CODEN: APCPCS; TRN: US15A3053096819","10.1063/1.4912790","","2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","22391123","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22391123","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1648"
"The heavy-duty vehicle future in the United States: A parametric analysis of technology and policy tradeoffs","Askin, Amanda Christine; Barter, Garrett; West, Todd H.; Manley, Dawn Kataoka","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; heavy duty vehicle; natural gas vehicle; emissions; petroleum; consumer choice","Here, we present a parametric analysis of factors that can influence advanced fuel and technology deployments in U.S. Class 7–8 trucks through 2050. The analysis focuses on the competition between traditional diesel trucks, natural gas vehicles (NGVs), and ultra-efficient powertrains. Underlying the study is a vehicle choice and stock model of the U.S. heavy-duty vehicle market. Moreover, the model is segmented by vehicle class, body type, powertrain, fleet size, and operational type. We find that conventional diesel trucks will dominate the market through 2050, but NGVs could have significant market penetration depending on key technological and economic uncertainties. Compressed natural gas trucks conducting urban trips in fleets that can support private infrastructure are economically viable now and will continue to gain market share. Ultra-efficient diesel trucks, exemplified by the U.S. Department of Energy's SuperTruck program, are the preferred alternative in the long haul segment, but could compete with liquefied natural gas (LNG) trucks if the fuel price differential between LNG and diesel increases. However, the greatest impact in reducing petroleum consumption and pollutant emissions is had by investing in efficiency technologies that benefit all powertrains, especially the conventional diesels that comprise the majority of the stock, instead of incentivizing specific alternatives.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

However, most of the policies are not properly executed because they do not consider various factors from the urban level perspective. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a dynamic analysis of an urban-based low-carbon policy using system dynamics, with a specific focus on housing and green space. This study was conducted in the following steps: (i) establishing the variables of urban-based greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions; (ii) creating a stock/flow diagram of urban-based GHGs emissions; (iii) conducting an information analysis using the system dynamics; and (iv) proposing the urban-based low-carbon policy. If a combined energy policy that uses the housing sector (30%) and the green space sector (30%) at the same time is implemented, 2020 CO{sub 2} emissions will be 7.23 million tons (i.e., 30.48% below 2020 business-as-usual), achieving the national carbon emissions reduction target (26.9%). The results of this study could contribute to managing and improving the fundamentals of the urban-based low-carbon policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","","","","","","United States","2015-02-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1644; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IC-ININFO 2014: 4.

"Is adaptation a local responsibility?","Nalaua, Johanna; Preston, Benjamin L.; Maloney, Megan C.","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Climate change; Adaptation; Local scale; Multi-level governance; Australia","Adaptation is now strongly embedded in the societal discourse regarding the management of climate risk. In this discourse, adaptation planning and implementation at the local level are seen as particularly important for developing robust responses to climate change. However, it is not clear whether the mantra that adaptation is local holds true given the multi-level nature of climate risk governance. Using a multi-method approach, this paper examines the extent to which adaptation should be framed as a local issue and, specifically, the role of local government in adaptation relative to other actors. In so doing, the paper first explores the extent to which the local framing of adaptation is embedded in the international adaptation literature. This is followed by a specific case study from Southeast Queensland, Australia, which focuses on the critical examination of the processes of responsibility shifting and taking among actors involved in coastal adaptation planning. Results indicate the assumption that adaptation is local remains widely held in adaptation science, although counter arguments can be readily identified. Interviews with adaptation actors revealed unclear divisions of responsibility for climate change adaptation as a significant constraint on actors willingness to implement adaptation. Additionally, attributing responsibility for adaptation to local actors might not necessarily be a robust strategy, due to the existence of particularly strong constraints and value conflicts at local levels of governance. Greater appreciation by researchers and practitioners for the interactions between local actors and those at higher levels of governance in shaping response capacity may contribute to more equitable and effective allocations of responsibilities for adaptation action.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Recognising this knowledge gap, we employed the systemic review approach to construct a framework of roles of SIA practitioners from literature. Our conceptual framework encompasses eleven roles, namely project manager of SIA, practitioner of SIA methodologies, social researcher, social strategy developer, social impact management consultant, community developer, visionary, public involvement specialist, coordinator, SIA researcher, and educator. Although these roles have been stratified into three overarching categories, the project, community and SIA development, they are indeed interrelated and should be examined together. The significance of this study is threefold. First, it pioneers the study of the roles of SIA practitioners in a focused and systematic manner. Second, it informs practitioners of the expectations of them thereby fostering professionalism. Third, it prepares the public for SIAs by elucidating the functions and values of the assessment. - Highlights: • We adopt systematic review to construct a framework of roles of social impact assessment (SIA) practitioners from literature. • We use three overarching categorises to stratify the eleven roles we proposed. • This work is a novel attempt to study the work as a SIA practitioner and build a foundation for further exploration. • The framework informs practitioners of the expectations on them thus reinforcing professionalism. • The framework also prepares the public for SIAs by elucidating the functions and values of the assessment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2014.09.008","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 50; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 124-133","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(14)00096-1; TRN: US15R1586017051","10.1016/J.EIAR.2014.09.008","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447509","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","50"

This work applied a cost-benefit analysis model for assessing the economic feasibility, which is important for promoting landfill mining. The model includes eight indicators of costs and nine indicators of benefits. Four landfill mining scenarios were designed and analyzed based on field data. The economic feasibility of landfill mining was then evaluated by the indicator of net present value (NPV). According to our case study of a typical old landfill mining project in China (Yingchun landfill), rental of excavation and hauling equipment, waste processing and material transportation were the top three costs of landfill mining, accounting for 88.2% of the total cost, and the average cost per unit of stored waste was 12.7 USD ton{sup −1}. The top three benefits of landfill mining were electricity generation by incineration, land reclamation and recycling soil-like materials. The NPV analysis of the four different scenarios indicated that the Yingchun landfill mining project could obtain a net positive benefit varying from 1.92 million USD to 16.63 million USD. However, the NPV was sensitive to the mode of land reuse, the availability of energy recovery facilities and the possibility of obtaining financial support by avoiding post-closure care.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2014.09.029","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 35; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 191-198","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0956-053X; CODEN: WAMAE2; PII: S0956-053X(14)00451-6; TRN: US15R3230013151","10.1016/J.WASMAN.2014.09.029","","2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","22443610","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22443610","","Waste Management","","35"

In this article we regard debate about the meaning of effectiveness in impact assessment as an inevitable consequence of increased participation in environmental decision-making, and therefore frame effectiveness based on an inclusive democracy role to mean the extent to which impact assessment can accommodate civil society discourse. Our aim is to investigate effectiveness based on this framing by looking at one type of impact assessment – environmental impact assessment (EIA) – in two controversial project proposals: the HS2 rail network in England; and the A4DS motorway in the Netherlands. Documentary analysis and interviews held with key civil society stakeholders have been deployed to identify discourses that were mobilised in the cases. EIA was found to be able to accommodate only one out of four discourses that were identified; for the other three it did not provide the space for the arguments that characterised opposition. The conclusion in relation to debate on framings of effectiveness is that EIA will not be considered effective by the majority of stakeholders. EIA was established to support decision-making through a better understanding of impacts, so its ineffectiveness is unsurprising when its role is perceived to be broader. However, there remains a need to map discourses in different decision contexts and to analyse the extent to which the range of discourses are accommodated throughout the decision process, and the role of impact assessment in those processes, before recommendations can be made to either improve impact assessment effectiveness, or whether it is simply perceptions of effectiveness that need to be improved. - Highlights: • Effectiveness of EIA is defined in terms of its ability to accommodate discourses. • Four separate discourses were identified across two controversial cases. • EIA is considered to mobilize one out of four discourses only. • Discourse mapping is recommended to improve EIA effectiveness.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2014.08.001","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 50; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 66-73","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(14)00069-9; TRN: US15R1580017045","10.1016/J.EIAR.2014.08.001","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447503","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447503","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","50"

There are, however, differing views on the value that these verifiers add and very limited learning in EIA has been drawn from independent verifiers. This paper aims to appraise how and to what extent independent EIA follow-up verifiers add value in major construction projects in the developing country context of South Africa. A framework for appraising the role of independent verifiers was established and four South African case studies were examined through a mixture of site visits, project document analysis, and interviews. Appraisal results were documented in the performance areas of: planning, doing, checking, acting, public participating and integration with other programs. The results indicate that independent verifiers add most value to major construction projects when involved with screening EIA requirements of new projects, allocation of financial and human resources, checking legal compliance, influencing implementation, reporting conformance results, community and stakeholder engagement, integration with self-responsibility programs such as environmental management systems (EMS), and controlling records. It was apparent that verifiers could be more creatively utilized in pre-construction preparation, providing feedback of knowledge into assessment of new projects, giving input to the planning and design phase of projects, and performance evaluation. The study confirms the benefits of proponent and regulator follow-up, specifically in having independent verifiers that disclose information, facilitate discussion among stakeholders, are adaptable and proactive, aid in the integration of EIA with other programs, and instill trust in EIA enforcement by conformance evaluation. Overall, the study provides insight on how to harness the learning opportunities arising from EIA follow-up through the appointment of independent verifiers. - Highlights: • A framework for appraising the role of independent verifiers is established. • The value added to EIA follow-up by independent verifiers in South Africa is documented. • Verifiers add most value when involved with screening, checking compliance, influencing decisions and community engagement. • Verifiers could be more creatively utilized in pre-construction preparation, giving feedback, and performance evaluation.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2014.10.004","","","","United States","2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 50; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 178-189","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(14)00106-1; TRN: US15R1592017057","10.1016/J.EIAR.2014.10.004","","2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","22447515","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22447515","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","50"
"Achieving Deeper Energy Savings in Federal Energy Performance Contracts","Shonder, John A.; Nasseri, Cyrus","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; ESPC; Energy; Deep Retrofits","Legislation requires each agency of the US federal government to reduce the aggregate energy use index of its buildings by 30% by 2015, with respect to a 2003 baseline. The declining availability of appropriated funding means that energy performance contracting will be key to achieving this goal. Historically however, energy performance contracts have been able to reduce energy use by only about 20% over baseline. Achieving 30% energy reductions using performance contracting will require new approaches and a specific focus on achieving higher energy savings, both by ESCOs and by agencies. This paper describes some of the ways federal agencies are meeting this challenge, and presents results from the efforts of one agency the US General Services Administration -- to achieve deeper energy savings in conventional energy savings performance contracts.","ASHRAE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.
