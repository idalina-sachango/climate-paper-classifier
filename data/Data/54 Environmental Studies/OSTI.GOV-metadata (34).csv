"Diurnal variation of the fair-weather atmospheric electric field in Binchuan, China","Wu, Jiahao; Zou, Ziming; Chen, Tao; Li, Yunlong; Lu, Yang; Ti, Shuo; Li, Lei","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric electric field; diurnal variation under fair-weather; aerosol concentration; sunrise and sunset effect","With the purpose of understanding the variation of fair-weather atmospheric electric field, the vertical component of atmospheric electric field (recorded as Ez) has been measured in the town Binchuan (25°50'N, 100°34'E, 1438.7 m asl) of Dali city, Yunnan, China from June 14, 2017 to December 1, 2020. Automatic measured visual range is used as a proxy of aerosol concentration. The mean diurnal variation curve of the fair-weather Ez in Binchuan, having two peaks occurred at around 9LT and 20LT, shows little correlation with the well-known Carnegie Curve and other two high-latitude sites' Curves. While strong negative correlation between fair-weather Ez and visual range is found, indicating the variation of fair-weather is dominated by aerosol concentration. The main source of aerosol concentration variation probably sunrise and sunset effect. We support our findings by comparing Ez, visual range with sunrise and sunset times. The peaks (troughs) of Ez (visual range) are proved to have weak correlations with anthropogenic pollution through comparing the Ez, visual range under workdays and holidays.","Elsevier","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Probabilistic feasibility assessment of sequestration reliance for climate targets","Matamala, Yolanda; Flores, Francisco; Arriet, Andrea; Khan, Zarrar; Feijoo, Felipe","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; nationally determined contributions; Paris agreement; chance constraint; carbon neutrality; carbon dioxide capture and storage","Countries worldwide are transforming their energy systems to achieve Carbon-Neutrality. Investing in renewable resources-based technologies and implementing Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are common strategies to achieve higher sequestration levels. Negative emissions through Bioenergy with CCS are expected to play an essential role in the transition to full decarbonization. On top of that, biomass is a limited resource that depends on environmental factors, which create uncertainties related to the amount that can be sustainably provided to the energy system. Here this study emphasizes the relevance of variability in carbon sequestration for achieving climate targets by 2050. Here this paper proposes a probabilistic approach that integrates the Global Change Analysis Model for Latin America (GCAM-LA) with a chance constraint approach. GCAM-LA is used to assess the impact on the energy sector of different limits of sustainable biomass and carbon budget scenarios. The risk associated with exceeding the sequestration capacity of a given region is modeled via Chance Constraint. Results show that electrification is an appropriate long-term decarbonization strategy. It smoothes the effects of uncertainty in sequestration capacity and responds to end-user demands. For this case study, higher levels of electrification are obtained at likelihood levels >66% for end-use sectors.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Cost and Life Cycle Analysis for Deep CO <sub>2</sub> Emissions Reduction for Steel Making: Direct Reduced Iron Technologies","Zang, Guiyan; Sun, Pingping; Elgowainy, Amgad; Bobba, Pallavi; McMillan, Colin; Ma, Ookie; Podkaminer, Kara; Rustagi, Neha; Melaina, Marc; Koleva, Mariya","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; CO2 emissions; direct reduced iron; energy switching; life cycle analysis; steelmaking; techno-economic analysis","We report that among heavy industrial sectors worldwide, the steel industry ranks first in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Technologies that produce direct reduced iron (DRI) enable the industry to reduce emissions or even approach net-zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for steel production. This study uses comprehensive cradle to gate (CTG) life cycle analysis (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) to evaluate the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of three DRI technologies. Compared to the baseline of blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) technology for steel making, using NG to produce DRI has the potential to reduce CTG CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 33%. When 83% or 100% renewable H<sub>2</sub> is used for DRI production, DRI technologies can potentially reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 57% and 67%, respectively, compared to baseline BF-BOF technology. However, the renewable H<sub>2</sub> application for DRI increases the levelized cost of steel (LCOS). When renewable natural gas (RNG) and clean electricity are used for steel production, the CTG CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of all the DRI technologies can potentially be reduced by more than 90% compared to the baseline BF-BOF technology, although the LCOS depends largely on the cost of RNG and clean electricity.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most studies characterizing the effect of plant genotype on root microbiota undersample host genetic diversity and grow plants outside of their native ranges, making the associations between host and microbes difficult to interpret. Here, we characterized the root microbiota of a large diversity panel of switchgrass, a North American native C4 bioenergy crop, in three field locations spanning its native range. Our data, composed of 1,961 samples, suggest that field location is the primary determinant of microbiome composition; however, substantial heritable variation is widespread across bacterial taxa, especially those in the Sphingomonadaceae family. Despite diverse compositions, relatively few highly prevalent taxa make up the majority of the switchgrass root microbiota, a large fraction of which is shared across sites. Local genotypes preferentially recruit/filter for local microbes, supporting the idea of affinity between local plants and their microbiota. Using genome-wide association, we identified loci impacting the abundance of >400 microbial strains and found an enrichment of genes involved in immune responses, signaling pathways, and secondary metabolism. We found loci associated with over half of the core microbiota (i.e., microbes in >80% of samples), regardless of field location. Finally, we show a genetic relationship between a basal plant immunity pathway and relative abundances of root microbiota. Furthermore, this study brings us closer to harnessing and manipulating beneficial microbial associations via host genetics.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Texas at Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Seasonal and Morphological Controls on Nitrate Retention in Arctic Deltas","Knights, Deon; Piliouras, Anastasia; Schwenk, Jon; Hariharan, Jayaram; Russoniello, Christopher","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Estimates of nitrate loading to the Arctic Ocean are limited by the lack of field observations within deltas partly due to logistical constraints. To overcome this limitation, we use a remote sensing framework to estimate retention of nitrate in Arctic deltas. We achieve this by coupling hydrological and biogeochemical process models at the network scale for five major Arctic deltas. Binary masks of delta channels were used to simulate flow direction and magnitude through networks. Models were parameterized using historical and seasonal observations. Simulated nitrate retention ranged from 2.9% to 15% of the incoming load. Retention rates were largest during winter but smallest during spring conditions when increased discharges export large nitrate masses to the coast. Under future climate scenarios, retention rates fall by ~1%–10%. Arctic deltas have an important effect on the magnitude of nitrate entering Arctic seas and the inclusion of processing in deltas can improve flux estimates.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Soil Respiration Responses to Throughfall Exclusion Are Decoupled From Changes in Soil Moisture for Four Tropical Forests, Suggesting Processes for Ecosystem Models","Cusack, Daniela F.; Dietterich, Lee H.; Sulman, Benjamin N.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Panama; soil carbon cycling; carbon dioxide; throughfall exclusion; CORPSE model; soil temperature; air temperature","Climatic drying is predicted for many tropical forests yet models remain poorly parameterized for these ecosystems, hampering predictions of forest-climate interactions. We applied an integrated model–experiment approach, parameterizing an ecosystem model with tropical forest observational data and comparing model predictions to a field drying manipulation. We hypothesized that drying suppresses soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes (i.e., respiration) in relatively dry tropical forests but increases CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in wetter tropical forests by alleviating anaerobiosis. We measured soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes during wet-dry cycles from 2015 to 2022 in four Panamanian forests that vary in rainfall and soil fertility. Measured soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes declined in the dry season and peaked in the early wet season ahead of peak soil moisture, resulting in lower soil moisture optima for respiration than previously modeled. We then parameterized the model using field data and the new moisture-respiration response functions. The updated model predicted increased soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes with drying in wetter and fertile forests and suppressed fluxes in drier, infertile forests. In contrast to model predictions, a chronic throughfall exclusion experiment initially suppressed soil respiration across forests, with sustained suppression for four years in the wettest forest only (-28% ± 4% during the dry season). In the fertile forest, drying eventually elevated CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes over this period (+75% ± 28% during the late wet season). The unexpected negative drying effect in the wettest, infertile forest could have resulted from reduced vertical flushing of nutrients into soils. Including hydro-nutrient interactions in ecosystem models could improve predictions of tropical forest-climate feedbacks.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Changes in belowground fungal communities and associated functions will inevitably follow. Therefore, we sought to investigate the relative importance of two important tree characteristics—mycorrhizal type [ectomycorrhizal (EcM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)] and leaf habit (deciduous or evergreen) on soil fungal community composition and organic matter cycling. We sampled soil in the organic and mineral horizons beneath two AM-associated (Fraxinus americana and Thuja occidentalis) and two ECM-associated tree species (Betula alleghaniensis and Tsuga canadensis), with an evergreen and deciduous species in each mycorrhizal group. To characterize fungal communities and organic matter decomposition beneath each tree species, we sequenced the ITS1 region of fungal DNA and measured the potential activity of carbon- and nitrogen-targeting extracellular enzymes. Each tree species harbored distinct fungal communities, supporting the need to consider both mycorrhizal type and leaf habit. However, between tree characteristics, mycorrhizal type better predicted fungal communities. Across fungal guilds, saprotrophic fungi were the most important group in shaping fungal community differences in soils beneath all tree species. The effect of leaf habit on carbon- and nitrogen-targeting hydrolytic enzymes depended on tree mycorrhizal association in the organic horizon, while oxidative enzyme activities were higher beneath EcM-associated trees across both soil horizons and leaf habits.","Springer","","Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","University of Wisconsin Madison Biotechnology Center","United States","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ecosystems","","Medium: ED","","","SC0020228","Journal ID: ISSN 1432-9840","10.1007/s10021-023-00840-6","","2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","1971371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1971371","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1971371","Ecosystems","",""

Here, future projections of hurricane activity (1980–2100), downscaled from multiple climate models using a synthetic hurricane model, show an enhanced hurricane frequency for the Gulf and lower East coast regions. The increase in coastal hurricane frequency is driven primarily by changes in steering flow, which can be attributed to the development of an upper-level cyclonic circulation over the western Atlantic. The latter is part of the baroclinic stationary Rossby waves forced mainly by increased diabatic heating in the eastern tropical Pacific, a robust signal across the multimodel ensemble. Last, these heating changes also play a key role in decreasing wind shear near the U.S. coast, further aggravating coastal hurricane risk enhanced by the physically connected steering flow changes.","AAAS","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Under unperturbed atmospheric conditions, the regional aerosol regime in the ENA varies seasonally due to different seasonal surface-ocean biogenic emissions, removal processes, and meteorological regimes. However, during periods when the marine boundary layer aerosol in the ENA is impacted by particles transported from continental sources, aerosol properties within the marine boundary layer change significantly, affecting the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we investigate the impact of long-range transported continental aerosol on the regional aerosol regime in the ENA using data collected at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility on Graciosa Island in 2017 during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) campaign. We develop an algorithm that integrates number concentrations of particles with optical particle dry diameter (D<sub>p</sub>) between 100 and 1000 nm, single scattering albedo, and black carbon concentration to identify multiday events (with duration >24 consecutive hours) of long-range continental aerosol transport in the ENA. In 2017, we detected nine multiday events of long-range transported particles that correspond to ~7.5 % of the year. For each event, we perform HYSPLIT 10 d backward trajectories analysis, and we evaluate CALIPSO aerosol products to assess, respectively, the origins and compositions of aerosol particles arriving at the ENA site. Subsequently, we group the events into three categories, (1) mixture of dust and marine aerosols, (2) mixture of marine and polluted continental aerosols from industrialized areas, and (3) biomass burning aerosol from North America and Canada, and we evaluate their influence on aerosol population and cloud condensation nuclei in terms of potential activation fraction and concentrations at supersaturation of 0.1 % and 0.2 %. The arrival of plumes dominated by the mixture of dust and marine aerosol in the ENA in the winter caused significant increases in baseline N<sub>tot</sub>. Simultaneously, the baseline particle size modes and CCN potential activation fraction remained almost unvaried, while cloud condensation nuclei concentrations increased proportionally to N<sub>tot</sub>. Events dominated by a mixture of marine and polluted continental aerosols in spring, fall, and winter led to a statistically significant increase in baseline N<sub>tot</sub>, a shift towards larger particular sizes, a higher CCN potential activation fractions, and cloud condensation nuclei concentrations of >170 % and up to 240 % higher than during baseline regime. Finally, the transported aerosol plumes characterized by elevated concentration of biomass burning aerosol from continental wildfires detected in the summertime did not statistically contribute to increase baseline aerosol particle concentrations in the ENA. However, particle diameters were larger than under baseline conditions, and CCN potential activation fractions were >75 % higher. Consequentially, cloud concentration nuclei concentrations increased by ~115 % during the period affected by the biomass burning events. Our results suggest that, through the year, multiday events of long-range continental aerosol transport periodically affect the ENA and represent a significant source of CCN in the marine boundary layer. Based on our analysis, in 2017, the multiday aerosol plume transport dominated by a mixture of dust and marine aerosol, a mixture of marine and polluted continental aerosols, and biomass burning aerosols caused increases in the NCCN baseline regime of, respectively, 6.6 %, 8 %, and 7.4 % at SS 0.1 % (and, respectively, 6.5 %, 8.2 %, and 7.3 % at SS 0.2 %) in the ENA.","Copernicus GmbH","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here we compared TBM representation of the vertical gradients of key leaf traits with measurements made in a tropical forest in Panama, and then quantified the impact of the observed gradients on simulated canopy scale CO<sub>2</sub> and water fluxes. Comparison between observed and TBM trait gradients showed divergence that impacted canopy scale simulations of water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange. Notably, the ratio between the dark respiration rate and the maximum carboxylation rate was lower near the ground than at the top-of-canopy, leaf-level water-use efficiency was markedly higher at the top-of-canopy, and the decrease in maximum carboxylation rate from the top-of-canopy to the ground was less than TBM assumptions. The representation of the gradients of leaf traits in TBMs is typically derived from measurements made within-individual plants, or, for some traits, assumed constant due to a lack of experimental data. Our work shows that these assumptions are not representative of the trait gradients observed in species-rich, complex tropical forests.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Field-scale dynamics of planting dates in the US Corn Belt from 2000 to 2020","Deines, Jillian M.; Swatantran, Anu; Ye, Dening; Myers, Brent; Archontoulis, Sotirios; Lobell, David B.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; planting dates; maize/corn; soybeans; US corn belt; Landsat; google earth engine; remote sensing","Crop planting dates are a dynamic feature of agricultural systems that respond to short- and long-term climate signals, crop and cultivar selection, and technology changes. Planting date records are essential for yield gap analyses, accurate crop modeling, and tracking farmer adaptations to weather and climate change. Although planting dates have high variation at local scales due to heterogeneity in farm resources and decision-making, available long-term data on planting dates is largely restricted to aggregated regional statistics or, at best, satellite-derived datasets with limited spatiotemporal extent and at resolutions unable to distinguish individual fields (> 250 m). Here, we generated retrospective annual field-scale (30 m) planting date maps for both maize and soybeans spanning 2000-2020 across a 12 state region in the United States Corn Belt based on Landsat satellite data and a large ground sample of over 28,000 maize and soybean fields. Using training data from 2015-2020 for model selection, we found that planting date predictions improved with harmonic regression of Landsat data and additional annual weather covariates. The preferred random forests model approximately doubled performance compared to a null model based on state median planting dates, capturing 47% of field-level variation for maize (mean absolute error, MAE = 7.4 days) and 44% for soybeans (MAE = 7.5 days) against held-out ground truth test data for 2008-2014. We also evaluated the full 2000-2020 dataset with state agricultural statistics, finding strong agreement with median planting dates for maize (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.76, MAE = 4.4 days) and slightly lower agreement for soybeans (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.65, MAE = 5.4 days) when aggregated to the state level. We then used this new dataset to analyze environmental determinants of planting dates at a finer-scale than previously possible, controlling for unobserved variation at the sub-state district level. We found that during 2000-2020, each standard deviation increase in rainfall delayed planting by ~ 2.5 days, and fields with higher soil productivity ratings tended to be planted earlier. We did not find meaningful trends over the last two decades in planting dates for maize or soybeans, in contrast to trends towards earlier planting dates late last century and predicted for this period in climate adaptation studies. We hypothesize increases in early season rainfall may have inhibited these shifts towards earlier planting. Remotely sensed planting dates will be a useful tool for yield gap analyses, crop simulation modeling, and ongoing assessment of climate adaptation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Physics informed deep neural network embedded in a chemical transport model for the Amazon rainforest","Sharma, Himanshu; Shrivastava, Manish; Singh, Balwinder","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atmospheric chemistry","Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are fine particles in the atmosphere, which interact with clouds, radiation and affect the Earth’s energy budget. SOA formation involves chemistry in gas phase, aqueous aerosols, and clouds. Simulating these chemical processes involve solving a stiff set of differential equations, which are computationally expensive steps for three-dimensional chemical transport models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are universal function approximators that could be used to represent the complex nonlinear changes in aerosol physical and chemical processes; however, key challenges such as generalizability to extended time periods, preservation of mass balance, simulating sparse model outputs, and maintaining physical constraints have limited their use in atmospheric chemistry. Here, we develop an approach of using a physics-informed DNN that overcomes previous such challenges and demonstrates its applicability for the chemical formation processes of isoprene epoxydiol SOA (IEPOX-SOA) over the Amazon rainforest. The DNN is trained with data generated by simulating IEPOX-SOA over the entire atmospheric column, using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The trained DNN is then embedded within WRF-Chem to replace the computationally expensive default solver of IEPOX-SOA formation. The trained DNN predictions generalizes well with the default model simulation of the IEPOX-SOA mass concentrations and its size distribution (20 size bins) over several days of simulations in both dry and wet seasons. The embedded DNN reduces the computational expense of WRF-Chem by a factor of 2. Our approach shows promise in terms of application to other computationally expensive chemistry solvers in climate models.","Springer Nature","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Observations of Offshore Internal Boundary Layers","Krishnamurthy, R.; Fernando, H. S.; Alappattu, D.; Creegan, E.; Wang, Q.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Doppler lidar; atmospheric science; offshore","The growth of the marine internal boundary layer (MIBL, height h<sub>i</sub>) with the shore-normal distance x, is a topic of continuing interest because of its applications in coastal dispersion, offshore wind farm siting, coastal air-sea fluxes and in evaporative ducting. Available data on MIBL are only scarce, given its difficult to measure the variability of coastal winds. During Coupled Air-Sea Processes and Electromagnetic Research (CASPER) campaigns an array of instrumentation was deployed to measure offshore spatial variability and its effect on electromagnetic wave propagation. Meteorological sensors (flux towers and remote sensing) were deployed along the coast of Point Mugu, California, on a research vessel and FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP) provided surface layer and boundary layer observations. In this article, measurements from multiple remote sensing instruments, such as synchronized triple Doppler lidars, small boat operations with tethered lifting system, and radiosondes provide a holistic view of the MIBL growth and its spatial variability from the coast. A convective and stable MIBL observed during two intensive operating period days showed distinct growth characteristics off the coast of Point-Mugu. During stable stratified atmospheric conditions, an MIBL was observed at least up to 47 km from the coast. The growth of the MIBL within the nearshore adjustment zone was influenced by surrounding atmospheric, oceanographic, and topographic conditions. A new parameterization scheme is developed based on advection-diffusion balance equations accounting for upstream turbulence and compared with h<sub>i</sub> observations from Doppler lidar and profiles from small boat. An evaluation of existing IBL theories was also conducted.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Simulating the Transport and Rupture of Pollen in the Atmosphere","Subba, Tamanna; Zhang, Yingxiao; Steiner, Allison L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; biological particles; clouds; aerosols","Pollen, one type of primary biological aerosol particle (PBAP), is emitted from the terrestrial biosphere and can undergo physical changes in the atmosphere via particle rupture. To examine the fate of pollen and its atmospheric processing, a pollen emission and transport scheme is coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). We simulate the emission of pollen and its impacts on the cloud properties and precipitation in the Southern Great Plains from 12 to 19 April 2013, a period with both high pollen emissions and convective activity. We conduct a suite of ensemble runs that simulate primary pollen and three different pollen rupture mechanisms that generate subpollen particles, including (a) high humidity-induced surface rupture, (b) high humidity-induced in-atmosphere plus surface rupture, and (c) lightning-induced rupture, where in-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning strikes trigger pollen rupture events. When relative humidity is high (>80%), coarse primary pollen (~1 μg m<sup>–3</sup>) is converted into fine subpollen particles (~1.2e<sup>–4</sup> μg m<sup>–3</sup>), which produces 80% more subpollen particles than lightning-induced rupture. The in-atmosphere humidity-driven rupture predominantly produces subpollen particles, which is further enhanced during a frontal thunderstorm. During strong convection, vertical updrafts lift primary pollen and subpollen particles (~0.5e<sup>–4</sup> μg m<sup>–3</sup>) to the upper troposphere (~12 km) and laterally transports the ruptured pollen in the anvil top outflow. In regions of high pollen and strong convection, ruptured pollen can influence warm cloud formation by decreasing low cloud (<4 km) cloud water mixing ratios and increasing ice phase hydrometeors aloft (>10 km)","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

MMFs can lead to more severe or differing impacts than single-mechanism floods. As a result, comprehensive risk assessments require the ability to assess the multivariate probabilistic behaviors of hazards from MMFs. Here this study introduces a novel Bayesian-motivated approach for the probabilistic assessment of hurricane-induced hazards from the combination of the surge, precipitation, tides, and river antecedent flow. A Bayesian network (BN) is developed to capture the physical (conditional) relationship between variables and facilitate the generation of a hazard curve for river discharge that captures the contributions from multiple flood drivers. A case study located along the Delaware River is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Five computationally efficient representative predictive models are developed to estimate the conditional distributions required for the BN as a means of demonstrating the overall framework. The predictive models used in this study act as placeholders and can be replaced with more sophisticated and high-fidelity models depending on the desired accuracy level. While the predictive models are intended to be representative and illustrative, the model performance is evaluated using three historical storms that affected the area. Overall, the proposed framework is shown to be transparent, effective, and adaptable.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Eleven solutions were tested, including point sensor networks and scanning/imaging solutions. Results indicated a 90% probability of detection (POD) of 3–30 kg CH<sub>4</sub>/h; 6 of 11 solutions achieved a POD < 6 kg CH<sub>4</sub>/h, although uncertainty was high. Four had true positive rates > 50%. False positive rates ranged from 0 to 79%. Six solutions estimated emission rates. For a release rate of 0.1–1 kg/h, the solutions’ mean relative errors ranged from –44% to +586% with single estimates between –97% and +2077%, and 4 solutions’ upper uncertainty exceeding +900%. Above 1 kg/h, mean relative error was –40% to +93%, with two solutions within ±20%, and single-estimate relative errors were from –82% to +448%. The large variability in performance between CM solutions, coupled with highly uncertain detection, detection limit, and quantification results, indicates that the performance of individual CM solutions should be well understood before relying on results for internal emissions mitigation programs or regulatory reporting.","American Chemical Society","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM)","","United States","2023-03-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 57 Journal Issue: 14","","Medium: X; Size: p. 5794-5805","","","FE0031873","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c09235","","2023-04-13T00:00:00Z","1963723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1963723","","Environmental Science and Technology","14","57"

Multi-modal micro-spectroscopy analysis of samples during the background case reveals a broadening of chemically specific size distribution above cloud top with a high abundance of sulfate and core-shell morphology, suggesting possible cloud processing of aerosols. The pollution case also indicates a broadening of size distribution at the upper cloud layer with the dominance of carbonaceous aerosol, which suggests the potential of carbonaceous aerosols for Arctic cloud formation.

"Synoptic Drivers of Atmospheric River Induced Precipitation Near Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica","Baiman, Rebecca; Winters, Andrew C.; Lenaerts, Jan; Shields, Christine A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Atmospheric rivers (ARs) that reach the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) transport anomalous moisture from lower latitudes and can impact the AIS via extreme precipitation and increased downward longwave radiation. ARs contribute significantly to the interannual variability of precipitation over the AIS and thus are likely to play a key role in understanding future changes in the surface mass balance of the AIS. Dronning Maud Land (DML) is one of four maxima in AR frequency over coastal East Antarctica, with AR precipitation explaining 77% of the interannual variability in precipitation for this region. We employ a 16-node self-organizing map (SOM) trained with MERRA-2 sea-level pressure anomalies to identify synoptic-scale environments associated with landfalling ARs in and around DML. Node composites of atmospheric variables reveal common drivers of precipitation associated with ARs reaching DML including anomalous high-low surface pressure couplets, anomalously high integrated water vapor, and coastal barrier jets. Using a quasi-geostrophic framework, we find that upward vertical motion associated with the occlusion process of attendant cyclones dominates atmospheric lift in AR environments. We further identify mechanisms that explain the variability in AR precipitation intensity across nodes, such as the lift associated with the occlusion process of attendant cyclones and the spatial coincidence of ascent induced by the occlusion process and frontogenesis. Here, the latter suggests that ARs making landfall during the mature phase of cyclogenesis result in higher precipitation intensity compared to landfalling ARs that occur during the occluded phase.","American Geophysical Union","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2023-03-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres; Journal Volume: 128; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e2022JD037859","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-897X","10.1029/2022jd037859","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970355","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970355","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","7","128"

In this report we measured the physical properties of a silt loam in response to the incorporation of polyester fibers and polypropylene granules over a wide range of concentrations. We further elucidated the underlying mechanisms through determining the role of microplastic shape and the baseline effects from the amendment of soil particles. The incorporation of microplastics into soil tended to increase contact angle and saturated hydraulic conductivity, decrease bulk density and water holding capacity, while did not affect aggregate stability. Polyester fibers affected soil physical properties more profoundly than polypropylene granules, due to the vastly different shape of fibers from that of soil particles. However, changes in soil properties were gradual, and significant changes did not occur until a high concentration of microplastics was reached (i.e., 0.5% w/w for polyester fibers and 2% w/w for polypropylene granules). Currently, microplastic concentrations in soils not heavily polluted with plastics are far below these concentrations, and results from this study suggest that microplastics at environmentally relevant concentrations have no significant effects on soil physical properties.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Regime-oriented causal model evaluation of Atlantic–Pacific teleconnections in CMIP6","Karmouche, Soufiane; Galytska, Evgenia; Runge, Jakob; Meehl, Gerald A.; Phillips, Adam S.; Weigel, Katja; Eyring, Veronika","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The climate system and its spatio-temporal changes are strongly affected by modes of long-term internal variability, like the Pacific decadal variability (PDV) and the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV). As they alternate between warm and cold phases, the interplay between PDV and AMV varies over decadal to multidecadal timescales. Here, we use a causal discovery method to derive fingerprints in the Atlantic–Pacific interactions and to investigate their phase-dependent changes. Dependent on the phases of PDV and AMV, different regimes with characteristic causal fingerprints are identified in reanalyses in a first step. In a second step, a regime-oriented causal model evaluation is performed to evaluate the ability of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in representing the observed changing interactions between PDV, AMV and their extra-tropical teleconnections. The causal graphs obtained from reanalyses detect a direct opposite-sign response from AMV to PDV when analyzing the complete 1900–2014 period and during several defined regimes within that period, for example, when AMV is going through its negative (cold) phase. Reanalyses also demonstrate a same-sign response from PDV to AMV during the cold phase of PDV. Historical CMIP6 simulations exhibit varying skill in simulating the observed causal patterns. Generally, large-ensemble (LE) simulations showed better network similarity when PDV and AMV were out of phase compared to other regimes. Also, the two largest ensembles (in terms of number of members) were found to contain realizations with similar causal fingerprints to observations. For most regimes, these same models showed higher network similarity when compared to each other. This work shows how causal discovery on LEs complements the available diagnostics and statistical metrics of climate variability to provide a powerful tool for climate model evaluation.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); European Research Council (ERC)","","United States","2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Earth System Dynamics (Online); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 309-344","","","SC0022070; 855187","Journal ID: ISSN 2190-4987","10.5194/esd-14-309-2023","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1968255","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1968255","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1968255","Earth System Dynamics (Online)","2","14"

Several global, country-level projections of income distribution are available but most project only the Gini coefficient (a summary statistic of the distribution) or utilize the Gini along with the assumption of a lognormal distribution. We test the lognormal assumption and find that it typically underestimates income in the highest deciles and over-estimates it in others. We find that a new model based on two principal components of national time series data for income distribution provides a better fit to the data for all deciles, especially for the highest and lowest. We also construct a projection model in which the first principal component is driven by the Gini coefficient and the second captures deviations from this relationship. We use the model to project income distribution by decile for all countries for the five shared socioeconomic pathways. We find that inequality is consistently higher than projections based on the Gini and the lognormal functional form, with some countries reaching ratios of the highest to lowest income deciles that are almost three times their value using the lognormal assumption.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Biofuels derived from corn starch have offered modest life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions over fossil fuels. Here we show that capture and storage of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from corn ethanol fermentation achieves ~58% reduction in the GHG intensity (CI) of ethanol at a levelized cost of 52 $/tCO<sub>2</sub>e abated. The integration of an oxyfuel boiler enables further CO<sub>2</sub> capture at modest cost. This system yields a 75% reduction in CI to 15 gCO<sub>2</sub>e/MJ at a minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) of $\$2.24$ / gallon ($\$0.59$ /L), a $\$0.31$ /gallon ($\$0.08$ /L) increase relative to the baseline no intervention case. The levelized cost of carbon abatement is 84 $/tCO<sub>2</sub>e. Sensitivity analysis reveals that carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative ethanol can be achieved when oxyfuel carbon capture is stacked with low-CI alternatives to grid power and fossil natural gas. Conservatively, fermentation and oxyfuel CCS can reduce the CI of conventional ethanol by a net 44–50 gCO<sub>2</sub>/MJ. Full implementation of interventions explored in the sensitivity analysis would reduce CI by net 79–85 gCO<sub>2</sub>/MJ. Integrated oxyfuel and fermentation CCS is shown to be costeffective under existing U.S. policy, offering near-term abatement opportunities.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 57 Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X; Size: p. 5391-5403","","","LLNL-JRNL-836683; AC52-07NA27344","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c04784","","2023-04-06T00:00:00Z","1962718","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1962718","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","57"

Meanwhile, CFA as a large industrial waste stream in the United States (U.S.) poses significant environmental and economic burdens. Recovery of REEs from CFA is a promising solution to the REE scarcity issue and also brings opportunities for CFA management. This study demonstrates a green system for REE recovery from Class F and C CFA that consists of three modules: REE leaching using citrate, REE separation and concentration using oxalate, and zeolite synthesis using secondary wastes from Modules I and II. In Module I, ~10 and 60% REEs were leached from the Class F and C CFA samples, respectively, using citrate at pH 4. In Module II, the addition of oxalate selectively precipitated and concentrated REEs from the leachate via the formation of weddellite (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O), while other trace metals remained in solution. In Module III, zeolite was synthesized using wastes from Modules I and II. This study is characterized by the successful recovery of REEs and upcycling of secondary wastes, which addresses both REE recovery and CFA management challenges.","American Chemical Society","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2023-03-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 57 Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X; Size: p. 5414-5423","","","AR0001394; FE0031739; #2004878","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c09273","","2023-04-06T00:00:00Z","1962703","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1962703","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","57"
"Evaluating Enhanced Reservoir Evaporation Losses From CMIP6‐Based Future Projections in the Contiguous United States","Zhao, Bingjie; Kao, Shih‐Chieh; Zhao, Gang; Gangrade, Sudershan; Rastogi, Deeksha; Ashfaq, Moetasim; Gao, Huilin","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Enhanced reservoir evaporation has become an emerging concern regarding water loss, especially when compounded with the ever-increasing water demand. In this study, we evaluated the evaporation rates and losses for 678 major reservoirs (representing nearly 90% of total storage capacity) in the Contiguous United States over historical baseline (1980–2019), near-term (2020–2039), and mid-term (2040–2059) future periods. The evaporation rate was estimated using the Lake Evaporation Model (LEM), an advanced lake evaporation model that addresses both heat storage and fetch effects, driven by multi-ensemble downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects 6 (CMIP6) projections under the SSP585 emission scenario. The results project that the evaporation loss may increase by 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/yr through the research period (1980–2059). Among all regions, the Rio Grande is projected to have the largest increasing rate in the near-term and mid-term future, with values of 7.11% of 10.25%, respectively. At the seasonal scale, the most significant increase in the evaporation rate is projected during the fall. The evaporation is projected to increase faster than the streamflow over many of the regions in the southwestern US during the summer/fall, suggesting that the shortage of water will be further exacerbated. The climate models contribute the most to the variance, as compared to the other components related to the projection of evaporation losses (e.g., hydrological model, downscaling method, and historical meteorological data set). These findings demonstrate the need to consider accelerated water loss through open water evaporation in long-term water resources planning across various spatiotemporal scales.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Boundary layer moisture variability at the Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) site during marine conditions is examined at monthly and daily timescales using 5 years of ground-based observations and output from the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis model. The annual cycle of the mixed-layer total water budgets is presented to estimate the relative contribution of large-scale advection, local moisture tendency, entrainment, and precipitation to balance the moistening due to surface latent heat flux on monthly timescales. When marine conditions prevail, advection of colder and dry air from the north acts as an important moisture sink (∼ 50 % of the overall budget) during fall and winter driving the seasonality of the budget. Entrainment and precipitation contribute to the drying of the boundary layer (∼ 25 % and ∼ 15 % respectively), and the local change in moisture contributes to a small residual part. On a daily temporal scale, moist and dry mesoscale columns of vapor (∼ 10 km) are analyzed during 10 selected days of precipitating stratocumulus clouds. Adjacent moist and dry columns present distinct mesoscale features that are strongly correlated with clouds and precipitation. Dry columns adjacent to moist columns have more frequent and stronger downdrafts immediately below the cloud base. Moist columns have more frequent updrafts, stronger cloud-top cooling, and higher liquid water path and precipitation compared to the dry columns. This study highlights the complex interaction between large-scale and local processes controlling the boundary layer moisture and the importance of spatial distribution of vapor to support convection and precipitation.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Role of Tropical Cyclones in Determining ENSO Characteristics","Li, Hui; Hu, Aixue; Meehl, Gerald A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can effectively modulate global tropical cyclone (TC) activity, but the role TCs may play in determining ENSO characteristics remains unclear. Here we investigate the impact of TC winds on ENSO using a suite of Earth system model experiments where we insert TC winds, extracted from a TC-permitting high-resolution simulation, into a low-resolution model configuration with nearly no intrinsic TCs. The presence of TC winds in the model increases ENSO power and shifts ENSO frequency closer to what we observe. TCs lead to an increase of strong to extreme El Niño events seen in observations and not simulated in the low-resolution model without intrinsic TCs, mainly through enhanced zonal advection feedback and thermocline feedback. Our results indicate that TCs play a fundamental role in producing the ENSO characteristics we experience today in the climate system and point to a two-way climatological interaction between TCs and ENSO.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

However, due to its black-box nature and lack of process-based implementation, we are unsure whether LSTM makes good predictions for the right reasons. In this work, we use an explainable machine learning (ML) method, called SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to evaluate the variable importance and variable-wise temporal importance in the LSTM model prediction. In application to 30 reservoirs over the Upper Colorado River Basin, United States, we show that LSTM can accurately predict the reservoir releases with NSE ≥ 0.69 for all the considered reservoirs despite of their diverse storage sizes, functionality, elevations, etc. Additionally, SHAP indicates that storage and inflow are more influential than precipitation and temperature. Moreover, the storage and inflow show a relatively long-term influence on the release up to 7 days and this influence decreases as the lag time increases for most reservoirs. These findings from SHAP are consistent with our physical understanding. However, in a few reservoirs, SHAP gives some temporal importances that are difficult to interpret from a hydrological point of view, probably because of its ignorance of the variable interactions. SHAP is a useful tool for black-box ML model explanations, but the hydrological processes inferred from its results should be interpreted cautiously. More investigations of SHAP and its applications in hydrological modeling is needed and will be pursued in our future study.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The former has expanded poleward and into denser water and strengthened by 3–4 Sv since the mid-1970s, while the latter has contracted and weakened by a similar rate during the same period.

The western pine beetle (WPB) outbreak incited by the 2012–2015 mega-drought in the Sierra Nevada, California, U.S., could portend more frequent and/or severe bark beetle outbreaks as the temperature warms and drought frequency and intensity increase in the future. However, changes in the frequency and/or severity (resultant levels of host tree mortality) of beetle outbreaks are difficult to predict as outbreaks are complex with non-linear and eruptive processes primarily driven by interactions among beetle populations, the demography of hosts and other tree species, and climate and weather. Using an insect phenology and tree defense model, we projected the future likelihood of WPB outbreaks in the Sierra Nevada with climate drivers from different Earth System Models. Our goal was to understand how host (ponderosa pine, PIPO) recovery and future warming and drought affect the frequency and severity of WPB outbreaks and their C consequences. Our projections suggested that by 2100 the C stored in live PIPO (mean: 1.98 kg C m<sup>-2</sup>, 95% CI: 1.74–2.21 kg C m<sup>-2</sup>) will not return to levels that occurred before the 2012–2015 drought (2012: ~2.30 kg C m<sup>–2</sup>) due to future WPB outbreaks. However, differences in climate models indicate a wide range of possible WPB outbreak frequencies and severities. Our results suggest that total plot basal area is the most significant factor in the mortality rate of PIPO by WPB in any given year, followed by drought severity and temperature. High levels of host basal area, higher temperature, and extreme drought all contribute to the frequency and severity of future WPB outbreaks. While PIPO basal area may decline under increased drought and warming, limiting high-stand basal area (>60 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) may reduce the severity of future WPB outbreaks in the Sierra Nevada.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Understanding ARs in a warming climate is problematic because the AR response to climate change is tied to how the feature is defined. The Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) provides insights into this problem by comparing 16 atmospheric river detection tools (ARDTs) to a common data set consisting of high resolution climate change simulations from a global atmospheric general circulation model. ARDTs mostly show increases in frequency and intensity, but the scale of the response is largely dependent on algorithmic criteria. Across ARDTs, bulk characteristics suggest intensity and spatial footprint are inversely correlated, and most focus regions experience increases in precipitation volume coming from extreme ARs. The spread of the AR precipitation response under climate change is large and dependent on ARDT selection.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Functional variability in specific root respiration translates to autotrophic differences in soil respiration in a temperate deciduous forest","Aaron Hogan, J.; Labbé, Jessy L.; Carrell, Alyssa A.; Franklin, Jennifer; Hoyt, Kevin P.; Valverde-Barrantes, Oscar J.; Baraloto, Christopher; Warren, Jeffrey M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; belowground physiology; root functional traits; soil fungi and bacteria; soil microbial 83 nitrogen; ZeroTol; temperate forest","CO<sub>2</sub> release from forest soils (R<sub>s</sub>) is a prominent flux in the global carbon cycle. Rs is derived from roots (autotrophic respiration, R<sub>a</sub>) and microbial (heterotrophic) respiration and is highly dynamic, as it depends on edaphic and environmental conditions as well as root functional traits and microbial community composition. It is unclear how root functional traits affect root and microbial respiration rates; however, their consideration may help parse out the relative contributions of root and microbial respiration to R<sub>s</sub>. At a temperate forest site, root systems of 3–4 functional root orders and their surrounding surface soil were carefully excavated and placed into custom trays designed to repeatedly measure R<sub>s</sub> in situ on eight temperate tree species that varied in their root functional strategies and mycorrhizal affinity. R<sub>s</sub> was measured bi-weekly to monthly for nearly one year using a custom chamber attached to a gas exchange system. R<sub>s</sub> varied over time, ranging from 0.3 to 12 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Comparable root systems of the same species were excised from the soil and specific root respiration rates (R<sub>r</sub>) were measured. Rr ranged from 2.5 to 9.0 nmol g<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and was negatively correlated with root tissue density and positively related to root tissue nitrogen concentration. Using R<sub>r</sub> to estimate R<sub>a</sub>, we estimate that R<sub>a</sub> accounts for <10%, on average 2–3%, of R<sub>s</sub> for individual root systems (averaging 1.2 g dry biomass) housed in surrounding soil (average 1.3 kg dry mass) in situ; thus, Ra was roughly 20 times greater than Rh per unit mass. The contribution of R<sub>a</sub> peaked in the fall and coincided with leaf senescence of the forest canopy. A soil-sterilizing experimental treatment designed to help isolate R<sub>a</sub> in situ reduced bacterial biomass and shifted fungal community composition, but there was no reduction in Rs of the in-situ root-soil tray systems. The relative R<sub>a</sub> to R<sub>s</sub> ratio increased with root functional strategies characterized by greater specific root length and tip abundance, but also to greater root tissue density. The ratio of R<sub>a</sub> to R<sub>s</sub> also increased with warmer soil temperatures and decreased slightly with increasing soil moisture. We discuss how incorporating root functional traits as modulators of the autotrophic contribution to R<sub>s</sub> could be considered when modeling total soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from forests.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We apply a novel atmospheric energy flux analysis to diagnose late 21st century tropical rainfall shifts in a large ensemble of simulations of 21st century climate. The method reconstructs 2D spatial changes in rainfall based on horizontal shifts in the lines of zero meridional and zonal divergent energy flux, called the energy flux equator (EFE) and energy flux prime meridian (EFPM), respectively. Two main sources of future atmospheric energy flux changes, and hence rainfall shifts, are identified by the analysis: the high-latitude North Atlantic due to a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation that shifts tropical rainfall southwards over the greater Tropical Atlantic sector and eastern Pacific; and the eastern tropical Pacific due to a permanent El-Niño-like response that produces zonal shifts over the Maritime Continent and South America. To first order, the shifts in the EFE and EFPM mirror gross distributional changes in tropical precipitation, with a southward shift in rainfall over the tropical Atlantic, West Africa, and eastern tropical Pacific and an eastward shift over the Maritime Continent and western Pacific. When used to reconstruct future rainfall shifts in the tropical Atlantic and Sahel, the method reasonably represents the simulated meridional structure of rainfall shifts but does not do so for the zonal structures.</p>","IOP Publishing","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","","United Kingdom","2023-03-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research.

In the spring of 2019, this laboratory study examined how 151 adult American Shad (Alosa sapidissima) responded to different gross velocities through a wall diffuser inside a full-scale fishway entrance channel. Two velocity conditions were studied, 0.152 m/s and 0.305 m/s, both without turning vanes inside the auxiliary water channel. The fish were tracked using the passive integrated transponder telemetry technique. The results of the experiments showed no difference in American Shad behavior when exhibited to the low and high velocity treatments. Moreover, shad passed the diffuser in roughly 3 out of every 4 attempts, regardless of the treatment. However, the similarity in shad behavior and passage performance is believed to be more of a result of the similarity in flow fields that resulted from the lack of flow guidance devices inside the auxiliary water channel. Furthermore, these findings therefore highlight the importance of properly maintained flow guidance devices, an often-overlooked component of an auxiliary water system.","Taylor & Francis","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Commonly, phase shift is computed in the small blocks of the images using the fast Fourier transform. In this study, we investigate the performance and the stability of the blockwise PC method by changing the block size, the frame interval, and combinations of red, green, and blue (RGB) channels from the total sky imager (TSI) at the United States Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility's Southern Great Plains site. We find that shorter frame intervals, followed by larger block sizes, are responsible for stable estimates of the CMV, as suggested by the higher autocorrelations. The choice of RGB channels has a limited effect on the quality of CMVs, and the red and the grayscale images are marginally more reliable than the other combinations during rapidly evolving low-level clouds. The stability of CMVs was tested at different image resolutions with an implementation of the optimized algorithm on the Sage cyberinfrastructure test bed. We find that doubling the frame rate outperforms quadrupling the image resolution in achieving CMV stability. The correlations of CMVs with the wind data are significant in the range of 0.38–0.59 with a 95 % confidence interval, despite the uncertainties and limitations of both datasets. A comparison of the PC method with constructed data and the optical flow method suggests that the post-processing of the vector field has a significant effect on the quality of the CMV. The raindrop-contaminated images can be identified by the rotation of the TSI mirror in the motion field. The results of this study are critical to optimizing algorithms for edge-computing sensor systems.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

This article describes a prototype of a ground-based, vertically pointing, time-gated, time-correlated single-photon-counting lidar (referred to as the T2 lidar) developed to explore atmospheric clouds at range resolution two orders of magnitude finer than traditional atmospheric lidars. The T2 lidar emits green-light pulses (532 nm) at a repetition rate of 20.6 kHz and a pulse width of ∼650 ps, which enables the observation of aerosol and cloud layers at heights from a few hundred meters to 7.28 km above the ground level at range resolution down to 10 cm. In addition, a digital delay pulse generator controls the detector to only receive photons for a short period after each laser pulse. This time-gated technique blocks photons arriving from regions outside the target zone, thus significantly reducing the noise level and allowing observation even inside clouds. Initial observations show that the T2 lidar can detect sharp cloud boundaries and fine structures near the cloud base. Such refined measurements of cloud structure could lead to an improved understanding of microphysical processes such as droplet activation, entrainment and mixing, and precipitation.</p>","MDPI AG","","Brookhaven National Lab.

These estimates are based on “top-down” NCE outputs from the v10 Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) modeling intercomparison project (MIP), wherein an ensemble of inverse modeling groups conducted standardized experiments assimilating OCO-2 column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (X<sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>) retrievals (ACOS v10), in situ CO<sub>2</sub> measurements or combinations of these data. The v10 OCO-2 MIP NCE estimates are combined with “bottom-up” estimates of fossil fuel emissions and lateral carbon fluxes to estimate changes in terrestrial carbon stocks, which are impacted by anthropogenic and natural drivers. These flux and stock change estimates are reported annually (2015–2020) as both a global 1° x 1° gridded dataset and a country-level dataset and are available for download from the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites' (CEOS) website. Across the v10 OCO-2 MIP experiments, we obtain increases in the ensemble median terrestrial carbon stocks of 3.29–4.58 Pg CO2 yr<sup>-1 </sup>(0.90–1.25 Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>). This is a result of broad increases in terrestrial carbon stocks across the northern extratropics, while the tropics generally have stock losses but with considerable regional variability and differences between v10 OCO-2 MIP experiments.

"Cloud‐Surface Coupling Alters the Morning Transition From Stable to Unstable Boundary Layer","Su, Tianning; Li, Zhanqing; Zheng, Youtong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Due to surface heating, the morning boundary layer transits from stable to neutral or convective conditions, exerting critical influences on low tropospheric thermodynamics. Low clouds closely interact with the boundary layer development, yet their interactions bear considerable uncertainties. Our study reveals that cloud-surface coupling alters the morning transition from stable to unstable boundary layer and thus notably affects the diurnal variation of the boundary layer. Specifically, due to the reduction in surface fluxes, decoupled clouds can delay the process of eroding nocturnal inversion by 0.8-hr and even prevent the transition of the boundary layer from happening for 12% of decoupled cases, keeping the boundary layer in a stable state during the noontime. On the other hand, when clouds are coupled with the surface, cloud-top radiative cooling can directly cool the upper boundary layer to facilitate sub-cloud convection, leading to an unstable boundary layer in the earlier morning.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

A century of aggressive logging and fire suppression in combination with conditions exacerbated by climate change have created an ongoing ecological, economic, and public health emergency. Between commercial harvests on California’s working forestlands and the increasing number of acres the state treats each year for fire risk reduction and carbon sequestration, California forests generate millions of tons of woody residues annually—residues that are typically left or burned in the field. State policymakers have turned to biomass electricity generation as a key market for woody biomass in the hope that it can support sustainable forest management activities while also providing low-carbon renewable electricity. However, open questions surrounding the climate and air pollution performance of electricity generation from woody biomass have made it difficult to determine how best to manage the risks and opportunities posed by forest residues. The California Biomass Residue Emissions Characterization (C-BREC) model offers a spatially-explicit life cycle assessment framework to rigorously and transparently establish the climate and air pollution impacts of biopower from forest residues in California under current conditions. The C-BREC model characterizes the variable emissions from different biomass supply chains as well as the counterfactual emissions from prescribed burn, wildfire, and decay avoided by residue mobilization. We find that the life cycle ‘carbon footprint’ of biopower from woody residues generated by recent forest treatments in California ranges widely—from comparable with solar photovoltaic on the low end to comparable with natural gas on the high end. This variation stems largely from the heterogeneity in the fire and decay conditions these residues would encounter if left in the field, with utilization of residue that would otherwise have been burned in place offering the best climate and air quality performance. California’s energy and forest management policies should account for this variation to ensure desired climate benefits are achieved.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

When a pyrocumulonimbus cloud develops and is maintained over a period of time, it can inject significant aerosol into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, resulting in a longer-term (months to years) occurrence of aerosol in the stratosphere. In this work, we investigate the British Columbia wildfires on 12–13 August 2017 using a multi-scale simulation framework. We use the output of a physics-based wildfire model (FIRETEC) with parameterized energy, particle, and gas emissions to drive the upper atmospheric aerosol mass injection within a regional cloud resolving model (HIGRAD). We demonstrate that vertical motions produced by latent heat release of the condensation of ice and cloud particles within the PyroCbs induce another 5 km of lifting of the simulated aerosol plume. Primary black carbon and organic aerosols (OAs) alone may not be enough to explain the observed aerosol burden, thus we show that secondary OA produced via condensation of gases by the fires, ash, and possibly dust can enhance lofted aerosol mass. A simulation with all emission mechanisms active, driven by the observed fuel load and environmental conditions, reasonably reproduces an aerosol profile inferred from observational data.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Emissions in the CMIP6 data occur at higher latitudes than in the CMIP5 data for all scenarios, years, and emitted species. A comparative simulation with the chemistry–climate model ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) reveals that the difference in nitrogen oxide emission distribution leads to reduced overall ozone changes due to aviation in the CMIP6 scenarios because in those scenarios the distribution of emissions is partly shifted towards the chemically less active higher latitudes. The radiative forcing associated with aviation ozone is 7.6 % higher, and the decrease in methane lifetime is 5.7 % larger for the year 2015 when using the CMIP5 latitudinal distribution of emissions compared to when using the CMIP6 distribution. We do not find a statistically significant difference in the radiative forcing associated with aviation aerosol emissions.

In this study, nearly 25 years of ground-based radar and lidar observations of vertical cloud profiles at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site are utilized to derive cloud vertical overlap characteristics from the Cloud Type (CLDTYPE) data product. Here, the cloud vertical overlap characteristics are further separated by cloud regime by considering seven cloud types (i.e., low cloud, congestus, deep convection, altocumulus, altostratus, cirrostratus, and cirrus) as well as periods of shallow cumulus. The decorrelation length scale (i.e., exponential transition from maximum to random overlap with layer separation) is found to vary by cloud regime, ranging between 0.04 km for cirrostratus paired with cirrus to 4.58 km for low cloud paired with cirrus at SGP. Cloud vertical overlap characteristics are also considered for other ARM sites including the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP), North Slope of Alaska (NSA), and Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) sites amongst other shorter term ARM deployments globally. The decorrelation length scale ranged globally from 1.03 km in the Arctic Ocean to 3.06 km in Manacapuru, Brazil. Globally, the decorrelation length scale by cloud regime exhibited similarities (e.g., for cirrus paired with cirrus) and differences (e.g., congestus paired with cirrus). The results could help inform development of cloud vertical overlap assumptions within operational numerical weather prediction models and potentially improve prediction of radiative fluxes for weather, climate, and renewable energy forecasting.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Revisiting Interior Water Mass Responses to Surface Forcing Changes and the Subsequent Effects on Overturning in the Southern Ocean","Tesdal, Jan‐Erik; MacGilchrist, Graeme A.; Beadling, Rebecca L.; Griffies, Stephen M.; Krasting, John P.; Durack, Paul J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Two coupled climate models, differing primarily in horizontal resolution and treatment of mesoscale eddies, were used to assess the impact of perturbations in wind stress and Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) melting on the Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (SO MOC), which plays an important role in global climate regulation. The largest impact is found in the SO MOC lower limb, associated with the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which in both models is enhanced by wind and weakened by AIS meltwater perturbations. Even though both models under the AIS melting perturbation show similar AABW transport reductions of 4–5 Sv (50%–60%), the volume deflation of AABW south of 30°S is four times greater in the higher resolution simulation (-20 vs. -5 Sv). Water mass transformation (WMT) analysis reveals that surface-forced dense water formation on the Antarctic shelf is absent in the higher resolution and reduced by half in the lower resolution model in response to the increased AIS melting. However, the decline of the AABW volume (and its inter-model difference) far exceeds the surface-forced WMT changes alone, which indicates that the divergent model responses arise from interactions between changes in surface forcing and interior mixing processes. This model divergence demonstrates an important source of uncertainty in climate modeling, and indicates that accurate shelf processes together with scenarios accounting for AIS melting are necessary for robust projections of the deep ocean's response to anthropogenic forcing.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Increased exposure of coastal cities to sea-level rise due to internal climate variability","Becker, M.; Karpytchev, M.; Hu, A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Physical oceanography; Projection and prediction","Adaptation to future sea-level rise is based on projections of continuously improving climate models. These projections are accompanied by inherent uncertainties, including those due to internal climate variability (ICV). The ICV arises from complex and unpredictable interactions within and between climate-system components, rendering its impact irreducible. Although neglecting this uncertainty can lead to an underestimation of future sea-level rise, its estimation and impacts have not been fully explored. Combining the Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble experiments with power-law statistics, we show that, by 2100, if the ICV uncertainty reaches its upper limit, new sea-level-rise hotspots would appear in Southeast Asian megacities (Chennai, Kolkata, Yangon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Manila), in western tropical Pacific Islands and the Western Indian Ocean. Here, the better the ICV uncertainty is taken into account and correctly estimated, the more effective adaptation strategies can be elaborated with confidence and actions to follow.","Nature Publishing Group","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2023-03-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Climate Change; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 367-374","","","SC0022070; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1758-678X","10.1038/s41558-023-01603-w","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970360","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970360","","Nature Climate Change","4","13"

In this study, we used an extended version of the Dynamic Recycling Model to identify moisture sources and quantified their contributions to the long-term trends of the Great Lakes Region (GLR) precipitation. Results show that the mid-Pacific is the main moisture source to the GLR precipitation except in the summertime when terrestrial sources dominate. We explained the double peaks in seasonal precipitation cycle by dissecting its moisture sources. Moisture from the Great Plains is responsible for the June peak, and from the mid-Pacific, the Great Plains and the Central America for the September peak. We found a statistically significant increasing trend of GLR’s precipitation over the past 40 years, particularly in the cold-season. This increase is caused by an intensified zonal moisture transport from the mid-Pacific through changes in atmospheric circulation.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Predicting how these interactions affect the spatial patterns and magnitudes of bed deformation in meandering rivers is essential for various river engineering and geoscience problems. Computational fluid dynamics simulations can predict river morphodynamics at fine temporal and spatial scales but have traditionally been challenged by the large scale of natural rivers. We conducted coupled large-eddy simulation and bed morphodynamics simulations to create a unique database of hydro-morphodynamic data sets for 42 meandering rivers with a variety of planform shapes and large-scale geometrical features that mimic natural meanders. For each simulated river, the database includes (a) bed morphology, (b) three-dimensional mean velocity field, and (c) bed shear stress distribution under bankfull flow conditions. The calculated morphodynamics results at dynamic equilibrium revealed the formation of scour and deposition patterns near the outer and inner banks, respectively, while the location of point bars and scour regions around the apexes of the meander bends is found to vary as a function of the radius of curvature of the bends to the width ratio. A new mechanism is proposed that explains this seemingly paradoxical finding. Furthermore, the high-fidelity simulation results generated in this work provide researchers and scientists with a rich numerical database for morphodynamics and bed shear stress distributions in large-scale meandering rivers to enable systematic investigation of the underlying phenomena and support a range of river engineering applications.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"The importance of ammonia for springtime atmospheric new particle formation and aerosol number abundance over the United States","Nair, Arshad Arjunan; Yu, Fangqun; Luo, Gan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; New particle formation (NPF); Ammonia (NH3); Ion-mediated nucleation (IMN); Particle size distributions (PNSD); Aerosol number concentration ultrafine particles (UFP)","New particle formation (NPF) and subsequent growth can contribute upwards of 50 % of the global cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget. It is also a significant source of ultrafine aerosols (PM<sub>0.1</sub>) with health implications. Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) can play a significant role in enhancing NPF and contributing to the growth of nucleated particles. Understanding these processes are vital for air quality and climate. Here, we examine the role of NH<sub>3</sub> in NPF and consequent effects on aerosol number concentrations (including CCN) and size distributions during springtime over the United States (US). We use the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model coupled with the size-resolved Advanced Particle Microphysics (APM) Model. We also employ measurements of particle number size distributions, CN10 (condensation nuclei > 10 nm), CCN0.4 (CCN at 0.4 % supersaturation), and aerosol composition (SO<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, Organics) at the Southern Great Plains site (SGP). The impact of NH<sub>3</sub> in ion-mediated nucleation is the improved capturing of the occurrence of almost all springtime (March–April) NPF events observed at SGP during 2015–2020. Furthermore, this brings the magnitude and temporal variations of particle number concentrations in stronger agreement with observations; mean fractional bias for modeled CN10(CCN0.4) reducing from –1.26 to –0.27 (–0.75 to –0.54) and overall good-agreement (|FractionalBias | < 0.6) improving from 8.5 to 54 % (31 to 42 %). The contribution of NH<sub>3</sub> in new particle formation is important for springtime abundance of ultrafine aerosols (explaining 63 ± 15 % of CN10) and CCN (16 ± 10 % of CCN0.4) over the US. Our analysis shows that the deviation of CCN0.4 is strongly correlated with PM<sub>1<sup>-</sup></sub>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> deviations, suggesting the importance of improved model representation of ammonium for more accurate quantification of potential cloud forming particles.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As an important compartment of the aquatic ecosystem, sediment properties impact PFAS partitioning between aqueous and solid phases, but little is known about the influence of sediment organic carbon content on PFAS bioaccumulation in benthic organisms. In this study, three freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates – worms (Lumbriculus variegatus), mussels (Elliptio complanata) and snails (Physella acuta) – were exposed for 28 days to PFAS spiked synthetic sediment equilibrated with a synthetic surface water. Using microcosms, sediment organic carbon content – 2%, 5% and 8% – was manipulated to assess its impact on PFAS bioaccumulation. Worms were found to have substantially greater PFAS bioaccumulation compared to mussels and snails. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) in worms were both one to two magnitudes higher than in mussels and snails, likely due to different habitat-specific uptake pathways and elimination capacities among species. In these experiments, increasing sediment organic carbon content decreased the bioaccumulation of PFAS to benthic macroinvertebrates. In worms, sediment organic carbon content was hypothesized to impact PFAS bioaccumulation by affecting PFAS partitioning and sediment ingestion rate. Notably, the BSAF values of 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (FTS) were the largest among 14 PFAS for all species, suggesting that the benthic macroinvertebrates probably have different metabolic mechanisms for fluorotelomer sulfonic acids compared to fish evaluated in published literature. Understanding the impact of species and sediment organic carbon on PFAS bioaccumulation is key to developing environmental quality guidelines and evaluating potential ecological risks to higher trophic level species.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

WRF-WVT is configured to isolate the subtropical moisture contribution to the AR, the moisture flux, and precipitation. Subtropical water vapor advected by the AR into Idaho is tagged and tracked in three-dimensional space throughout the run. This allows the contribution of the subtropical moisture to the vertical distribution of water vapor and the precipitation to be directly calculated. The simulated cloud structure is compared with airborne radar data collected during two SNOWIE intensive operation periods. This study found that more than 70% of the moisture flux and more than 80% of the precipitation across the Idaho Mountains during SNOWIE IOP 4 could be attributed to subtropical moisture within the AR. Nearly all of the moisture flux in the upper cloud and 50% of the moisture in the lower cloud was attributable to the subtropical moisture. The subtropical moisture contribution within the AR to precipitation ranged from 35% in northern Idaho to more than 90% in southern Idaho.

"Machine Learning of Key Variables Impacting Extreme Precipitation in Various Regions of the Contiguous United States","Lin, Xinming; Fan, Jiwen; Hou, Z. Jason; Wang, Jingyu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Amplification in extreme precipitation intensity and frequency can cause severe flooding and impose significant social and economic consequences. Variations in extreme precipitation intensity, frequencies, and return periods can be attributed to many physical variables across spatial and temporal scales. Here we employ ensemble machine learning (ML) methods, namely random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and artificial neural networks (ANN), to explore key contributing variables to monthly extreme precipitation intensity and frequency in six regions over the United States. We further establish emulators for return periods. Results show that the ML models for intensity perform better in regions with obvious seasonality (i.e., Northern Great Plains, Southern Great Plains, and West Coast) than the other three regions (Northeast, Southwest, and Rocky Mountains), while for frequency the models perform well for most regions. The Shapley additive explanation is used to help explain the relationships between extreme precipitation characteristics and identify top variables for RF and XGB. We find that latent heat flux, relative humidity, soil moisture, and large-scale subsidence are key common variables across the regions for both monthly intensity and frequency, and their compound effects are non-negligible. The developed ML models capture the probability and return period of extreme precipitation well for all regions and may be used for decision making (e.g., infrastructure planning and design).","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Atmospheric aerosol has substantial impacts on climate, air quality and biogeochemical cycles, and its concentrations are highly variable in space and time. A key variability to evaluate within models that simulate aerosol is the vertical distribution, which influences atmospheric heating profiles and aerosol–cloud interactions, to help constrain aerosol residence time and to better represent the magnitude of simulated impacts. To ensure a consistent comparison between modeled and observed vertical distribution of aerosol, we implemented an aerosol lidar simulator within the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package version 2 (COSPv2). We assessed the attenuated total backscattered (ATB) signal and the backscatter ratios (SRs) at 532 nm in the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1). The simulator performs the computations at the same vertical resolution as the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), making use of aerosol optics from the E3SMv1 model as inputs and assuming that aerosol is uniformly distributed horizontally within each model grid box. The simulator applies a cloud masking and an aerosol detection threshold to obtain the ATB and SR profiles that would be observed above clouds by CALIOP with its aerosol detection capability. Our analysis shows that the aerosol distribution simulated at a seasonal timescale is generally in good agreement with observations. Over the Southern Ocean, however, the model does not produce the SR maximum as observed in the real world. Comparison between clear-sky and all-sky SRs shows little differences, indicating that the cloud screening by potentially incorrect model clouds does not affect the mean aerosol signal averaged over a season. This indicates that the differences between observed and simulated SR values are due not to sampling errors, but to deficiencies in the representation of aerosol in models. Finally, we highlight the need for future applications of lidar observations at multiple wavelengths to provide insights into aerosol properties and distribution and their representation in Earth system models.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The loss of coastal forests has significant implications for the coastal carbon cycle; yet, predicting mortality likelihood is difficult due to our limited understanding of disturbance impacts on coastal forests. The manipulative, ecosystem-scale Terrestrial Ecosystem Manipulation to Probe the Effects of Storm Treatments (TEMPEST) experiment addresses the potential for freshwater and estuarine-water disturbance events to alter tree function, species composition, and ecosystem processes in a deciduous coastal forest in MD, USA. The experiment uses a large-unit (2000 m <sup>2</sup> ), un-replicated experimental design, with three 50 m × 40 m plots serving as control, freshwater, and estuarine-water treatments. Transient saturation (5 h) of the entire soil rooting zone (0–30 cm) across a 2000 m <sup>2</sup> coastal forest was attained by delivering 300 m <sup>3</sup> of water through a spatially distributed irrigation network at a rate just above the soil infiltration rate. Our water delivery approach also elevated the water table (typically ~ 2 m belowground) and achieved extensive, low-level inundation (~ 8 cm standing water). A TEMPEST simulation approximated a 15-cm rainfall event and based on historic records, was of comparable intensity to a 10-year storm for the area. This characterization was supported by showing that Hurricane Ida’s (~ 5 cm rainfall) hydrologic impacts were shorter (40% lower duration) and less expansive (80% less coverage) than those generated through experimental manipulation. Future work will apply TEMPEST treatments to evaluate coastal forest resilience to changing hydrologic disturbance regimes and identify conditions that initiate ecosystem state transitions. </p>","Springer Science + Business Media","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In a two-part investigation, the Hanford Site 200 West Area pump-and-treat (P&T) facility in Washington State, USA is used as a case study to evaluate the performance of two IX resins for groundwater treatment: Purolite® A532E for pertechnetate (TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) removal, explored in Part I, and DOWEX 21K (DOWEX) for uranium (U) removal. In Part II, DOWEX selectivity for U, as uranyl carbonate species, and uptake kinetics is quantified in a series of laboratory-scale aqueous batch experiments containing Hanford-relevant concentrations of competing anions nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>), and carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), as well as co-mingled contaminant TcO<sub>4</sub><sub>-</sub>. Here the results demonstrate that DOWEX trimethylammonium functional groups are highly selective for U carbonate species (85–100 % uptake) under all conditions investigated. Only NO<sub>3</sub><sub>-</sub> concentrations of 100 mM were shown to decrease U removal, with the extent (85–99 %) depending on competing anion concentrations present in solution. However, at the highest NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations reported for groundwaters treated at the P&T facility (25 mM), the effect on U uptake is minimal. The batch sorption results are modeled to obtain chloride normalized equilibrium exchange coefficients (K) for predicting DOWEX performance: K<sub>SO4--/Cl-</sub> = 2.0, K<sub>NO3-/Cl-</sub> = 5.0, K<sub>HCO3-/Cl-</sub> = 1.5, K<sub>TcO4-/Cl-</sub> = 2,000, and K<sub>U/Cl-</sub> = 50,000. These K values predict little effect of current and future influent chemistries on U removal by DOWEX, where both uranyl carbonate species and TcO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> are removed such that effluent concentrations meet groundwater treatment requirements.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A CCN closure study for the entire campaign period was performed where measured CCN concentrations at 0.24% and 0.46% supersaturation were compared with the predicted CCN concentrations calculated using κ-Köhler theory, three different assumptions of aerosol mixing state, and various assumptions about hygroscopicity, density, and the insoluble fraction of organic particles. We found that the Closure Ratio (CR), calculated as the ratio of predicted to measured CCN concentrations, was equal to one under two different aerosol mixing state assumptions: (a) all particles are composed of 100% organic particles, and (b) particles are externally mixed and composed of pure sulfates, nitrates, and organic particles assuming hygroscopicity values for organic particles (K<sub>org</sub>) between 0.04 and 0.17. The use of internal mixing state assumption often led to overprediction of CCN concentrations but the agreement within ±20% with the measured CCN concentrations was observed under certain closure permutations. A similar agreement, that is, within ±20%, was also observed using permuted parameters concerning density (1 and 1.5 g cm–3) and an insoluble fraction (0% and 20%) of organic particles.

"Hydrostatic and Non‐Hydrostatic Baroclinic Instability in the Dynamical Core of the DOE Global Climate Model","Sun, Xiaoming; Nadiga, Balasubramanya T.; Taylor, Mark A.; Puthan, Pranav S.; Urrego‐Blanco, Jorge R.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The dynamical core of the Department of Energy global climate model is used to understand the role of non-hydrostatic dynamics in the simulation of dry and moist baroclinic waves. To reduce computational cost, the Diabatic Acceleration and REscaling approach is adopted. Scale analysis and numerical simulations suggest that the model solution is not distorted by the change of spherical metric terms due to the change of Earth radius, neither are the inter-scale interactions strongly altered as indicated by the analysis of spectral flux. Compared with hydrostatic simulations, the onset of baroclinic instability is delayed under non-hydrostatic dynamics as the associated weaker vertical motions tend to increase the critical wavelength and narrow the range of waves that can be baroclinically unstable. During the development of baroclinic waves, non-hydrostatic dynamics tends to induce vertical motions in the upper troposphere, accelerating the eastward propagation of upper-level ridges through their impact on local vorticity tendency. These processes reduce the westward tilt of the vertical ridge axes and suppress the conversion of mean flow available potential energy to eddy kinetic energy, leading to weaker baroclinic eddies than in hydrostatic simulations. The contrasts between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic settings hold in supplemental experiments that vary the background flow Rossby number, the amount of water vapor content and vertical resolution. We also find that mesoscale and smaller-scale activities can be considerably under-represented when the vertical resolution is limited to that typically used in global climate models.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

However, standard aerosolization techniques require relatively large liquid volumes (e.g., several milliliters) and high sample masses that limit their utility. Here we report the development and characterization of a micronebulization AMS (MN-AMS) technique that requires as low as 10 µL of sample and can provide the quantification of the nanogram level of organic and inorganic substances via the usage of an isotopically labeled internal standard (34SO). Using standard solutions, the detection limits for this technique were determined at 0.19, 0.75, and 2.2 ng for sulfate, nitrate, and organics, respectively. The analytical recoveries for these species are 104 %, 87 %, and 94 %, respectively. This MN-AMS technique was applied successfully to analyze filter and impactor samples collected using miniature particulate matter (PM) samplers deployable on uncrewed atmospheric measurement platforms, such as uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) and tethered balloon systems (TBSs). Chemical composition of PM samples collected from a UAS field campaign conducted at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Southern Great Plains (SGP) observatory was characterized. The offline MN-AMS data compared well with the in situ PM composition measured by a co-located aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM). In addition, the MN-AMS and ion chromatography (IC) agreed well for measurements of sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the PM extracts. This study demonstrates the utility of combining MN-AMS with uncrewed measurement platforms to provide quantitative measurements of ambient PM composition.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Previous studies have attributed the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of riverine CH<sub>4</sub> to environmental factors such as sediment type, water level, temperature, or particulate organic carbon abundance through correlation analysis. However, a mechanistic understanding of the basis for such heterogeneity is lacking. Here, in this study, we combine sediment CH<sub>4</sub> data from the Hanford reach of the Columbia River with a biogeochemical-transport model to show that vertical hydrologic exchange flows (VHEFs), driven by the difference between river stage and groundwater level, determine CH<sub>4</sub> flux at the sediment–water interface. CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes show a nonlinear relationship with the magnitude of VHEFs, where high VHEFs introduce O<sub>2</sub> into riverbed sediments, which inhibit CH<sub>4</sub> production and induce CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation, and low VHEFs cause transient reduction in CH<sub>4</sub> flux (relative to production) due to reduced advective CH<sub>4</sub> transport. In addition, VHEFs lead to the hysteresis of temperature rise and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions because high river discharge caused by snowmelt in spring leads to strong downwelling flow that offsets increasing CH<sub>4</sub> production with temperature rise. Our findings reveal how the interplay between in-stream hydrologic flux besides fluvial-wetland connectivity and microbial metabolic pathways that compete with methanogenic pathways can produce complex patterns in CH<sub>4</sub> production and emission in riverbed alluvial sediments.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Physics–Informed Neural Networks of the Saint–Venant Equations for Downscaling a Large–Scale River Model","Feng, Dongyu; Tan, Zeli; He, QiZhi","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; physical-informed neural network; data assimilation; Saint-Venant equations; flood modeling; downscaling","Large-scale river models are being refined over coastal regions to improve the scientific understanding of coastal processes, hazards and responses to climate change. However, coarse mesh resolutions and approximations in physical representations of tidal rivers limit the performance of such models at resolving the complex flow dynamics near the river-ocean interface, resulting in inaccurate simulations of flood inundation. In this research, we propose a machine learning (ML) framework based on the state-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the downscaled flow at the subgrid scale. First, we demonstrate that PINN is able to assimilate observations of various types and solve the one-dimensional (1-D) Saint-Venant equations (SVE) directly. We perform the flow simulations over a floodplain and along an open channel in several synthetic case studies. The PINN performance is evaluated against analytical solutions and numerical models. Our results indicate that the PINN solutions of water depth have satisfactory accuracy with limited observations assimilated. In the case of flood wave propagation induced by storm surge and tide, a new neural network architecture is proposed based on Fourier feature embeddings that seamlessly encodes the periodic tidal boundary condition in the PINN's formulation. Furthermore, we show that the PINN-based downscaling can produce more reasonable subgrid solutions of the along-channel water depth by assimilating observational data. The PINN solution outperforms the simple linear interpolation in resolving the topography and dynamic flow regimes at the subgrid scale. This study provides a promising path towards improving emulation capabilities in large-scale models to characterize fine-scale coastal processes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The methane-related damages to climate, measured as the Social Cost of Methane, and to human health have been analyzed by different studies and considered by government rulemaking in the last decades, but the ozone-related damages to crop revenues associated to methane emissions have not been incorporated to policy agenda. Using a combination of the Global Change Analysis Model and the TM5-FASST Scenario Screening Tool, we estimate that global marginal agricultural damages range from ~ 423 to 556 $2010/t-CH<sub>4</sub>, of which 98 $2010/t-CH<sub>4</sub> occur in the USA, which is the most affected region due to its role as a major crop producer, followed by China, EU-15, and India. These damages would represent 39–59% of the climate damages and 28–64% of the human health damages associated with methane emissions by previous studies. The marginal damages to crop revenues calculated in this study complement the damages from methane to climate and human health, and provides valuable information to be considered in future cost-benefits analyses.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, we characterize the climatology and surface impacts of ARs on West Antarctica, focusing on the Amundsen Sea Embayment and Marie Byrd Land. First, we develop a climatology of ARs in this region, using an Antarctic-specific AR detection tool combined with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) atmospheric reanalyses. We find that while ARs are infrequent (occurring 3 % of the time), they cause intense precipitation in short periods of time and account for 11 % of the annual surface accumulation. They are driven by the coupling of a blocking high over the Antarctic Peninsula with a low-pressure system known as the Amundsen Sea Low. Next, we use observations from automatic weather stations on Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf with the firn model SNOWPACK and interferometric reflectometry (IR) to examine a case study of three ARs that made landfall in rapid succession from 2 to 8 February 2020, known as an AR family event. While accumulation dominates the surface impacts of the event on Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (> 100 kg m<sup>–2</sup> or millimeters water equivalent), we find small amounts of surface melt as well (< 5 kg m<sup>–2</sup>). The results presented here enable us to quantify the past impacts of ARs on West Antarctica's surface mass balance (SMB) and characterize their interannual variability and trends, enabling a better assessment of future AR-driven changes in the SMB.","Copernicus GmbH","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; National Science Foundation (NSF); Natural Environment Research Council; Agence Nationale de la Recherche","","Germany","2023-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: The Cryosphere (Online) Journal Volume: 17 Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: p. 865-881","","","DE SC0022070; SC0022070; 80NSSC21K1610; NE/S006419/1; 80NSSC20K1727; 1929991; 1947282; 1738934; ANR-20-CE01-0013","Journal ID: ISSN 1994-0424","10.5194/tc-17-865-2023","","2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","1958056","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1958056","","The Cryosphere (Online)","2","17"

Uncertainties in an output of interest that depends on the solution of a complex system (e.g., of partial differential equations with random inputs) are often, if not nearly ubiquitously, determined in practice using Monte Carlo (MC) estimation. While simple to implement, MC estimation fails to provide reliable information about statistical quantities (such as the expected value of the output of interest) in application settings such as climate modeling, for which obtaining a single realization of the output of interest is a costly endeavor. Specifically, the dilemma encountered is that many samples of the output of interest have to be collected in order to obtain an MC estimator that has sufficient accuracy – so many, in fact, that the available computational budget is not large enough to effect the number of samples needed. To circumvent this dilemma, we consider using multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) estimation which leverages the use of less costly and less accurate surrogate models (such as coarser grids, reduced-order models, simplified physics, and/or interpolants) to achieve, for the same computational budget, higher accuracy compared to that obtained by an MC estimator – or, looking at it another way, an MFMC estimator obtains the same accuracy as the MC estimator at lower computational cost. The key to the efficacy of MFMC estimation is the fact that most of the required computational budget is loaded onto the less costly surrogate models so that very few samples are taken of the more expensive model of interest. We first provide a more detailed discussion about the need to consider an alternative to MC estimation for uncertainty quantification. Subsequently, we present a review, in an abstract setting, of the MFMC approach along with its application to three climate-related benchmark problems as a proof-of-concept exercise.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Univ. of South Carolina, Columbia, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR).

It was observed that out of 100 BMT of raw materials processed annually only 10% is recycled back. This has resulted in a strenuous burden on natural or primary resources of minerals (such as ores) having limited availability. Moreover, severe environmental concerns have been raised by the huge piles of waste generated at landfill sites. To resolve these issues, ‘Urban Mining’ from waste or secondary resources in a Circular Economy’ concept is the only sustainable solution. The objective of this review is to critically examine the availability, elemental composition, and the market potential of the selected secondary resources such as lignocellulosic/algal biomass, desalination water, sewage sludge, phosphogypsum, and e-waste for minerals sequestration. This review showed that, secondary resources have potential to partially replace the minerals required in different sectors such as macro and microelements in agriculture, rare earth elements (REEs) in electrical and electronics industry, metals in manufacturing sector and precious elements such as gold and platinum in ornamental industry. Further, inputs from the selected life cycle analysis (LCA) & techno economic analysis (TEA) were discussed which showed that although, urban mining has a potential to reduce the greenhouse gaseous (GHG) emissions in a sustainable manner however, process improvements through innovative, novel and cost-effective pathways are essentially required for its large-scale deployment at industrial scale in future.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, synthetic fertilizers are made up of several macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), each with different energy intensities and environmental impacts. With the movement toward resource circularity, there is a need to create a more holistic view regarding the process energy associated with synthetic inorganic fertilizers, including nitrogen and phosphorus. Here, we first describe the growing production and consumption of inorganic (synthetic) and organic (animal waste) nutrients in agriculture as well as the process energy associated with the production of granular phosphorus and nitrogen-based fertilizers. Next, we present a projected global demand of nitrogen and phosphorus consumption based on various sustainability and societal equity scenarios to make an argument for the viability of nutrient recovery in addition to nutrient synthesis to meet this demand. Finally, we discuss the characteristics and challenges of emerging technologies for nutrient recovery along with a baseline of current operational recovery facilities.","American Chemical Society","","Ohio Univ., Athens, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); Center for Advancing Sustainable and Distributed Fertilizer Production (CASFER)","","United States","2023-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Energy Letters Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1493-1501","","","EE0009502; EEC-2133576","Journal ID: ISSN 2380-8195","10.1021/acsenergylett.2c02627","","2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","1957677","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1957677","","ACS Energy Letters","3","8"
"Thermal modulation of reaction equilibria controls mass transfer in CO <sub>2</sub> -binding organic liquids","Moore, Thomas; Varni, Anthony J.; Pang, Simon H.; Akhade, Sneha A.; Li, Sichi; Nguyen, Du T.; Stolaroff, Joshuah K.","42 ENGINEERING; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","CO<sub>2</sub>-Binding organic liquids (CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs) are non-aqueous solvents which may reduce the parasitic energy of carbon capture processes. These solvents exhibit surprising mass transfer behavior: at fixed pressure driving force, the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> into CO<sub>2</sub>BOLs decreases exponentially with increased temperature, a phenomenon not observed in aqueous amines. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is primarily driven by a shift in reaction equilibrium, which reduces the degree to which chemical reactions enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> flux. First-principles surface renewal models quantitatively reproduce mass transfer data for CO<sub>2</sub> absorption into 2-EEMPA, IPADM-2-BOL and DBU:Hexanol across a range of temperatures. Density functional theory calculations are used to identify structural modifications likely to improve the CO<sub>2</sub> flux. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between CO<sub>2</sub> flux and the energy required for solvent regeneration, and provide a theoretical foundation for rational solvent design and the development of physics-informed mass transfer models.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Development of a microsampler suitable for aerial collection of aerosol particles","Cheng, Meng-Dawn; Chien, Chih-Hsiang; Graham, David E.; Harter, Andrew","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","A microsampler for collecting aerosol particles on an unmanned aerial system (UAS) was designed and evaluated in the laboratory for dry (no condensed water) and wet (foggy, misty, or rainy) air conditions. This microsampler was produced using a customized impactor design to minimize size, weight, and power requirements uniquely suitable for aerial applications, also maximize the collection efficiency above a specific cut-off size in a short time and concentrate particles for future automated analysis using microfluidics. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results suggested a design that provided a higher sampling efficiency with minimal inlet loss. The microsampler was experimentally evaluated using fluorescent polystyrene latex (PSL) particles at four nominal sizes. The experimental results at the four PSL particle sizes agree reasonably well with the collection efficiencies predicted by CFD. We found no effect of humidity on the collection efficiency of the microsampler under conditions at 80% relative humidity. However, when condensed water exists, significant biases on the collection efficiencies were found suggesting that this microsampler should not be used under conditions where there is condensed water in the atmosphere, e.g., foggy, misty, and rainy conditions.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Existing uncertainties on land cover classification and in biomass estimates hinder accurate attribution of carbon emissions to specific forest classes. In this study, we used textural metrics derived from PlanetScope images to implement a probabilistic classification framework to identify intact, logged and burned forests in three Amazonian sites. We also estimated biomass for these forest classes using airborne lidar and compared biomass uncertainties using the lidar-derived estimates only to biomass uncertainties considering the forest degradation classification as well. Our classification approach reached overall accuracy of 0.86, with accuracy at individual sites varying from 0.69 to 0.93. Logged forests showed variable biomass changes, while burned forests showed an average carbon loss of 35%. We found that including uncertainty in forest degradation classification significantly increased uncertainty and decreased estimates of mean carbon density in two of the three test sites. Our findings indicate that the attribution of biomass changes to forest degradation classes needs to account for the uncertainty in forest degradation classification. By combining very high-resolution images with lidar data, we could attribute carbon stock changes to specific pathways of forest degradation. This approach also allows quantifying uncertainties of carbon emissions associated with forest degradation through logging and fire. Both the attribution and uncertainty quantification provide critical information for national greenhouse gas inventories.","BioMed Central","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

With drought and elevated temperature increasing the importance of vegetation dynamics to fire behavior, and the advent of next generation models capable of capturing increasingly complex physical processes, we provide a renewed focus on representation of woody vegetation in fire models. Currently, the most advanced representations of fire behavior and biophysical fire effects are found in distinct classes of fine-scale models and do not capture variation in live fuel (i.e., living plant) properties. We demonstrate that plant water and carbon dynamics, which influence combustion and heat transfer into the plant and often dictate plant survival, provide the mechanistic linkage between fire behavior and effects. Our conceptual framework linking remotely sensed estimates of plant water and carbon to fine scale models of fire behavior and effects could be a critical first step toward improving the fidelity of the coarse scale models that are now relied upon for global fire forecasting. This process-based approach will be essential to capturing the influence of physiological responses to drought and warming on live fuel conditions, strengthening the science needed to guide fire managers in an uncertain future.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The two stations are separated by 11.5-km and each station consists of four antenna sets (instead of three for the original BIMAP) that form a Y-shaped array for improved interferometric performance. In this paper, we report the BIMAP-3D system design, a generalized and analytical 2D interferometry technique for noncoplanar antenna array, a two-stage 3D mapping technique based on geometric triangulation and baseline-based differential time of arrival, and a technique to reconstruct the polarization orientation in 3D space by combining the 2D polarization results from the two-station observations. Along with description of the techniques, we demonstrate and discuss the initial lightning results, including 3D maps for a hybrid intracloud and cloud-to-ground flash and for a normal intracloud flash, development of abnormal K-change leaders, and polarization signatures for a K-change leader. We find that with the two-stage 3D mapping techniques, the sources can be located to meters accuracy for a favorable event that occurs between the two stations. We also find the polarization vectors for the example K leader are mostly orthogonal to the leader channel after the full 3D polarization analysis. The main purpose of this paper is to report the BIMAP-3D techniques and capabilities. Detailed analysis of more specific discharge processes will be reported in later studies.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Assessing hydropower availability in a changing climate is technically challenging because there is a lack of consensus in the modeling representation of key dynamics across scales and processes. Focusing on 132 US federal hydropower plants, in this study we evaluate the compounded impact of climate and reservoir-hydropower models’ structural uncertainties on monthly hydropower projections. In particular, instead of relying on one single regression-based hydropower model, we introduce another conceptual reservoir operations-hydropower model in the assessment framework. This multi-model assessment approach allows us to partition uncertainties associated with both climate and hydropower models for better clarity. Results suggest that while at least 70% of the uncertainties at the annual scale and 50% at the seasonal scale can be attributed to the choice of climate models, up to 50% of seasonal variability can be attributed to the choice of hydropower models, particularly in regions over the western US where the reservoir storage is substantial. The analysis identifies regions where multi-model assessments are needed and presents a novel approach to partition uncertainties in hydropower projections. Another outcome includes an updated evaluation of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)-based federal hydropower projection, at the monthly scale and with a larger ensemble, which can provide a baseline for understanding future assessments based on CMIP6 and beyond.</p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To utilize such waste materials for engineered carbon mineralization purposes, there is a need to investigate the fate and mobility of toxic metals. This is a study of the coprecipitation of metals with calcium carbonate for environmental heavy metal mitigation. The study also examines the stability of precipitated phases under environmentally relevant acid conditions. For a wide range of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) concentrations (10 to 5000 mg/L), induced coprecipitation led to greater than 99% uptake from water. The calcium carbonate phases were found to contain amounts as high as 9.9 wt % (Cd) and 17 wt % (Zn), as determined by novel synchrotron techniques, including X-ray fluorescence element mapping and three-dimensional (3D) nanotransmission X-ray microscopy (TXM). TXM imaging revealed first-of-a-kind observations of chemical gradients and internal nanoporosity within particles. These observations provided new insights into the mechanisms leading to the retention of coprecipitated heavy metals during the dissolution of calcite in acidic (pH 4) solutions. These observations highlight the feasibility of utilizing carbonate coprecipitation as an engineered approach to the durable sequestration of toxic metals.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS)","","United States","2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 57 Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: p. 3104-3113","","","SC0014664; FG02-94ER14466; AC02-06CH11357","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c07678","","2023-03-07T00:00:00Z","1924582","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1924582","","Environmental Science and Technology","8","57"

In this work, results indicated that (1) the cleaning and pelletizing process at reclaimers contributed the most to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of recycled FPP products, and (2) the GHG emissions of recycled FPP products in all four pathways are lower than the comparator products. Therefore, using a higher percentage of recycled FPP substituted in a product can result in greater GHG emission reductions.

"Scaling of Turbulence and Microphysics in a Convection–Cloud Chamber of Varying Height","Thomas, Subin; Yang, Fan; Ovchinnikov, Mikhail; Cantrell, Will; Shaw, Raymond A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; cloud chamber; turbulence scaling; cloud microphysics","The convection–cloud chamber enables measurement of aerosol and cloud microphysics, as well as their interactions, within a turbulent environment under steady-state conditions. Increasing the size of a convection–cloud chamber, while holding the imposed temperature difference constant, leads to increased Rayleigh, Reynolds and Nusselt numbers. Large–eddy simulation coupled with a bin microphysics model allows the influence of increased velocity, time, and spatial scales on cloud microphysical properties to be explored. Simulations of a convection–cloud chamber, with fixed aspect ratio and increasing heights of H=1, 2, 4, and (for dry conditions only) 8 m are performed. The key findings are: Velocity fluctuations scale as H^1/3, consistent with the Deardorff expression for convective velocity, and implying that the turbulence correlation time scales as H^2/3. Temperature and other scalar fluctuations scale as H^-3/7. Droplet size distributions from chambers of different sizes can be matched by adjusting the total aerosol injection rate as the horizontal cross-sectional area (i.e., as H^2 for constant aspect ratio). Injection of aerosols at a point versus distributed throughout the volume makes no difference for polluted conditions, but can lead to cloud droplet size distribution broadening in clean conditions. Cloud droplet growth by collision and coalescence leads to a broader right tail of the distribution compared to condensation growth alone, and this tail increases in magnitude and extent monotonically as the increase of chamber height. These results also have implications for scaling within turbulent, cloudy mixed-layers in the atmosphere, such as fog layers.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Quantifying uncertainty in Pareto estimates of global lake area","Stachelek, Jemma","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences","Size is a critical factor determining the rate and occurrence of specific lake processes such as carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions and emerging evidence suggests that small lakes in particular have particularly large CO<sub>2</sub> flux rates. Because we do not have a complete census of all lakes, upscaling estimates of such processes to small lakes at broad spatial scales requires the use of lake size-abundance distributions rather than empirical measurements of area. Existing lake census efforts are incomplete such that as lakes become smaller, they are more likely to be omitted either because they are too small to be resolved from remote sensing products or because of limited ground surveying effort (i.e., “censoring” of small lakes relative to large lakes). The present study explores one potential shortcoming of prior approaches estimating global lake area using lake size-abundance distributions. Namely, that these prior approaches rely on frequentist curve fitting techniques combined with an ad-hoc cutoff determination strategy (visual inspection to determine a likely censoring point). This yields an over-exact lake area estimate that is typically reported with no uncertainty bounds. I show how these shortcomings can be addressed with a Bayesian model that produces larger estimates of lake area uncertainty relative to the typical approach. When used as part of a sensitivity analysis, such an approach has the potential to enable more robust intercomparisons among studies of aquatic processes upscaling.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Specifically, river networks are often misrepresented because of the mismatch between the model's spatial resolution and river network details, resulting in significant uncertainty in the projected flow direction. In this study, we developed a topological relationship-based river network representation method for spatially distributed hydrologic models. This novel method uses (a) graph theory algorithms to simplify real-world vector-based river networks and assist in mesh generation; and (b) a topological relationship-based method to reconstruct conceptual river networks. The main advantages of our method are that (a) it combines the strengths of vector-based and DEM raster-based river network extraction methods; and (b) it is mesh-independent and can be applied to both structured and unstructured meshes.

This study comprehensively evaluates ELM snow simulations over the western United States at 0.125° resolution during 2001–2019 using the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) in situ networks, MODIS remote sensing products (i.e., MCD43 surface albedo product), the spatially and temporally complete (STC) snow-covered area and grain size (MODSCAG) and MODIS dust and radiative forcing in snow (MODDRFS) products (STC-MODSCAG/STC-MODDRFS), and the snow property inversion from remote sensing (SPIReS) product and two data assimilation products of snow water equivalent and snow depth – i.e., University of Arizona (UA) and SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). Overall the ELM simulations are consistent with the benchmarking datasets and reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns, interannual variability, and elevation gradients for different snow properties including snow cover fraction (f<sub>sno</sub>), surface albedo (α<sub>sur</sub>) over snow cover regions, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow depth (D<sub>sno</sub>). However, there are large biases of f<sub>sno</sub> with dense forest cover and αsur in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada in winter, compared to the MODIS products. There are large discrepancies of snow albedo, snow grain size, and light-absorbing particle-induced snow albedo reduction between ELM and the MODIS products, attributed to uncertainties in the aerosol forcing data, snow aging processes in ELM, and remote sensing retrievals. Against UA and SNODAS, ELM has a mean bias of -20.7 mm (-35.9 %) and -20.4 mm (-35.5 %), respectively, for spring, and -13.8 mm (-27.8 %) and -10.2 mm (-22.2 %), respectively, for winter. ELM shows a relatively high correlation with SNOTEL SWE, with mean correlation coefficients of 0.69 but negative mean biases of -122.7 mm. Compared to the snow phenology of STC-MODSCAG and SPIReS, ELM shows delayed snow accumulation onset dates by 17.3 and 12.4 d, earlier snow end dates by 35.5 and 26.8 d, and shorter snow durations by 52.9 and 39.5 d, respectively. This study underscores the need for diagnosing model biases and improving ELM representations of snow properties and snow phenology in mountainous areas for more credible simulation and future projection of mountain snowpack.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Design methodologies and engineering applications for ecosystem biomimicry: an interdisciplinary review spanning cyber, physical, and cyber-physical systems","Hinkelman, Kathryn (ORCID:0000000282976036); Yang, Yizhi; Zuo, Wangda (ORCID:0000000321025592)","42 ENGINEERING; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; biomimicry; cyber systems; cyber-physical systems; physical systems; sustainable development; design; ecosystem; engineering; methods; sustainability; systems","<title>Abstract</title> <p>Ecosystem biomimicry is a promising pathway for sustainable development. However, while typical form- and process-level biomimicry is prevalent, system-level ecosystem biomimicry remains a nascent practice in numerous engineering fields. This critical review takes an interdisciplinary approach to synthesize trends across case studies, evaluate design methodologies, and identify future opportunities when applying ecosystem biomimicry to engineering practices, including cyber systems (CS), physical systems (PS), and cyber-physical systems (CPS). After systematically sourcing publications from major databases, the papers were first analyzed at a meta level for their bibliographic context and for statistical correlations among categorical variables. Then, we investigated deeper into the engineering applications and design methodologies. Results indicate that CPS most frequently mimic organisms and ecosystems, while CS and PS frequently mimic populations-communities and molecules-tissues-organ systems, respectively (statistically highly significant). An indirect approach is most often used for mimicry at organizational levels from populations to ecosystems, while a direct approach frequently suits levels from molecules to organisms (highly significant). Dominant themes across engineering applications include symbiotic organism search algorithms for CS and ecological network analysis for CPS, while PS applications are highly diverse. For design methodologies, this work summarizes and details ten well-documented biomimetic process models among literature, which addresses an outdated concern for a lack of systematic methods for ecosystem biomimicry. In addition to the Biomimetics Standard ISO 18458, these methods include the Natural Step and Techno-Ecological Synergy framework, among others. Further, the analyses revealed future opportunities from less utilized design methods (e.g., interdisciplinary teams tackling indirect, ecosystem-level projects) to well-established engineering concepts ready for technological advancement (e.g., implementing membrane computing for physical applications). For future studies, this review provides a comprehensive reference for ecosystem biomimetic design practices and application opportunities across multiple engineering domains.</p>","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Rather than producing a single fuel product, lignocellulosic biorefineries have the potential to serve as hubs for the production of fuels, production of petrochemical replacements, and treatment of high-moisture organic waste. A detailed techno-economic analysis and life-cycle greenhouse gas assessment are developed to explore the cost and emission impacts of integrated corn stover-to-ethanol biorefineries that incorporate both codigestion of organic wastes and different strategies for utilizing biogas, including onsite energy generation, upgrading to bio-compressed natural gas (bioCNG), conversion to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) bioplastic, and conversion to single-cell protein (SCP). We find that codigesting manure or a combination of manure and food waste alongside process wastewater can reduce the biorefinery’s total costs per metric ton of CO2 equivalent mitigated by half or more. Upgrading biogas to bioCNG is the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategy, while upgrading biogas to PHB or SCP is competitive with combusting biogas onsite.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Some of the new generation GCMs predict too much liquid and too little ice in mixed-phase clouds. This misrepresentation of cloud phase in GCMs results in weaker negative cloud feedback over the SO and a higher climate sensitivity. Based on a model comparison with observational data obtained during the Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation and Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES), this study addresses a key uncertainty in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) related to cloud phase, namely ice formation in pristine remote SO clouds. It is found that sea spray organic aerosols (SSOA) are the most important type of ice nucleating particles (INPs) over the SO with concentrations one order of magnitude higher than those of dust INPs based on measurements and CESM2 simulations. Secondary ice production (SIP) which includes riming splintering, rain droplet shattering, and ice-ice collisional fragmentation as implemented in CESM2 is the dominant ice production process in moderately cold clouds with cloud temperatures greater than –20°C. SIP enhances the in-cloud ice number concentrations (Ni) by 1-3 orders of magnitude and predicts more mixed-phase (with percentage occurrence increased from 15% to 21%), in better agreement with the observations. Finally, this study highlights the importance of accurately representing cloud phase over the pristine remote SO by considering the ice nucleation of SSOA and SIP processes, which are currently missing in most GCM cloud microphysics parameterizations.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Here, therefore, we used a machine learning approach to predict Q<sub>10</sub> from 1994 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 km across China from 515 field observations at 5 cm soil depth using climate, soil and vegetation variables. Predicted Q<sub>10</sub> varied from 1.54 to 4.17, with an area-weighted average of 2.52.

Spatially, soil organic carbon (SOC) was the most important driving factor in 62 % of the land area across China, and varied greatly, demonstrating soil controls on the spatial pattern of Q<sub>10</sub>. These findings highlighted different environmental controls on the spatial and temporal pattern of soil respiration Q<sub>10</sub>, which should be considered to improve global biogeochemical models used to predict the spatial and temporal patterns of soil carbon fluxes to ongoing climate change.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We use an adiabatic rising parcel model to study activation and diffusional growth of cloud droplets, focusing on the spectral width evolution, and contrasting clean and polluted environments. A comprehensive droplet growth equation is used that includes kinetic, solute, and surface tension effects. We show that those effects have an appreciable impact on the spectral width evolution above the cloud base. Without those effects, the droplet area standard deviation should not change once activation is completed. In contrast, simulation results show that the area standard deviation does increase with height, especially for weak updrafts and polluted environments. Implications of those results for cloud modeling, especially applying conventional bin microphysics, are discussed.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Single-Well Push–Pull Tracer Test Analyses to Determine Aquifer Reactive Transport Parameters at a Former Uranium Mill Site (Grand Junction, Colorado)","Johnson, Raymond H.; Paradis, Charles J.; Kent, Ronald D.; Tigar, Aaron D.; Reimus, Paul William","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; tracer testing; push-pull tests; push-drift-pull tests; geochemical modeling; reactive transport modeling; uranium","At a former uranium mill site where tailings have been removed, prior work has determined several potential ongoing secondary uranium sources. These include locations with uranium sorbed to organic carbon, uranium in the unsaturated zone, and uranium associated with the presence of gypsum. To better understand uranium mobility controls at the site, four single-well push–pull tests (with a drift phase) were completed with the goal of deriving aquifer flow and contaminant transport parameters for inclusion in a future sitewide reactive transport model. This goes beyond the traditional use of a constant sorption distribution coefficient (K<sub>d</sub>) and allows for the evaluation of alternative remedial injection fluids, which can produce variable K<sub>d</sub> values. Dispersion was first removed from the resulting data to determine possible reactions before conducting reactive transport simulations. These initial analyses indicated the potential need to include cation exchange, uranium sorption, and gypsum dissolution. A reactive transport model using multiple layers to account for partially penetrating wells was completed using the PHT-USG reactive transport modeling code and calibrated using PEST. The model results quantify the hydraulic conductivity and dispersion parameters using the injected tracer concentrations. Uranium sorption, cation exchange, and gypsum dissolution parameters were quantified by comparing the simulated versus observed geochemistry. All simulations required some cation exchange and calcite equilibrium, and one simulation required gypsum dissolution to improve the model fit for calcium and sulfate. Uranium sorption parameters were not strongly influenced by the other parameter values but were highly influenced by uranium concentrations during the drift phase, with possible kinetic rate limitations. Thus, a future recommendation for such push–pull tests is to collect more geochemical data during the drift phase. The final uranium sorption parameters were within the range of values determined from prior column testing. The flow and transport parameters derived from these single-well push–pull tests will provide initial parameters for any future sitewide reactive transport model.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Toward decarbonization of this key global economic sector, it is imperative to quantitatively understand the contributions to energy usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along the petrochemical manufacturing supply chain, which can inform judicious policy development and impactful technology options to improve or reimagine existing manufacturing practices. To that end, here we use the Materials Flows through Industry (MFI) tool to estimate the supply chain energy and GHG emissions for 51 organic petrochemicals and 6 intermediates that are globally produced at a capacity of at least 1 million metric tons (MMT) per year. This analysis focuses on supply chains in the United States, from which industrial data are readily sourced to obtain accurate energy and GHG emission estimates. Analysis for each chemical includes contributions from sourcing chemical feedstocks, electricity use, and fuel usage for transportation and manufacturing. This analysis predicts that process fuel, which is primarily used for heating, dominates GHG emissions in all cases except for chlorochemicals, where electricity is used extensively for the chloroalkali process and results in a large electricity GHG emission contribution ranging from 7 to 54% of total GHG emissions. Additionally, the contribution of electricity to GHG emissions ranges from 6 to 63%, representing the decarbonization potential in the transition toward renewable electricity with existing manufacturing processes. Taken together, these data serve as a critical baseline toward industrial decarbonization of the organic chemical sector, against which to compare changes to the electrical grid and industrial heat sources, improvements to existing technologies to manufacture the same chemicals, and new technologies to source alternative feedstocks to manufacture direct or functional replacement chemicals.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Soil organic matter diagenetic state informs boreal forest ecosystem feedbacks to climate change","Myers-Pigg, Allison N.; Kaiser, Karl; Benner, Ronald; Ziegler, Susan E.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) in boreal forests is dependent on the integrative ecosystem response to climate change. For example, boreal forest productivity is often nitrogen (N) limited, and climate warming can enhance N cycling and primary productivity. However, the net effect of this feedback on the SOC reservoir and its longevity with climate change remain unclear due to difficulty in detecting small differences between large and variable carbon (C) fluxes needed to determine net changes in soil reservoirs. The diagenetic state of SOC – resulting from the physicochemical and biological transformations that alter the original biomolecular composition of detrital inputs to soil over time – is useful for tracing the net response of SOC at the timescales relevant to climate change not usually discernible from fluxes and stocks alone. Here, we test two hypotheses using a mesic boreal forest climate transect: (1) the SOC diagenetic state is maintained across this climosequence, and (2) the maintenance of the SOC diagenetic state is a consequence of coupled soil C and N cycling, signifying the role of enhanced N cycling supporting SOC inputs that maintain SOC stocks within the warmer-climate forests. Shifts in nonvascular to vascular plant inputs with climate observed in these and other boreal forests highlighted the need to carefully separate biogeochemical indicators of SOC source from those signifying diagenetic alteration. We thus evaluated and applied lignin biomarkers to assess the diagenetic alteration of SOC in these boreal forest organic soils and directly compared the lignin diagenetic state with that of soil organic nitrogen (SON) assessed through amino acid composition. The lignin diagenetic state remained constant across the climate transect, indicating a balance between the input and removal of lignin in these mesic boreal forests. When combined with previous knowledge of these forest ecosystems, including the diagenetic state of SON and direct measures of C fluxes and stocks, the results indicate a coupled increase in C and N cycling with climate warming that supports forest productivity and maintains SOC stocks. This balance could markedly shift as other factors begin to limit forest productivity (e.g., trace nutrients, water) with further climate change or affect forest nutrient allocation (e.g., forest age or compositional change). Further application of the approach presented here could be used to detect the limits of this and other ecosystem–climate feedbacks, by providing a tractable and parameterizable index of the lignin state across large spatial scales, necessary for ecosystem-scale parameterizations.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian advection scheme for tracer transport on arbitrary meshes","Herzfeld, Mike; Engwirda, Darren (ORCID:0000000233799109)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences; Mathematics; Unstructured modelling; Numerical modelling; Coastal processes; Semi-Lagrangian advection","A variant of the flux-form semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) advection scheme is presented suitable for use on arbitrary unstructured meshes. The time-step used with the scheme is not constrained by the Courant number, resulting in model run-times that may be many times faster than Courant-constrained schemes. The scheme also has the property of mass conservation. This makes the scheme a potential candidate for offline simulation of tracers in unstructured sediment transport, biogeochemical or atmospheric chemistry models. We describe the numerics of the scheme and apply it to a number of idealised and real applications to demonstrate its utility. In these test cases we compare results from the offline FFSL scheme with those generated by the original hydrodynamic model which uses high order conservative tracer transport. We assess the FFSL scheme for accuracy, conservation and computational efficiency. Additionally, traditional semi-Lagrangian advection schemes are included in assessments for comparison. Results indicate that the FFSL scheme produces closer agreement with tracer distributions generated by the hydrodynamic model than the semi-Lagrange scheme, and mass conservation was vastly superior.

The FFSL scheme presented here therefore offers a viable mass-conserving, computationally-efficient option for use in offline transport models on arbitrary unstructured meshes.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We assess the technoeconomic performance of LSRRO by using an optimization model that minimizes the levelized cost of water (LCOW). We develop detailed models for the RO module and other equipment using WaterTAP (Water treatment Technoeconomic Assessment Platform), an open-source simulation and optimization software for water treatment. We improve upon previous LSRRO cost optimization studies by optimizing the salt permeability for each stage, which has significant implications for technoeconomic performance. We present the cost-optimal design, operation, and performance for three cases: 35 g/L TDS feed at 70% recovery, 70 g/L at 55%, and 125 g/L at 35%. The cost-optimal LCOW and specific energy consumption (SEC) for these cases are 0.70, 1.89, and 7.41 $/m<sup>3</sup> and 3.9, 8.4, and 30.4 kWh/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively. For each case, we use sensitivity analyses to provide guidance on key factors that impact economic viability. We also present the cost-optimal LCOW and SEC for feed concentrations between 5 and 220 g/L TDS and recoveries between 30 and 90%. So, we compare LSRRO to other high-salinity desalination technologies and find that it may be cost-competitive below feed concentrations of 125 g/L.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, based on coupled fire–climate–ecosystem model simulations, summertime wildfire-induced PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations are projected to nearly double in North America by the mid-21st century compared to the present. More strikingly, the projected enhancement in fire-induced PM<sub>2.5</sub> (~1–2 µg m<sup>-3</sup>) and its contribution (~15 %–20 %) to the total PM<sub>2.5</sub> are distinctively significant in the eastern US.

These runup events are associated with inland excursions of hundreds of meters and periods of minutes. While the theory of radiation stress implies that nearshore energy transfer from the carrier waves to the infragravity waves can also lead to very large runup, there have not been observations of runup events induced by this process with magnitudes and periods comparable to the other three mechanisms. This work presents observations of several runup events in the US Pacific Northwest that are comparable to extreme runup events related to the other three mechanisms. It also discusses possible generation mechanisms and shows that energy transfer from carrier waves to bound infragravity waves is a plausible generation mechanism.

"Evaluation of distributed process-based hydrologic model performance using only a priori information to define model inputs","Bhanja, Soumendra N.; Coon, Ethan T.; Lu, Dan; Painter, Scott L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Integrated hydrological models; Catchment hydrology; Model evaluation","Fully distributed, integrated surface–subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) have seen renewed interest due to availability of better software, high performance computing facilities, and high-resolution, spatially extensive data products. ISSHMs are valuable as tools for advancing system understanding as they can resolve multiple processes defined on the plot scale including three-dimensional interaction of surface water and groundwater. Here, we evaluated the performance of an ISSHM, the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), on seven diverse catchments across the continental US using widely available data products to define model inputs without calibration. We compare the ATS-simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with gauge observations and MODIS-derived evapotranspiration, respectively. Using the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as metric, ATS with default data products performed reasonably well at 6 of 7 catchments for streamflow. However, in one of those 6 catchments ATS had poor performance on baseflow and ATS’s overall performance was thus judged to be inadequate despite the acceptable KGE. ATS performance for evapotranspiration was good in all 7 catchments using default data products. In the two catchments where ATS streamflow performance using default data products was not acceptable, the performance was significantly improved by using local information on subsurface properties below the soil. We also compare the model-simulated streamflow and evapotranspiration with the Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SAC-SMA) model, a semi-distributed model that was calibrated on a catchment-by-catchment basis. Uncalibrated ATS performance is comparable to the calibrated SAC-SMA model in terms of streamflow while ATS performance is similar to or better (much better in certain catchments) in reproducing MODIS-derived evapotranspiration. Reasonably good performance of ATS without catchment-specific calibration provides new confidence in the ISSHM class of models and community data products as tools for advancing understanding of watershed function in a changing environment.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Power-to-hydrogen (PtH<sub>2</sub>) technologies based on clean electricity can provide such H<sub>2</sub>, yet their carbon intensities alone do not provide sufficient basis to judge their potential contribution to a sustainable and just energy transition. Introducing a prospective life cycle assessment framework to decipher the non-linear relationships between future technology and energy system dynamics over time, we showcase its relevance to inform research, development, demonstration, and deployment by comparing two PtH<sub>2</sub> technologies to steam methane reforming (SMR) across a series of environmental and resourceuse metrics. We find that the system transitions in the power, cement, steel, and fuel sectors move impacts for both PtH<sub>2</sub> technologies to equal or lower levels by 2100 compared to 2020 per kg of H<sub>2</sub> except for metal depletion. The decarbonization of the United States power sector by 2035 allows PtH<sub>2</sub> to reach parity with SMR at 10 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub>/kg H<sub>2</sub> between 2030 and 2050. Updated H<sub>2</sub> radiative forcing and leakage levels only marginally affect these results. Biomass carbon removal and storage power technologies enable carbon-negative H<sub>2</sub> after 2040 at about –15 kg of CO<sub>2e</sub>/kg H<sub>2</sub>. Still, both PtH<sub>2</sub> processes exhibit higher impacts across most other metrics, some of which are worsened by the decarbonization of the power sector. Observed increases in metal depletion and eco- and human toxicity levels can be reduced via PtH<sub>2</sub> energy and material use efficiency improvements, but the power sector decarbonization routes also warrant further review and cradle-to-grave assessments to show tradeoffs from a systems perspective.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, there are common challenges of typical modeling approaches: process-based hydrologic models can be data/computation-intensive, and statistics-based models can be region/stream-specific. Here we present a nationally scalable modeling framework integrating the simulated runoff from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) routing model leveraging high-performance computing. We demonstrate an efficient method of assimilating streamflow at US Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow monitoring sites using a simple hierarchical approach in the VIC-RAPID framework. The result is a reconstructed 36-year (1980–2015) daily and monthly streamflow dataset (Dayflow) at ~2.7 million NHDPlusV2 stream reaches in the conterminous US (CONUS). We perform a comprehensive evaluation at 7,526 USGS sites and characterize their error statistics. The results demonstrate that 49% of the USGS sites demonstrate Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) > 0.5 and 58% of the sites show percentage bias within ±20% for the daily naturalized streamflow. Streamflow data assimilation across CONUS shows an overall improvement over naturalized streamflow, notably in the western semiarid-to-arid regions. Comparison to other national and global streamflow reanalysis datasets such as the National Water Model and Global Reach-scale A priori Discharge Estimates for SWOT demonstrates improved KGE, reduced bias, and directions for Dayflow improvements. Investigations of error statistics with key hydrologic, hydroclimatic, and geomorphologic basin characteristics reveal region-specific patterns which may help improve future framework applications. Overall, Dayflow may enable a better understanding of hydrologic conditions in a changing environment, especially in locations currently not represented by streamflow monitoring networks.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

While the general ubiquity and importance of NPF is understood, the vertical extent and governing mechanisms of NPF and growth in the lower troposphere are uncertain. We present an analysis of four NPF events and two non-NPF events during the HI-SCALE field campaign at the Southern Great Plains observatory in Oklahoma, USA. Firstly, we analyzed airborne and ground-based observations of aerosol and gas-phase properties. Secondly, we used a column aerosol chemistry and microphysics model to probe factors that influence the vertical profile of NPF. During HI-SCALE, we found several instances of enhanced NPF occurring several hundred meters above the surface; however, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the observed NPF made comparisons between airborne- and ground-based observations difficult. The model represented the observed NPF (or lack of NPF) and particle growth at the surface to final diameters within 10 nm. The model predicted enhanced NPF rates in the upper mixed layer, and this enhancement is primarily due to the temperature dependence in the NPF schemes, but this was also dependent on the vertical profile of gas-phase precursors measured during HI-SCALE. We found vertical mixing in the model either enhanced or suppressed NPF rates, aerosol number concentrations, and particle growth rates at the surface. Here, our analysis provides insights for future field campaigns and modeling efforts investigating the vertical profile of NPF.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Classification Analysis of Southwest Pacific Tropical Cyclone Intensity Changes Prior to Landfall","Bhowmick, Rupsa; Trepanier, Jill C.; Haberlie, Alex M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; tropical cyclone forecasting; landfalling intensity; machine learning classification; random forest classifier; southwest Pacific Ocean","This study evaluates the ability of a random forest classifier to identify tropical cyclone (TC) intensification or weakening prior to landfall over the western region of the Southwest Pacific Ocean (SWPO) basin. For both Australia mainland and SWPO island cases, when a TC first crosses land after spending ≥24 h over the ocean, the closest hour prior to the intersection is considered as the landfall hour. If the maximum wind speed (V<sup>max</sup>) at the landfall hour increased or remained the same from the 24-h mark prior to landfall, the TC is labeled as intensifying and if the V<sup>max</sup> at the landfall hour decreases, the TC is labeled as weakening. Geophysical and aerosol variables closest to the 24 h before landfall hour were collected for each sample. The random forest model with leave-one-out cross validation and the random oversampling example technique was identified as the best-performing classifier for both mainland and island cases. The model identified longitude, initial intensity, and sea skin temperature as the most important variables for the mainland and island landfall classification decisions. Incorrectly classified cases from the test data were analyzed by sorting the cases by their initial intensity hour, landfall hour, monthly distribution, and 24-h intensity changes. TC intensity changes near land strongly impact coastal preparations such as wind damage and flood damage mitigations; hence, this study will contribute to improve identifying and prioritizing prediction of important variables contributing to TC intensity change before landfall.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Blowing Snow at McMurdo Station, Antarctica During the AWARE Field Campaign: Multi-Instrument Observations of Blowing Snow","Loeb, Nicole A.; Kennedy, Aaron","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In polar regions, blowing snow (BLSN) can play a substantial role in regional thermodynamics and radiation properties. The extent of the impact depends upon the depth of the BLSN layer, a property that is difficult to measure and not well understood. The West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) Field Campaign saw the deployment of a large suite of observational instruments to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, allowing for in-depth investigation of BLSN. During the year of the campaign, BLSN occurred ~7.4% of the time. In this study, additional remote sensing observations are used to supplement an existing ceilometer-based BLSN characterization algorithm creating a multi-instrument (MI) depth estimation algorithm to yield layer depths with more certainty. Backscatter coefficient and linear depolarization ratios from the micropulse and high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) are incorporated along with color ratio derived from HSRL backscatter and Ka-band radar reflectivity observations. This provided estimates of BLSN depth that were less impacted by noise/artifacts in any one set of observations. When applied to the data from AWARE, the MI algorithm yielded an average depth of 168.2 m with ~60% of plumes less than 200 m in depth. Events occurring with precipitation saw the most value in the additional instruments, with the suite of observations allowing for more separation of BLSN particles from fallstreaks.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

QBO has a significant positive correlation with near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over central China (92.5–112.5° E, 26–38° N) when the sea surface temperature (SST) over the eastern tropical Pacific is warmer than normal, with a correlation coefficient of 0.53, but QBO has no significant effect on O<sub>3</sub> under the cold SST anomaly. Compared to the easterly phase of QBO, the near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations have an increase of up to 3 ppb (5% relative to the average) over central China during its westerly phase under the warm SST anomaly. O<sub>3</sub> also increases above the surface and up to the upper troposphere, with a maximum increase of 2–3 ppb (3%–5%) in 850–500 hPa over central China when comparing westerly phase to easterly phase. Process-based analysis and sensitivity simulations suggest that the O<sub>3</sub> increase over central China is mainly attributed to the anomalous downward transport of O<sub>3</sub> during the westerly phase of QBO when a warm SST anomaly occurs in the eastern tropical Pacific, while the local chemical reactions and horizontal transport processes partly offset the O<sub>3</sub> increase. This work suggests a potentially important role of QBO and the related vertical transport process in affecting near-surface O<sub>3</sub> air quality, with an indication for O<sub>3</sub> pollution prediction and prevention.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Carbon sequestration and nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation in a freshwater, estuarine marsh: Effects of microtopography and nutrient loads","Villa, Jorge A.; Bohrer, Gil; Ju, Yang; Wrighton, Kelly; Johnson, Nicholas; Kinsman-Costello, Lauren","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Carbon sequestration; Nitrate load; Freshwater mineral soil wetland; Wetland restoration; Lake Erie","Wetlands are widely recognized as nutrient sinks for their ability to remove nutrients in runoff and retain them in soils. This is a valuable service, especially in agricultural watersheds, making nutrient removal one of the main goals in many wetland creation and restoration projects. However, incorporating nutrient management considerations requires site-level assessments, the scale at which wetland creation and restoration occur. Here we studied how carbon (C) sequestration, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accumulation vary at different microtopographic levels and locations within a freshwater, estuarine marsh on the coast of Lake Erie. We further explored links between C sequestration, and N and P accumulation in recent years, and orthophosphate ($PO_{4}^{3-}$), ammonium ($NH_{4}^{+}$), and nitrate ($NO_{3}^{-}$) concentrations and loads. The rates of C sequestration and N accumulation were relatively lower at spots of intermediate depth and locations closer to the wetland’s main channel. P accumulation was highest at deep spots but did not differ among locations based on distance from the channel. Empirical models showed that nitrate load is the most important variable explaining the variability in C, N, and P sequestration/accumulation (r2 = 0.57, 0.61, and 0.32, respectively) and that the relationship between inorganic nutrient loads and accumulation was negative. Our findings suggest that including microtopographic relief features in wetland creation and design, especially deeper spots, is critical to enhancing wetland ecosystems’ C, N, and P sinking capacity. Also, that upstream nitrate management should be a priority to increase benefits from C sequestration and long-term N and P accumulation.","Elsevier","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Updating and Evaluating Anthropogenic Emissions for NOAA’s Global Ensemble Forecast Systems for Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols): Application of an SO<sub>2</sub> Bias-Scaling Method","Jeong, Gill-Ran; Baker, Barry; Campbell, Patrick C.; Saylor, Rick; Pan, Li; Bhattacharjee, Partha S.; Smith, Steven J.; Tong, Daniel; Tang, Youhua","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; bias scaling; SO2 emissions; GEFS-aerosols; CEDS","We updated the anthropogenic emissions inventory in NOAA’s operational Global Ensemble Forecast for Aerosols (GEFS-Aerosols) to improve the model’s prediction of aerosol optical depth (AOD). We used a methodology to quickly update the pivotal global anthropogenic sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) emissions using a speciated AOD bias-scaling method. The AOD bias-scaling method is based on the latest model predictions compared to NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2). The model bias was subsequently applied to the CEDS 2019 SO<sub>2</sub> emissions for adjustment. The monthly mean GEFS-Aerosols AOD predictions were evaluated against a suite of satellite observations (e.g., MISR, VIIRS, and MODIS), ground-based AERONET observations, and the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) ensemble results. The results show that transitioning from CEDS 2014 to CEDS 2019 emissions data led to a significant improvement in the operational GEFS-Aerosols model performance, and applying the bias-scaled SO<sub>2</sub> emissions could further improve global AOD distributions. The biases of the simulated AODs against the observed AODs varied with observation type and seasons by a factor of 3~13 and 2~10, respectively. The global AOD distributions showed that the differences in the simulations against ICAP, MISR, VIIRS, and MODIS were the largest in March–May (MAM) and the smallest in December–February (DJF). When evaluating against the ground-truth AERONET data, the bias-scaling methods improved the global seasonal correlation (r), Index of Agreement (IOA), and mean biases, except for the MAM season, when the negative regional biases were exacerbated compared to the positive regional biases. The effect of bias-scaling had the most beneficial impact on model performance in the regions dominated by anthropogenic emissions, such as East Asia. However, it showed less improvement in other areas impacted by the greater relative transport of natural emissions sources, such as India. The accuracies of the reference observation or assimilation data for the adjusted inputs and the model physics for outputs, and the selection of regions with less seasonal emissions of natural aerosols determine the success of the bias-scaling methods. A companion study on emission scaling of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols needs further improved aerosol prediction.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Climate-driven deterioration of future ozone pollution in Asia predicted by machine learning with multi-source data","Li, Huimin; Yang, Yang; Jin, Jianbing; Wang, Hailong; Li, Ke; Wang, Pinya; Liao, Hong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a secondary pollutant in the atmosphere formed by photochemical reactions that endangers human health and ecosystems. O<sub>3</sub> has aggravated in Asia in recent decades and will vary in the future. In this study, to quantify the impacts of future climate change on O<sub>3</sub> pollution, near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over Asia in 2020–2100 are projected using a machine learning (ML) method along with multi-source data. The ML model is trained with combined O<sub>3</sub> data from a global atmospheric chemical transport model and real-time observations. The ML model is then used to estimate future O<sub>3</sub> with meteorological fields from multi-model simulations under various climate scenarios. The near-surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations are projected to increase by 5 %–20 % over South China, Southeast Asia, and South India and less than 10 % over North China and the Gangetic Plains under the high-forcing scenarios in the last decade of 21st century, compared to the first decade of 2020–2100. The O<sub>3</sub> increases are primarily owing to the favorable meteorological conditions for O<sub>3</sub> photochemical formation in most Asian regions. We also find that the summertime O<sub>3</sub> pollution over eastern China will expand from North China to South China and extend into the cold season in a warmer future. Our results demonstrate the important role of a climate change penalty on Asian O<sub>3</sub> in the future, which provides implications for environmental and climate strategies of adaptation and mitigation.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Modeling Land-Atmosphere Coupling at Cloud-Resolving Scale Within the Multiple Atmosphere Multiple Land (MAML) Framework in SP-E3SM","","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Representing subgrid variabilities of land surface processes and their upscaled effects is crucial for global climate modeling. Here, we implement a Multiple Atmosphere Multiple Land (MAML) framework in the superparamaterized version of E3SM (SP32 E3SM) to explicitly simulate the subgrid variabilities of land states and fluxes at cloud-resolving scale and their interactions with atmosphere. Comparing to the standard SP-E3SM in which all the atmospheric columns of the cloud resolving model embedded within the global atmospheric model grid interact with the same land surface (i.e., Multiple Atmosphere Single Land (MASL)), the impact of MAML on the strength of land-atmosphere coupling is limited, partly because the current implementation mainly facilitates one-way coupling between the cloud-resolving model and the land surface model. Despite such limitation, MAML increases the surface latent heat flux at the expense of sensible heat flux, and increases precipitation in India, Amazon, and Central Africa, reducing the model dry bias compared to the standard SP-E3SM. By employing a normalized gross moist stability (NGMS) diagnostic framework, we find that the increase in precipitation minus evaporation (PE) is primarily driven by the change in large-scale moisture convergence, particularly by the increase of water vapor in the lower atmosphere, while the local effect of total surface energy flux plays a minor role in the P-E change. More specifically, MAML changes the surface energy partitioning (evaporative fraction), increases the atmosphere water vapor, and further increases P-E by decreasing the NGMS. Finally, future development in the MAML framework is discussed.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Distinct regional meteorological influences on low-cloud albedo susceptibility over global marine stratocumulus regions","Zhang, Jianhao (ORCID:0000000169882935); Feingold, Graham (ORCID:0000000207742926)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Marine stratocumuli cool the Earth effectively due to their high reflectance of incoming solar radiation and persistent occurrence. The susceptibility of cloud albedo to droplet number concentration perturbations depends strongly on large-scale meteorological conditions. Studies focused on the meteorological dependence of cloud adjustments often overlook the covariability among meteorological factors and their geographical and temporal variability. We use 8 years of satellite observations sorted by day and geographical location to show the global distribution of marine low-cloud albedo susceptibility. We find an overall cloud brightening potential for most marine warm clouds, which is more pronounced over subtropical coastal regions. A weak cloud darkening potential in the annual mean is evident over the remote SE Pacific and SE Atlantic. We show that large-scale meteorological fields from the ERA5 reanalysis data, including lower-tropospheric stability, free-tropospheric relative humidity, sea surface temperature, and boundary layer depth, have distinct covariabilities over each of the eastern subtropical ocean basins where marine stratocumuli prevail. This leads to a markedly different annual cycle in albedo susceptibility over each basin. Moreover, we find that basin-specific regional relationships between key meteorological factors and albedo susceptibilities are absent in a global analysis. Our results stress the importance of considering the geographical distinctiveness of temporal meteorological covariability when scaling up the local-to-global response of cloud albedo to aerosol perturbations.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In mid-century under a high emissions scenario, precipitation volume from the top 20% of winter storms is projected to increase by up to 40% across the region. Increased area coverage and storm intensity explain 69% and 60% of this increase, respectively, while a robust sharpening of future storms with larger increase in storm center precipitation than increase in storm area offsets the increase by 31%. Ignoring the changing area-intensity relationship due to storm sharpening could overestimate the watershed design storms by up to 10% or 7-75mm across the western US.

"Causes and evolution of winter polynyas north of Greenland","Lee, Younjoo J.; Maslowski, Wieslaw; Cassano, John J.; Clement Kinney, Jaclyn; Craig, Anthony P.; Kamal, Samy; Osinski, Robert; Seefeldt, Mark W.; Stroeve, Julienne; Wang, Hailong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","During the 42-year period (1979–2020) of satellite measurements, four major winter (December–March) polynyas have been observed north of Greenland: one in December 1986 and three in the last decade, i.e., February of 2011, 2017, and 2018. The 2018 polynya was unparalleled in its magnitude and duration compared to the three previous events. Given the apparent recent increase in the occurrence of these extreme events, this study aims to examine their evolution and causality, in terms of forced versus natural variability. The limited weather station and remotely sensed sea ice data are analyzed combining with output from the fully coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), including one hindcast and two ensemble simulations. We found that neither the accompanying anomalous warm surface air intrusion nor the ocean below had an impact (i.e., no significant ice melting) on the evolution of the observed winter open-water episodes in the region. Instead, the extreme atmospheric wind forcing resulted in greater sea ice deformation and transport offshore, accounting for the majority of sea ice loss in all four polynyas. Our analysis suggests that strong southerly winds (i.e., northward wind with speeds greater than 10 m s<sup>–1</sup>) blowing persistently over the study region for at least 2 d or more were required over the study region to mechanically redistribute some of the thickest Arctic sea ice out of the region and thus to create open-water areas (i.e., a latent heat polynya). To assess the role of internal variability versus external forcing of such events, we carried out and examined results from the two RASM ensembles dynamically downscaled with output from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE) simulations. Out of 100 winters in each of the two ensembles (initialized 30 years apart: one in December 1985 and another in December 2015), 17 and 16 winter polynyas were produced north of Greenland, respectively. The frequency of polynya occurrence had no apparent sensitivity to the initial sea ice thickness in the study area pointing to internal variability of atmospheric forcing as a dominant cause of winter polynyas north of Greenland. We assert that dynamical downscaling using a high-resolution regional climate model offers a robust tool for process-level examination in space and time, synthesis with limited observations, and probabilistic forecasts of Arctic events, such as the ones being investigated here and elsewhere.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The development of predictive models of re-burns is thus essential to better understand their primary drivers so that forest management practices can be updated to account for these events. First, we assess the potential for human activity as a driver of re-burns by evaluating re-burn trends both within and outside of the wildland–urban interface (WUI) of the western US. Next, we investigate the predictability of re-burns through the application of both random forest and the explanatory machine learning non-negative matrix factorization using k-means clustering (NMFk) algorithms to predict re-burn occurrence over California based on a number of climate factors. Our findings indicate that while most states showed increasing trends within the WUI when trends were conducted over longer moving windows (e.g. 20 years), California was the only state where the rate of increase was consistently higher in the WUI, indicating a stronger potential for human activity as a driver in that location. Furthermore, we find model performance was found to be robust over most of California (Testing F1 scores = 0.688), although results were highly variable based on EPA level III Ecoregion (F1 scores = 0.0–0.778). Insights provided from this study will lead to a better understanding of climate and human activity drivers of re-burns and how these vary at broad spatial scales so that improvements in forest management practices can be tuned according to the level of change that is expected for a given region.","IOP Publishing","","Los Alamos National Lab.

To overcome the underconstrained nature of inverse problems and achieve good performance, an approach is presented with embedded physics and a technique known as algorithmic differentiation. We use a physics-embedded generative model, which takes statistically simple parameters as input and outputs subsurface properties (e.g., permeability or P-wave velocity), that embeds physical knowledge of the subsurface properties into inverse analysis and improves its performance. We tested the application of this approach on four geologic problems: two heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields, a hydraulic fracture network, and a seismic inversion for P-wave velocity. This physics-embedded inverse analysis approach consistently characterizes these geological problems accurately. Furthermore, the excellent performance in matching the observational data demonstrates the reliability of the proposed method.

"Mesoscale convective clustering enhances tropical precipitation","Angulo-Umana, Pedro; Kim, Daehyun","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In the tropics, extreme precipitation events are often caused by mesoscale systems of organized, spatially clustered deep cumulonimbi, posing a substantial risk to life and property. While the clustering of convective clouds has been thought to strengthen precipitation rate, no quantitative estimates of this hypothesized enhancement exist. In this study, after isolating the effects of mesoscale convective clustering on precipitation, we find that strongly clustered oceanic convection precipitates more intensely than weakly clustered convection. We further show that this enhancement is primarily attributable to an increase in convective precipitation rate when the environment is less than 70% saturated, with increases in the size of the rainy stratiform region being of equal or greater importance when the environment is closer to saturation. Our results suggest that a correct representation of mesoscale organized convective systems in numerical weather and climate models is needed for accurate predictions of extreme precipitation events.","AAAS","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A leading theory for explaining such a relationship is warm-phase invigoration, in which cloudy updrafts that are more polluted more readily condense water vapor onto liquid drops, thereby releasing latent heat faster, leading to higher buoyancies and higher updraft speeds. For this mechanism to work, water-vapor supersaturations well in excess of 1% must be typical of relatively unpolluted cloudy updrafts. Here, for this study, the supersaturation is calculated from in situ observations of warm-phase cloudy updrafts over the Amazon. Instead of values well in excess of 1%, the typical values are found to be around 0.2%. These observations imply that cleaner preindustrial air might have generated supersaturations around 1%, but those are still too low for warm-phase invigoration to have any practically significant impact on cloud buoyancy and updraft speeds.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Storm Surge Modeling as an Application of Local Time-Stepping in MPAS-Ocean","Lilly, Jeremy R.; Capodaglio, Giacomo; Petersen, Mark R.; Brus, Steven R.; Engwirda, Darren; Higdon, Robert L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES; ocean model; climate; time-stepping methods","This paper presents the first practical application of local time-stepping (LTS) schemes in the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean (MPAS-O). We use LTS schemes in a single-layer, global ocean model that predicts the storm surge around the eastern coast of the United States during Hurricane Sandy. The variable-resolution meshes used are of unprecedentedly high resolution in MPAS-O, containing cells as small as 125 m wide in Delaware Bay. It is shown that a particular, third-order LTS scheme (LTS3) produces sea-surface height solutions that are of comparable quality to solutions produced by the classical four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) with a uniform time step on the same meshes. Furthermore, LTS3 is up to 35% faster in the best cases considered, where the number of cells using the coarse time-step relative to those using the fine time-step is as low as 1:1. This shows that LTS schemes are viable for use in MPAS-O with the added benefit of substantially less computational cost. The results of these performance experiments inform us of the requirements for efficient mesh design and configuration of LTS regions for LTS schemes. In particular, we see that for LTS to be efficient on a given mesh, it is important to have enough cells using the coarse time-step relative to those using the fine time-step, typically at least 1:5 to see an increase in performance.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A Coupled Deep Learning Model for Estimating Surface NO<sub>2</sub> Levels from Remote Sensing Data: 15-Year Study Over the Contiguous United States","Ghahremanloo, Masoud; Lops, Yannic; Choi, Yunsoo; Mousavinezhad, Seyedali; Jung, Jia","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","This study proposes a novel two-step deep learning (DL) model for estimating surface NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations using satellite data over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2005 to 2019. The first phase of the model uses partial convolutional neural network (PCNN), an advanced DL model that accurately imputes gaps between surface NO<sub>2</sub> stations and creates 5,478 daily-mean NO<sub>2</sub> grids (PCNN-NO<sub>2</sub>) of the 2005-2019 period over the study area. We then feed the PCNN-NO<sub>2</sub>, along with other predictor variables, into a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate surface NO<sub>2</sub> levels, achieving exceptional performance with a correlation coefficient of 0.975 to 0.978, a mean absolute bias of 0.99 ppb to 1.38 ppb, and a root mean square error of 1.47 ppb to 1.97 ppb. Spatial cross-validation results also indicate strong spatial performance of PCNN-DNN surface NO<sub>2</sub> estimates. In addition to its accurate estimates, the PCNN-DNN model consistently generates estimated NO<sub>2</sub> grids without any missing values, improving the quality of various applications such as emission reduction strategies and public health studies. Between 2005 and 2019, the 5,478 daily estimated NO<sub>2</sub> grids over the CONUS reveal significant reductions in NO<sub>2</sub> levels in fourteen major urban environments: Washington D.C. (-43%), New York (-45%), Los Angeles (-38%), Chicago (-25%), Boston (-43%), Houston (-34%), Dallas (-40%), Philadelphia (-41%), Phoenix (-38%), Detroit (-20%), Denver (-23%), Atlanta (-0.7%), Cincinnati (-38%), and Pittsburgh (-56%). Furthermore, the study shows that the denser urban regions that in-situ stations are installed in, the higher the difference between in-situ observations and regional-mean NO<sub>2</sub> levels.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Such prediction of extraction well performance at designated locations is critical for configuring pump-and-treat (P&T) well network design and operation, setting reasonable target closure dates for overall remedying, and estimating remedy costs. The framework is developed with operational and monitoring data routinely collected during P&T remedy operations, including well extraction and injection rates as well as in situ contaminant concentrations. Traditionally, the collected data were rarely used for purposes other than assessing past well performance and the accuracy of the conceptual site model. However, recent advances in data-driven computational approaches enable better use of the large datasets to inform future well performance, enhance site characterization, and improve remediation planning. In this study, we established a DL framework to integrate transient three-dimensional contaminant plumes and multiple aquifer properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity and hydrostratigraphic maps) to identify characteristic patterns controlling and representing extraction well mass recovery, aiming at providing future mass recovery estimates for existing wells and candidate wells at any proposed locations. We evaluated our framework by using a realistic synthetic dataset generated from a well-calibrated flow and transport model used in the 200 West Area of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hanford Site in southeastern Washington state. The multi-channel feature in our framework allows integration of various types and temporal densities of training datasets for DL model development. Overall, we found that the trained DL model achieved an accuracy of over 90% in ranking extraction well performance in validation datasets, and over 80% in predicting high-performance-ranking well locations. This data-informed approach provides a flexible tool to support adaptive site management, streamline decision-making, and potentially reduce remediation time and costs. Our DL framework can be used as a filtering tool to improve the current P&T network optimization design by reducing the number of candidate well locations.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The Arctic environment is rapidly changing due to accelerated warming in the region. The warming trend is driving a decline in sea ice extent, which thereby enhances feedback loops in the surface energy budget in the Arctic. Arctic aerosols play an important role in the radiative balance and hence the climate response in the region, yet direct observations of aerosols over the Arctic Ocean are limited. In this study, we investigate the annual cycle in the aerosol particle number size distribution (PNSD), particle number concentration (PNC), and black carbon (BC) mass concentration in the central Arctic during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. This is the first continuous, year-long data set of aerosol PNSD ever collected over the sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean. We use a k-means cluster analysis, FLEXPART simulations, and inverse modeling to evaluate seasonal patterns and the influence of different source regions on the Arctic aerosol population. Furthermore, we compare the aerosol observations to land-based sites across the Arctic, using both long-term measurements and observations during the year of the MOSAiC expedition (2019–2020), to investigate interannual variability and to give context to the aerosol characteristics from within the central Arctic. Our analysis identifies that, overall, the central Arctic exhibits typical seasonal patterns of aerosols, including anthropogenic influence from Arctic haze in winter and secondary aerosol processes in summer. The seasonal pattern corresponds to the global radiation, surface air temperature, and timing of sea ice melting/freezing, which drive changes in transport patterns and secondary aerosol processes. In winter, the Norilsk region in Russia/Siberia was the dominant source of Arctic haze signals in the PNSD and BC observations, which contributed to higher accumulation-mode PNC and BC mass concentrations in the central Arctic than at land-based observatories. We also show that the wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) phenomenon, which was reported to achieve a record-breaking positive phase during January–March 2020, explains the unusual timing and magnitude of Arctic haze across the Arctic region compared to longer-term observations. In summer, the aerosol PNCs of the nucleation and Aitken modes are enhanced; however, concentrations were notably lower in the central Arctic over the ice pack than at land-based sites further south. The analysis presented herein provides a current snapshot of Arctic aerosol processes in an environment that is characterized by rapid changes, which will be crucial for improving climate model predictions, understanding linkages between different environmental processes, and investigating the impacts of climate change in future Arctic aerosol studies.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Event Synchronization is used to measure the strength of association between the onset of droughts at different spatial locations within the time lag of 1-3 months. The network coefficients derived from the synchronization network indicate a highly heterogeneous connectivity structure underlying global drought events. Drought hotspot regions such as Southern Europe, Northeast Brazil, Australia, and Northwest USA behave as drought hubs that synchronize regionally and with other hubs at inter-continental or even inter-hemispheric scale. This observed affinity among drought hubs is equivalent to the ‘rich-club phenomenon’ in Network Theory, where ‘rich’ nodes (here, drought hubs) are tightly interconnected to form a club, implicating the possibility of simultaneous large-scale droughts over multiple continents.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We assess possible physiological and mechanistic controls on the estimation of the g<sub>1 </sub>(stomatal slope, inversely proportional to water use efficiency) and g<sub>0</sub> (stomatal intercept) parameters, using diurnal gas exchange surveys and leaf level response curves of six tropical broadleaf evergreen tree species. g<sub>1</sub> estimated from ex-situ response curves averaged 50% less than g<sub>1</sub> estimated from survey data. While g<sub>0</sub> and g<sub>1</sub> varied between leaves of different phenological stages, the trend was not consistent among species. We identified a diurnal trend associated with g<sub>1</sub> and g<sub>0</sub> that significantly improved model projections of diurnal trends in transpiration. The accuracy of modelled g<sub>s</sub> can be improved by accounting for variation in stomatal behavior across diurnal periods, and between measurement approaches, rather than focusing on phenological variation in stomatal behavior. Additional investigation into the primary mechanisms responsible for diurnal variation in g<sub>1</sub> will be required to account for this phenomena in land surface models.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Global and northern-high-latitude net ecosystem production in the 21st century from CMIP6 experiments","Qiu, Han; Hao, Dalei; Zeng, Yelu; Zhang, Xuesong; Chen, Min","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Climate warming is accelerating the changes in the global terrestrial ecosystems and particularly those in the northern high latitudes (NHLs; poleward of 50° N) and rendering the land–atmosphere carbon exchange highly uncertain. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) employs the most updated climate models to estimate terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics driven by a new set of socioeconomic and climate change pathways. By analyzing the future (2015–2100) carbon fluxes estimated by 10 CMIP6 models, we quantitatively evaluated the projected magnitudes, trends, and uncertainties in the global and NHL carbon fluxes under four scenarios plus the role of NHLs in the global terrestrial ecosystem carbon dynamics. Overall, the models suggest that the global and NHL terrestrial ecosystems will be consistent carbon sinks in the future, and the magnitude of the carbon sinks is projected to be larger under scenarios with higher radiative forcing. By the end of this century, the models on average estimate the NHL net ecosystem productivity (NEP) as 0.54 ± 0.77, 1.01 ± 0.98, 0.97 ± 1.62, and 1.05 ± 1.83 Pg C yr<sup>–1</sup> under SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, respectively. The uncertainties are not substantially reduced compared with earlier results, e.g., the Coupled Climate–Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP). Although NHLs contribute a small fraction of the global carbon sink (~13 %), the relative uncertainties in NHL NEP are much larger than the global level. Our results provide insights into future carbon flux evolutions under future scenarios and highlight the urgent need to constrain the large uncertainties associated with model projections for making better climate mitigation strategies.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Variability in modelled reservoir greenhouse gas emissions: comparison of select US hydropower reservoirs against global estimates","Hansen, Carly (ORCID:0000000193280838); Pilla, Rachel; Matson, Paul; Skinner, Bailey; Griffiths, Natalie; Jager, Henriette","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; reservoirs; hydropower","Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from reservoirs have most often been evaluated on a global extent through areal scaling or linear-regression models. These models typically rely on a limited number of characteristics such as age, size, and average temperature to estimate per reservoir or areal flux. Such approaches may not be sufficient for describing conditions at all types of reservoirs. Emissions from hydropower reservoirs have received increasing attention as industry and policy makers seek to better understand the role of hydropower in sustainable energy solutions. In the United States (US), hydropower reservoirs span a wide range of climate regions and have diverse design and operational characteristics compared to those most heavily represented in model literature (i.e., large, tropical reservoirs). It is not clear whether estimates based on measurements and modeling of other subsets of reservoirs describe the diverse types of hydropower reservoirs in the US. We applied the Greenhouse Gas from Reservoirs (G-res) emissions model to 28 hydropower reservoirs located in a variety of ecological, hydrological, and climate settings that represent the range of sizes and types of facilities within the US hydropower fleet. The dominant pathways for resulting GHG emissions estimates in the case-study reservoirs were diffusion of carbon dioxide, followed by methane ebullition. Among these case-study reservoirs, total post-impoundment areal flux of carbon ranges from 84 to 767 mgCm<sup>–2</sup>d<sup>–1</sup>, which is less variable than what has been reported through measurements at other US and global reservoirs. The net GHG reservoir footprint was less variable and towards the lower end of the range observed from modeling larger global reservoirs, with a range of 138 to 1,052 g CO<sub>2</sub> eq m<sup>–2</sup> y<sup>–1</sup>, while the global study reported a range of 115 to 145,472 g CO<sub>2</sub> eq m<sup>–2</sup> y<sup>–1</sup>. High variation in emissions normalized with respect to area and generation highlights the need to be cautious when using area or generation in predicting or communicating emissions footprints for reservoirs relative to those of other energy sources, especially given that many of the hydropower reservoirs in the US serve multiple purposes beyond power generation.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, this study investigates how the June 2012 North American derecho could unfold in the future with global warming. Convection-permitting regional model simulations of the derecho as observed are compared with simulations under a pseudo global warming scenario of the future environments by the end of the 21st century following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP5-8.5). The control simulations can well reproduce the observed derecho features, including storm evolution, surface wind, and precipitation, except for a 2-hour delay relative to observations. Compared to the control simulations, the derecho shrinks and decays earlier in the future environments, with much less destructive impacts on the Mid-Atlantic coastal areas. The shrinkage of the derecho is attributed to the lower relative humidity on both sides of the derecho propagation path under global warming, which suppresses updraft and strengthens downdraft, impeding the spatial extent of the derecho. The premature decay is due to the intensification of an isolated deep convection (IDC) event that develops ahead of the derecho. The meridional gradient of future warming strengthens the synoptic environments, enhancing convergence in a corridor of higher instability that facilitates intensification and continuous development of the IDC event. By consuming most of the energy and moisture on the derecho propagation path, the IDC hinders the derecho development in the Mid-Atlantic coastal areas. Focusing on a single derecho event, this study reveals how changes in the thermodynamic environment with warming could induce complex changes in the derecho.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Neglecting Model Parametric Uncertainty Can Drastically Underestimate Flood Risks","Sharma, Sanjib; Lee, Benjamin Seiyon; Hosseini‐Shakib, Iman; Haran, Murali; Keller, Klaus","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Floods drive dynamic and deeply uncertain risks for people and infrastructures. Uncertainty characterization is a crucial step in improving the predictive understanding of multi-sector dynamics and the design of risk-management strategies. Current approaches to estimate flood hazards often sample only a relatively small subset of the known unknowns, for example the uncertainties surrounding the model parameters. This approach neglects the impacts of key uncertainties on hazards and system dynamics. Here we mainstream a recently developed method for Bayesian inference to calibrate a computationally expensive distributed hydrologic model. We compare three different calibration approaches: (1) stepwise line search, (2) precalibration or screening, and (3) the Fast Model Calibrations (FaMoS) approach. FaMoS deploys a particle-based approach that takes advantage of the massive parallelization afforded by modern high-performance computing systems. We quantify how neglecting parametric uncertainty and data discrepancy can drastically underestimate extreme flood events and risks. Precalibration improves prediction skill score over a stepwise line search. As a result, the Bayesian calibration improves the uncertainty characterization of model parameters and flood risk projections.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2023-01-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Earth's Future Journal Volume: 11 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X","","","DE‐SC0016162; DE‐SC0022141; SC0016162; SC0022141","Journal ID: ISSN 2328-4277","10.1029/2022EF003050","","2023-01-09T00:00:00Z","1908027","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1908027","","Earth's Future","1","11"

Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine- and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. Here we developed an index-guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (i.e. percentage of tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices characteristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470-2819 mm year<sup>-1</sup>). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness with corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n=9 sites) and local phenocams (n=9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90m×90m) with r<sup>2</sup>=0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale seasonality with r<sup>2</sup> ranging from 0.62-0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Multi–year analysis of rain–snow levels at Marquette, Michigan","Shates, Julia A.; Pettersen, Claire; L’Ecuyer, Tristan S.; Kulie, Mark S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; precipitation; radar; rain; remote sensing; instrumentation","This study uses observations from a ground-based instrument suite to investigate the rain-snow level in stratiform rainfall from January 2014 to April 2020 in the Upper Great Lakes Region. The height above the surface where ice melts to rain, the rain-snow level (RSL), influences microphysical assumptions in remote sensing precipitation retrievals and the ability of space-based radar to discriminate surface precipitation phase because of ground clutter. The instrument suite is installed at the Marquette, MI (MQT) National Weather Service station adjacent to Lake Superior. Rain events and the RSL are studied through a ground-based vertically profiling radar (Micro Rain Radar), a custom NASA-developed video disdrometer (Precipitation Imaging Package), and reanalyses products from ECMWF ERA5 and NASA MERRA-2. Further, distinct macro and micro physical characteristics are observed in precipitation events with shallow RSL ( < 1.8 km above ground level [AGL]) and intermediate RSL ( > 1.8 km AGL). Intermediate RSL correspond to rain events with relatively higher rain rates and a higher concentration of small drops in the drop size distributions (DSDs). Shallow RSL DSDs contain relatively higher concentrations of large drops with lower fall speeds suggesting that partially melted snowflakes may be reaching the surface. Reflectivity-rain-rate relationships are also impacted by microphysical differences associated with RSL regimes. Radar-detected RSL agree with reanalysis-derived melt levels- especially at wet-bulb isotherms of 0.5°C and 1°C. Seasonal differences such as shallow rain-snow levels in winter, fall, and spring have subsequent implications for satellite detectability.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In trees, the contribution of leaf hydraulic resistance (Rleaf) to total soil-to-leaf hydraulic resistance (Rtotal) is thought to be high relative to leaf pathlength (fRleaf = Rleaf/Rtotal), but this has rarely been tested. We compiled a multi-biome dataset of fRleaf using new and previously published measurements of pressure differences within trees in situ. Across 80 samples, fRleaf averaged 0.51 (95% CI = 0.46, 0.57) and it declined with tree height. We also used the allometric relationship between soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance and laboratory-based measurements of leaf conductance to compute the average fRleaf among 19 tree samples, which was 0.40 (95% CI = 0.29, 0.56). The in-situ technique produces a more accurate descriptor of fRleaf because it accounts for dynamic leaf hydraulic conductance. Both approaches demonstrate the outsized role of leaves in controlling tree hydrodynamics. Higher fRleaf likely protects stems more from hydraulic conductance loss, so the decline in fRleaf with tree height would make large trees more vulnerable to drought stress and could contribute to their observed disproportionate drought mortality.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

As a result, ecosystem-level responses to these interacting facets of global change remain poorly understood. In 2017, we started an experiment in a coastal wetland that crosses warming and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, to better understand how the interactions of these factors affect the plants, biogeochemistry, and overall survival of these ecosystems. However, contrary to our expectations, when elevated CO<sub>2</sub> is combined with warming, the wetland accumulated less carbon, making it more vulnerable to sea-level rise. This was due to the plants transporting more oxygen into the soil, which stimulated aerobic decomposition. At the same time, the increased supply of oxygen reduced net methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from the system, even though warming alone substantially increased CH<sub>4</sub> emission. Together, these results demonstrate that ecosystem responses to interacting facets of global change may be mediated by plant traits that regulate the soil environment. Thus, plant responses are critical for predicting future ecosystem survival and climate feedbacks.","Nature Publishing Group","","Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, MD (United States); Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, VA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Geoscience; Related Information: Noyce G ; Megonigal J P ; Smith A ; Kirwan M ; Rich R (2022): Oxygen priming induced by elevated CO2 reduces carbon accumulation and methane emissions in coastal wetlands, 2017-2020, Maryland.

Retardant applications are carefully planned to maximize fire line effectiveness, improve firefighter safety, protect high-value resources and assets, and limit environmental impact. However, topography, wind, visibility, and aircraft orientation can lead to differences between planned drop locations and the actual placement of the retardant. Information on the precise placement and areal extent of the dropped retardant can provide wildland fire managers with key information to (1) adaptively manage event resources, (2) assess the effectiveness of retardant slowing or stopping fire spread, (3) document location in relation to ecologically sensitive areas; and perform or validate cost-accounting for drop services. This study uses Sentinel-2 satellite data and commonly used machine learning classifiers to test an automated approach for detecting and mapping retardant application. We show that a multiclass model (retardant, burned, unburned, and cloud artifact classes) outperforms a single-class retardant model and that image differencing (post-application minus pre-application) outperforms single-image models. Compared to the random forest and support vector machine, the gradient boosting model performed the best with an overall accuracy of 0.88 and an F1 Score of 0.76 for fire retardant, though results were comparable for all three models.

The depth of thawed ground overlying permafrost (active layer thickness) has broadly increased across the Arctic in recent decades, coincident with a period of increased streamflow, especially the lowest flows (baseflow). Mechanistic links between active layer thickness and baseflow have recently been explored using linear reservoir theory, but most watersheds behave as nonlinear reservoirs. We derive theoretical nonlinear relationships between long-term average saturated soil thickness $\bar{η}$(proxy for active layer thickness) and long-term average baseflow. When applied to 38 years of daily streamflow data for the Kuparuk River basin on the North Slope of Alaska, the theory predicts $\bar{η}$ increased 0.17 ± 0.22[2σ] cm a<sup>-1</sup> between 1983 and 2020 (6.4 ± cm total). The rate of increase nearly doubled to 0.29 ± 0.31 cm a<sup>-1</sup> between 1990 and 2020, during which time local field measurements from Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring sites indicate the active layer increased 0.31 ± 0.22 cm a<sup>-1</sup>. The predicted rate of increase more than doubled again between 2002 and 2020, outpacing a near doubling of observed active layer thickening, consistent with trends in terrestrial water storage inferred from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite gravimetry and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications climate reanalysis. Overall, hydrologic change is accelerating in the Kuparuk River basin, and we provide a theoretical framework for estimating basin-scale changes in active layer water storage from streamflow measurements.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Investigating the Unique Ability of <em>Trichodesmium</em> To Fix Carbon and Nitrogen Simultaneously Using MiMoSA","Gardner, Joseph J.; Hodge, Bri-Mathias S.; Boyle, Nanette R.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; cyanobacteria; flux analysis; metabolic modeling; systems biology","The open ocean is an extremely competitive environment, partially due to the dearth of nutrients. Trichodesmium erythraeum, a marine diazotrophic cyanobacterium, is a keystone species in the ocean due to its ability to fix nitrogen and leak 30 to 50% into the surrounding environment, providing a valuable source of a necessary macronutrient to other species. While there are other diazotrophic cyanobacteria that play an important role in the marine nitrogen cycle, Trichodesmium is unique in its ability to fix both carbon and nitrogen simultaneously during the day without the use of specialized cells called heterocysts to protect nitrogenase from oxygen. Here, we use the advanced modeling framework called multiscale multiobjective systems analysis (MiMoSA) to investigate how Trichodesmium erythraeum can reduce dimolecular nitrogen to ammonium in the presence of oxygen. Our simulations indicate that nitrogenase inhibition is best modeled as Michealis-Menten competitive inhibition and that cells along the filament maintain microaerobia using high flux through Mehler reactions in order to protect nitrogenase from oxygen. We also examined the effect of location on metabolic flux and found that cells at the end of filaments operate in distinctly different metabolic modes than internal cells despite both operating in a photoautotrophic mode. These results give us important insight into how this species is able to operate photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation simultaneously, giving it a distinct advantage over other diazotrophic cyanobacteria because they can harvest light directly to fuel the energy demand of nitrogen fixation.","American Society for Microbiology","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A common approach of handling this forcing is to expand mass anomalies into spherical harmonics, which are scaled by load Love numbers to account for elastic earth deformation. We investigate two different approaches to perform these calculations for ocean models that employ unstructured meshes and distributed memory parallelization. The first approach leverages a highly efficient spherical harmonics library, but requires all-to-one and one-to-all communications and interpolation operations between the unstructured and a structured mesh. This approach is compared to a parallel algorithm that computes the spherical harmonic transformations directly on the unstructured mesh with an all-reduce communication. Here, our results show that although the unstructured mesh calculations are more expensive, the scalability of the unstructured mesh approach allows for more efficient spherical harmonics transforms for high-resolution meshes and large processor counts. This methodology enables the efficient inclusion of tidal dynamics large-scale Earth system model simulations.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

They thus appear to be a stopgap solution despite their potential contribution to circular water management. Low-maintenance but inaccurate soft sensors are emerging that address this concern. However, how their inaccuracy impacts the catchment-wide treatment performance of a system of many OSTs has not been quantified. Here, we develop a stochastic model to estimate catchment-wide OST performances with a Monte Carlo simulation. In our study, soft sensors with a 70% accuracy improved the treatment performance from 66% of the time functional to 98%. Soft sensors optimized for specificity, indicating the true negative rate, improve the system performance, while sensors optimized for sensitivity, indicating the true positive rate, quantify the treatment performance more accurately. This new insight leads us to suggest programming two soft sensors in practical settings with the same hardware sensor data as input: one soft sensor geared to high specificity for maintenance scheduling and one geared to high sensitivity for performance quantification. Our findings suggest that a maintenance strategy combining inaccurate sensors with appropriate alarm management can vastly improve the mean catchment-wide treatment performance of a system of OSTs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Tropical forests cycle more carbon, water, and energy than any other biome (Bonan, 2008). The Amazon is the largest tropical forest, spanning one-third of South America, and any perturbation in its function has repercussions on the global climate. Mild and severe droughts in the Amazon are predicted to double and triple in area, respectively, by 2100, while the area under wet extremes will increase (Duffy et al., 2015). Our understanding of the role of plants' hydrological environments in determining their drought response, however, is limited (Chitra-Tarak et al., 2018, 2021). An important review by Costa et al. (2023; pp. 714–733) published in this issue of New Phytologist highlights that shallow-water table (WT) forests constitute c. 50% of the Amazon and may act as hydrological refugia during droughts, yet they have been neglected in Amazon forest research to date. Emerging results suggest that the shallow-WT forests that dominate the Amazon basin may increase in productivity under moderate droughts due to relief from hypoxia, suggesting a potential buffer from drought relative to deeper WT forests (Fig. 1). During severe droughts, however, shallow-WT forests may be vulnerable to collapse due to drought-intolerant traits. Addressing the underrepresentation of relatively drought-resilient shallow-WT forests in the Amazon's forest inventories may help resolve the much-debated incongruence in recent studies of the Amazon's drought resilience. Data from forest inventories (biased toward deep-WT forests) indicate that the Amazon's carbon sink is declining, partially because of drought impacts (Phillips et al., 2009; Brienen et al., 2015), whereas basin-wide satellite-based measures of gross primary productivity, which include shallow-WT forests, indicate varied regional responses to droughts (Saleska et al., 2007; Brando et al., 2010). Costa et al.'s (2023) descriptive insights of the intricate balance of geology, topography, hydrology, vegetation, and drought on ecosystem function, as well as their conceptual predictive framework, are useful for developing new empirical research in these understudied ecosystems and improving Earth system models.","Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Multi-scale Analysis of Surface Heterogeneity Induced Convection on Isentropic Coordinates","Chen, Jingyi; Hagos, Samson; Xiao, Heng; Fast, Jerome; Feng, Zhe","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atmosphere-land interaction; convective clouds; cumulus clouds; clouds","This research uses semi-idealized simulations to investigate multi-scale processes induced by the heterogeneity of soil moisture observed during the 2016 Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) field campaign. The semi-idealized simulations have realistic land heterogeneity, but large-scale winds are removed. Analysis on isentropic coordinates enables the tracking of circulation that transports energy vertically and facilitates the identification of the primary convective processes induced by realistic land heterogeneity. The isentropes associated with upward motion are found to connect the ground characterized by high latent heat flux to cloud bases directly over the ground with high sensible heat flux, while isentropes associated with downward motion connect precipitation to the ground characterized by high sensible heat fluxes. The mixing of dry, warm parcels ascending from the ground with high sensible heat fluxes and moist parcels from high latent heat regions leads to cloud formation. This new mechanism explains how soil moisture heterogeneity provides the key ingredients such as buoyancy and moisture for shallow cloud formation. We also found that the sub-mesoscale dominates upward energy transport in the boundary layer, while mesoscale circulations contribute to vertical energy transport above the boundary layer. Our novel method better illustrates and elucidates the nature of land atmospheric interactions under irregular and realistic soil moisture patterns.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of relevant systems that incorporate representative organic solutes allow detailed investigation of changes in fundamental interfacial and capillary properties. Experiments: We use MD simulations to explore the effects of four organic solutes (quinoline, decanoic acid, coronene, sorgoleone) on the wettability of quartz by water in the presence of scCO2. We examine the impacts of polar, alkyl, and aromatic moieties as well as fluid flow velocity at elevated temperatures and pressures. Findings: Organic molecules accumulate at the water-CO2 interface, where they distribute according to their size and functional groups. Certain organics penetrate the adsorbed water film at the quartz-CO2 interface, revealing two modes of hydrogen bonding between polar organic functional group, water, and quartz surface –OH groups. Interfacial energies and contact angles are minimally impacted by organic adsorption at the water-CO2 interface, possibly due to simultaneous CO2 desorption. Non- equilibrium MD simulations reveal that flow-induced redistribution of organic compounds modulates the radii of curvature of the advancing and receding water-CO2 interfaces. Our results indicate that organic adsorption on water surfaces is likely ubiquitous during multi-phase flow in soils and sedimen- tary rocks, with implications for the mobilization and transport of organic compounds.","Elsevier","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

The accurate representation of carbonaceous aerosols in climate models is critical for reducing uncertainties in their climate feedback. In this regard, emission fluxes and aerosol life cycle processes are the two primary sources of uncertainties. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a dynamic ageing scheme and emission estimates that are updated for the local sources improves the representation of carbonaceous aerosols over the Indian monsoon region in a regional climate model, RegCM, compared with its default configuration. The respective mean black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) surface concentrations in 2010 are estimated to be 4.25 and 10.35 µg m<sup>-3</sup> over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in the augmented model. The BC column burden over the polluted IGP is found to be 2.47 mg m<sup>-2</sup>, 69.95 % higher than in the default model configuration and much closer to available observations. The anthropogenic aerosol optical depth (AOD) increases by more than 19 % over the IGP due to the model enhancement, also leading to a better agreement with observed AOD. The respective top-of-the-atmosphere, surface, and atmospheric anthropogenic aerosol short-wave radiative forcing are estimated at -0.3, -9.3, and 9.0 W m<sup>-2</sup> over the IGP and -0.89, -5.33, and 4.44 W m<sup>-2</sup> over Peninsular India (PI). Our results suggest that the combined effect of two modifications leads to maximum improvements in the model performance in regions where emissions play a dominant role.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Despite significant differences between simulations using idealized sinusoidal topography and real topography of the Amazon forest, results indicate that the effects of topography are located predominantly in the upper canopy and above, and are mostly caused by mean advection of TKE. The “horizontally” averaged TKE budget from idealized and real gentle topographies are almost identical to that for flat terrain, including a clear inertial layer above the roughness sublayer in which shear production is balanced by local dissipation. At topography crests, where observational towers are usually located, mean vertical advection of TKE can be as important as horizontal advection. We propose the use on an approximate TKE balance equation to estimate mean advection from single tower measurements, and introduce a new advection index that can be used as a proxy to quantify the importance of the topography on the TKE budget.","American Meteorological Society","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Population data are typically aggregated at census enumeration units, which can have arbitrary, temporally-evolving boundaries. Previous approaches to imperviousness-based dasymetric mapping ignore cell-level patterning of imperviousness within a spatial unit of prediction, which potentially serve as a strong indicator of population. Landscape metrics derived from imperviousness data offer a promising approach to capture these patterns. In this study, we incorporate landscape metrics derived from impervious cover percentage maps into intelligent dasymetric mapping to downscale population from census tracts to block groups in four states with varying population densities: Connecticut, South Carolina, West Virginia, and New Mexico. We compare the performance of the landscape metrics-based models against two baseline models in all four states across three different time periods. The results show that intelligent dasymetric mapping using landscape metrics generally outperforms the two baseline models. We further compare the performance of landscape metrics as an ancillary source of information for dasymetric mapping against other traditionally-used datasets (e.g., land use, roads, nighttime lights data) in three states (Connecticut, South Carolina, and New Mexico) in 2000. We find that class area, landscape shape index, and number of patches consistently achieve lower error rates than other ancillary datasets in all the three states.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A common approach for investigating population- or community-level impacts on bioindicators compares demographic parameter estimates (e.g., population size or density) between sites that were subjected to different levels of contamination. However, the traditional analytical method used in such studies is nonspatial capture-recapture, which results in conclusions about potential relationships between demographics and contaminants being inferred indirectly. Here, we extend this comparative approach to the spatially explicit framework, allowing direct estimation of said relationships and comparisons between study areas, by applying spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models to bioindicator (deer mice [Peromyscus spp.]) detection data from two study areas that were subjected to different industrial activities and remediation practices. Bioindicator density differed by 178% between the neighboring study areas, and the area with the highest soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, chromium, and zinc had the highest bioindicator density. Under the traditional nonspatial approach, we might have concluded that soil chemical levels had negligible influences on demographics. However, by modeling density as a spatial function of select chemical concentrations using SCR models, we found strong support for a positive relationship between density and soil chromium concentrations in one study area (β = 0.82), which was not masked by or associated with habitat-related metrics. To obtain reliable inferences about potential effects of environmental contamination on bioindicator demographics, we contend that a comparative spatially explicit approach using SCR ought to become standard.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

An accurate characterization of tundra vegetation composition is required to understand how the Arctic will respond to future climate change. However, quantifying tundra vegetation composition over large areas is challenging as commonly-used satellite observations are too coarse, spatially and spectrally, to differentiate low-lying tundra vegetation types. Recent airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy platforms provide better data to characterize vegetation composition. Yet, our ability to characterize vegetation composition with imaging spectroscopy remains largely unexplored in the Arctic, particularly due to a lack of ground observations needed to train and test classification models. To address this problem, we collected very-high-resolution (VHR, ~5 cm) unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery at three low-Arctic tundra sites located on the Seward Peninsula, western Alaska. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of integrating imagery from the UAS and the hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) airborne instrument to map the fractional composition of 12 key Arctic plant functional types (PFTs). To this end, we first mapped the 12 PFTs from our VHR UAS imagery using random forest classification. We then used these UAS-derived PFT maps as ground truth to develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict the fractional cover (FCover) of each PFT from AVIRIS-NG imagery. Further, we evaluated the performance of our PLSR models using reserved UAS samples, as well as by mapping PFT FCover and dominant PFT for large tundra landscapes. Our results show that 1) Arctic PFTs can be effectively mapped using VHR UAS imagery, with overall accuracy between 86% and 92%, 2) when the UAS mapped PFTs were used to inform PLSR scaling models, the FCover of the 12 PFTs could be effectively estimated from AVIRIS-NG imagery with a mean absolute error (MAE) <0.13, and 3) our PLSR models outperformed traditional, fully constrained least-squares (FCLS) linear mixture analysis and produced high-quality, spatially contiguous PFT FCover and PFT maps that captured vegetation spatial patterns with similar accuracy to those developed from UAS imagery. The developed PLSR models have the potential to be broadly applied for quantifying vegetation composition with AVIRIS-NG images to help monitor tundra vegetation dynamics and improve process-based modeling of tundra ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Grassland productivity responds unexpectedly to dynamic light and soil water environments induced by photovoltaic arrays","Sturchio, Matthew A.; Macknick, Jordan E.; Barron‐Gafford, Greg A.; Chen, Anping; Alderfer, Cavin; Condon, Kathleen; Hajek, Olivia L.; Miller, Benjamin; Pauletto, Benjamin; Siggers, J. Alexander; Slette, Ingrid J.; Knapp, Alan K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; agrivoltaic; dryland agriculture; dryland ecology; light response of photosynthesis; plant physiology","Agrivoltaic (AV) systems are designed to coproduce photovoltaic (PV) energy on lands simultaneously supporting agriculture (food/forage production). PV infrastructure in agroecosystems alters resources critical for plant growth, and water-limited agroecosystems such as grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to the unique spatial and temporal patterns of incident sunlight and soil water inherent within AV systems. However, the impact of resource alteration on forage production, the primary ecosystem service from managed grasslands, is poorly resolved. Here, we evaluated seasonal patterns of soil moisture (SM) and diurnal variation in incident sunlight (photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) in a single-axis-tracking AV system established in a formerly managed semiarid C<sub>3</sub> grassland in Colorado. Our goals were to (1) quantify dynamic patterns of PPFD and SM within a 1.2 MW PV array in a perennial grassland, and (2) determine how aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and photosynthetic parameters responded to the resource patterns created by the PV array. We hypothesized that spatial variability in ANPP would be strongly related to SM patterns, typical of most grasslands. We measured significant reductions in ANPP directly beneath PV panels, where SM and PPFD were both low. However, in locations with significantly increased SM from the shedding and redistribution of precipitation by PV panels, ANPP was not increased. Instead, ANPP was greatest in locations where plants were shaded in the afternoon but received high levels of PPFD in the morning hours, when air temperatures and vapor pressure deficits were relatively low. Thus, contrary to expectations, we found relatively weak relationships between SM and ANPP despite significant spatial variability in both. Further, there was little evidence that light-saturated photosynthesis (A<sub>sat</sub>) and quantum yield of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (ΦCO<sub>2</sub>) differed for plants growing directly beneath (lowest PPFD) versus between (highest PPFD) PV panels. Overall, the AV system established in this semiarid managed grassland did not alter patterns of ANPP in ways predictable from past studies of controls of ANPP in open grasslands. However, our results suggest that the diurnal timing of low versus high periods of PPFD incident on plants is an important determinant of productivity patterns in grasslands.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this trend are poorly understood. Here, we analyze multi-model simulations from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to investigate potential drivers of the observed precipitation trend. We find that anthropogenic sulfate aerosols over remote polluted regions in South and East Asia lead to increased summer precipitation, especially convective and extreme precipitation, in arid Central Asia. Elevated concentrations of sulfate aerosols over remote polluted Asia cause an equatorward shift of the Asian Westerly Jet Stream through a fast response to cooling of the local atmosphere at mid-latitudes. This shift favours moisture supply from low-latitudes and moisture flux convergence over arid Central Asia, which is confirmed by a moisture budget analysis. High levels of absorbing black carbon lead to opposing changes in the Asian Westerly Jet Stream and reduced local precipitation, which can mask the impact of sulfate aerosols. This teleconnection between arid Central Asia precipitation and anthropogenic aerosols in remote Asian polluted regions highlights long-range impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on atmospheric circulations and the hydrological cycle.</jats:p>","Springer Nature","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Our results show that the machine learning postprocessor can improve streamflow forecasts relative to low-complexity forecasts (e.g., climatological and temporal persistence) as well as standalone hydrometeorological modeling and neural network. The relative gain in forecast skill from postprocessor is generally higher at medium-range timescales compared to shorter lead times; high flows compared to low–moderate flows, and the warm season compared to the cool ones.

Traditional computer vision methods rely on low-level visual features of clouds for estimating cloud coverage or sky conditions. Several handcrafted approaches have been proposed; however, scope for improvement still exists. Newer deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated superior performance for cloud segmentation and categorization. These methods, however, need expert engineering intervention in the preprocessing steps—in the traditional methods—or human assistance in assigning cloud or clear sky labels to a pixel for training DNNs. Such human mediation imposes considerable time and labor costs. We present the application of a new self-supervised learning approach to autonomously extract relevant features from sky images captured by ground-based cameras, for the classification and segmentation of clouds. We evaluate a joint embedding architecture that uses self-knowledge distillation plus regularization. We use two datasets to demonstrate the network’s ability to classify and segment sky images—one with ~85,000 images collected from our ground-based camera and another with 400 labeled images from the WSISEG database. We find that this approach can discriminate full-sky images based on cloud coverage, diurnal variation, and cloud base height. Additionally, it semantically segments the cloud areas without labels. The approach shows competitive performance in all tested tasks, suggesting a new alternative for cloud characterization.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Strictly Enforcing Invertibility and Conservation in CNN-Based Super Resolution for Scientific Datasets","Geiss, Andrew; Hardin, Joseph C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; radars/radar observations; remote sensing; downscaling; climate models; deep learning; machine learning","<title>Abstract</title> <p> Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image “super resolution” (SR), dramatically outperforming past methods for enhancing image resolution. They could be a boon for the many scientific fields that involve imaging or any regularly gridded datasets: satellite remote sensing, radar meteorology, medical imaging, numerical modeling, and so on. Unfortunately, while SR-CNNs produce visually compelling results, they do not necessarily conserve physical quantities between their low-resolution inputs and high-resolution outputs when applied to scientific datasets. Here, a method for “downsampling enforcement” in SR-CNNs is proposed. A differentiable operator is derived that, when applied as the final transfer function of a CNN, ensures the high-resolution outputs <italic>exactly</italic> reproduce the low-resolution inputs under 2D-average downsampling while improving performance of the SR schemes. The method is demonstrated across seven modern CNN-based SR schemes on several benchmark image datasets, and applications to weather radar, satellite imager, and climate model data are shown.

Here, we introduce a method to modify existing deep neural network architectures so that they strictly conserve physical quantities in the input field when “super resolving” scientific data and find that the method can improve performance across a wide range of datasets and neural networks. Integration of known physics and adherence to established physical constraints into deep neural networks will be a critical step before their potential can be fully realized in the physical sciences.</p> </sec>","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Divergent responses of soil microorganisms to throughfall exclusion across tropical forest soils driven by soil fertility and climate history","Chacon, Stephany S.; Cusack, Daniela F.; Khurram, Aizah; Bill, Markus; Dietterich, Lee H.; Bouskill, Nicholas J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Field; Throughfall exclusion; Microbial community; Tropical rainforest; Panama; SOM; Mean annual","Model projections predict tropical forests will experience longer periods of drought and more intense precipitation cycles under a changing climate. Such transitions have implications for structure-function relationships within microbial communities. We examine how throughfall exclusion might reshape prokaryotic and fungal communities across four lowland forests in Panama with a wide variation in mean annual precipitation and soil fertility. Four sites were established across a 1000 mm span in Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP: 2335–3421 mm). We expected microbial communities at sites with lower MAP to be less sensitive to throughfall exclusion than sites with higher MAP and fungal communities to be more resistant to disturbance than prokaryotes. At each location, partial throughfall exclusion structures were established over 10 × 10 m plots to reduce direct precipitation input. After short-term (~3–9 months) throughfall exclusion, prokaryotic communities showed no change in composition. However, prolonged (12–18 months) throughfall exclusion resulted in divergent prokaryotic community responses, reflecting MAP and soil fertility. We observed the emergence of a “drought microbiome” within infertile sites, whereby the community structure of the experimental throughfall exclusion plots at the lower MAP sites diverged from their respective control sites and converged towards overlapping assemblages. Furthermore, under throughfall exclusion, taxa increasing in relative abundance at the wettest site reflected that endemic to control plots at the lowest MAP site, suggesting a shift toward communities with lifehistory traits selected for under a lower MAP. By contrast, fungal community composition across sites was resilient to throughfall exclusion; however, biomass diverged in response to throughfall exclusion, increasing at two sites while decreasing in the other two. Broadly, our results suggest that microbial communities’ sensitivity to frequent drying and rewetting periods in tropical forest soils will depend on climate history and soil fertility, with infertile sites likely to respond readily to changes in precipitation.","Elsevier","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Plant-Soil Relationships Influence Observed Trends Between Manganese and Carbon Across Biomes","Santos, Fernanda; Herndon, Elizabeth","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; manganese; carbon; soil organic matter; lignin; plant-soil interactions","Manganese (Mn) is an essential plant micronutrient that plays a critical role in the litter decomposition by oxidizing and degrading complex organic molecules. Previous studies report a negative correlation between Mn concentrations and carbon (C) storage in organic horizons and suggest that high Mn concentrations in leaf litter reduce soil C storage in forest ecosystems, presumably by stimulating the oxidation of lignin by fungal enzymes. Yet, the relationship between Mn and C in the litter layer and organic soil remains poorly understood and restricted to a few biomes, hampering our ability to improve mechanistic understanding of soil C accumulation. Here, to examine plant-soil interactions that underlie observed relationships between Mn and C across a wide range of biomes, we extracted biogeochemical data reported for plants and soils from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) database. We found that increased C and nitrogen (N) storage in organic horizons were associated with declines in Mn concentrations across diverse ecosystems at the continental scale, and this relationship was associated with the degree of organic matter decomposition (i.e., O<sub>i</sub>, O<sub>e</sub>, and O<sub>a</sub>). Carbon and N stocks were more strongly correlated with Mn than with climatic variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation). Foliar Mn was strongly correlated with foliar lignin, and both these parameters increased with a decrease in soil pH, indicating links between soil pH, foliar chemistry, and litter decomposability. Our observations suggest that increased Mn bioavailability and accumulation in foliage under moderately acidic soil conditions support fungal decomposition of lignin-rich litter and contributes to lower soil C stocks.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A review of water valuation metrics: Supporting sustainable water use in manufacturing","Das, Sujit; Fuchs, Heidi; Philip, Ritu; Rao, Prakash","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Water valuation metrics; Manufacturing use; Economics; Sustainability; Technology infrastructure","In the manufacturing sector, water has been often considered too cheap to conserve. Such thinking relies on water valuations that limit the value of water to the price paid. Using such simple methods, the share of water cost to total manufacturing cost is significantly small, <3%. As a result, conserving water and enabling technology uptake is difficult to justify economically and slow to advance, hindering progress toward sustainable water use. However, the value of water to a manufacturer is far greater than the price paid. Valuations such as the true cost of water consider the additional in-plant treatment and energy costs and have been gaining greater traction in the manufacturing sector. However, true cost alone still undervalues water by not accounting for economic and social costs related to scarcity and environmental externalities. This paper makes the case and presents a framework for valuing manufacturing water beyond the price paid and the true cost. The proposed fuller valuation of manufacturing water takes into account the internal and opportunity costs associated with the realization of water risks. The paper follows with a review of a wide range of water valuation metrics, both at the specific industry level and regional/economy-wide level. The use of various valuation metrics incorporating the relationship between the change in value with change in water use, such as marginal value of water, shadow price, and elasticity at the specific industry level, has been limited in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Further, a limited number of studies exist on data-intensive subjective evaluation techniques such as computable general equilibrium modeling and input-output modeling for regional water valuation. After reviewing water value metrics, several recent case studies from manufacturers from the literature are presented to illustrate both the promise and challenges of a fuller valuation of water as proposed here. Some large multinational corporations have moved toward assessing the value of water via supply chain sustainability initiatives, environmental profit and loss accounting, estimating risk-adjusted values of water, hydro-economic modeling, natural capital asset valuation, and developing value chain indices. This paper provides policymakers and technology developers a framework for monetizing water value beyond its true cost and current metrics. If adopted, such fuller water valuations can help make the business case for the development and deployment of cost-effective water-conserving technologies, thereby improving the sustainability of the manufacturing sector with respect to water.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Observations of Mantle Seismic Anisotropy Using Array Techniques: Shear-Wave Splitting of Beamformed SmKS Phases","Wolf, Jonathan; Frost, Daniel A.; Long, Maureen D.; Garnero, Edward; Aderoju, Adeolu O.; Creasy, Neala Marie; Bozdağ, Ebru","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Shear-wave splitting measurements are commonly used to resolve seismic anisotropy in both the upper and lowermost mantle. Typically, such techniques are applied to SmKS phases that have reflected (m-1) times off the underside of the core-mantle boundary before being recorded. Practical constraints for shear-wave splitting studies include the limited number of suitable phases as well as the large fraction of available data discarded because of poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) or large measurement uncertainties. Array techniques such as beamforming are commonly used in observational seismology to enhance SNRs, but have not been applied before to improve SmKS signal strength and coherency for shear wave splitting studies. Here, we investigate how a beamforming methodology, based on slowness and backazimuth vespagrams to determine the most coherent incoming wave direction, can improve shear-wave splitting measurement confidence intervals. Through the analysis of real and synthetic seismograms, we show that (a) the splitting measurements obtained from the beamformed seismograms (beams) reflect an average of the single-station splitting parameters that contribute to the beam; (b) the beams have (on average) more than twice as large SNRs than the single-station seismograms that contribute to the beam; (c) the increased SNRs allow the reliable measurement of shear wave splitting parameters from beams down to average single-station SNRs of 1.3. Beamforming may thus be helpful to more reliably measure splitting due to upper mantle anisotropy. Moreover, here we show that beamforming holds potential to greatly improve detection of lowermost mantle anisotropy by demonstrating differential SKS–SKKS splitting analysis using beamformed USArray data.","American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Seasonal Locking of the MJO’s Southward Detour of the Maritime Continent: The Role of the Australian Monsoon","Kang, Daehyun; Kim, Daehyun; Rushley, Stephanie; Maloney, Eric","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Maritime Continent; Madden-Julian oscillation; Monsoons; Moisture/moisture budget; Intraseasonal variability; Seasonal cycle","This study investigates why the major convective envelope of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) detours to the south of the Maritime Continent (MC) only during boreal winter [December–March (DJFM)]. To examine processes affecting this MJO detour, the MJO-related variance of precipitation and column-integrated moisture anomalies in DJFM are compared with those in the seasons before [October–November (ON)] and after [April–May (AM)]. While MJO precipitation variance is much higher in the southern MC (SMC) during DJFM than in other seasons, the MJO moisture variance is comparable among the seasons, implying that the seasonal locking of the MJO’s southward detour cannot be explained by the magnitude of moisture anomalies alone. The higher precipitation variance in the SMC region is partly explained by the much higher moisture sensitivity of precipitation in DJFM than in other seasons, resulting in a more efficient conversion of anomalous moisture to anomalous precipitation. DJFM is also distinguishable from the other seasons by stronger positive wind–evaporation feedback onto MJO precipitation anomalies due to the background westerly wind in the lower troposphere. It is found that the seasonal cycle of moisture–precipitation coupling and wind–evaporation feedback in the SMC region closely follows that of the Australian monsoon, which is active exclusively in DJFM. Our results suggest that the MJO’s southward detour in the MC is seasonally locked because it occurs preferentially when the Australian monsoon system produces a background state that is favorable for MJO development in the SMC.","American Meteorological Society","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States); Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Aside from setting long-term goals, the pathways followed by nations will involve a series of synergies and trade-offs both between and within these agendas. Since it will not be possible to optimise across the 17 SDGs while simultaneously transitioning to low-carbon societies, it will be necessary to implement policies to address the most critical aspects of the agendas and understand the implications for the other dimensions. Here, we rely on a modelling exercise to analyse the long-term implications of a variety of Paris-compliant mitigation strategies suggested in the recent scientific literature on multiple dimensions of the SDG Agenda. The strategies included rely on technological solutions such as renewable energy deployment or carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions such as afforestation and behavioural changes in the demand side. Results for a selection of energy-environment SDGs suggest that some mitigation pathways could have negative implications on food and water prices, forest cover and increase pressure on water resources depending on the strategy followed, while renewable energy shares, household energy costs, ambient air pollution and yield impacts could be improved simultaneously while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, results indicate that promoting changes in the demand side could be beneficial to limit potential trade-offs.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Still, their role in the response of phytoplankton to rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is poorly understood. Here, we show that the response of the cosmopolitan Emiliania huxleyi (E. huxleyi) to increasing CO<sub>2</sub> is affected by the coexistence with bacteria. Specifically, decreased growth rate of E. huxleyi at enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations was amplified in the bloom phase (potentially also related to nutrient concentrations) and with the coexistence with Idiomarina abyssalis (I. abyssalis) and Brachybacterium sp. In addition, enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations also affected E. huxleyi’s cellular content estimates, increasing organic and decreasing inorganic carbon, in the presence of I. abyssalis, but not Brachybacterium sp. At the same time, the bacterial isolates only survived in coexistence with E. huxleyi, but exclusively I. abyssalis at present CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Bacterial species or group-specific responses to the projected CO<sub>2</sub> rise, together with the concomitant effect on E. huxleyi, might impact the balance between the microbial loop and the export of organic matter, with consequences for atmospheric carbon dioxide.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we investigated how root exudate from plants of three diverging lineages, Lactuca sativa (lettuce), Brassica juncea (mustard cabbage), and Zea mays (maize) influence the growth of their own rhizosphere bacteria (host) and those from other plant species (non-host) in growth bioassays. We found that on the community level, lettuce rhizosphere bacteria grew better in non-host exudate, but mustard cabbage and maize rhizosphere bacteria grew similarly well in both host and non-host exudate. However, individual bacteria taxa showed strong preferences for exudate from different plant species. The bacterial growth patterns were independent of C and N quantity, suggesting that certain exometabolic compounds may drive the growth patterns. Our results demonstrate that root exudate from a given plant species have the potential to stimulate or suppress soil bacteria and hint at a mechanism that different plant species use to select for their specific suite of rhizosphere bacteria. Furthermore, these findings contribute to our broader understanding of how root exudate quality could be a mechanism that plants use to select for distinct microbial communities in the rhizosphere.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

A better understanding of the role of TCs within the climate system requires a fully coupled modeling framework, where TC-induced ocean responses feed back to the atmosphere and subsequently to the climate mean state and variability. Here, we investigate the impacts of TC wind forcing on the global ocean and the associated feedbacks within the climate system using the fully coupled Community Earth System Model version 1.3 (CESM1.3). Using the low-resolution version of CESM1.3 (1° atmosphere and ocean grid spacing) with no intrinsic TCs, we conduct a suite of sensitivity experiments by inserting TC winds extracted from a high-resolution (0.25° atmosphere grid spacing) TC-permitting simulation into the low-resolution model. Results from the low-resolution TC experiment are compared to a low-resolution control simulation to diagnose TCs’ impact. We found that the added TC winds can increase ocean heat content by affecting ocean vertical mixing, air–sea enthalpy fluxes, and cloud amount. Here, the added TCs can influence mean SST, precipitation, ocean subsurface temperature, and ocean mixed layer depth. We found a strengthening of the wind-driven subtropical cells and a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation due to the changes of surface buoyancy fluxes. TCs in the model cause anomalous equatorward ocean heat convergence in the deep tropics and an increase of poleward ocean heat transport out of the subtropics. Our modeling results provide new insights into the multiscale interactions between TCs and the coupled climate system.","American Meteorological Society","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Estimating snow cover from high-resolution satellite imagery by thresholding blue wavelengths","Thaler, Evan Austin; Crumley, Ryan Landon; Bennett, Katrina Eleanor","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; snow; remote sensing; planet satellite imagery; blue wavelength","We report the extent and duration of snow cover, a critical component of the hydrologic cycle and the global climate system, is expected to shift dramatically under climate change. Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snow-covered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of F-scores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snow-related processes.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We quantified for the first time the impact of O<sub>3</sub> deposition to the Arctic sea ice on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) O<sub>3</sub> concentration and budget using year-round flux and concentration observations from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign and simulations with a single-column atmospheric chemistry and meteorological model (SCM). Based on eddy-covariance O<sub>3</sub> surface flux observations, we find a median surface resistance on the order of 20,000 s m<sup>–1</sup>, resulting in a dry deposition velocity of approximately 0.005 cm s<sup>–1</sup>. This surface resistance is up to an order of magnitude larger than traditionally used values in many atmospheric chemistry and transport models. The SCM is able to accurately represent the yearly cycle, with maxima above 40 ppb in the winter and minima around 15 ppb at the end of summer. However, the observed springtime ozone depletion events are not captured by the SCM. In winter, the modelled PBL O<sub>3</sub> budget is governed by dry deposition at the surface mostly compensated by downward turbulent transport of O<sub>3</sub> towards the surface. Advection, which is accounted for implicitly by nudging to reanalysis data, poses a substantial, mostly negative, contribution to the simulated PBL O<sub>3</sub> budget in summer. During episodes with low wind speed (<5 m s<sup>–1</sup>) and shallow PBL (<50 m), the 7-day mean dry deposition removal rate can reach up to 1.0 ppb h<sup>–1</sup>. Our study highlights the importance of an accurate description of dry deposition to Arctic sea ice in models to quantify the current and future O<sub>3</sub> sink in the Arctic, impacting the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> budget, which has been modified in the last century largely due to anthropogenic activities.","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"On the measurement of <em>S</em><sub>diff</sub> splitting caused by lowermost mantle anisotropy","Wolf, Jonathan; Long, Maureen D.; Creasy, Neala Marie; Garnero, Edward","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; planetary interiors; numerical modelling; computational seismology; seismic anisotropy; wave propagation","Seismic anisotropy has been detected at many depths of the Earth, including its upper layers, the lowermost mantle and the inner core. While upper mantle seismic anisotropy is relatively straightforward to resolve, lowermost mantle anisotropy has proven to be more complicated to measure. Due to their long, horizontal ray paths along the core–mantle boundary (CMB), S waves diffracted along the CMB (S<sub>diff</sub>) are potentially strongly influenced by lowermost mantle anisotropy. S<sub>diff</sub> waves can be recorded over a large epicentral distance range and thus sample the lowermost mantle everywhere around the globe. S<sub>diff</sub> therefore represents a promising phase for studying lowermost mantle anisotropy; however, previous studies have pointed out some difficulties with the interpretation of differential SH<sub>diff</sub>–SV<sub>diff </sub>traveltimes in terms of seismic anisotropy. Here, we provide a new, comprehensive assessment of the usability of S<sub>diff</sub> waves to infer lowermost mantle anisotropy. Using both axisymmetric and fully 3-D global wavefield simulations, we show that there are cases in which S<sub>diff </sub>can reliably detect and characterize deep mantle anisotropy when measuring traditional splitting parameters (as opposed to differential traveltimes). First, we analyze isotropic effects on S<sub>diff</sub> polarizations, including the influence of realistic velocity structure (such as 3-D velocity heterogeneity and ultra-low velocity zones), the character of the lowermost mantle velocity gradient, mantle attenuation structure, and Earth’s Coriolis force. Secondly, we evaluate effects of seismic anisotropy in both the upper and the lowermost mantle on SH<sub>diff</sub> waves. In particular, we investigate how SH<sub>diff</sub> waves are split by seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle near the source and how this anisotropic signature propagates to the receiver for a variety of lowermost mantle models. We demonstrate that, in particular and predictable cases, anisotropy leads to S<sub>diff</sub> splitting that can be clearly distinguished from other waveform effects. Here, these results enable us to lay out a strategy for the analysis of S<sub>diff</sub> splitting due to anisotropy at the base of the mantle, which includes steps to help avoid potential pitfalls, with attention paid to the initial polarization of S<sub>diff</sub> and the influence of source-side anisotropy.

"Interaction between cloud–radiation, atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics based on observational data from GoAmazon 2014/15 and a cloud-resolving model","Gonçalves, Layrson M.; Coelho, Simone M. S. C.; Kubota, Paulo Y.; Souza, Dayana C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Observational meteorological data from the field experiment GoAmazon 2014/15 and data from numerical simulations with the cloud-resolving model (CRM) called the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) are used to study the interaction between the cloudiness–radiation as well as the atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics variables for a site located in the central Amazon region (–3.2°S, –60.6°W) during the wet and dry periods. The main aims are to (a) analyze the temporal series of the integrated cloud fraction, precipitation rate and downward shortwave flux as well as (b) to determine the relationship between the integrated cloud fraction, radiative fluxes and large-scale variable anomalies as a function of the previous day's average. The temporal series of the integrated cloud fraction, precipitation rate and downward shortwave flux from SAM simulations showed physical consistency with the observations from GoAmazon 2014/15. Shallow and deep convection clouds show to have a meaningful impact on radiation fluxes in the Amazon region during wet and dry periods. Anomalies of large-scale variables (relative to the previous day's average) are physically associated with cloud formation, evolution and dissipation. SAM consistently simulated these results, where the cloud fraction vertical profile shows a pattern very close to the observed data (cloud type). Additionally, the integrated cloud fraction and large-scale variable anomalies, as a function of the previous day's average, have a good correlation. These results suggest that the memory of the large-scale dynamics from the previous day can be used to estimate the cloud fraction as well as the water content, which is a variable of the cloud itself. In general, the SAM satisfactorily simulated the interaction between cloud–radiation as well as dynamic and thermodynamic variables of the atmosphere during the periods of this study, being able to obtain atmospheric variables that are impossible to obtain in an observational way.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Exploring the Consistency of Water Scarcity Inferences between Large-Scale Hydrologic and Node-Based Water System Model Representations of the Upper Colorado River Basin","Hadjimichael, Antonia; Yoon, Jim; Reed, Patrick; Voisin, Nathalie; Xu, Wenwei","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Water resources model development and simulation efforts have seen rapid growth in recent decades to aid evaluations and planning around water scarcity and allocation. Models are typically developed by two distinct communities: (1) large-scale hydrologic modelers emphasizing hydroclimatological processes, and (2) water systems modelers emphasizing environmental, infrastructural, and institutional features that shape water scarcity at the local basin level. This study assesses whether two representative models from these communities produce consistent insights when evaluating the water scarcity vulnerabilities in the Upper Colorado River Basin within the state of Colorado. Results showed that although the regional-scale model [model for scale adaptive river transport (MOSART)—water management (WM)] can capture the aggregate effect of all water operations in the basin, it underestimates the subbasin-scale variability in specific user’s vulnerabilities. The basin-scale water systems model [State of Colorado’s Stream Simulation Model (StateMod)] suggests a larger variance of scarcity across the basin’s water users due to its more detailed accounting of local water allocation infrastructure and institutional processes. This model intercomparison highlights potentially significant limitations of large-scale studies in seeking to evaluate water scarcity and actionable adaptation strategies, as well as ways in which basin-scale water systems model’s information can be used to better inform water allocation and shortage when used in tandem with larger-scale hydrological modeling studies.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Influence of Spatial Dipole Pattern in Asian Aerosol Changes on East Asian Summer Monsoon","","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; monsoons; climate models; aerosol radiative effect; aerosols/particulates","Since China implemented the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013, the aerosol emissions in East Asia have been greatly reduced, while emissions in South Asia have continued to increase. This has led to a dipole pattern of aerosol emissions between South Asia and East Asia. We report the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) responses to the dipole changes in aerosol emissions during 2013–17 are investigated using the atmosphere model of Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We show that decreases in East Asian emissions alone lead to a positive aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) of 1.59 (±0.97) W m<sup>-2</sup> over central-eastern China (25°–40°N, 105°–122.5°E), along with a 0.09 (±0.07)°C warming in summer during 2013–17. The warming intensified the land–sea thermal contrast and increased the rainfall by 0.32 (±0.16) mm day<sup>-1</sup>. When considering both the emission reductions in East Asia and increases in South Asia, the ERF is increased to 3.39 (±0.89) W m<sup>-2</sup>, along with an enhanced warming of 0.20 (±0.08)°C over central-eastern China, while the rainfall insignificant decreased by 0.07 (±0.16) mm day<sup>-1</sup>. It is due to the westward shift of the strengthened western Pacific subtropical high, linked to the increase in black carbon in South Asia. Based on multiple EASM indices, the reductions in aerosol emissions from East Asia alone increased the EASM strength by almost 5%. Considering the effect of the westward shift of WPSH, the dipole changes in emissions together increased the EASM by 5%–15% during 2013–17, revealing an important role of South Asian aerosols in changing the East Asian climate.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As a result, models offering precise simulation in operations often acquire individual cloud transmittance or reflectance from a lookup table precomputed for practicable scenarios. To further expedite the computation of global horizontal irradiance and to reduce the storage requirements, the Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications (FARMS) parameterized the lookup table using elementary functions with specified coefficients. This study extends FARMS direct normal irradiance (DNI) computation by utilizing hyperbolic tangent functions and various polynomial functions to parameterize the cloud transmittance for scattered solar radiation in the circumsolar region. The parameterization is implemented in FARMS with DNI (FARMS-DNI) and accounts for the circumsolar radiation when assessing or forecasting DNI. The evaluation, with long-term observations at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's, Solar Radiation Research Laboratory, and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement, Southern Great Plains, Central Facility, shows that the parameterized DNIs are virtually identical with those computed by coupling FARMS-DNI to a lookup table of cloud transmittance. This parameterization has diverse applications in radiative transfer models and numerical weather prediction models used to assess or forecast direct solar radiation.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

E3SMv2 is a significant evolution from its predecessor E3SMv1, resulting in a model that is nearly twice as fast and with a simulated climate that is improved in many metrics. We describe the physical climate model in its lower horizontal resolution configuration consisting of 110 km atmosphere, 165 km land, 0.5° river routing model, and an ocean and sea ice with mesh spacing varying between 60 km in the mid-latitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles. The model performance is evaluated with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations augmented with historical simulations as well as simulations to evaluate impacts of different forcing agents. The simulated climate has many realistic features of the climate system, with notable improvements in clouds and precipitation compared to E3SMv1. E3SMv1 suffered from an excessively high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 5.3 K. In E3SMv2, ECS is reduced to 4.0 K which is now within the plausible range based on a recent World Climate Research Program assessment. However, a number of important biases remain including a weak Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, deficiencies in the characteristics and spectral distribution of tropical atmospheric variability, and a significant underestimation of the observed warming in the second half of the historical period. An analysis of single-forcing simulations indicates that correcting the historical temperature bias would require a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the aerosol-related forcing.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Long-term observations of turbulence vertical velocity spectra in a convective mixed layer: Dependence on land-surface forcing in the U.S. Southern Great Plains","Williams, Ian N.; Qiu, Shaoyue","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; convective boundary layer; vertical velocity spectra; atmospheric stability; turbulence scale and structure; Doppler lidar","Doppler lidar vertical velocity retrievals were analyzed for the scale and structure of mixed-layer turbulence over a 7-year period, on fair-weather warm season days (442 cases) in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. Based on the hypothesized influence of land-surface forcing and updraft size on convective boundary layer clouds, a spectral analysis was performed to quantify effects of surface forcing (surface buoyancy flux, friction velocity, and evaporative fraction) on turbulence scale. Here, significant (order-of-magnitude) variations in spectral density were found in the energy-production subrange and mesoscale regimes. Integral scale decreased with increasing buoyancy flux (and Monin-Obukhov stability parameter), while spectral density in the energy production subrange increased, implying a transition to buoyancy-driven cellular structures with narrower updrafts. The influence of stability parameter was limited to the neutral to convective transition, and could not explain the wide variation in spectral density in the mesoscale regime. However, high friction velocity (u*> 0.5 m s<sup>–1</sup>) was associated with larger integral scale (updraft width), and a greater portion of spectral density in the mesoscale regime. Lidar profiles and radar reflectivity for individual cases revealed evidence of roll and wave-like structures contributing to mesoscale variability on high friction velocity days, suggesting shear instabilities on days with wetter land surface conditions and smaller buoyancy flux. The role of friction velocity emphasizes the multivariate nature of surface influences on turbulence, and implies that variance-based turbulence closures may not be adequate for capturing effects of surface forcing on updraft size.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Drying of tundra landscapes will limit subsidence-induced acceleration of permafrost thaw","Painter, Scott L.; Coon, Ethan T.; Khattak, Ahmad Jan; Jastrow, Julie D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; permafrost; active layer; climate change; thermokarst","We used a model for permafrost hydrology informed by detailed measurements of soil ice content to better understand the potential risk of abrupt permafrost thaw triggered by melting ground ice, a key open question associated with permafrost response to a warming Arctic. Our spatially resolved simulations of a well-characterized site in polygonal tundra near Utqiagvik, Alaska, agree well with multiple types of observations in the current climate. Projections indicate 63 cm of bulk subsidence from 2006 to 2100 in the strong-warming Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate. Permafrost thaw as measured by the increase in active layer thickness (ALT)—the thickness of the soil layer that thaws each summer—is accelerated by subsidence, but the effect is relatively small. The ALT increases from the current-day value of approximately 50 cm to approximately 180 cm by 2100 when subsidence is included compared to about 160 cm when it is neglected. In these simulations, previously identified positive feedbacks between subsidence and thaw are self-limiting on decadal time frames because landscape runoff and increasing evapotranspiration result in drier tundra with weaker surface/atmosphere coupling. These results for a tundra site that is representative of large swathes of the Alaska North Slope suggest that subsidence is unlikely to lead to abrupt thaw over large areas. However, subsidence does have significant effects on the hydrology of polygonal tundra. Specifically, subsidence increases landscape runoff, which helps maintain streamflow in the face of increased evapotranspiration but also causes drier tundra conditions that could have deleterious effects on sensitive Arctic wetland ecosystems.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, numerical experiments with different combinations of climate and emissions highlighted opposite changes of annual ozone over the contiguous U.S. under scenarios with high vs. low ozone precursor emissions in the future with warming. Comparing the occurrence of heat waves on higher vs. lower ozone days, we found significant suppression of the heat wave exacerbation of ozone by anthropogenic emissions reductions. Variations of ozone with temperature (T) and water vapor (Q) over the western U.S. and southeastern U.S. in the simulations are clearly revealed through the construction of an O<sub>3</sub>-T-Q diagram. Based on the diagram, we further identified a T-dominant regime at higher temperatures where ozone increases with temperature increase, and a Q-dominant regime at lower temperatures where ozone decreases with temperature increase due to the negative effect of water vapor. With larger anthropogenic emission reductions, ozone may increase at a lower rate with temperature in the T-dominant regime, or even decrease with temperature in the Q-dominant regime. Our results show that with large emission reductions, substantial ozone pollution due to warming and increasing heat waves may be counteracted by water vapor, partly turning the ‘climate penalty’ on ozone into ‘climate benefit’. Hence controlling anthropogenic emissions may be an increasingly important strategy in a warmer and wetter climate to improve air quality and public health.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Coupling of nitric acid digestion and anion-exchange resin separation for the determination of methylmercury isotopic composition within organisms","Crowther, Elizabeth R.; Demers, Jason D.; Blum, Joel D.; Brooks, Scott C.; Johnson, Marcus W.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; Mercury isotopes; Methylmercury; Anion-exchange resin; Nitric acid digestion; Aquatic organisms; Separation","Isotope ratios of methylmercury (MeHg) within organisms can be used to identify sources of MeHg that have accumulated in food webs, but these isotopic compositions are masked in organisms at lower trophic levels by the presence of inorganic mercury (iHg). To facilitate measurement of MeHg isotope ratios in organisms, we developed a method of extracting and isolating MeHg from fish and aquatic invertebrates for compound-specific isotopic analysis involving nitric acid digestion, batch anion-exchange resin separation, and pre-concentration by purge and trap. Recovery of MeHg was quantified after each step in the procedure, and the average cumulative recovery of MeHg was 93.4 ± 2.9% (1 SD, n = 28) for biological reference materials and natural biota samples and 96.9 ± 1.8% (1 SD, n = 5) for aqueous MeHgCl standards. The amount of iHg impurities was also quantified after each step, and the average MeHg purity was 97.8 ± 4.3% (1 SD, n = 28) across all reference materials and natural biota samples after the final separation step. Measured MeHg isotopic compositions of reference materials agreed with literature values obtained using other MeHg separation techniques, and MeHg isotope ratios of aqueous standards, reference materials, and natural biota samples were reproducible. On average, the reproducibility associated with reference material process replicates (2 SD) was 0.10‰ for δ202MeHg and 0.04‰ for Δ199MeHg. This new method provides a streamlined, reliable technique that utilizes a single sample aliquot for MeHg concentration and isotopic analysis. This promotes a tight coupling between MeHg concentration, %MeHg, and Hg isotopic composition, which may be especially beneficial for studying complex food webs with multiple isotopically distinct sources of iHg and/or MeHg.","Springer","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Quantifying the drivers of ecosystem fluxes and water potential across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in an arid woodland","Kannenberg, Steven A.; Barnes, Mallory L.; Bowling, David R.; Driscoll, Avery W.; Guo, Jessica S.; Anderegg, William R.L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Gross primary productivity; Evapotranspiration; Net ecosystem exchange; Piñon-juniper woodland; Precipitation pulse; Water potential","Dryland ecosystems occupy a vast swath of the terrestrial land surface and exert a sizeable impact on the cycling of carbon and water globally. These biomes are characterized by tightly coupled carbon and water cycles that respond rapidly to transient pulses in water availability. However, there exist many mechanistic uncertainties regarding the environmental drivers of, and linkages between, plant and ecosystem processes. Thus, drylands are often poorly represented in many vegetation and land surface models. An enhanced understanding of dryland ecosystem function is limited by the lack of long-term, co-located, and frequent measurements of plant and ecosystem processes. At a piñon-juniper woodland in southeastern Utah, USA, we collected a continuous dataset of meteorological conditions, soil water potential from surface to bedrock, tree water potential, and ecosystem carbon and water fluxes from eddy covariance. We found that predawn and midday tree water potential and daily ecosystem fluxes were highly sensitive to fluctuations in soil water availability, particularly in shallower layers, and that daytime variability in atmospheric drivers only loosely controlled these processes. The strong connections between shallow soil water potential, tree water potential, and ecosystem fluxes occurred because of the dominant role of precipitation pulses in driving vegetation activity, as even small pulses of moisture stimulated shallow soil water potential, tree water potential, and evapotranspiration for between 1 and 2 weeks. Carbon fluxes (net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity) were sensitive to precipitation pulses for longer, up to 3 weeks. Our results highlight that improved monitoring and sensing of shallow soil moisture can greatly enhance our understanding of dryland ecosystem function. Here, a better mechanistic understanding of the impacts of precipitation pulses is also needed to improve vegetation modeling of dryland ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Current nature-based biological practices for rare earth elements extraction and recovery: Bioleaching and biosorption","Brown, Rebecca McKenzie; Mirkouei, Amin; Reed, David W.; Thompson, Vicki S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Bioleaching; Biosorption; Rare Earth Element; Electronic Wastes; Renewable; Sustainability","There is a growing demand for advancing products and renewable technologies worldwide that rely on rare earth elements (REEs), including those directly necessary for a low-carbon energy transition, national security applications, and consumer electronics. This study focuses on current nature-based biological methods (i.e., bioleaching and biosorption) for REEs extraction from electronic wastes (e-wastes) and ore deposits. Herein, comprehensive narrative and systematic reviews of bioleaching and biosorption extraction methods are performed to identify their sustainability challenges and benefits, and highlight the potential pathways that would address the existing gaps. From the narrative review, it is evident that biological methods for REEs extraction are more environmentally friendly than conventional methods currently used in the REE mining industry (e.g., acid leaching and solvent extraction). From the systematic review, it is clear that bioleaching and biosorption research has been a rapidly growing field of interest over the last 10 years, particularly for precious metals extraction (e.g., copper and gold). From both reviews, it is apparent that REEs extraction from domestic ore deposits alone is inadequate, and sustainable REEs recovery from e-wastes is also necessary to meet the growing REEs demand. It is concluded that targeted mixed REEs extraction for specific products can be a potential pathway for sustainable REEs extraction from both ore and e-wastes that would reduce separation costs and emissions from the associated use of harsh chemicals. It is further concluded that nature-based biological REE extraction solutions offer an opportunity to generate significant socio-economic and environmental benefits.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Tibetan Plateau (TP) spring observed surface temperatures show a lag correlation with summer precipitation in several remote regions, but current global land-atmosphere coupled models are unable to represent this behavior due to significant errors in producing observed TP surface temperatures. To address these issues, the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) program launched the “Impact of Initialized Land Surface Temperature and Snowpack on Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction” (LS4P) initiative as a community effort to test the impact of land temperature in high mountain regions on S2S prediction by climate models: more than 40 institutions worldwide are participating in this project. After using an innovative new land state initialization approach based on observed surface 2-meter temperature over the TP in the LS4P experiment, results from a multi-model ensemble provide evidence for a causal relationship in the observed association between the Plateau spring land temperature and summer precipitation over several regions across the world through teleconnections. The influence is underscored by an out-of-phase oscillation between the TP and Rocky Mountain surface temperatures. This study reveals for the first time that high mountain land temperature could be a substantial source of S2S precipitation predictability, and its effect is probably as large as ocean surface temperature over global “hot spot” regions identified here; the ensemble means in some “hot spots” produce more than 40% of the observed anomalies. This LS4P approach should stimulate more follow-on explorations.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The Role of Cloud–Cloud Interactions in the Life Cycle of Shallow Cumulus Clouds","Chen, Jingyi; Hagos, Samson M.; Feng, Zhe; Fast, Jerome D.; Xiao, Heng","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; boundary layer; clouds; convective clouds","Some of the climate research puzzles relate to a limited understanding of the critical factors governing the life cycle of cumulus clouds. These factors force the initiation and the various mixing processes during cloud life cycles. To shed some light into these processes, we tracked the life cycle of thousands of individual shallow cumulus clouds in a large-eddy simulation during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems field campaign in the U.S. southern Great Plains. Concurrent evolution of clouds is tracked and their respective neighboring clouds are examined. Results show that the clouds initially smaller than neighboring clouds can grow larger than the neighboring clouds by a factor of 2 within 20% of their lifetime. Two groups of the tracked clouds with growing and decaying neighboring clouds, respectively, show distinct characteristics in their life cycles. Clouds with growing neighboring clouds form above regions with larger surface heterogeneity, whereas clouds with decaying neighboring clouds are associated with less heterogeneous surfaces. Also, those with decaying neighboring clouds experience larger instability and a more humid boundary layer, indicating evaporation below the cloud base is likely occurring before those clouds are formed. Larger instability leads to higher vertical velocity and convergence within the cloud, which causes stronger surrounding downdrafts and water vapor removal in the surrounding area. The latter appears to be the reason for the decaying neighboring clouds. Finally, understanding those processes provide insights into how cloud–cloud interactions modulate the evolution of cloud population and into how this evolution can be represented in future cumulus parameterizations.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, previous modeling studies of the effectiveness of river corridors in removing excess nitrogen via denitrification were often limited to the reach-scale and low-order stream watersheds. We developed a basin-scale river corridor model based on SWAT-MRMT-R to account for denitrification in the hyporheic zone (HZ) for the Columbia River Basin (CRB) with random forest models to identify what factors control the spatial variation of HZ denitrification in streams with different sizes and land uses. Our modeling results suggest that the combined effects of hydrologic variability in streams and substrate availability influenced by land-use control the spatial variability of HZ denitrification at the basin scale. Hyporheic exchange flux can explain the denitrification extent in different-sized streams, while among the streams affected by different land uses, the combination of hyporheic exchange flux and stream concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can explain the denitrification differences. Also, we can generalize that the most influential watershed and stream variables controlling denitrification variation are stream morphology parameters (D50, stream slope), climate (annual precipitation), and stream DOC-related parameters (percent of forest area). The modeling framework in our study can serve as a useful tool to identify the limiting factors in removing excess N pollution in large river basins where direct measurement is often infeasible.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4‰ at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site-by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 ± 1.2 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> to increase SOC stocks by 4‰ per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median ± median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Here, our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi-model ensembles when predicting SOC stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition.","Wiley - British Society of Soil Science","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, vegetation cover in rural areas is often dominated by cultivated land, whose phenological timing is considerably influenced by agricultural managements (e.g., timing of sowing and harvesting), leading to biased conclusions derived from the urban-rural LSP differences. To demonstrate this problem, we investigated the crop influence on the phenological response to a warmer environment resulting from the UHI effect. We partitioned cities in the United States into cultivated and non-cultivated categories according to the proportion of crops in rural areas. We then built continuous buffer zones starting from the urban boundary to explore the urban-rural LSP differences considering the UHI effect on them. In this work, the results suggest crop inclusion is likely to lead to >14 days of urban-rural differences at both the start of the season (SOS) and the end of the season (EOS) between cultivated and non-cultivated cities. The temperature sensitivity (ST) of SOS is overestimated by approximately 2.7 days/°C, whereas the EOS is underestimated by 3.6 days/°C. Removing crop-dominated pixels (i.e., above 50 %) can minimize the influence of crop planting/harvesting on LSP and derive reliable results. We, therefore, suggest explicit consideration of crop impacts in future studies of phenological differences between urban and rural areas and the UHI effect on LSP in urban domains, as presented by this comprehensive study.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the nature of these intermediates, the mechanisms by which they form, and their roles in downstream oxidation reactions remain unclear. Here, we use a combination of optical and X-ray transient absorption spectroscopies to study the formation, interconversion, and relaxation of several excited-state and metastable high-valent iron species following excitation of aqueous potassium ferrate(VI) by ultraviolet and visible light. Branching from the initially populated ligand-to-metal charge transfer state into independent photophysical and photochemical pathways occurs within tens of picoseconds, with the quantum yield for the generation of reactive Fe(V) species determined by relative rates of the competing intersystem crossing and reverse electron transfer processes. Relaxation of the metal-centered states then occurs within 4 ns, while the formation of metastable Fe(V) species occurs in several steps with time constants of 250 ps and 300 ns.

Previous observational studies have shown that Arctic sea ice leads are an important source of sea salt aerosols, and modeling efforts have also proposed blowing snow sublimation as a source. In this study, size-resolved atmospheric particle number concentrations and chemical composition were measured at the Arctic coastal tundra site of Utqiagvik, Alaska, during spring (3 April–7 May 2016). Blowing snow conditions were observed during 25 % of the 5-week study period and were overpredicted by a commonly used blowing snow parameterization based solely on wind speed and temperature. Throughout the study, open leads were present locally. During periods when blowing snow was observed, significant increases in the number concentrations of 0.01–0.06 µm particles (factor of 6, on average) and 0.06–0.3 µm particles (67 %, on average) and a significant decrease (82 %, on average) in 1–4 µm particles were observed compared to low wind speed periods. These size distribution changes were likely caused by the generation of ultrafine particles from leads and/or blowing snow, with scavenging of supermicron particles by blowing snow. At elevated wind speeds, both submicron and supermicron sodium and chloride mass concentrations were enhanced, consistent with wind-dependent local sea salt aerosol production. At moderate wind speeds below the threshold for blowing snow as well as during observed blowing snow, individual sea spray aerosol particles were measured. These individual salt particles were enriched in calcium relative to sodium in seawater due to the binding of this divalent cation with organic matter in the sea surface microlayer and subsequent enrichment during seawater bubble bursting. The chemical composition of the surface snowpack also showed contributions from sea spray aerosol deposition. Overall, these results show the contribution of sea spray aerosol production from leads on both aerosols and the surface snowpack. Therefore, if blowing snow sublimation contributed to the observed sea salt aerosol, the snow being sublimated would have been impacted by sea spray aerosol deposition rather than upward brine migration through the snowpack. Sea spray aerosol production from leads is expected to increase, with thinning and fracturing of sea ice in the rapidly warming Arctic.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Competition between main meniscus and corner film flow during imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube","Zhao, Jianlin; Qin, Feifei; Fei, Linlin; Qin, Chaozhong; Kang, Qinjun; Derome, Dominique; Carmeliet, Jan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences; Imbibition; Corner film; Viscous coupling; Interacting capillary bundle model; Phase diagram","Imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube with corner flow can be described by an interacting capillary bundle model, where the first sub-capillary describes the main meniscus flow while the others describe corner film flow. In this work, an advanced modified interacting capillary bundle model (MICBM) is developed to simulate imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube incorporating the viscous coupling effect. The flow conductances of each sub-capillary are obtained from two-phase lattice Boltzmann simulations with different viscosity ratios considering the viscous coupling effect. After verifying its accuracy, MICBM is used to analyze the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus and corner film flows under different conditions. The results show that, with increasing viscosity ratio between wetting and non-wetting fluids and increasing driving force, the wetting corner film development tends to be less significant compared with main meniscus flow. Interestingly, the corner film length first increases then decreases when the wetting fluid is less viscous than the non-wetting fluid in a long square tube. A phase diagram of dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio is proposed to characterize the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow. Gravity and smaller contact angle make the corner film development more obvious. In addition, the tube length and width are shown to influence the interaction between main meniscus and corner film flow for a low viscosity ratio. The underlying physics of the above phenomena are explained in detail.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

However, there are scenarios where direct disposal of DPCs may result in temperatures in excess of the specified upper temperature limits for some engineered barrier system (EBS) materials, which may cause alteration within EBS materials dependent on local conditions such as host rock composition, chemistry of the saturating groundwaters, and interactions between barrier materials themselves. Here we report the results of hydrothermal experiments reacting EBS materials—bentonite buffer and steel—with an analogue crystalline host rock and groundwater at 250 °C. Experiment series explored the effect of reaction time on the final products and the effects of the mineral and fluid reactants on different steel types. Post-mortem X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe, and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed characteristic alteration of both bentonite and steel, including the formation of secondary zeolite and calcium silicate hydrate minerals within the bentonite matrix and the formation of iron-bearing clays and metal oxides at the steel surfaces. Swelling clays in the bentonite matrix were not quantitatively altered to non-swelling clay species by the hydrothermal conditions. The combined results of the solution chemistry over time and post-mortem mineralogy suggest that EBS alteration is more sensitive to initial groundwater chemistry than the presence of host rock, where limited potassium concentration in the solution prohibits conversion of the smectite minerals in the bentonite matrix to non-swelling clay species.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

These simulations, run using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with the addition of an immersed boundary method, predict transport and mixing during a controlled tracer release from the Joint Urban 2003 field campaign in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This work extends the results of a recent study through analysis of turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence spectra and their role in accurately simulating wind speed, direction, and tracer concentration. The significance and role of surface heat fluxes and use of the cell perturbation method in the numerical simulation setup are also examined. Our previous study detailed the model development necessary for our multiscale simulations, examined model skill at predicting wind speeds and tracer concentrations, and demonstrated that dynamic downscaling from mesoscale to microscale through a sequence of nested simulations can improve predictions of transport and dispersion relative to a microscale-only simulation forced by idealized meteorology. Here, predictions are compared with observations to assess qualitative agreement and statistical model skill at predicting wind speed, wind direction, tracer concentration, and turbulent kinetic energy at locations throughout the city. We also investigate the scale distribution of turbulence and the associated impact on model skill, particularly for predictions of transport and dispersion. Our results show that downscaled large-scale turbulence, which is unique to the multiscale simulations, significantly improves predictions of tracer concentrations in this complex urban environment.</p> <sec> <title>Significance Statement</title> <p>Simulations of atmospheric transport and mixing in urban environments have many applications, including pollution modeling for urban planning or informing emergency response following a hazardous release. These applications include phenomena with spatial scales spanning from millimeters to kilometers. Most simulations resolve flow only within the urban area of interest, omitting larger scales of turbulence and regional influences. This study examines a method that resolves both the small and large-scale flow features. We evaluate simulation accuracy by comparing predictions with observations from an experiment involving the release of a tracer gas in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with emphasis on correctly modeling turbulent fluctuations.

"Surface temperature comparison of the Arctic winter MOSAiC observations, ERA5 reanalysis, and MODIS satellite retrieval","Herrmannsdörfer, Lia; Müller, Malte; Shupe, Matthew D.; Rostosky, Philip","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Surface temperature; Energy budget; Arctic; Sea ice; ERA5; MOSAiC","Atmospheric model systems, such as those used for weather forecast and reanalysis production, often have significant and systematic errors in their representation of the Arctic surface energy budget and its components. The newly available observation data of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition (2019/2020) enable a range of model analyses and validation in order to advance our understanding of potential model deficiencies. In the present study, we analyze deficiencies in the surface radiative energy budget over Arctic sea ice in the ERA5 global atmospheric reanalysis by comparing against the winter MOSAiC campaign data, as well as, a pan-Arctic level-2 MODIS ice surface temperature remote sensing product. We find that ERA5 can simulate the timing of radiatively clear periods, though it is not able to distinguish the two observed radiative Arctic winter states, radiatively clear and opaquely cloudy, in the distribution of the net surface radiative budget. The ERA5 surface temperature over Arctic sea ice has a conditional error with a positive bias in radiatively clear conditions and a negative bias in opaquely cloudy conditions. The mean surface temperature error is 4°C for radiatively clear situations at MOSAiC and up to 15°C in some parts of the Arctic. The spatial variability of the surface temperature, given by 4 observation sites at MOSAiC, is not captured by ERA5 due to its spatial resolution but represented in the level-2 satellite product. The sensitivity analysis of possible error sources, using satellite products of snow depth and sea ice thickness, shows that the positive surface temperature errors during radiatively clear events are, to a large extent, caused by insufficient sea ice thickness and snow depth representation in the reanalysis system. A positive bias characterizes regions with ice thickness greater than 1.5 m, while the negative bias for thinner ice is partly compensated by the effect of snow.","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Analyzed herein are factors modulating the surface air temperatures in the region for a 20-yr period (2000–19) using space- and surface-based observations, and output from a reanalysis model. The 20-yr period is segregated into two decades, 2000–09 and 2010–19, corresponding to different tropospheric chemical regimes. Changes in seasonal and decadal averages are examined. The later decade experienced higher average surface air temperatures with significant warming during summer and fall seasons. Decadal and seasonal averages of cloud properties, column water vapor, rain rates, and top-of-atmosphere outgoing longwave radiation did not exhibit statistically significant differences between the two decades. The region experienced strong warm and moist advection during the winter months and very weak advection during the summer months. The later decade exhibited higher low-level moisture advection during the winter months than the earlier decade with insignificant changes in the temperature advection between the two decades. The later decade had significantly lower aerosol dry and liquid water mass during all seasons, along with lower aerosol optical depth, higher single scattering albedo, and lower top-of-the-atmosphere outgoing shortwave radiation during cloud-free conditions in the summer season. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in the aerosol direct radiative forcing are responsible for warming during summer months that experience weak advection and highlight seasonal differences in the temperature controlling mechanisms in the region.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Direct seepage measurements are labor-intensive and difficult to automate, whereas indirect (e.g., thermal) and remote sensing methods have potential to allow continuous monitoring with limited field effort. We present a preliminary assessment of a multi-scale temperature-based strategy for monitoring HEFs along the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, in eastern WA, United States. Five thermal methods were assessed. First, a vertical temperature profile (VTP) was installed into the streambed. The VTP data were analyzed using a data assimilation algorithm designed for automated real-time estimation in dynamic systems. Second, a thermal infrared (TIR) camera was used in roving surveys to identify seeps. Third, a TIR camera was stationed at the VTP site to collect images at 1-h intervals. Together, the two TIR datasets provided a basis to assess the potential for drone-based TIR. Fourth, temperature was measured at the sediment/water interface to assess fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing. Fifth, imagery from the ECOSTRESS satellite mission was acquired to assess the potential of spaceborne thermal monitoring. Based on our preliminary assessment, VTP, TIR, and bed temperature measurements provide complementary spatial coverage, temporal sampling, and resolution; these methods have potential for long-term, automated monitoring of HEFs. The publicly available spaceborne imagery, however, proved inadequate because of insufficient spatial resolution and data gaps resulting from cloud cover and revisit frequency.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A new mobile observatory equipped with remote sensors controlled by a smart sampling protocol was developed to collect high-resolution (18 m, 15 s) observations throughout the atmospheric layer below 1.5 km. A series of four deployments was performed around the One Vanderbilt skyscraper (H<sub>1</sub> = 427 m) located in Manhattan, NY to document wind flow and temperature in canyons with relatively high width-to-depth ratios (H<sub>2</sub>/W ~ 1.2-7.5; H<sub>2</sub> being the height of the adjacent building) and steepness (H<sub>1</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>= 2.1-11.2) and that under a range of inflow wind and solar heating conditions. A series of flow features were common to all case studies with head-on winds. A stagnation point was observed 2/3 of the way up the impeded portion of the One Vanderbilt, pointing to the importance of the upwind building height in controlling vertical air flow. In the canyons parallel to the flow, three sets of mirroring counterrotating vortices were detected pointing to the fact that H<sub>2</sub> is not as important a parameter in controlling flow in canyons parallel to the inflow wind. Plumes of rapidly rising air were detected near building heat vents under both 10 m s<sup>–1</sup> and 3 m s<sup>–1</sup> inflow wind conditions, at night and in the morning respectively. This suggests that anthropogenic heat may be an important energy source especially in the absence of solar heating. In the presence of solar heating, a systematic tendency for upward flow was observed above H<sub>1</sub>. We associate this pattern to the presence of rising thermals, a common mechanism for planetary boundary layer growth. Below H<sub>2</sub>, complete flow reversal (relative to mechanically driven circulations) was detected ~20 % of the time, showing evidence of dominant thermal effects even under 7 m s<sup>–1</sup> inflow wind conditions.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

There is increasing observational evidence of climate change impacts on water resource availability and agricultural productivity in the central Himalayan region. Here, we assess the farmers’ perception of climate change and its impacts on agriculture in western Nepal. We interviewed 554 households and conducted eight focus group discussions to collect farmers’ perceptions of temperature and rainfall characteristics, water availability, onset and duration of different seasons, and the impacts of such changes on their lives and livelihoods. Our results indicate that the farmers’ perceptions of rising annual and summer temperatures are consistent with observations. Perception, however, contradicts observed trends in winter temperature, as well as annual, monsoon, and winter precipitation. In addition, farmers are increasingly facing incidences of extreme events, including rainfall, floods, landslides, and droughts. These hazards often impact agricultural production, reducing household income and exacerbating the economic impacts on subsistence farmers. Integrated assessment of farmers’ perceptions and hydrometeorological observations is crucial to improving climate change impact assessment and informing the design of mitigation and adaptation strategies.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Linking Large-Scale Double-ITCZ Bias to Local-Scale Drizzling Bias in Climate Models","Zhou, Wenyu; Leung, L. Ruby; Lu, Jian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; precipitation; climate models; clouds; model evaluation performance; parameterization","Tropical precipitation in climate models presents significant biases in both the large-scale pattern (i.e., double intertropical convergence zone bias) and local-scale characteristics (i.e., drizzling bias with too frequent drizzle/convection and reduced occurrences of no and heavy precipitation). By untangling the coupled system and analyzing the biases in precipitation, cloud, and radiation, this study shows that local-scale drizzling bias in atmospheric models can lead to large-scale double-ITCZ bias in coupled models by inducing convective-regime-dependent biases in precipitation and cloud radiative effects (CRE). The double-ITCZ bias consists of a hemispherically asymmetric component that arises from the asymmetric SST bias and a nearly symmetric component that exists in atmospheric models without the SST bias. By increasing light rain but reducing heavy rain, local-scale drizzling bias induces positive (negative) precipitation bias in the moderate (strong) convective regime, leading to the nearly symmetric wet bias in atmospheric models. By affecting the cloud profile, local-scale drizzling bias induces positive (negative) CRE bias in the stratocumulus (convective) regime in atmospheric models. Because the stratocumulus (convective) region is climatologically more pronounced in the southern (northern) tropics, the CRE bias is deemed to be hemispherically asymmetric and drives warm and wet (cold and dry) biases in the southern (northern) tropics when coupled to ocean. Our results suggest that correcting local-scale drizzling bias is critical for fixing large-scale double-ITCZ bias. Finally, the drizzling and double-ITCZ biases are not alleviated in models with mesoscale (0.25°–0.5°) or even storm-resolving (~3 km) resolution, implying that either large-eddy simulation or fundamental improvement in small-scale subgrid parameterizations is needed.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It also addressed the lack of comprehensive documentation by compiling information from all contributing regional models, allowing for an informed use of data. In addition to presenting the worldwide CORDEX dataset, we assess here its consistency for precipitation and temperature by comparing climate change signals in regions with overlapping CORDEX domains, obtaining overall coincident regional climate change signals. The C3S CORDEX dataset has been used for the assessment of regional climate change in the IPCC AR6 (and for the interactive Atlas) and is available through the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS).","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The aim of this initiative was to address major gaps in our understanding of Earth’s energy and water cycles given a lack of information about the basic fluxes and associated reservoirs of these cycles. GEWEX sought to acquire and set standards for climatological data on variables essential for quantifying water and energy fluxes and for closing budgets at the regional and global scales. In so doing, GEWEX activities led to a greatly improved understanding of processes and our ability to predict them. Such understanding was viewed then, as it remains today, essential for advancing weather and climate prediction from global to regional scales. GEWEX has also demonstrated over time the importance of a wider engagement of different communities and the necessity of international collaboration for making progress on understanding and on the monitoring of the changes in the energy and water cycles under ever increasing human pressures. Here, this paper reflects on the first 30 years of evolution and progress that has occurred within GEWEX. This evolution is presented in terms of three main phases of activity. Progress toward the main goals of GEWEX is highlighted by calling out a few achievements from each phase. A vision of the path forward for the coming decade, including the goals of GEWEX for the future, are also described.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Potential use of engineered nanoparticles in ocean fertilization for large-scale atmospheric carbon dioxide removal","Babakhani, Peyman; Phenrat, Tanapon; Baalousha, Mohammed; Soratana, Kullapa; Peacock, Caroline L.; Twining, Benjamin S.; Hochella, Michael F.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; environmental health; safety issues; nanoparticles","Artificial ocean fertilization (AOF) aims to safely stimulate phytoplankton growth in the ocean and enhance carbon sequestration. AOF carbon sequestration efficiency appears lower than natural ocean fertilization processes due mainly to the low bioavailability of added nutrients, along with low export rates of AOF-produced biomass to the deep ocean. Here we explore the potential application of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to overcome these issues. Data from 123 studies show that some ENPs may enhance phytoplankton growth at concentrations below those likely to be toxic in marine ecosystems. ENPs may also increase bloom lifetime, boost phytoplankton aggregation and carbon export, and address secondary limiting factors in AOF. Life-cycle assessment and cost analyses suggest that net CO<sub>2</sub> capture is possible for iron, SiO<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ENPs with costs of 2–5 times that of conventional AOF, whereas boosting AOF efficiency by ENPs should substantially enhance net CO<sub>2</sub> capture and reduce these costs. Therefore, ENP-based AOF can be an important component of the mitigation strategy to limit global warming.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Natural variability in this teleconnection has not been robustly quantified, complicating the detection of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use a linear inverse model (LIM) to quantify natural variability in the ENSO-SWUS teleconnection. The LIM yields realistic teleconnection patterns with century-scale variability comparable to simulations from the Last Millennium Ensemble project and the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6. The variability quantified by the LIM illuminates two aspects of our understanding of ENSO and its impacts: the inherent statistics of the observable system can produce century-long periods with a wide range of correlations to SWUS hydroclimate, including nonsignificant correlations, and thus that detecting changes in ENSO-related hydroclimate variability is challenging in a changing climate.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Mixing of soot particles with other chemicals during atmospheric processing may partially offset their hydrophobicity, promoting water uptake and structural compaction. Here, we investigated morphological changes in fractal soot particles coated by sulfuric acid and then humidified, both in airborne and surface-bound states. Airborne soot was probed by tandem differential mobility analysis. Surface-bound soot was studied in a controlled microenvironment of a closed cell, using environmental transmission electron microscopy. After humidification, the airborne particles became fully compact, but the deposited particles showed only minor morphological changes despite significant water uptake. Although minor, those changes were detected during both water condensation and evaporation, indicating that condensation-evaporation cycles play an important role in atmospheric soot compaction. Lesser restructuring of deposited aggregates was caused by surface anchoring and coating loss, making anchoring an indispensable tool for preserving morphology of aggregates against changing experimental environment.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Tracking snowmelt during hydrological surface processes using a distributed hydrological model in a mesoscale basin on the Tibetan Plateau","Liu, Zhe; Cuo, Lan; Sun, Ning","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; DHSVM; snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm; snow contribution; streamflow; reservoir regulation; Tibetan Plateau","We report that mountain snowpack is an important water resource for the high altitude and latitude regions where the terrain is complex. However, the snowmelt pathway and its actual contribution to streamflow and soil moisture are rarely reported and remain unclear in such regions. To fill in this knowledge gap, we incorporate a snowmelt pathway tracking algorithm to a high-resolution physics-based distributed-hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM), to track snowmelt movement and quantify snowmelt contributions in the surface hydrologic processes. A simple reservoir operation scheme is also incorporated in the model. The modified model is applied to a dammed meso-scale watershed in the northeast Tibetan Plateau, China to study the snow and reservoir effects. The results show that annual snow contribution to soil moisture (SC-SM) and snow contribution to streamflow (SC-S) significantly decrease over 1965-2019. At a monthly scale, SC-SM has the largest amplitude at the top soil layer and its peak in the deeper layer lags behind the upper layer, and mean monthly SC-S at all stations show bimodal distributions corresponding to snowfall season. Reservoir regulation has subtle impacts (≤2.0%) on SC-S. If the current climate change rate continues, monthly and annual streamflow at the outlet will decrease primarily due to snowpack reduction. To mitigate climate change impacts, better water resource management is needed in this watershed.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Scalable deep learning for watershed model calibration","Mudunuru, Maruti K.; Son, Kyongho; Jiang, Peishi; Hammond, Glenn E.; Chen, Xingyuan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; artificial neural networks; calibration; ensemble methods; deep learning; watershed hydrology","Watershed models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) consist of high-dimensional physical and empirical parameters. These parameters often need to be estimated/calibrated through inverse modeling to produce reliable predictions on hydrological fluxes and states. Existing parameter estimation methods can be time consuming, inefficient, and computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we present an accurate and robust method to calibrate the SWAT model (i.e., 20 parameters) using scalable deep learning (DL). We developed inverse models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to assimilate observed streamflow data and estimate the SWAT model parameters. Scalable hyperparameter tuning is performed using high-performance computing resources to identify the top 50 optimal neural network architectures. We used ensemble SWAT simulations to train, validate, and test the CNN models. We estimated the parameters of the SWAT model using observed streamflow data and assessed the impact of measurement errors on SWAT model calibration. We tested and validated the proposed scalable DL methodology on the American River Watershed, located in the Pacific Northwest-based Yakima River basin. Our results show that the CNN-based calibration is better than two popular parameter estimation methods (i.e., the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation [GLUE] and the dynamically dimensioned search [DDS], which is a global optimization algorithm). For the set of parameters that are sensitive to the observations, our proposed method yields narrower ranges than the GLUE method but broader ranges than values produced using the DDS method within the sampling range even under high relative observational errors. The SWAT model calibration performance using the CNNs, GLUE, and DDS methods are compared using R<sub>2</sub> and a set of efficiency metrics, including Nash-Sutcliffe, logarithmic Nash-Sutcliffe, Kling-Gupta, modified Kling-Gupta, and non-parametric Kling-Gupta scores, computed on the observed and simulated watershed responses. The best CNN-based calibrated set has scores of 0.71, 0.75, 0.85, 0.85, 0.86, and 0.91. The best DDS-based calibrated set has scores of 0.62, 0.69, 0.8, 0.77, 0.79, and 0.82. The best GLUE-based calibrated set has scores of 0.56, 0.58, 0.71, 0.7, 0.71, and 0.8. The scores above show that the CNN-based calibration leads to more accurate low and high streamflow predictions than the GLUE and DDS sets. Our research demonstrates that the proposed method has high potential to improve our current practice in calibrating large-scale integrated hydrologic models.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Thus, comprehensive understanding of the effects of forest management practices on forest soil C stock and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes is needed for the development of effective forest-based climate change mitigation strategies. To improve this understanding, we synthesized peer-reviewed literature on forest management practices that can mitigate climate change by increasing soil C stocks and reducing GHG emissions. We further identified soil processes that affect soil GHG balance and discussed how models represent forest management effects on soil in GHG inventories and scenario analyses to address forest climate change mitigation potential. Forest management effects depend strongly on the specific practice and land type. Intensive timber harvesting with removal of harvest residues/stumps results in a reduction in soil C stock, while high stocking density and enhanced productivity by fertilization or dominance of coniferous species increase soil C stock. Nitrogen fertilization increases the soil C stock and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions while decreasing the CH<sub>4</sub> sink. Peatland hydrology management is a major driver of the GHG emissions of the peatland forests, with lower water level corresponding to higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Furthermore, the global warming potential of all GHG emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O) together can be ten-fold higher after clear-cutting than in peatlands with standing trees. The climate change mitigation potential of forest soils, as estimated by modelling approaches, accounts for stand biomass driven effects and climate factors that affect the decomposition rate. A future challenge is to account for the effects of soil preparation and other management that affects soil processes by changing soil temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient balance, microbial community structure and processes, hydrology and soil oxygen concentration in the models. We recommend that soil monitoring and modelling focus on linking processes of soil C stabilization with the functioning of soil microbiota.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Thus, how the floods induced by intense hurricanes respond to these potential changes is of great concern. This study investigates the future warmer climate impacts on hurricane-induced extreme rainfall, and—more importantly—the subsequent compound flooding at the watershed scale (from an event-based analysis perspective). To this goal, a modeling framework is designed based on the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), the Two-Dimensional fvand the Regional Community Earth System Model (R-CESM). The framework was applied to Hurricane Harvey (2017) at the Clear Creek watershed (a coastal watershed in the southern Houston) as a case study. The results show that the projected maximum rainfall totals over the watershed would be exacerbated by 17.7 % and 49.7 % in the 2050s and 2090s (respectively) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). This means a 16.1 % increase in Harvey rainfall over the watershed per degree Celsius increase in Mean Surface Temperature over the Gulf of Mexico region (18°~31° N, 77°~98° W). Meanwhile, the increases in maximum inundation extent would be 11.0 % (2050s) and 19.5 % (2090s). Furthermore, considerable increases in maximum inundation depth and duration in regions along the middle and downstream of Clear Creek (and also those around Clear Lake) are expected. The projected SLR will have little effect on the maximum inundation depth and extent if storm surge changes are not taken into account; meanwhile, it will influence the inundation duration at downstream locations. In conclusion, this modeling framework can be also applied at other coastal watersheds to evaluate the projected climate change impacts on the compound flooding induced by extreme climate events.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Recently, whether a tree species forms a symbiosis with arbuscular (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi has been suggested as a strong predictor of soil C storage, but there is wide variability within EcM systems. In this study, we investigated how mycorrhizal associations and the species composition of canopy trees and mycorrhizal fungi related to the proportion of soil C and nitrogen (N) in mineral associations and soil C:N across four sites representing distinct climates and tree communities in the eastern US broadleaf forest biome. In two of our sites, we found the expected relationship of declining mineral-associated C and N and increasing soil C:N ratios as the basal area of EcM-associating trees increased. However, across all sites these soil properties strongly correlated with canopy tree and fungal species composition. Sites where the expected pattern with EcM basal area was observed were (1) dominated by trees with lower quality litter in the Pinaceae and Fagaceae families and (2) dominated by EcM fungi with medium-distance exploration type hyphae, melanized tissues, and the potential to produce peroxidases. Here, this observational study demonstrates that differences in SOM between AM and EcM systems are dependent on the taxa of trees and EcM fungi involved.

Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; aerosol model; climate model; nitrate aerosol; radiative forcing; mixing state","Nitrate aerosol plays an important role in affecting regional air quality as well as Earth's climate. However, it is not well represented or even neglected in many global climate models. In this study, we couple the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) module with the four-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4) in DOE's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) to simulate nitrate aerosol and its radiative effects. We find that nitrate aerosol simulated by E3SMv2-MAM4-MOSAIC is sensitive to the treatment of gaseous HNO<sub>3</sub> transfer to/from interstitial particles related to accommodation coefficients of HNO<sub>3</sub> (α<sub>HNO<sub>3</sub></sub>) on dust and non-dust particles. We compare three different treatments of HNO<sub>3</sub> transfer: (a) a treatment (MTC_SLOW) that uses a low α<sub>HNO<sub>3</sub></sub> in the mass transfer coefficient (MTC) calculation; (b) a dust-weighted MTC treatment (MTC_WGT) that uses a high α<sub>HNO<sub>3</sub></sub> on non-dust particles; and (c) a dust-weighted MTC treatment that also splits coarse mode aerosols into the coarse dust and sea salt sub-modes in MOSAIC (MTC_SPLC). MTC_WGT and MTC_SPLC increase the global annual mean (2005–2014) nitrate burden from 0.096 (MTC_SLOW) to 0.237 and 0.185 Tg N, respectively, mostly in the coarse mode. MTC_WGT and MTC_SPLC also produce stronger nitrate direct radiative forcing (-0.048 and -0.051 W m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively) and indirect forcing (-0.33 and -0.35 W m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively) than MTC_SLOW (-0.021 and -0.24 W m<sup>-2</sup>).

The DataHawk2 (DH2) is a small, fixed-wing, uncrewed aircraft system, or UAS, developed at the University of Colorado (CU) primarily for taking detailed thermodynamic measurements of the atmospheric boundary layer. The DH2 weighs 1.7 kg and has a wingspan of 1.3 m, with a flight endurance of approximately 60 min, depending on configuration. In the DH2's most modern form, the aircraft carries a Vaisala RSS-421 sensor for pressure, temperature, and relative humidity measurements, two CU-developed infrared temperature sensors, and a CU-developed fine-wire array, in addition to sensors required to support autopilot function (pitot tube with pressure sensor, GPS receiver, inertial measurement unit), from which wind speed and direction can also be estimated. This paper presents a description of the DH2, including information on its design and development work, and puts the DH2 into context with respect to other contemporary UASs. Data from recent field work (MOSAiC, the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) is presented and compared with radiosondes deployed during that campaign to provide an overview of sensor and system performance. These data show good agreement across pressure, temperature, and relative humidity as well as across wind speed and direction. Additional examples of measurements provided by the DH2 are given from a variety of previous campaigns in locations ranging from the continental United States to Japan and northern Alaska. Finally, a look toward future system improvements and upcoming research campaign participation is given.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Current research suggests that climate change may pose a substantial threat to NVP, but the extent to which this will affect the associated ecosystem functions and services is highly uncertain. Here, we propose a research agenda to address this urgent question, focusing on physiological and ecological processes that link NVP to ecosystem functions while also taking into account the substantial taxonomic diversity across multiple ecosystem types. Accordingly, we developed a new categorization scheme, based on microclimatic gradients, which simplifies the high physiological and morphological diversity of NVP and world-wide distribution with respect to several broad habitat types. We found that habitat-specific ecosystem functions of NVP will likely be substantially affected by climate change, and more quantitative process understanding is required on (1) potential for acclimation, (2) response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, (3) role of the microbiome, and (4) feedback to (micro)climate. We suggest an integrative approach of innovative, multimethod laboratory and field experiments and ecophysiological modelling, for which sustained scientific collaboration on NVP research will be essential.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Constraining the particle-scale diversity of black carbon light absorption using a unified framework","Beeler, Payton (ORCID:0000000347591461); Chakrabarty, Rajan K. (ORCID:0000000157539937)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Black carbon, light absorption, mixing state, morphology","Atmospheric black carbon (BC), the strongest absorber of visible solar radiation in the atmosphere, manifests across a wide spectrum of morphologies and compositional heterogeneity. Phenomenologically, the distribution of BC among diverse particles of varied composition gives rise to enhancement of its light absorption capabilities by over twofold in comparison to that of nascent or unmixed homogeneous BC. This situation has challenged the modeling community to consider the full complexity and diversity of BC on a per-particle basis for accurate estimation of its light absorption. The conventionally adopted core–shell approximation, although computationally inexpensive, is inadequate not only in estimating but also capturing absorption trends for ambient BC. Here we develop a unified framework that encompasses the complex diversity in BC morphology and composition using a single metric, the phase shift parameter (ρ<sub>BC</sub>), which quantifies how much phase shift the incoming light waves encounter across a particle compared to that in its absence. We systematically investigate variations in ρ<sub>BC</sub> across the multi-space distribution of BC morphology, mixing state, mass, and composition as reported by field and laboratory observations. We find that ρ<sub>BC</sub>>1 leads to decreased absorption by BC, which explains the weaker absorption enhancements observed in certain regional BC compared to laboratory results of similar mixing state. We formulate universal scaling laws centered on ρ<sub>BC</sub> and provide physics-based insights regarding core–shell approximation overestimating BC light absorption. We conclude by packaging our framework in an open-source Python application to facilitate community-level use in future BC-related research. The package has two main functionalities. The first functionality is for forward problems, wherein experimentally measured BC mixing state and assumed BC morphology are input, and the aerosol absorption properties are output. The second functionality is for inverse problems, wherein experimentally measured BC mixing state and absorption are input, and the morphology of BC is returned. Further, if absorption is measured at multiple wavelengths, the package facilitates the estimation of the imaginary refractive index of coating materials by combining the forward and inverse procedures. Our framework thus provides a computationally inexpensive source for calculation of absorption by BC and can be used to constrain light absorption throughout the atmospheric lifetime of BC.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These results indicate significant deficiencies of MOST and BRN, particularly for the derivation of the latent heat flux.

The results imply that further studies of surface fluxes and other turbulent variables with ML techniques provide great promise for deriving advanced flux parameterizations and their implementation in land–atmosphere system models. </p>","Springer Science + Business Media","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Spatial Microbial Respiration Variations in the Hyporheic Zones Within the Columbia River Basin","Son, Kyongho; Fang, Yilin; Gomez‐Velez, Jesus D.; Chen, Xingyuan","river corridor; hyporheric zone; aerobic and anaerobic respiration; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; river corridor model; hyporheic zone","While the hyporheic zone (HZ) accounts for a significant portion of whole stream CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, HZ respiration modeling studies are lacking in quantifying their contributions to the total CO<sub>2</sub> at large watershed/basin scales. Quantifying the contribution of anaerobic respiration is also underappreciated. This study used a carbon-nitrogen-coupled river corridor model to quantify HZ aerobic and anaerobic respiration and determined the key factors controlling their spatial variability within the Columbia River Basin (CRB). The modeled respiration patterns showed high spatial variability. Among the nine sub-basins composing the CRB, the Lower Columbia and the Willamette, which receive higher precipitation, had higher respiration. Medium-sized rivers (4th to 6th orders) produced the highest aerobic and anaerobic respiration among reaches of different sizes. At the reach and sub-basin scales, aerobic respiration is dominant, representing approximately 98.7% of the total respiration across the CRB. While most of the reaches were dominant with aerobic respiration, reaches in agricultural land showed a relatively higher anaerobic respiration (18%) ratio. A variable importance analysis showed that hyporheic exchange flux controlled most of the spatial variability of HZ respiration, dominating over other physical variables such as residence time, stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The influence of substrate concentration (DOC and DO) is larger in modeling anaerobic respiration than aerobic respiration. Future research will focus on improving the estimation of the HZ exchange flux and the implementation of spatially explicit parameterizations for the reactions of interest to reduce model uncertainty.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Michael; Sanchez, Kevin J.; Kreidenweis, Sonia M.; DeMott, Paul J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Southern Ocean; sea spray aerosol; aerosol surface area","This study focuses on methods to estimate dry marine aerosol surface area (SA) from bulk optical measurements. Aerosol SA is used in many models' ice nucleating particle (INP) parameterizations, as well as influencing particle light scattering, hygroscopic growth, and reactivity, but direct observations are scarce in the Southern Ocean (SO). Two campaigns jointly conducted in austral summer 2018 provided co-located measurements of aerosol SA from particle size distributions and lidar to evaluate SA estimation methods in this region. Mie theory calculations based on measured size distributions were used to test a proposed approximation for dry aerosol SA, which relies on estimating effective scattering efficiency (Q) as a function of Ångström exponent (å). For distributions with dry å < 1, Q = 2 was found to be a good approximation within ±50%, but for distributions with dry å > 1, an assumption of Q = 3 as in some prior studies underestimates dry aerosol SA by a factor of 2 or more. We propose a new relationship between dry å and Q, which can be used for –0.2 < å < 2, and suggest å = 0.8 as the cutoff between primary and secondary marine aerosol-dominated distributions. Application of a published methodology to retrieve dry marine aerosol SA from lidar extinction profiles overestimated aerosol SA by a factor of 3–5 during these campaigns. Using Microtops aerosol optical thickness measurements, we derive alternative lidar conversion parameters from our observations, applicable to marine aerosol over the SO.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

First, a reduction in tropical ascent area and an increased frequency of heavy precipitation result in high cloud reduction and upper-tropospheric drying, which increases longwave cooling and reduces subsidence weakening, favoring low cloud reduction (Radiation-Subsidence Pathway). Second, increased longwave cooling decreases tropospheric stability, which also reduces subsidence weakening and low cloudiness (Stability-Subsidence Pathway). In summary, greater high cloud reduction and upper-tropospheric drying (negative longwave feedback) lead to a more positive cloud feedback among CMIP6 models by contributing to a greater reduction in low cloudiness (positive shortwave feedback). Varying strengths of the two pathways contribute considerably to the intermodel spread in climate sensitivity.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 7119","","","SC0021312","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723","10.1038/s41467-022-34787-4","","2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","1903484","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1903484","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1903484","Nature Communications","1","13"

When they are common, symbiotic associations between plants and bacteria can add more than 100 kg N ha<sup>–1</sup> y<sup>–1</sup> to ecosystems. Yet, these associations are uncommon in many terrestrial ecosystems. In most cases, N inputs derive from more cryptic sources, including mutualistic and/or free-living microorganisms in soil, plant litter, decomposing roots and wood, lichens, insects, and mosses, among others. Unfortunately, large gaps remain in the understanding of cryptic N fixation. Here, we conducted a literature review to explore rates, patterns, and controls of cryptic N fixation in both unmanaged and agricultural ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that, as is common with N fixation, rates are highly variable across most cryptic niches, with N inputs in any particular cryptic niche ranging from near zero to more than 20 kg ha<sup>–1</sup> y<sup>–1</sup>. Such large variation underscores the need for more comprehensive measurements of N fixation by organisms not in symbiotic relationships with vascular plants in terrestrial ecosystems, as well as identifying the factors that govern cryptic N fixation rates. We highlight several challenges, opportunities, and priorities in this important research area, and we propose a conceptual model that posits an interacting hierarchy of biophysical and biogeochemical controls over N fixation that should generate valuable new hypotheses and research.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Emulsion liquid membranes (ELMs) have received interest due to rapid kinetics, high selectivities, and low solvent requirements but are too unstable for industrial usage. Here, we demonstrate that polymeric microcapsules can serve as robust, solvent-free mimics of ELMs. As a proof of concept, we incorporated the copper-selective ligand Lix 84-I in the walls of microcapsules formed from a commercial polystyrene-b-polybutadiene-b-polystyrene triblock polymer. The microcapsules were formed from a double-emulsion template, resulting in particles typically 20–120 μm in diameter that encapsulated even smaller droplets of a dilute (≤0.5 M) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution. Batch experiments demonstrated facilitated-transport behavior, with equilibrium reached in as little as 10 min for microcapsules with 1% ligand, and with ~15-fold selectivity for Cu<sup>2+</sup> over Ni<sup>2+</sup>.

"Short-term solar radiation forecast using total sky imager via transfer learning","Manandhar, Prajowal; Temimi, Marouane; Aung, Zeyar","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; energy; solar radiation; sky imager; deep transfer learning; forecasting","Ground-based sky cameras, which capture hemispherical images, have been extensively used for localized monitoring of clouds. This paper proposes a short-term forecasting approach based on transfer learning using Total Sky-Imager (TSI) images of the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site obtained from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) dataset. An accurate estimation of solar irradiance using TSI is key for short-term solar energy generation forecasting and optimal energy consumption planning. We make use of deep neural network architectures such as AlexNet and ResNet-101 to extract the underlying deep convolution features from TSI images and then train using an ensemble learning approach to model and forecast solar radiation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach by showcasing the best and worst cases. Thus, the transfer learning approach significantly reduces the time and resources required for modeling solar radiation. We outperform with reference to another state-of-art technique for solar modeling using TSI images at different forecast lead times.","Elsevier","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Global Barotropic Tide Modeling Using Inline Self‐Attraction and Loading in MPAS‐Ocean","Barton, Kristin N.; Pal, Nairita; Brus, Steven R.; Petersen, Mark R.; Arbic, Brian K.; Engwirda, Darren; Roberts, Andrew F.; Westerink, Joannes J.; Wirasaet, Damrongsak; Schindelegger, Michael","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ocean model; tides","We examine ocean tides in the barotropic version of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-Ocean), the ocean component of the Department of Energy Earth system model. We focus on four factors that affect tidal accuracy: self-attraction and loading (SAL), model resolution, details of the underlying bathymetry, and parameterized topographic wave drag. The SAL term accounts for the tidal loading of Earth's crust and the self-gravitation of the ocean and the load-deformed Earth. A common method for calculating SAL is to decompose mass anomalies into their spherical harmonic constituents. Here, we compare a scalar SAL approximation versus an inline SAL using a fast spherical harmonic transform package. Wave drag accounts for energy lost by breaking internal tides that are produced by barotropic tidal flow over topographic features. We compare a series of successively finer quasi-uniform resolution meshes (62.9, 31.5, 15.7, and 7.87 km) to a variable resolution (45 to 5 km) configuration. We ran MPAS-Ocean in a single-layer barotropic mode forced by five tidal constituents. The 45 to 5 km variable resolution mesh obtained the best total root-mean-square error (5.4 cm) for the deep ocean (> 1,000 m) M<sub>2</sub> tide compared to TPXO8 and ran twice as fast as the quasi-uniform 8 km mesh, which had an error of 5.8 cm. This error is comparable to those found in other forward (non-assimilative) ocean tide models. In future work, we plan to use MPAS-Ocean to study tidal interactions with other Earth system components, and the tidal response to climate change.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6.1), the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM; version 2.1), simulates the life cycle (emission, transport, and deposition) of mineral dust and its interactions with physio-chemical components to quantify the impacts of dust on climate and the Earth system. The accuracy of such quantifications relies on how well dust-related processes are represented in the model. Here we update the parameterizations for the dust module, including those on the dust emission scheme, the aerosol dry deposition scheme, the size distribution of transported dust, and the treatment of dust particle shape. Multiple simulations were undertaken to evaluate the model performance against diverse observations, and to understand how each update alters the modeled dust cycle and the simulated dust direct radiative effect. The model–observation comparisons suggest that substantially improved model representations of the dust cycle are achieved primarily through the new more physically-based dust emission scheme. In comparison, the other modifications induced small changes to the modeled dust cycle and model–observation comparisons, except the size distribution of dust in the coarse mode, which can be even more influential than that of replacing the dust emission scheme. We highlight which changes introduced here are important for which regions, shedding light on further dust model developments required for more accurately estimating interactions between dust and climate.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we evaluate the modeled TC climatology and the probabilistic forecast skill of basin-wide TC genesis at weekly temporal resolution. Prediction skill is calculated using the Brier skill score relative to a constant annual mean climatology and to a monthly varying seasonal climatology during TC season. The model captures the observed basin-wide climatological TC seasonality and spatial distributions at weeks 1–6, but TC genesis is largely underestimated from Week 2 onward. For some basins and lead times, the predicted TC genesis is primarily controlled by the number of TC “seeds” and the mean-state climate condition. The model has good prediction skill relative to the constant climatology across all the basins and lead times, but is only skillful in the eastern Pacific, North Indian Ocean, and Southern Hemisphere at Week 1 when compared to the seasonal climatology, indicating limited skill in predicting deviations from the seasonal cycle. We find strong modulations of the predicted TC genesis at up to 3 weeks of forecast lead time by the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The interannual variability of predicted TC genesis and accumulated cyclone energy are skillfully predicted in the North Atlantic and the Northwestern Pacific, with a strong modulation by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.","American Geophysical Union","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)","","United States","2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres; Journal Volume: 127; Journal Issue: 22","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e2022JD036986","","","SC0022070; 1947282; 1852977; AGS-1652289; 80NSSC21K1525; KMI2021-01210","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-897X","10.1029/2022jd036986","","2023-01-16T00:00:00Z","1908344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1908344","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","22","127"
"Convective Momentum Transport and Its Impact on the Madden‐Julian Oscillation in E3SM‐MMF","Yang, Qiu; Hannah, Walter M.; Leung, L. Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; convection momentum transport; Madden-Julian oscillation; E3SM; multiscale modeling framework; large-scale circulation; convection organization","Convective momentum transport (CMT) is the process of vertical redistribution of horizontal momentum by small-scale turbulent flows from moist convection. Traditional general circulation models (GCMs) and their multiscale modeling framework (MMF) versions poorly represent CMT due to insufficient information of subgrid-scale flows at each GCM grid. Here the explicit scalar momentum transport (ESMT) scheme for representing CMT is implemented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model-Multiscale Modeling Framework (E3SM-MMF) with embedded 2-D cloud-resolving models (CRMs), and verified against E3SM-MMF simulations with 3-D CRMs and observations. The results show that representing CMT by ESMT helps reduce climatological mean precipitation model bias over the western Pacific and the ITCZ regions, which is attributed to the weakened mean easterlies over the Pacific. Also, CMT from simulations with 2-D and 3-D CRMs impose a similar impact on Kelvin waves by reducing their variability and slowing down their phase speed, but opposite impacts on the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) variability. The ESMT scheme readily captures the climatological mean spatial patterns of the zonal and meridional components of CMT and their variability across multiple time scales, but shows some differences in estimating its magnitude. CMT mainly affects the MJO by decelerating its winds in the free troposphere, but accelerates its near-surface winds. This study serves as a prototype for implementing CMT scheme in the MMF simulations, highlighting its crucial role in reducing model bias in mean state and spatiotemporal variability.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Surface casings are the last barrier of the well system. Consequently, fluids released into the environment from oil and gas wells typically originate from the surface casing. In this study, we analyze a database of geochemical samples collected from 2,573 surface casings in northeastern Colorado. The majority of surface casings (80.3%) contain thermogenic gas from the deep subsurface. Of these wells, most (73.3%) experience gas migration into the surface casing through a compromised steel casing or cement seal, which indicates pervasive integrity issues in the region. Surface casing contains methane, BTEX, and other hydrocarbons, and has an isotopic signature characteristic of reservoir gas. Finally, surface casing liquids also contain hydrocarbons and high concentrations of BTEX, which highlights the need to mitigate well integrity issues and prevent the release of these fluids.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 23","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 17227-17235","","","89243318CFE000003","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c05239","","2023-03-03T00:00:00Z","1958743","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1958743","","Environmental Science and Technology","23","56"

QUIC-Fire was developed to fill this gap but it cannot currently address complex terrain, typical for instance of the Western United States. In this paper, we describe the extension of the diagnostic wind model QUIC-URB, the wind engine of QUIC-Fire, to a terrain-following coordinate system. In particular, the paper presents the mathematical derivation of the wind solver leading to a linear system of equations that are solved through the successive over-relaxation method. The model is validated against a standard test used in previous works (the Askervein Hill) and against a new dataset from measurements in the Socorro Mountains, New Mexico. The terrain-following implementation captured the correct phenomenology for the isolated Askervein Hill, with a wind speed up at the top of the hill. We report the model agreed well with measurements on the upwind side of the peak, but overestimated speed-up on the downwind side of the hill. This is due to the inability of the model to generate flow separation and wake-eddy dynamics. On a common laptop, the divergence-free wind field was obtained in 6 s, making the solver appealing for coupled fire–atmosphere simulations. The Socorro Mountain was highly complex, with many cliff faces, peaks, and valleys. Although the model captures the magnitude and direction of inlet and outlet areas of the domain, it performs rather poorly in the valley region and in the regions near the steep cliffs. Hence, the model shows good agreement with data in areas of open sloped terrain but lacks in areas where flow separation and thermally driven effects may be present (neither effect was addressed in this work). Results highlight that future work should focus on the implementation of parameterizations of wake-eddies, similar to QUIC-URB’s building parameterizations, and on thermodynamic-driven flow.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We expected smaller g<sub>s</sub>, but greater A<sub>net</sub>, responses to eCO<sub>2</sub> in gymnosperms compared with angiosperm PFTs. We found that iWUE increased in proportion to increasing eCO<sub>2</sub> in all PFTs, and that increases in A<sub>net</sub> had stronger effects than reductions in g<sub>s</sub>. The USO model correctly captured stomatal behaviour with eCO<sub>2</sub> across most datasets. The chief difference among PFTs was a lower stomatal slope parameter (g<sub>1</sub>) for the gymnosperm, compared with angiosperm, species. Land surface models can use the USO model to describe stomatal behaviour under changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The contribution of Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, to sea-level rise through 2100 constrained by recent observations of speedup and retreat","Hillebrand, Trevor Ray; Hoffman, Matthew James; Perego, Mauro; Price, Stephen F.; Howat, Ian M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences; Mathematics","Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, has retreated and accelerated through the 21st century, raising concerns that it could be a significant contributor to future sea-level rise. We use a data-constrained ensemble of three-dimensional higher-order ice sheet model simulations to estimate the likely range of sea-level rise from the continued retreat of Humboldt Glacier. We first solve for basal traction using observed ice thickness, bed topography, and ice surface velocity from the year 2007 in a PDE-constrained (partial differential equation) optimization. Next, we impose calving rates to match mean observed retreat rates from winter 2007–2008 to winter 2017–2018 in a transient calibration of the exponent in the power-law basal friction relationship. We find that power-law exponents in the range of 1/7–1/5 – rather than the commonly used 1/3–1 – are necessary to reproduce the observed speedup over this period. We then tune an iceberg calving parameterization based on the von Mises stress yield criterion in another transient-calibration step to approximate both observed ice velocities and terminus position in 2017–2018. Finally, we use the range of basal friction relationship exponents and calving parameter values to generate the ensemble of model simulations from 2007–2100 under three climate forcing scenarios from CMIP5 (two RCP8.5 forcings, Representative Concentration Pathway) and CMIP6 (one SSP5-8.5 forcing, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway). Our simulations predict 5.2–8.7mm of sea-level rise from Humboldt Glacier, significantly higher than a previous estimate (~3.5 mm) and equivalent to a substantial fraction of the 40–140 mm predicted by ISMIP6 from the whole Greenland Ice Sheet. Our larger future sea-level rise prediction results from the transient calibration of our basal friction law to match the observed speedup, which requires a semi-plastic bed rheology. In many simulations, our model predicts the growth of a sizable ice shelf in the middle of the 21st century. Thus, atmospheric warming could lead to more retreat than predicted here if increased surface melt promotes hydrofracture of the ice shelf. Our data-constrained simulations of Humboldt Glacier underscore the sensitivity of model predictions of Greenland outlet glacier response to warming to choices of basal shear stress and iceberg calving parameterizations. Further, transient calibration of these parameterizations, which has not typically been performed, is necessary to reproduce observed behavior. Current estimates of future sea-level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet could, therefore, contain significant biases.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Effects of random forest modeling decisions on biogeochemical time series predictions","Regier, Peter; Duggan, Matthew; Myers‐Pigg, Allison; Ward, Nicholas","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; nitrate; machine learning (ML); random forests; Chesapeake Bay; Lake Erie","Random Forests (RF) are an increasingly popular machine learning approach used to model biogeochemical processes in the Earth system. While RF models are robust to many assumptions that complicate deterministic models, there are several important parameterization decisions for appropriate use and optimal model fit. We explored the role that parameter decisions, including training/testing data splitting strategies, variable selection, and hyperparameters play on RF goodness-of-fit by constructing models using 162 unique parameter combinations to predict concentrations of nitrate, a key nutrient for biogeochemical cycling in aquatic ecosystems. Models were built on long-term, publicly available water quality and meteorology time-series collected by the National Estuarine Research Reserve monitoring network for two contrasting ecosystems representing freshwater and brackish estuaries. We found that accounting for temporal dependence when splitting data into training and testing subsets was key for avoiding over-estimation of model predictive power. In addition, variable selection and, to a lesser degree, the ratio of training to testing data, were significant parameters for optimizing RF goodness-of-fit. We also explored how model parameter decisions influenced interpretation of the relative importance of predictors to the model, and model predictor-dependent variable relationships, with results suggesting that both data structure and model parameterization influence these factors. Because much of the current RF literature is written for the computational and statistical science communities, the primary goal of this study is to provide guidelines for aquatic scientists new to machine learning to apply RF techniques appropriately to aquatic biogeochemical datasets.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Part of that is because of the limited understanding of the size dependence of particle properties and variation of these properties along with the vertical profile under different environmental conditions. Thus, we present a vertical gradient of size-resolved aerosol composition by deploying an automated size and time-resolved aerosol collector (STAC) platform integrated with sensors on the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement's (ARM) tethered balloon system (TBS) at the Southern Great Plains (SGP, Oklahoma) site. Our results highlight variations in atmospheric processing and aerosol sources along the vertical column by showing similar compositions with different size distributions of particles at various altitudes. The platform has been deployed in several other ARM campaigns in Oliktok Point (Alaska), Houston (Texas), and Crested Butte (Colorado). The STAC platform is loaded with an array of 4-stage cascade impactors to collect aerosol particles within different aerodynamic size ranges up to 20 sampling points per flight for various atmospheric research studies, such as the vertical profile of size-resolved aerosol chemical composition and multi-phase chemistry. Time-resolved sampling facilitates the study of the evolution of particles in the atmosphere. The battery-powered, lightweight automated size- and time-resolved sampling system is ideal for unmanned aerial systems (e.g., TBS) and aircraft sampling. The STAC platform is integrated with a temperature and relative humidity sensor and a pressure sensor to monitor ambient conditions, an optical particle counter to measure aerosol size distribution, and a micro-aethalometer to measure the black carbon mass concentration. Experimentally derived 50% cut-off sizes of each stage (stages A to D) for a standard impactor are about 2.3, 0.62, 0.42, and 0.12 μm. The impactor is adaptable to collect smaller particles with an additional replaceable stage E with a 50% cut-off size of 0.07 μm. The STAC platform facilitates simultaneous sampling of aerosols on three different types of substrates for multi-modal offline analysis to probe their physical (e.g., phase state and morphology), chemical (e.g., the elemental composition of individual particles and size-resolved chemical composition), optical (light absorption and scattering), hygroscopic and ice nucleation properties.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The influence of recent and future climate change on spring Arctic cyclones","Parker, Chelsea L.; Mooney, Priscilla A.; Webster, Melinda A.; Boisvert, Linette N.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric dynamics; climate and earth system modeling; cryospheric science","In recent decades, the Arctic has experienced rapid atmospheric warming and sea ice loss, with an ice-free Arctic projected by the end of this century. Cyclones are synoptic weather events that transport heat and moisture into the Arctic, and have complex impacts on sea ice, and the local and global climate. However, the effect of a changing climate on Arctic cyclone behavior remains poorly understood. This study uses high resolution (4 km), regional modeling techniques and downscaled global climate reconstructions and projections to examine how recent and future climatic changes alter cyclone behavior. Results suggest that recent climate change has not yet had an appreciable effect on Arctic cyclone characteristics. However, future sea ice loss and increasing surface temperatures drive large increases in the near-surface temperature gradient, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and convection during cyclones. The future climate can alter cyclone trajectories and increase and prolong intensity with greatly augmented wind speeds, temperatures, and precipitation. Such changes in cyclone characteristics could exacerbate sea ice loss and Arctic warming through positive feedbacks. The increasing extreme nature of these weather events has implications for local ecosystems, communities, and socio-economic activities.","Nature Publishing Group","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We performed atmosphere-only simulations forced by sea-surface temperature patterns characteristic of La Niña and the positive AMM jointly, and El Niño and the negative AMM jointly, in historical and future climates. Projected Atlantic TCs become more frequent in the future by approximately 34% during El Niño and negative AMM and by 66% during La Niña and positive AMM, with a significant increase in the portion of intense TCs.

"Description and Evaluation of a New Deep Convective Cloud Model Considering In-cloud Inhomogeneity","Chu, Wenchao; Lin, Yanluan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; convection scheme; cloud Inhomogeneity; CAM5","Convections still need to be parameterized in general circulation models (GCMs) in the coming decades. Performances of GCMs are significantly influenced by the convection schemes used. In contrast to most conventional cloud models that ignore in-cloud inhomogeneities, a new convective cloud model explicitly considering in-cloud inhomogeneities is developed. The new model adopts a single bulk plume approach, but divides the plume into a series of interacting sub-plumes in order to mimic the transition from the plume core to its edges. We implemented the new cloud model in NCAR Community Atmosphere Model version 5.0 (CAM5) and evaluated its performance. Single-column tests show a stronger mass flux profile and low-level detrainment with the new model. In global simulations, the long-lasting wet bias in the tropical free troposphere of CAM5 is alleviated. Spatial pattern and intensity distribution of precipitation is improved, but the global hydrological cycle is slightly over-enhanced. The diurnal cycle of tropical precipitation is also better captured though the precipitation peak still occurs earlier than the observations and the amplitude of the cycle tends to weaken. MJO simulation is slightly improved with the new scheme. In addition, the new cloud model generated more tropical cyclones, in better agreement with observations.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"STITCHES: creating new scenarios of climate model output by stitching together pieces of existing simulations","Tebaldi, Claudia; Snyder, Abigail; Dorheim, Kalyn","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Climate model output emulation has long been attempted to support impact research, mainly to fill in gaps in the scenario space. Given the computational cost of running coupled earth system models (ESMs), which are usually the domain of supercomputers and require on the order of days to weeks to complete a century-long simulation, only a handful of different scenarios are usually chosen to externally force ESM simulations. An effective emulator, able to run on standard computers in times of the order of minutes rather than days could therefore be used to derive climate information under scenarios that were not run by ESMs. Lately, the necessity of accounting for internal variability has also made the availability of initial-condition ensembles, under a specific scenario, important, further increasing the computational demand. At least so far, emulators have been limited to simplified ESM-like output, either seasonal, annual, or decadal averages of basic quantities, like temperature and precipitation, often emulated independently of one another. With this work, we propose a more comprehensive solution to ESM output emulation. Our emulator, STITCHES, uses existing archives of earth system models' (ESMs) scenario experiments to construct ESM-like output under new scenarios or enrich existing initial-condition ensembles, which is what other emulators also aim to do. Importantly, however, STITCHES' output has the same characteristics of the ESM output it sets out to emulate: multivariate, spatially resolved, and high frequency, representing both the forced component and the internal variability around it. STITCHES extends the idea of time sampling – according to which climate outcomes are stratified by the global warming level at which they manifest themselves, irrespective of the scenario and time at which they occur – to the construction of a continuous history of ESM-like output over the whole 21st century, consistent with a 21st-century trajectory of global surface air temperature (GSAT) derived from the scenario that has been chosen as the target of the emulation. STITCHES does so by first splitting the target GSAT trajectory into decade-long windows, then matching each window in turn to a decade-long window within an existing model simulation from the available scenario runs according to its proximity to the target in absolute size of the temperature anomaly and its rate of change. A look-up table is therefore created of a sequence of existing experiment–time-window combinations that, when stitched together, create a GSAT trajectory “similar” to the target. Importantly, we can then stitch together much more than GSAT from these windows, i.e., any output that the ESM has saved for these existing experiment–time-window combinations, at any frequency and spatial scale available in its archive. We show that the stitching does not introduce artifacts in the great majority of cases (we look at temperature and precipitation at monthly frequency and on the native grid of the ESM and at an index of ENSO activity, the Southern Oscillation Index). This is true even if the criteria for the identification of the decades to be stitched together are chosen to work for a smoothed time series of annual GSAT, a result we expect given the larger amount of noise affecting most other variables at finer spatial scales and higher frequencies, which therefore are more “forgiving” of the stitching. We successfully test the method's performance over many ESMs and scenarios. Only a few exceptions surface, but these less-than-optimal outcomes are always associated with a scarcity of the archived simulations from which we can gather the decade-long windows that form the building blocks of the emulated time series. In the great majority of cases, STITCHES' performance is satisfactory according to metrics that reward consistency in trends, interannual and inter-ensemble variance, and autocorrelation structure of the time series stitched together. The method therefore can be used to create ESM-like output according to new scenarios, on the basis of a trajectory of GSAT produced according to that scenario, which could be easily obtained by a simple climate model. It can also be used to increase the size of existing initial-condition ensembles. There are aspects of our emulator that will immediately disqualify it for specific applications, like when climate information is needed whose characteristics result from accumulated quantities over windows of times longer than those used as pieces by STITCHES, droughts longer than a decade for example. But for many applications, we argue that a stitched product can satisfy the climate information needs of impact researchers. STITCHES cannot emulate ESM output from scenarios that result in GSAT trajectories outside of the envelope available in the archive, nor can it emulate trajectories with shapes different from existing ones (overshoots with negative derivative, for example). Therefore, the size and characteristics of the available archives of ESM output are the principal limitations for STITCHES' deployment. Thus, we argue for the possibility of designing scenario experiments within, for example, the next phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project according to new principles, relieved of the need to produce a number of similar trajectories that vary only in radiative forcing strength but more strategically covering the space of temperature anomalies and rates of change.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Estimated timescales for wet deposition of organic compounds as a function of Henry's law constants","Bi, Chenyang; Isaacman-VanWertz, Gabriel","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Atmospheric organic compounds may deposit to Earth's surfaces via dry deposition, driven by concentration gradients, and wet deposition, driven by the scavenging of compounds by precipitation. Their removal by deposition has downstream impacts on concentrations of secondary organic aerosol by removing potential aerosol precursors that would otherwise oxidize to form particulate matter. The impact of deposition processes can consequently be considered as competition between rates of oxidation and deposition, but timescales for deposition are not well constrained. While timescales for dry deposition have been estimated and experimentally validated in the past, understanding of wet deposition of organics is still very limited. In this work, we estimate the wet deposition timescale for gas-phase organic compounds in the atmosphere as a function of Henry's law constants, H, using real-world precipitation frequency and size distributions at five globally-distributed sites. The wet deposition timescale decreases significantly with the increase of H until reaching a stable minimum for compounds with H > 10<sup>5</sup> M per atm. We estimate that the median wet deposition timescale for highly soluble gases is approximately 5 hours during a continuous rain event for all sites. However, median estimated timescales ranged from 80 to 200 hours, depending on location. Timescales are found to depend primarily on the frequency and duration of precipitation events rather than their intensity or size characteristics. Based on these data, we demonstrate that timescales for wet deposition of gases can be estimated at any given location using only basic precipitation information, without detailed or high-precision measurements.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Field observations can provide valuable insight into the characteristics of the induction zone and the mechanisms that amplify it. However, the small velocity reductions that have been measured experimentally pose a challenge in quantifying blockage, especially onshore, where flow heterogeneities may be of the same scale as the blockage effect itself. We simulate the flow around the King Plains wind plant in the simple terrain of Oklahoma, the location of the American WAKE experimeNt (AWAKEN), to evaluate blockage in this environment. We find the induction zone of the wind plant extends 24D upstream, with velocity deficits smaller than 0.64m/s (8%) throughout. We also use virtual measurements upstream of the wind plant to analyze the uncertainties and difficulties in measuring blockage using a scanning lidar onshore. Based on our virtual lidar study, the induction zone of land-based wind plants can be incorrectly estimated using observations if the effects of nonuniform terrain on the flow are not carefully considered. Changes in terrain elevation produce local variations in wind speed (as measured by a scanning lidar) that exceed in magnitude the deceleration within the induction zone. We propose a methodology to differentiate between these local changes in wind speed and blockage in experimental settings, highlighting the difficulties associated with measurement of blockage in even relatively simple onshore environments.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The sorption of heavy metals on covalently bonded minerals is generally well described by surface complexation models (SCMs). However, understanding sorption on sparingly soluble minerals is challenging because of the dynamically evolving chemistry of sorbent surfaces. The interpretation can be even more complicated when multiple metal ions compete for sorption. In the present study, we observed synergistically enhanced uptake of lead and selenate on the barite (001) surface through two sorption mechanisms: lattice incorporation that dominates at lower coverages and two-dimensional monolayer growth that dominates at higher coverages. Further, we also observed a systematic increase in the sorption affinity with increasing co-sorbed ion coverages, different from the assumption of invariant binding constants for individual adsorption processes in classical SCMs. Computational simulations showed thermodynamically favorable co-incorporation of lead and selenate by simultaneously substituting for barium and sulfate in neighboring sites, resulting in the formation of molecular clusters that locally match the net dimension of the substrate lattice. These results emphasize the importance of ion–ion interactions at mineral–water interfaces that control the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Influence of African Easterly Wave Suppression on Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Activity in a Convection-Permitting Model","Danso, Derrick K.; Patricola, Christina M.; Bercos‐Hickey, Emily","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","African easterly waves (AEWs) are strongly linked to Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) on the synoptic timescale by serving as seedling disturbances for TC genesis. However, it is unclear whether climatological TC frequency is limited by AEWs. We investigated the impact of suppressing AEWs using a 3-member ensemble of convection-permitting regional model simulations, in which AEWs were either retained or removed through the lateral boundary conditions. Suppressing AEWs did not substantially change seasonal TC number, but did influence TC intensity, genesis time and location. Suppressing AEWs produced stronger TCs, shifted peak TC genesis from September to August, and reduced (increased) TC genesis in the eastern Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico). Without AEWs, TCs generated under more favorable large-scale atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, these results indicate that AEWs may not be reliable predictors of basin-wide seasonal TC frequency. However, simulations provide evidence that AEWs could influence the large-scale environment that is important for TCs.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Using cloud radar to investigate the effect of rainfall on migratory insect flight","Wainwright, Charlotte E.; Volponi, Sabrina N.; Stepanian, Phillip M.; Reynolds, Don R.; Richter, David H.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; entomology; flight behaviour; image processing; radar aeroecology","The fate of migrating insects that encounter rainfall in flight is a critical consideration when modelling insect movement, but few field observations of this common phenomenon have ever been collected due to the logistical challenges of witnessing these encounters. Operational cloud radars have been deployed around the world by meteorological agencies to study precipitation physics, and as a byproduct, provide a rich database of insect observations that is freely available to researchers. Although considered unwanted ‘clutter’ by the meteorologists who collect the data, the analysis method presented here enables ecologists to delineate co-occurring signals from insects and raindrops. We present a method that uses image processing techniques on cloud radar velocity spectra to examine the fate of migrating insects when they encounter precipitation. By analysing velocity spectra, we can distinguish flying insects from falling rain and compare the relative density of insects in flight before, during and after the rainfall. We demonstrate the method on a case of insect migration in Oklahoma, USA. Using this method, we show the first reconstructed images of migrating insect layers in flight during rainfall. Our analysis shows that mild to moderate rainfall diminishes the number of insects aloft but does not cause full termination of migratory flight, as has previously been suggested. We hope this technique will spur further investigations of how changing weather conditions impact insect migration, and enable some of the first of such studies in regions of the world that are underrepresented in the literature.","British Ecological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The torrential rainfall was mainly caused by an active cross-equatorial northerly surge (CENS) that occurred concurrently with equatorial waves and Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). A strong and persistent low-level northerly wind and moisture transport induced by CENS created favorable atmospheric conditions for the formation of deep convection and heavy rainfall over Jakarta. The concurrent occurrences of convectively active phases of equatorial waves (mainly Kelvin, TD-type, and eastward propagating inertia-gravity waves) and MJO during the event further supported the development of heavy rainfall by increasing low-level moisture flux convergence, whereas equatorial Rossby waves contributed indirectly to the increased moisture transport by amplifying cross-equatorial meridional flows toward Jakarta. Together, these large-scale dynamical forcing factors provided a conducive convective environment for the development of mesoscale convective systems and, hence, extreme rainfall over the region.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Marine sky brightening (MSB), involving the direct scattering of sunlight from sea salt injection into the marine boundary layer, has been proposed as an additional geoengineering method that could work in areas that are not regularly cloudy. Here, we use a regional atmospheric model to simulate MCB and MSB over the Gulf of Mexico and nearby land, a highly populated and economically important region that is not characterized by persistent marine stratocumulus cloud cover. Injection of sea salt in the Aitken mode from a region in the central Gulf of Mexico equivalent to 10.8 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> produces an upwards 8.4 W m<sup>-2</sup> radiative flux change across the region at the top of the atmosphere, largely due to cloud property changes. Comparatively, a similar mass injection in the accumulation mode produces a 3.1 W m<sup>-2</sup> radiative flux change driven primarily by direct scattering. Injection of even larger particles produces a much smaller radiative flux change. Shortwave flux changes due to clouds are largely driven by an increase in cloud droplet number concentration and an increase in cloud liquid water path (each contributing about 45% to the flux change), with a much lower contribution from cloud fraction changes (10%).","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The annual cycles of the vertical distributions of dust backscatter coefficient and PDR and dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) show that aerosol loading has a maximum in late winter and early spring but a minimum in late summer and early autumn. Vertically, dust aerosol occurs in the entire troposphere in spring and winter and in the low and middle troposphere in summer and autumn.

"Sizing ice hydrometeor populations using the dual-wavelength radar ratio","Matrosov, Sergey Y.; Korolev, Alexei; Wolde, Mengistu; Nguyen, Cuong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES; atmospheric particles, radar, remote sensing","Dual-wavelength (3.2 and 0.32 cm, i.e., X- and W-radar bands) radar ratio (DWR) measurements in ice clouds and precipitation using Canada's National Research Council Institute for Aerospace Research airborne radar are compared to closely collocated particle microphysical in situ sampling data in order to develop relations between DWR and characteristic hydrometeor size. This study uses the radar and in situ data sets collected during the In-Cloud ICing and Large-drop Experiment (ICICLE) campaign in midlatitude frontal clouds. Since atmospheric particle scattering at X band is predominantly in the Rayleigh regime and the W-band frequency is the highest frequency usually used for hydrometeor remote sensing, the X–W-band combination provides a relatively strong dual-wavelength reflectivity difference. This study considers radar and in situ measurements conducted in relatively homogeneous cloud and precipitation conditions. Measurements show that under these conditions, the difference between the X-band radar reflectivities observed with vertical and horizontal pointing of the radar beam are generally small and often negligible. However, W-band reflectivities at vertical beam pointing are, on average, larger than those for horizontal beam pointing by about 4 dB, which is a non-Rayleigh scattering effect from preferentially oriented non-spherical particles. A horizontal radar beam DWR–mean volume particle size relation, Dv, provides robust estimates of this characteristic size for populations of particles with different habits. Uncertainties of Dv retrievals using DWR are around 0.6 mm when Dv is greater than approximately 1 mm. Size estimates using vertical radar beam DWRs have larger uncertainties due to smaller dual-wavelength signals and stronger influences of hydrometeor habits and orientations at this geometry of beam pointing. Mean relations among different characteristic sizes, which describe the entire particle size distribution (PSD), such as Dv, and other sizes used in various applications (e.g., the mean, effective, and median sizes) are derived, so the results of this study can be used for estimating different PSD characteristic sizes.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Automated detection of sound producing animals from passively recorded soundscapes via machine-learning approaches is a promising technique towards this goal, but it is constrained by the necessity of large training data sets. Using soundscapes from a tropical forest in Borneo and a Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN), we investigate i) the minimum viable training data set size for accurate prediction of call types (‘sonotypes’), and ii) the extent to which data augmentation and transfer learning can overcome the issue of small and imbalanced training data sets. We found that even relatively high sample sizes (>80 per sonotype) lead to mediocre accuracy, which however improved significantly with data augmentation and transfer learning, including at extremely small sample sizes (3 per sonotype), regardless of taxonomic group or call characteristics. Neither transfer learning nor data augmentation alone achieved high accuracy. Our results suggest that transfer learning and data augmentation could make the use of CNNs to classify species’ vocalizations feasible even for small soundscape-based projects with many rare species.

Unfortunately, those responses are difficult to predict in seasonally dry forests, in part, because ecosystem processes are highly sensitive to both changes in temperature and precipitation. We investigated how warming might alter stocks of C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in vegetation and the entire regolith (soil + weathered bedrock or “saprock”) using a space-for-time substitution along a bioclimatic gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. The pine-oak and mixed-conifer forests between 1,160–2,015 m elevation have more optimal climates (not too dry or hot) for ecosystem productivity, soil weathering, and cycling of essential elements than the oak savannah (405 m) and subalpine forest (2,700 m). We found decreases in overstory vegetation nutrient stocks with decreasing elevation because of enhanced water limitation and greater occurrence of disturbances. Stocks of C, N, and P in the entire regolith peaked at the pine-oak and mixed-conifer forests across the bioclimatic gradient, driven by thicker regolith profiles and greater nutrient input rates. These observations suggest long-term warming will decrease ecosystem nutrient storage at the warmer, transitional pine-oak zone, but will increase nutrient storage at the colder, subalpine zone.

"Diurnal cycle of precipitation over global monsoon systems in CMIP6 simulations","Tao, Cheng; Xie, Shaocheng; Tang, Shuaiqi; Lee, Jiwoo; Ma, Hsi-Yen; Zhang, Chengzhu; Lin, Wuyin","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; precipitation; diurnal cycle; global monsoon systems; CMIP6","Accurate simulation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation over different climate regimes, including global monsoon systems, is an ongoing challenge for current state-of-the-art climate models. Here, in this study, the diurnal cycles of summertime precipitation from 21 CMIP6 historical simulations are evaluated with the NASA IMERG data via the diurnal harmonic amplitude and phase from the Fourier analysis in seven regional monsoon systems: Northern and Southern Africa monsoons, South Asia monsoon, East Asia monsoon, Australia monsoon, and North and South America monsoons. Particularly, we focus on four subregions including ocean, coastal ocean, land, and coastal land considering the different underlying physical processes. It is found that the CMIP6 historical simulations perform fairly well on reproducing the diurnal cycle of precipitation over ocean and coastal ocean, while the simulated diurnal harmonic phase and amplitude over land and coastal land show larger biases and model spread compared to biases over ocean and coastal ocean. The simulation of precipitation diurnal cycle is substantially improved in the multi-model mean of both CMIP6 historical and CMIP6 AMIP simulations compared with that of CMIP5 historical simulations. But the model bias of precipitation diurnal cycle is in general similar between CMIP6 AMIP and CMIP6 historical simulations, which suggests that the impact of the interactive ocean on the simulated diurnal precipitation averaged over a large domain is generally minor. The influence of model resolution on the diurnal cycle is shown in mixed directions across various subregions, and significant improvement from the low- to high-resolution models is only notable over coastal ocean.","Springer-Verlag","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Drought, as a typical extreme event, is a key driver of forest mortality but there have been no reports on continental-scale quantification of its impact on forest mortality or how it compares to other natural or anthropogenic drivers. Thus, our ability to understand and predict broad-scale carbon cycling in response to changing climate and extreme events is limited. In this study, we applied an attribution approach based on different sources of data to quantify the area and potential carbon loss/transfer in continental U.S. (CONUS) from four types of disturbance: (1) anthropogenic (especially timber harvest); (2) fire; (3) drought-associated; and (4) other from 2000 to 2014. Our results showed that anthropogenic disturbances, fire, drought-associated disturbances, and other disturbances accounted for 54.3, 10.7, 12.7, and 22.3% of total canopy area loss, respectively. Anthropogenic disturbance was the most important driver contributing to 58.1% potential carbon loss/transfer in CONUS for 2000–2014. The potential carbon loss/transfer from natural disturbances (fire, drought, and other) for the same study period accounted for approximately 41.9% of the total loss/transfer from all agents, suggesting that natural disturbances also played a very important role in forest carbon turnover. Potential carbon loss/transfer associated with drought accounted for approximately 11.6% of the total loss/transfer in CONUS, which was of similar magnitude to potential carbon loss/transfer from fire (~11.0%). The other natural disturbance accounted for 19.3% of potential carbon loss/transfer. Our results demonstrated the importance of the impacts of various disturbances on forest carbon stocks at the continental scale, and the drought-associated carbon loss/transfer data developed here could be used for evaluating the performance of predictive models of tree mortality under droughts.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, composition-specific identification, nucleation processes, and ice nucleation rates of SSA-INPs have not been well constrained. Microspectroscopic characterization of ambient and laboratory-generated SSA confirms that water-borne exudates from planktonic microorganisms composed of a mixture of proteinaceous and polysaccharidic compounds act as ice-nucleating agents (INAs). These data and data from previously published mesocosm and wave channel studies are subsequently used to further develop the stochastic freezing model (SFM) producing ice nucleation rate coefficients for SSA-INPs. The SFM simultaneously predicts immersion freezing and deposition and homogeneous ice nucleation by SSA particles under tropospheric conditions. Predicted INP concentrations agree with ambient and laboratory measurements. In addition, this holistic freezing model is independent of the source and exact composition of the SSA particles, making it well suited for implementation in cloud and climate models.","AAAS","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

However, the chemical composition of Se-barite coprecipitates usually deviates from that predicted from thermodynamic calculations. This discrepancy was resolved by considering variations in nucleation and growth rates controlled by ion–mineral interactions, solubility, and interfacial energy. For homogeneous precipitation, ~10% of sulfate, higher than thermodynamic predictions (<0.3%), was substituted by Se(IV) or Se(VI) oxyanion, which was attributed to adsorption-induced entrapment during crystal growth. For heterogeneous precipitation, thiol- and carboxylic-based organic films, utilized as model interfaces to mimic the natural organic-abundant environments, further enhanced the sequestration of Se(VI) oxyanions (up to 41–92%) with barite. Such enhancement was kinetically driven by increased nucleation rates of selenate-rich barite having a lower interfacial energy than pure barite. In contrast, only small amounts of Se(IV) oxyanions (~1%) were detected in heterogeneous coprecipitates mainly due to a lower saturation index of BaSeO<sub>3</sub> and deprotonation degree of Se(IV) oxyanion at pH 5.6. Finally, these roles of nanoscale mineralization mechanisms observed during composition selection of Se-barite could mark important steps toward the remediation of contaminants through coprecipitation.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These took place from 17 August to 5 September 2017, during the African biomass burning season. The primary motivation was to give confidence in the use of data from multiple platforms with which to evaluate numerical climate models. The three platforms were involved in the CLouds-Aerosol-Radiation Interaction and Forcing for Year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017), ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES), and Layered Atlantic Smoke and Interactions with Clouds (LASIC) field experiments.

The intercomparison flight sampled a relatively clean atmosphere overlying a moderately polluted boundary layer, while the 6 fly-bys of the ARM site sampled both clean and polluted conditions 2–4 km upwind. We compare and validate characterisations of aerosol physical, chemical, and optical properties, atmospheric radiation, and cloud microphysics between platforms. We assess the performance of measurement instrumentation in the field, under conditions where sampling conditions are not tightly controlled as in laboratory measurements where calibrations are performed. Solar radiation measurements compared well between airborne platforms. Optical absorption coefficient measurements compared well across all three platforms, even though absolute magnitudes were often low (< 10 Mm<sup>-1</sup>) and close to the sensitivity limits of measurement instrumentation thereby confounding assessments of the comparability of absorption Ångström exponent characterisations. Aerosol absorption measurements from airborne platforms were more comparable than aircraft-to-ground observations. Scattering coefficient observations compared well between airborne platforms, but agreement with ground-based measurements was worse, potentially caused by small differences in sampling conditions or actual aerosol population differences. Chemical composition measurements followed a similar pattern, with better comparisons between the airborne platforms. Thermodynamics, aerosol, and cloud microphysical properties generally compared well.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Degradative plasmids with genetic capabilities to degrade organic contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have the potential to be useful for more environmentally friendly and cost-effective remediation technologies compared to existing physical remediation methods. Genetic bioaugmentation, the addition of catabolic genes into well-adapted communities via plasmid transfer (conjugation), is being explored as a remediation approach that is sustainable and long-lasting. Here, we explored the effect of the ecological growth strategies of plasmid donors and recipients on conjugation and naphthalene degradation of two PAH-degrading plasmids, pNL1 and NAH7. Overall, both pNL1 and NAH7 showed conjugation preferences towards a slow-growing ecological growth strategy, except when NAH7 was in a mixed synthetic community. These conjugation preferences were partially described by a combination of growth strategy, GC content, and phylogenetic relatedness. Further, removal of naphthalene via plasmid-mediated degradation was consistently higher in a community consisting of recipients with a slow-growing ecological growth strategy compared to a mixed community or a community consisting of fast-growing ecological growth strategy. Understanding plasmid conjugation and degradative preferences has the capacity to influence future remediation technology design and has broad implications in biomedical, environmental, and health fields.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Roles of External Forcing and Internal Variability in Precipitation Changes of a Sub-Region of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic During 1979–2019","Dong, Lu; Leung, L. Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Observations of the seasonal mean precipitation averaged over a sub-region of the U.S. mid-Atlantic show significant increases in summer but no changes in winter during 1979–2019. Clarifying the drivers of these observed changes is important for understanding and interpreting future projections of regional precipitation by climate models. Herein, this study examines the relative effects of external forcing and internal variability in the observed multi-decadal changes using the historical and RCP8.5/SSP585 simulations from 37 models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), 35 models in CMIP6, as well as large ensemble simulations from 6 models, each including more than 20 members. During 1979–2019, enhanced warming over land relative to ocean due to external forcing induces low pressure anomalies over land that contribute to the wetting summer. While similar wetting also occurs during winter, such effect is offset by the drying associated with the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in recent decades. Internal variability produces large uncertainty in the multi-decadal precipitation changes simulated by climate models through changes in large-scale circulation associated with the NAO in winter and the North Atlantic Subtropical High in summer. These multi-decadal relationships between precipitation and large-scale circulation under internal variability also manifest on inter-annual timescale. These relationships highlight enhanced moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic in winter and near the mid-Atlantic coast in summer that modulates precipitation change in the study region.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Global and regional energy systems, including hydropower, may evolve in a variety of ways under different scenarios. Representation of hydropower in global multisector models is often simplified at the country or regional level. Some models assume a fixed hydropower supply, which is not affected by economic drivers or competition with other electricity generation sources. Here, we implement an endogenous model of hydropower expansion in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), including a representation of hydropower potential at the river basin level to project future hydropower production across river basins and explore hydropower’s role in evolving energy systems both regionally and globally, under alternative scenarios. Each scenario utilizes the new endogenous hydropower implementation but makes different assumptions about future low-carbon transitions, technology costs, and energy demand. Our study suggests there is ample potential for hydropower to expand in the future to help meet growing demand for electricity driven by socioeconomic growth, electrification of end-use sectors, or other factors. However, hydropower expansion will be constrained by resource availability, resource location, and cost in ways that limit its growth relative to other technologies. As a result, all scenarios show a generally decreasing share of hydroelectricity over total electricity generation at the global level. Hydropower expansion varies across regions, and across basins within regions, due to differences in resource potential, cost, current utilization, and other factors. In sum, our scenarios entail hydropower generation growth between 36% and 119% in 2050, compared to 2015, globally.</p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Ruby; Roberts, Malcolm J.; Cha, Dong-Hyun; Moon, Jihong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Rainfall; Tropical cyclones; Numerical analysis/modeling","This study evaluates tropical cyclone (TC) rainfall structures in the CMIP6 HighResMIP global climate model (GCM) simulations against satellite rainfall retrievals. We specifically focus on TCs within the deep tropics (25oS-25oN). Analysis of TC rain rate composites indicates that in comparison to the satellite observations at the same intensity, many HighResMIP simulations tend to overproduce rain rates around TCs, in terms of both maximum rain rate magnitude and area-averaged rain rates. In addition, as model horizontal resolution increases, the magnitude of the peak rain rate appears to increase. However, the area-averaged rain rates decrease with increasing horizontal resolution, partly due to the TC eyewall being located closer to the TC center, thus occupying a smaller area and contributing less to the area-averaged rain rates. The effect of ocean coupling is to lower the TC rain rates, bringing them closer to the satellite observations, due to reduced horizontal moisture flux convergence and surface latent heat flux beneath TCs. Examination of horizontal rain rate distributions indicates that vertical wind shear-induced rainfall asymmetries in HighResMIP-simulated TCs are qualitatively consistent with the observations. In addition, a positive relationship is observed between the area-averaged inner-core rainfall and TC intensification likelihoods across the HighResMIP simulations, as GCM simulations producing stronger TCs more frequently have the greater rainfall close to the center, in agreement with previous theoretical and GCM simulation results.","American Meteorological Society","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States); Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The Role of Ocean Circulation in Southern Ocean Heat Uptake, Transport, and Storage Response to Quadrupled CO<sub>2</sub>","Li, Qiuxian; Luo, Yiyong; Lu, Jian; Liu, Fukai","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Southern Ocean; Ocean circulation; Heat budgets/fluxes","In response to quadrupled CO<sub>2</sub>, the Southern Ocean primarily uptakes excess heat around 60°S, which is then redistributed by the northward ocean heat transport (OHT) and mostly stored in the ocean or released back to the atmosphere around 45°S. However, the relative roles of mean ocean circulation and ocean circulation change in the uptake and redistribution of heat in the Southern Ocean remain controversial. Here, in this study, a set of climate model experiments embedded with a novel partial coupling technique are used to separate the roles of mean ocean circulation (passive component) and ocean circulation change (active component). For the ocean heat uptake (OHU) response, the mean ocean circulation and ocean circulation change are of equal importance. The OHT response south of 50°S is mainly determined by mean ocean circulation, while the ocean circulation change generates an anomalous southward OHT north of 50°S. A heat budget analysis finds that the divergence of passive OHT acts to balance the passive surface heat gain to the south of ~50°S, while the convergence of active OHT acts to balance the active surface heat loss to the north of ~50°S. Intriguingly, all the increase in ocean heat storage (OHS) is attributable to the passive component, with the ocean circulation change playing almost no role. In the Southern Ocean, both the active and the passive ocean heat transports are overcompensated by the reverse atmospheric heat transport via the Bjerknes compensation.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Mixing Pathways in Simple Box Models","Qu, Lixin; Hetland, Robert D.; Schlichting, Dylan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; salinity; coastal flows; mixing","<title>Abstract</title> <p> Tracer variance budgets can be used to estimate bulk mixing in a control volume. For example, simple, analytical, bulk formulations of salt mixing, defined here as the destruction of salinity variance, can be found for estuaries with a riverine source of freshwater and a two-layer exchange flow at the mouth using salinity as a representative tracer. For a steady case, the bulk salt mixing <italic>M</italic> can be calculated as <inline-formula id='IE1'/> , where <italic>S</italic> <sub>in</sub> and <italic>S</italic> <sub>out</sub> are the representative salinities in the estuarine exchange flow, and <italic> Q <sub>R</sub> </italic> and <italic>Q</italic> <sub>in</sub> are the river and landward volume fluxes, respectively. The bulk salt mixing <italic>M</italic> can be considered as the sum of mixing pathways, where each pathway has a mixing of <italic>Q</italic> (Δ <italic>S</italic> ) <sup>2</sup> , where <italic>Q</italic> is the volume transport and Δ <italic>S</italic> is the salinity difference across the pathway. For the estuary case, one mixing path is associated with the river inflow, and the other is associated with the inflow of salty, oceanic water. This concept of linking mixing to input–output pathways is extended, in simple box models, from estuaries to scenarios with multiple inputs/outputs, as might be found in a complex estuarine/fjord network, in a region on a continental shelf, or any other control volume with multiple exchanges. This approach allows for the estimation of the relative contributions of each input–output pathway to the total mixing within a control volume. </p>","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Our variance-partitioning analysis identifies vegetation type as an important predictor for SEB-components during Arctic summer (June-August), compared to other SEB-drivers including climate, latitude and permafrost characteristics. Differences among vegetation types can be of similar magnitude as between vegetation and glacier surfaces and are especially high for summer sensible and latent heat fluxes. The timing of SEB-flux summer-regimes (when daily mean values exceed 0 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) relative to snow-free and -onset dates varies substantially depending on vegetation type, implying vegetation controls on snow-cover and SEB-flux seasonality.

Although it is common knowledge that measurements obtained through field studies vs. laboratory incubations can diverge because of the vastly different conditions of these environments, few studies have systematically examined these patterns. These data are used to parameterize and benchmark ecosystem- to global-scale models, which are then susceptible to the biases of the source data.

Case comparison indicates that the cloud top locations in the MMCR observation are largely consistent with those in satellite data. The precipitation has the occurrence frequency of 9.5% over the year, with the maximum value of 16.3% in July and the submaximal value of 14.7% in January, showing the significant influences of monsoons on precipitation at Wuhan. As the humid, cloudy and rainy climate, the probability of precipitation and non-precipitation clouds increases gradually from 53.9% in January to a large value of 71.5% in July. The non-precipitation clouds have the probability of 44.5% in the year, with two prominent peaks at the reflectivities of -35 to -30 dBZ around 12 km in summer and - 37– -32 dBZ around 10 km in spring. The cloud top can reach the heights of 14.49, 16.62, 13.38 and 11.73 km from spring to winter, respectively. The monthly mean cloud layer thickness is the largest (2.18 km) in May and September, and the smallest (1.36 km) in November. The seasonally averaged base and top heights and thickness of clouds have small diurnal variations. The high cloud is predominant in the warm months from May to September, and in the other cool months, the middle cloud has the most fraction. The quantitative investigation of clouds is helpful in improving the cloud parameterization in climate models.","Elsevier","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Impact of Advection Schemes on Tracer Interrelationships in Large-Eddy Simulations of Deep Convection","Hernández Pardo, Lianet; Morrison, Hugh; Lauritzen, Peter H.; Pöhlker, Mira","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; advection; cumulus clouds; large eddy simulations; model errors; tracers","This study investigates the preservation of tracer interrelationships during advection in large-eddy simulations of an idealized deep convective cloud, which is particularly relevant to chemistry, aerosol, and cloud microphysics models. Employing the Cloud Model 1, advection is represented using third-, fifth-, and seventh-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes. As a simplified analogy for cloud hydrometeors and aerosols, several inert passive tracers following linear and nonlinear relationships are initialized after the cloud reaches ~6-km depth. Numerical mixing in the simulated turbulent convective clouds leads to significant deviations from the initial nonlinear relationships between tracers. In these simulations, a considerable fraction of the grid points where the tracers’ nonlinear relationships are altered from advection are classified as unrealistic (e.g., ~13% for the environmental tracers on average), including errors from range-preserving unmixing and overshooting. Errors in the sum of three tracers are also relatively large, ranging between ~1% and 16% for 5% of the grid points in and near the cloud. The magnitude of unrealistic mixing and errors in the sum of three tracers generally increase with the order of accuracy of the advection scheme. These results are consistent across model grid spacings ranging from 50 to 200 m, and across three different flow realizations for each combination of grid spacing and advection scheme tested. Tests employing a previously proposed scalar normalization procedure show substantially reduced errors in the sum of three tracers with a relatively small negative impact on other tracer relationships. This analysis, therefore, suggests efficacy of the normalization procedure when applied to turbulent three-dimensional cloud simulations.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

By using Low-Frequency Component Analysis, we explore the uncertainties of the resulting AMO indices and the corresponding spatial patterns derived from three observational SST datasets. We found that the known coherent spatial pattern of the AMO at the basin scale over the North Atlantic appears in two out of the three datasets. Further analysis indicates that both the warming trend and the different techniques used to construct these observed gridded SSTs contribute to the AMO’s spatial coherence over the North Atlantic, especially during periods of sparse data sampling. The SST in the Extended Reconstructed SST dataset version 5 (ERSSTv5), changes from being systematically below the other datasets during the dense sampling periods on either side of the Second World War (WWII), to systematically above the other datasets during WWII, thereby introducing an artificial 10–20-year variability that affects the AMO’s spatial coherence. This coherence in the AMO’s spatial pattern is also affected by bias adjustment in ERSSTv5 at relative cool (i.e., non-summer) seasons, and by the heterogeneous North Atlantic warming pattern. The different AMO patterns can induce the different effects of wind, surface heat fluxes, and then drive ocean circulation and its heat transport convergence, especially for some seasons. For AMO indices, both the different detrending methods and different observational data result in uncertainty for the period 1935–1950. Such SST uncertainty is important to detect the relative role of the atmosphere and ocean in shaping the AMO.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); China NSFC","","United States","2022-10-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Marine Science; Journal Volume: 9","","Medium: ED","","","SC0022070; 41976026; 41931183; 41931182","Journal ID: ISSN 2296-7745","10.3389/fmars.2022.1007646","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970376","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1970376","Frontiers in Marine Science","","9"

Its activity and selectivity are highly facet-dependent. We recently examined the commonly proposed rate-limiting CO hydrogenation step on Cu(111) via embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory and demonstrated that only this higher-level theory yields predictions consistent with potential-dependent experimental kinetics. Here, to understand the differing activities of Cu(111) and Cu(100) in catalyzing CO<sub>2</sub>R, we explore CO hydrogenation on Cu(100) using ECW theory. We predict that the preferred pathway involves the reduction of adsorbed CO (*CO) to *COH via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at working potentials, although *CHO also may form with a kinetically accessible but higher barrier. In contrast, our earlier work on Cu(111) concluded that *COH and *CHO formation via PCET are equally feasible. Furthermore, this work illustrates one possible origin of the facet dependence of CO<sub>2</sub>R mechanisms and products on Cu electrodes and sheds light on how the selectivity of CO<sub>2</sub>R electrocatalysts can be controlled by the surface morphology.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

This includes results from the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) double-moment microphysics, the Hebrew University Cloud Model bin microphysics (HUCM) interfaced to the RAMS parent model, and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model with the Thompson, Morrison, double-moment 6-class (WDM6), and National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) double-moment schemes. Simulations are examined with respect to the raindrop size distribution (DSD) volume-number mean diameter (D<sub>m</sub>) and intercept parameter (N<sub>w</sub>). When compared to a suite of disdrometer observations, the RDFD resulting from each microphysics scheme exhibits varying degrees of mean drop size constraints and peaks in the frequency distribution of D<sub>m</sub>. A more detailed investigation of the peaked RDFD from the RAMS simulations suggests that the parameterization of raindrop collisional breakup can impose strong limitations on the evolution of simulated drop growth. As such, a summary and comparison of the drop breakup parameterizations among the aforementioned microphysics schemes is presented. While some drop breakup parameterizations are adjusted toward the observations by modifying the threshold diameter for the onset of breakup, this study explores the use of a modified maximum breakup efficiency. This method permits the parameterization to retain its threshold breakup diameter, while limiting the strength of drop breakup and permitting a broader range of drop sizes. As a result, the simulated mean drop sizes are in better agreement with observations.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Enabled by the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) simulator, EAMv2 and EAMv1 predicted cloud phase is compared against the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) at high latitudes where mixed-phase clouds are prevalent. Our results indicate that the underestimation of cloud ice in simulated high-latitude mixed-phase clouds in EAMv1 has been significantly reduced in EAMv2. The increased ice clouds in the Arctic mainly result from the modification on the WBF (Wegner-Bergeron-Findeisen) process in EAMv2. The impact of the modified WBF process is moderately compensated by the low limit of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) in cloud microphysics and the new dCAPE_ULL trigger used in deep convection in EAMv2. Moreover, it is found that the new trigger largely contributes to the better cloud phase simulation over the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean where large errors are found in EAMv1. However, errors in simulated cloud phase in EAMv1, such as the overestimation of supercooled liquid clouds near the surface in both hemispheres and the underestimation of ice clouds over Antarctica, persist in EAMv2. In conclusion, this study highlights the impact of deep convection parameterizations, which has received little attention, on high-latitude mixed-phase clouds, and the importance of continuous improvement of cloud microphysics in climate models for accurately representing mixed-phase clouds.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Flood events; Convective storms; Soil moisture","Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that are clustered in time and space can have a broader impact on flooding because they have larger area coverage than that of individual MCSs. The goal of this study is to understand the flood likelihood associated with MCS clusters. To achieve this, floods in the Storm Events Database in April–August of 2007–17 are matched with clustered MCSs identified from a high-resolution MCS dataset and terrestrial conditions in a land surface dataset over the central-eastern United States. In this work, our analysis indicates that clustered MCSs preferentially occurring in April–June are more effective at producing floods, which also last longer due to the greater rainfall per area and wetter initial soil conditions and, hence, produce greater runoff per area than nonclustered MCSs. Similar increases of flood occurrence with cluster-total rainfall size and wetter soils are also observed for each MCS cluster, especially for the overlapping rainfall areas within each cluster. These areas receive rainfall from multiple MCSs that progressively wet the soils and are therefore associated with higher flood likelihood. This study underscores the importance to understand clustered MCSs to better understand flood risks and their future changes.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we combine observations with model simulations, to investigate the HEXs and Compound Height-Heat Extremes (CHHEXs) along the Indian Ocean coast of Indonesia in recent decades. We find that anthropogenic sea level rise combined with decadal climate variability causes increased occurrence of HEXs during 2010–2017. Both HEXs and CHHEXs are driven by equatorial westerly and longshore northwesterly wind anomalies. For most HEXs, which occur during December-March, downwelling favorable northwest monsoon winds are enhanced but enhanced vertical mixing limits surface warming. For most CHHEXs, wind anomalies associated with a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and co-occurring La Niña weaken the southeasterlies and cooling from coastal upwelling during May-June and November-December. Our findings emphasize the important interplay between anthropogenic warming and climate variability in affecting regional extremes.","Nature Publishing Group","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 6410","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723","10.1038/s41467-022-34003-3","","2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","1903580","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1903580","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1903580","Nature Communications","1","13"

The algorithm is based on the calculation of reflectivity and radial velocity texture fields that measure the horizontal homogeneity of cloud and precipitation features. The texture fields are translated into convectivity, a numerical measure of the convective or stratiform nature of each data point. The convective–stratiform classification is obtained by thresholding the convectivity field. Subcategories of low, mid-, and high stratiform, shallow, mid-, deep, and elevated convective, and mixed echoes are introduced, which are based on the melting-layer and divergence-level altitudes. As the algorithm provides vertically resolved classifications, it is capable of identifying different types of vertically layered echoes, and convective features that are embedded in stratiform cloud layers. Its robustness was tested on data from four HCR field campaigns that took place in different meteorological and climatological regimes. The algorithm was adapted for use in spaceborne and ground-based radars, proving its versatility, as it is adaptable not only to different radar types and wavelengths, but also different research applications.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Foundational to the rational design of efficient, selective CO<sub>2</sub>RR electrocatalysts is mechanistic analysis of the best metal catalyst thus far identified, namely, copper (Cu), via quantum mechanical computations to complement experiments. Here, we apply embedded correlated wavefunction (ECW) theory, which regionally corrects the electron exchange-correlation error in density functional theory (DFT) approximations, to examine multiple C–C coupling steps involving adsorbed CO (*CO) and its hydrogenated derivatives on the most ubiquitous facet, Cu(111). We predict that two adsorbed hydrogenated CO species, either *COH or *CHO, are necessary precursors for C–C bond formation. The three kinetically feasible pathways involving these species yield all three possible products: *COH–CHO, *COH–*COH, and *OCH–*OCH. The most kinetically favorable path forms *COH–CHO. In contrast, standard DFT approximations arrive at qualitatively different conclusions, namely, that only *CO and *COH will prevail on the surface and their C–C coupling paths produce only *COH–*COH and *CO–*CO, with a preference for the first product. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the importance of applying qualitatively and quantitatively accurate quantum mechanical method to simulate electrochemistry in order ultimately to shed light on ways to enhance selectivity toward C<sub>2+</sub> product formation via CO<sub>2</sub>RR electrocatalysts.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

Topographic heterogeneity and lateral subsurface flow at the hillslope scale of ≤1 km may have outsized impacts on tropical forest through their impacts on water available to plants under water-stressed conditions. However, vegetation dynamics and finer-scale hydrologic processes are not concurrently represented in Earth system models. In this study, we integrate the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) that includes the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), with a three-dimensional hydrology model (ParFlow) to explicitly resolve hillslope topography and subsurface flow and perform numerical experiments to understand how hillslope-scale hydrologic processes modulate vegetation along water availability gradients at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Our simulations show that groundwater table depth (WTD) can play a large role in governing aboveground biomass (AGB) when drought-induced tree mortality is triggered by hydraulic failure. Analyzing the simulations using random forest (RF) models, we find that the domain-wide simulated AGB and WTD can be well predicted by static topographic attributes, including surface elevation, slope, and convexity, and adding soil moisture or groundwater table depth as predictors further improves the RF models. Different model representations of mortality due to hydraulic failure can change the dominant topographic driver for the simulated AGB. Contrary to the simulations, the observed AGB in the well-drained 50 ha forest census plot within BCI cannot be well predicted by the RF models using topographic attributes and observed soil moisture as predictors, suggesting other factors such as nutrient status may have a larger influence on the observed AGB. The new coupled model may be useful for understanding the diverse impact of local heterogeneity by isolating the water availability and nutrient availability from the other external and internal factors in ecosystem modeling.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A Decentralized Approach for Modeling Organized Convection Based on Thermal Populations on Microgrids","Neggers, R. A. J.; Griewank, P. J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; convective parameterization; spatial organization; population dynamics; thermals; microgrid modeling; shallow cumulus","In this study a spectral model for convective transport is coupled to a thermal population on a two-dimensional horizontal “microgrid”, covering the typical gridbox size of general circulation models. The goal is to explore new ways of representing impacts of spatial organization in cumulus cloud fields. The thermals are considered the smallest building block of convection, with thermal life cycle and movement represented through binomial functions. Thermals interact through two simple rules, reflecting pulsating growth and environmental deformation. Long-lived thermal clusters thus form on the microgrid, exhibiting scale growth and spacing that represent simple forms of spatial organization and memory. Size distributions of cluster number are diagnosed from the microgrid through an online clustering algorithm, and provided as input to a spectral multi-plume eddy-diffusivity mass flux scheme. This yields a decentralized transport system, in that the thermal clusters acting as independent but interacting nodes that carry information about spatial structure. The main objectives of this study are i) to seek proof of concept of this approach, and ii) to gain insight into impacts of spatial organization on convective transport. Single-column model experiments demonstrate satisfactory skill in reproducing two observed cases of continental shallow convection. Metrics expressing self-organization and spatial organization match well with large-eddy simulation results. We find that in this coupled system, spatial organization impacts convective transport primarily through the scale break in the size distribution of cluster number. The rooting of saturated plumes in the subcloud mixed layer plays a key role in this process.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The concentration of Cu and Zn in the sediments has increased over the lifetime of the wetland and is a concern. A bioremediation option was investigated at the laboratory scale utilizing a newly isolated bacterium of the copper metabolizing genus Cupriavidus isolated from Tim’s Branch Creek, a second-order stream that eventually serves as a tributary to the Savannah River, contaminated with uranium and other metals including copper, nickel, and mercury. Cupriavidus basilensis SRS is a rod-shaped, gram-negative bacterium which has been shown to have predatory tendencies. The isolate displayed resistance to the antibiotics ofloxacin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, select fungi, as well as Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Subsequent ribosomal sequencing demonstrated a 100% confidence for placement in the genus Cupriavidus and a 99.014% match to the C. basilensis type strain. When H-02 wetland samples were inoculated with Cupriavidus basilensis SRS samples showed significant (p < 0.05) decrease in Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and variability in Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Over the 72-h incubation there were no significant changes in the inoculate densities (10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> cells/ML) indicating Cupriavidus basilensis SRS resiliency in this environment. This research expands our understanding of the Cupriavidus genus and demonstrates the potential for Cupriavidus basilensis SRS to bioremediate sites impacted with heavy metals, most notably copper.","Nature Publishing Group","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

Plant diversity in terrestrial ecosystems drives feedback links between plant C inputs and soil pores, where the latter, in turn, impact the redox environment and Mn. This study examined associations between soil pores (>36 μm Ø) and Mn within intact soils from two grassland ecosystems, after their >6-year implementation in a replicated field experiment. In this work, we used μ-XRF imaging and XANES spectroscopy to explore spatial distribution patterns of Mn oxidation states, combined with X-ray computed microtomography and 2D zymography. A high plant diversity system (restored prairie) increased soil C and modified spatial distribution patterns of soil pores as compared to a single species system (monoculture switchgrass). In switchgrass, the abundance of oxidized and reduced Mn oxidation states varied with distance from pores consistently with anticipated O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, while in the soil from restored prairie, the spatial patterns suggested that biological activity played a greater role in influencing Mn distributions. Based on the findings, we propose a hypothesis that Mn transformations promote C gains in soils of high plant diversity grasslands.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States).

However, the precipitation regulation service of the TP ecosystems for supplying moisture and maintaining precipitation is yet to be evaluated. In this study, we used the moisture recycling framework and a moisture tracking model to quantify the precipitation regulation services of TP ecosystems for their contribution to precipitation. We found TP ecosystems contributed substantially to local and downwind precipitation, with a contribution of 221 mm/year for the TP and neighboring areas through evapotranspiration (ET) (104 mm/year through transpiration), declined to <10 mm/year for eastern China and other surrounding countries. Among ecosystem types, grassland contributed most to precipitation, followed by barren and snow lands, forests, and shrublands. In terms of seasonality, precipitation contribution from TP ecosystems was greater in summer months than in non-summer months for western China, while the opposite was true for eastern China—although the magnitude was much smaller. Over the past two decades, the significant ET increases in TP translated to a widespread increase in precipitation contribution for TP and downwind beneficiary regions from 2000 to 2020. Our study provides a quantitative way to understand the precipitation regulation services of TP ecosystems through moisture recycling, substantiating their key role to maintain precipitation and the water cycle for downwind regions—effectively acting as an ecological safeguard that could be perceived by the public.","Wiley","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Here we use a deep learning algorithm to identify weather fronts in high resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations over the contiguous United States (CONUS), and evaluate the results using observational and reanalysis products. We further compare results between CESM simulations using present-day and future climate forcing, to study how these features might change with climate change. We find that detected front frequencies in CESM have seasonally varying spatial patterns and responses to climate change and are found to be associated with modeled changes in large scale circulation such as the jet stream. We also associate the detected fronts with precipitation and find that total and extreme frontal precipitation mostly decreases with climate change, with some seasonal and regional differences. Here, decreases in Northern Hemisphere summer frontal precipitation are largely driven by changes in the frequency of different front types, especially cold and stationary fronts. On the other hand, Northern Hemisphere winter exhibits some regional increases in frontal precipitation that are largely driven by changes in frontal precipitation intensity. While CONUS mean and extreme precipitation generally increase during all seasons in these climate change simulations, the likelihood of frontal extreme precipitation decreases, demonstrating that extreme precipitation has seasonally varying sources and mechanisms that will continue to evolve with climate change.","American Geophysical Union","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres; Journal Volume: 127; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e2022JD037038","","","SC0022070; AC02-06CH11357; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-897X","10.1029/2022jd037038","","2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","1898031","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1898031","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","21","127"

Here we examine the roles of sea surface temperature (SST) and meteorological factors in controlling the mesoscale morphology and evolution of shallow clouds associated with a cold-air outbreak that occurred on 1 March 2020 during phase I of the Aerosol Cloud Meteorology Interactions over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE). Our results show that the simulated PFC structure and ambient conditions by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model are generally consistent with observations from GOES-16 and dropsonde measurements. We also examine the thermodynamical and dynamical influences in the cloud mesoscale morphology using WRF sensitivity experiments driven by two meteorological forcing datasets with different domain-mean SST and spatial gradients, which lead to dissimilar values of hydrometeor water path and cloud core fraction. The SST from ERA5 leads to weaker stability and higher inversion height than the SST from FNL does. In addition, the use of large-scale meteorological forcings from ERA5 yields a distinctive time evolution of wind direction shear in the inner domain, which favors the formation and persistence of longer cloud rolls. Both factors contribute to a change in the time evolution of domain-mean water path and cloud core fraction of cloud streets. Our study takes advantage of the simulation driven by the differences between two large-scale forcing datasets to illustrate the importance of SST and wind direction shear in the cloud street morphology in a realistic scenario.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Nevertheless, the insufficient observation frequencies and low detection accuracy of the boundary layer restricts the description of atmospheric state changes by the temperature and humidity profiles. Therefore, this work focus on retrieving the temperature and humidity profiles using observations of the FengYun-4 (FY-4) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) combined with ground-based infrared spectral observations from the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI), which are more accurate than space-based individual retrieval results and have a wider effective retrieval range than ground-based individual retrieval results. Based on the synergistic observations, which are made by matching the space-based and ground-based data with those of different spatial and temporal resolutions, a synergistic retrieval process is proposed to obtain the temperature and humidity profiles at a high frequency under clear-sky conditions based on the optimal estimation method. In this research, using the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) as the forward model for observing simulations, a retrieval experiment was carried out in Qingdao, China, where an AERI is situated. Taking radiosonde data as a reference for comparing the retrieval results of the temperature and humidity profiles of the troposphere, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the synergistic retrieval algorithm below 400 hPa is within 2 K for temperature and within 12% for relative humidity. Compared with the GIIRS individual retrieval, the RMSE of temperature and relative humidity for the synergistic method is reduced by 0.13–1.5 K and 2.7–4.4% at 500 hPa, and 0.13–2.1 K and 2.5–7.2% at 900 hPa. Moreover, the forecast index (FI) calculated from the retrieval results shows reasonable consistency with the FIs calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and from radiosonde data.

This Review synthesizes estimates of past and future OHC changes using observations and models. The top 2,000 m of the global ocean has significantly warmed since the 1950s, gaining 351 ± 59.8 ZJ (1 ZJ = 10<sup>21</sup>J) from 1958 to 2019. The rate of warming increased from <5 to ~10 ZJ yr<sup>–1</sup> from the 1960s to the 2010s. Observed area-averaged warming is largest in the Atlantic Ocean and southern oceans at 1.42 ± 0.09 and 1.40 ± 0.09 × 109 J m<sup>–2</sup>, respectively, for the upper 2,000 m over 1958–2019. These observed patterns of heat gains are dominated by heat redistribution. Observationally constrained projections suggest that historic ocean warming is irreversible this century, with net warming dependent on the emission scenario. By 2100, projected warming in the top 2,000 m is 2–6 times that observed so far, ranging from 1,030 [839–1,228] ZJ for a low-emission scenario to 1,874 [1,637–2,109] ZJ for a high-emission scenario. The Pacific is projected to be the largest heat reservoir owing to its size, but area-averaged warming remains strongest in the Atlantic and southern oceans. Ocean warming has extensive impacts that pose risks to marine ecosystems and society. Here, the projected changes necessitate a continuation and improvement of observations and models, along with better uncertainty estimation.","Springer Nature","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-10-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Reviews Earth & Environment; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 776-794","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 2662-138X","10.1038/s43017-022-00345-1","","2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","1903572","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1903572","","Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","11","3"

While changes in hurricane intensification and environment have been examined at basin scales previously, near-coastal changes have not been adequately explored. In this study, we address this using a suite of observations and climate model simulations. Over the 40-year period of 1979–2018, the mean 24-hr hurricane intensification rate increased by ~1.2 kt 6-hr<sup>–1</sup> near the US Atlantic coast. However, a significant increase in intensification did not occur near the Gulf coast over the same period. The enhanced hurricane intensification along the Atlantic coast is consistent with an increasingly favorable dynamic and thermodynamic environment there, which is well simulated by climate models over the historical period. Further, multi-model projections suggest a continued enhancement of the storm environment and hurricane intensification near the Atlantic coast in the future.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The retrieval uncertainty is 0.01 + 5%AOD, and the mean bias is approximately -2%. In an application to satellite observations, aerosol hygroscopic growth due to humidification near clouds enhances AOD by 100% in regions within 1 km of cloud edges. The humidification effect leads to an overall 55% increase in the clear-sky aerosol direct radiative effect. Although this increase is based on a case study, it highlights the importance of aerosol retrievals in near-cloud regions, and the need to incorporate the humidification effect in radiative forcing estimates.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Improving flood hazard projections has the potential to inform the design and implementation of flood risk management strategies. Current flood hazard projections are uncertain, especially due to uncertain model parameters. Calibration methods use observations to quantify model parameter uncertainty. With limited computational resources, researchers typically calibrate models using either relatively few expensive model runs at high spatial resolutions or many cheaper runs at lower spatial resolutions. This leads to an open question: is it possible to effectively combine information from the high and low resolution model runs? We propose a Bayesian emulation–calibration approach that assimilates model outputs and observations at multiple resolutions. As a case study for a riverine community in Pennsylvania, we demonstrate our approach using the LISFLOOD-FP flood hazard model. Here, the multiresolution approach results in improved parameter inference over the single resolution approach in multiple scenarios. Results vary based on the parameter values and the number of available models runs. Our method is general and can be used to calibrate other high dimensional computer models to improve projections.","Wiley","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-10-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EnvironMetrics (London); Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 2; Related Information: PDF of open source manuscript available at: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/env.2769","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e2769","","","SC0016162; SC0022141; DE‐SC0016162; DE‐SC0022141","Journal ID: ISSN 1180-4009","10.1002/env.2769","","2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","1901593","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1901593","","EnvironMetrics (London)","2","34"

Wildfire impact on severe storms and weather hazards is another pathway that threatens society, and our understanding of which is very limited. Here, we use unique modeling developments to explore the effects of wildfires in the western US (mainly California and Oregon) on precipitation and hail in the central US. We find that the western US wildfires notably increase the occurrences of heavy precipitation rates by 38% and significant severe hail (≥2 in.) by 34% in the central United States. Both heat and aerosols from wildfires play an important role. By enhancing surface high pressure and increasing westerly and southwesterly winds, wildfires in the western United States produce ( <xref ref-type='bibr'>1</xref> ) stronger moisture and aerosol transport to the central United States and ( <xref ref-type='bibr'>2</xref> ) larger wind shear and storm-relative helicity in the central United States. Both the meteorological environment more conducive to severe convective storms and increased aerosols contribute to the enhancements of heavy precipitation rates and large hail. Moreover, the local wildfires in the central US also enhance the severity of storms, but their impact is notably smaller than the impact of remote wildfires in California and Oregon because of the lessened severity of the local wildfires. As wildfires are projected to be more frequent and severe in a warmer climate, the influence of wildfires on severe weather in downwind regions may become increasingly important. </p>","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A climate model sensitivity experiment is used to identify a new mechanism involving a warm season circumglobal atmospheric teleconnection pattern that spread heat extremes over far-flung areas of the Northern Hemisphere arising from the intense heating over the desiccated Great Plains themselves. It has only been in the twenty-first century that human populations in these regions of the Northern Hemisphere have experienced heat extremes comparable to the 1930s. This demonstrates that humans influenced Northern Hemisphere temperature and heat extremes through disastrous and unprecedented regional land use practices over the Great Plains, and points to the possibility that future intense regional droughts could affect heat extremes on hemispheric scales.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Recently, the prominent global greening trend has inspired considerable interest in examining climate feedbacks to vegetation changes. However, the impacts of recent widespread vegetation cover changes on soil temperature have been less documented and have received insufficient attention. Here, a high-resolution regional climate model was used to examine the potential impact of vegetation cover changes over the past 37 years, obtained as satellite observational data, on regional air and soil temperatures across the Heilong-Amur River Basin. Our sensitivity experiments indicated that the 1.85% increase in the regional fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from 1982 to 2018 cooled the air temperature by 0.045°C and the soil temperature by 0.19°C and that this cooling effect would continue in the near future, from 2016-2018 to 2051-2053. We found that soil temperatures were more sensitive to vegetation cover changes than air temperatures, particularly in mid-high latitude forest ecosystems; this finding helps to explain the nonsignificant decrease in soil temperatures in forest ecosystems over the past 40 years detected in the ERA5-Land reanalysis. Further, our results also suggest that vegetation restoration in forest ecosystems could mitigate the effects of climate change on permafrost environments by increasing the number of soil freezing days.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Rivers and river habitats around the world are under sustained pressure from human activities and the changing global environment. Our ability to quantify and manage the river states in a timely manner is critical for protecting the public safety and natural resources. In recent years, vector-based river network models have enabled modeling of large river basins at increasingly fine resolutions, but are computationally demanding. This work presents a multistage, physics-guided, graph neural network (GNN) approach for basin-scale river network learning and streamflow forecasting. During training, we train a GNN model to approximate outputs of a high-resolution vector-based river network model; we then fine-tune the pretrained GNN model with streamflow observations. We further apply a graph-based, data-fusion step to correct prediction biases. The GNN-based framework is first demonstrated over a snow-dominated watershed in the western United States. A series of experiments are performed to test different training and imputation strategies. Results show that the trained GNN model can effectively serve as a surrogate of the process-based model with high accuracy, with median Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.97. Application of the graph-based data fusion further reduces mismatch between the GNN model and observations, with as much as 50 % KGE improvement over some cross-validation gages. To improve scalability, a graph-coarsening procedure is introduced and is demonstrated over a much larger basin. Results show that graph coarsening achieves comparable prediction skills at only a fraction of training cost, thus providing important insights into the degree of physical realism needed for developing large-scale GNN-based river network models.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We demonstrate that ultrafast laser filament-induced fluorescence of chlorophyll in the green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is a promising method for remote, in-field detection of stress from exposure to nuclear materials. This method holds an advantage over broad-area surveillance, such as solar-induced fluorescence monitoring, when targeting excitation of a specific plant would improve the detectability, for example when local biota density is low. After exposing <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to uranium, we find that the concentration of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime, and carotenoid content increase. The increased fluorescence lifetime signifies a decrease in non-photochemical quenching. The simultaneous increase in carotenoid content implies oxidative stress, further confirmed by the production of radical oxygen species evidence in the steady-state absorption spectrum. This is potentially a unique signature of uranium, as previous work finds that heavy metal stress generally increases non-photochemical quenching.

Here, we present recent developments using atom probe tomography (APT) enabling direct visualization of nanoscale fluid inclusions trapped within pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and thereby chemical characterization of remnant seawater. Pyrite framboids (spherical clusters of nanocrystals) were sampled from the Middle Devonian Leicester Pyrite Member (New York). Scanning transmission electron microscopy shows low density regions distributed within the pyrite consistent with nanoscale pores (<4 nm in size). APT 3D visualization and compositional mapping reveals that the nanopores are filled with water. The inclusions appear to preserve the elemental signature of the water column in which the framboids formed, specifically seawater components including Na, K, Mg, and Ca. Mg/Ca ratios within the pyrite were generally measured to be within 0.6±0.2 – consistent with calcite-dominated seawater conditions existing in the Middle Devonian. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the potential for a novel approach to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions from coupled elemental and structural analyses of nanoscale fluid inclusions.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Instead of having a comprehensive review of existing microphysical parameterizations that have been developed over the years, this study concentrates purposely on several topics that we believe, are understudied, but hold great potentials for further advancing bulk microphysics parameterizations: multi-moment bulk microphysics parameterizations and the role of the spectral shape of hydrometeor size distributions; discrete vs ""continuous"" representation of hydrometeor types; turbulence-microphysics interactions including turbulent entrainment-mixing processes and stochastic condensation; theoretical foundations for the mathematical expressions used to describe hydrometeor size distributions and hydrometeor morphology; and approaches for developing bulk microphysics parameterizations. Also presented are the spectral bin scheme and particle-based scheme (esp., super-droplet method) for representing explicit microphysics. Their advantages and disadvantages are elucidated for constructing cloud models with detailed microphysics that are essential to developing processes understanding and bulk microphysics parameterizations.

We used representative remote sensing algorithms across terrestrial and aquatic study domains to inform aspects of mission design that are most important for impacting accuracy in each scientific area. We simulated the propagation of uncertainties in the retrieval process including the effects of different instrument configuration choices. We found that retrieval accuracy and information content degrade consistently at >10 nm spectral resolution, >30 m spatial resolution, and >8 day revisit.

Despite remarkable advances in fire modeling and weather forecasting, it remains challenging to anticipate catastrophic wildfire events and associated damage. One key missing component is a fire weather prediction system with sufficiently long lead time capable of providing useful regional details. Here, we develop a hybrid prediction model of wildfire danger called CFS with super resolution (CFS-SR) as a proof of concept to fill that void. The CFS-SR model is constructed by integrating the Climate Forecast System version 2 with a deep learning technique from Single Image Super Resolution, a method widely used in enhancing image resolution. We show that for the 2018-2019 fire season, the CFS-SR model significantly improves accuracy in forecasting fire weather at lead times of up to 7 days with an enhanced spatial resolution up to 4 km. This level of high resolution provides county-level fire weather forecast, making it more practical for allocating resources to mitigate wildfire danger. Our study demonstrates that a proper combination of ensemble climate predictions with deep learning techniques can boost predictability at finer spatial scales, increasing the utility of fire weather forecasts for practical applications.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Such changes are expected to influence microbes, nutrients, and the fate of C in tropical forest soils. To explore this, we assessed soil microbial biomass, potential extracellular enzyme activities, and nutrient availability in a partial throughfall exclusion experiment in four seasonal lowland tropical humid forests in Panama with wide variation in precipitation and soil fertility. We hypothesized that throughfall exclusion would reduce microbial biomass and activity and accentuate dry season soil nutrient accumulation, with larger effects in wetter, less droughtresistant forests. We observed a baseline seasonal pattern of decreased microbial biomass and increased extractable dissolved organic C (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>), and resinextractable phosphorus (P) in the dry season, with the strongest patterns for nitrogen (N). However, potential enzyme activities showed no consistent seasonality. In line with seasonal drying, throughfall exclusion decreased soil microbial biomass in the wet season and increased TDN and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, especially in the dry season. In contrast to seasonal drying, throughfall exclusion decreased DOC and did not affect resinextractable P, but slightly decreased potential phosphatase activities. Potential enzyme activities varied among sites and sampling times, but did not explain much variation in microbial biomass or substrate availability. We conclude that reduced rainfall in tropical forests might accentuate some dry season patterns, like reductions in microbial biomass and accumulation of extractable nutrients. However, our data also suggest new patterns, like reduced inputs of DOC to soils with drying, which could have cascading effects on soil ecological function and C storage.","Springer","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-10-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biogeochemistry; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 227-250","","","SC0020669; SC0015898","Journal ID: ISSN 0168-2563","10.1007/s10533-022-00980-2","","2023-02-20T00:00:00Z","1924485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1924485","","Biogeochemistry","2","161"

Aerosol has been shown to delay the Sc breakup by postponing the onset of precipitation, however its climatic effect is uncertain. Here we introduce a new approach that allows us to re-cast currently observed cloud cover and albedo to their counterfactual cleaner world, enabling the first estimate of the radiative effect due to delayed cloud breakup. Using simple radiative approximation, the radiative forcing with respect to pre-industrial times due to delayed Sc breakup is -0.39 W m-2. The radiative effect changes nearly linearly with aerosol due to the droplet concentration control on the cloud cover, suggesting a potentially accelerated warming if the current trend of reduction in aerosol emissions continues.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

We performed a numerical simulation of air quality using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to calculate the NO<sub>2</sub> column density required for the inverse modeling.

The accuracy of the constrained NO<sub>x</sub> emissions using mass balance–based inversions in South Korea was the highest in the summer due to the minimized smearing effects, and the 9 km resolution modeling was the most efficient for inverse modeling of the region. In addition, the results of inverse modeling varied depending on the regridding methods, implying the importance of using a suitable regridding method and modeling resolution.

"Evaluating simplifications of subsurface process representations for field-scale permafrost hydrology models","Gao, Bo (ORCID:000000015405423X); Coon, Ethan T. (ORCID:0000000181249622)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Permafrost degradation within a warming climate poses a significant environmental threat through both the permafrost carbon feedback and damage to human communities and infrastructure. Understanding this threat relies on better understanding and numerical representation of thermo-hydrological permafrost processes and the subsequent accurate prediction of permafrost dynamics. All models include simplified assumptions, implying a tradeoff between model complexity and prediction accuracy. The main purpose of this work is to investigate this tradeoff when applying the following commonly made assumptions: (1) assuming equal density of ice and liquid water in frozen soil, (2) neglecting the effect of cryosuction in unsaturated freezing soil, and (3) neglecting advective heat transport during soil freezing and thaw. This study designed a set of 62 numerical experiments using the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS v1.2) to evaluate the effects of these choices on permafrost hydrological outputs, including both integrated and pointwise quantities. Simulations were conducted under different climate conditions and soil properties from three different sites in both column- and hillslope-scale configurations. Results showed that amongst the three physical assumptions, soil cryosuction is the most crucial yet commonly ignored process. Neglecting cryosuction, on average, can cause 10 %–20 % error in predicting evaporation, 50 %–60 % error in discharge, 10 %–30 % error in thaw depth, and 10 %–30 % error in soil temperature at 1 m beneath the surface. The prediction error for subsurface temperature and water saturation is more obvious at hillslope scales due to the presence of lateral flux. By comparison, using equal ice–liquid density has a minor impact on most hydrological metrics of interest but significantly affects soil water saturation with an averaged 5 %–15 % error. Neglecting advective heat transport presents the least error, 5 % or even much lower, in most metrics of interest for a large-scale Arctic tundra system without apparent influence caused by localized groundwater flow, and it can decrease the simulation time at hillslope scales by 40 %–80 %. By challenging these commonly made assumptions, this work provides permafrost hydrology scientists an important context for understanding the underlying physical processes, including allowing modelers to better choose the appropriate process representation for a given modeling experiment.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Arctic rain on snow (ROS) deposits liquid water onto existing snowpacks. Upon refreezing, this can form icy crusts at the surface or within the snowpack. By altering radar backscatter and microwave emissivity, ROS over sea ice can influence the accuracy of sea ice variables retrieved from satellite radar altimetry, scatterometers, and passive microwave radiometers. During the Arctic Ocean MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition, there was an unprecedented opportunity to observe a ROS event using in situ active and passive microwave instruments similar to those deployed on satellite platforms. During liquid water accumulation in the snowpack from rain and increased melt, there was a 4-fold decrease in radar energy returned at Ku- and Ka-bands. After the snowpack refroze and ice layers formed, this decrease was followed by a 6-fold increase in returned energy. Besides altering the radar backscatter, analysis of the returned waveforms shows the waveform shape changed in response to rain and refreezing. Microwave emissivity at 19 and 89 GHz increased with increasing liquid water content and decreased as the snowpack refroze, yet subsequent ice layers altered the polarization difference. Corresponding analysis of the CryoSat-2 waveform shape and backscatter as well as AMSR2 brightness temperatures further shows that the rain and refreeze were significant enough to impact satellite returns. Our analysis provides the first detailed in situ analysis of the impacts of ROS and subsequent refreezing on both active and passive microwave observations, providing important baseline knowledge for detecting ROS over sea ice and assessing their impacts on satellite-derived sea ice variables.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

It is based on the calculation of reflectivity texture—a combination of the intensity and the heterogeneity of the radar echoes on each horizontal plane in a 3D Cartesian volume. Reflectivity texture is translated into convectivity, which is designed to be a quantitative measure of the convective nature of each 3D radar grid point. It ranges from 0 (100% stratiform) to 1 (100% convective). By thresholding convectivity, a more traditional qualitative categorization is obtained, which classifies radar echoes as convective, mixed, or stratiform. In contrast to previous algorithms, these echo-type classifications are provided on the full 3D grid of the reflectivity field. The vertically resolved classifications, in combination with temperature data, allow for subclassifications into shallow, mid-, deep, and elevated convective features, and low, mid-, and high stratiform regions—again in three dimensions. The algorithm was validated using datasets collected over the U.S. Great Plains during the PECAN field campaign. An analysis of lightning counts shows ~90% of lightning occurring in regions classified as convective by ECCO. A statistical comparison of ECCO echo types with the well-established GPM radar precipitation-type categories show 84% (88%) of GPM stratiform (convective) echo being classified as stratiform (convective) or mixed by ECCO. ECCO was applied to radar grids for the continental United States, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, and Europe, illustrating its robustness and adaptability to different radar grid characteristics and climatic regions.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Natural colloids facilitated transport of steroidal estrogens in saturated porous media: Mechanism and processes","Wang, Yuanyuan; Zhong, Lirong; Song, Xiaoming; Adeel, Muhammad; Yang, Yuesuo","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; estrogens; colloids; transport; saturated porous media; column test; groundwater","Steroid estrogens (SEs) are widely distributed in terrestrial environment, whilst the transport of SEs in groundwater is not well understood. Specifically, the effects of ubiquitous natural colloids on the SEs transport are unclear. Here, the influence of inorganic colloids (i.e. silica and illite) and organic colloids, i.e. Humic acid (HA), on the transport of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) in saturated porous media were studied in laboratory scale column experiments. Characterization on the colloids and the column packing material was conducted to provide bases for the interpretation of column test findings. Results showed that the transport of SEs was facilitated by the nature colloids that were migrating through the saturated porous media. About 38.5% of E1 and 24.6% of E2 were retained in the column when colloids were absent in the system. Further, when transporting with silica colloids, illite colloids, and HA colloids, the transport of E1 was enhanced by 15.64%, 11.17%, and 25.60%, respectively; whilst the transport of E2 was improved by 19.56%, 23.06%, and 36.40%, respectively. The colloids’ SEs transport enhancement depended not only on the mobility of the colloids but also on their geochemical characteristics. The tested organic colloids showed 1.5-2.5 times greater ability on promoting the transport of SEs than the inorganic ones. The proposed mechanisms of nature colloids facilitated transport of SEs include competing for adsorption sites on the sand surfaces by the colloids resulting mobilization of adsorbed SEs from solid matrix, and transport of colloids as carriers for SEs.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Benchmarking Simulated Precipitation Variability Amplitude across Time Scales","Ahn, Min-Seop; Gleckler, Peter J.; Lee, Jiwoo; Pendergrass, Angeline G.; Jakob, Christian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Here, objective performance metrics that measure precipitation variability across time scales from subdaily to interannual are presented and applied to Historical simulations of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) models. Three satellite-based precipitation estimates (IMERG, TRMM, and CMORPH) are used as reference data. We apply two independent methods to estimate temporal variability of precipitation and compare the consistency in their results. The first method is derived from power spectra analysis of 3-hourly precipitation, measuring forced variability by solar insolation (diurnal and annual cycles) and internal variability at different time scales (subdaily, synoptic, subseasonal, seasonal, and interannual). The second method is based on time averaging and facilitates estimating the seasonality of subdaily variability. Supporting the robustness of our metric, we find a near equivalence between the results obtained from the two methods when examining simulated-to-observed ratios over large domains (global, tropics, extratropics, land, or ocean). Additionally, we demonstrate that our model evaluation is not very sensitive to the discrepancies between observations. Our results reveal that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in general overestimate the forced variability while they underestimate the internal variability, especially in the tropical ocean and higher-frequency variability. The underestimation of subdaily variability is consistent across different seasons. The internal variability is overall improved in CMIP6, but remains underestimated, and there is little evidence of improvement in forced variability. Increased horizontal resolution results in some improvement of internal variability at subdaily and synoptic time scales, but not at longer time scales.","American Meteorological Society","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Nitrate Controls on the Extent and Type of Metal Retention in Fine-Grained Sediments of a Simulated Aquifer","Engel, Maya; Noël, Vincent; Kukkadapu, Ravi K.; Boye, Kristin E.; Bargar, John R.; Fendorf, Scott","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Contaminant transport; Element cycling; Interface; X-ray absorption spectroscopy; Metal attenuation","Aquifer groundwater quality is largely controlled by sediment composition and physical heterogeneity, which commonly sustain a unique redox gradient pattern. Attenuation of heavy metals within these heterogeneous aquifers is reliant on multiple factors, including redox conditions, and redox-active species that can further influence biogeochemical cycling. Here, we simulated an alluvial aquifer system using columns filled with natural coarse-grained sediments and two domains of fine-grained sediment lenses. Our goal was to examine heavy metal (Ni and Zn) attenuation within a complex aquifer network and further explore nitrate-rich groundwater conditions. The fine-grained sediment lenses sustained reducing conditions and served as a sink for Ni sequestration – in the form of Ni-silicates, Ni-organic matter, and a dominant Ni-sulfide phase. Further, the silicate clay and sulfide pools were also important retention mechanisms for Zn; however, Ni was associated more extensively with organic matter compared to Zn that formed layered double hydroxides. Nitrate-rich conditions promoted denitrification within the lenses that was coupled to the oxidation of Fe(II) and the concomitant precipitation of an Fe(III) phase with higher structural distortion. A decreased metal sulfide pool also resulted, where nitrate-rich conditions generated in an average 20% decrease in solid phase Ni, Zn, and Fe. Ultimately, nitrate plays a significant role in the aquifer’s biogeochemical cycling and capacity to retain heavy metals.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Extracted soil iron positively correlated with in situ abiotic N<sub>2</sub>O production determined by isotopic tracers. Moreover, we found that microbial N<sub>2</sub>O reduction accompanied abiotic production, essentially closing a coupled abiotic-biotic N<sub>2</sub>O cycle. Anaerobic N<sub>2</sub>O consumption occurred ubiquitously (pH 6.4–3.7), with proportions of diverse clade II N<sub>2</sub>O reducers increasing with consumption rates. Our findings show that denitrification in tropical peat soils is not a purely biological process but rather a ‘mosaic’ of abiotic and biotic reduction reactions.

One consequence of flooding events such as this is outbreaks of vector borne diseases (VBDs) which are often associated with climate anomalies. In this study, data from the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) mission is used with other soil moisture and precipitation data to show that the 2020 Sahelian growing season was the most extreme over the past four decades, ranking first in seasonally accumulated precipitation, which on average exceeded the climatology by around 300 mm. VBD outbreaks of Rift Valley fever and Chikungunya followed in Mauritania/Senegal and Chad, respectively. In some cases, soil moisture is a better indicator of VBD outbreak risk than precipitation, which has so far been more commonly used in studies of VBD outbreaks. It is expected that this finding will inform future monitoring and prediction efforts for VBD risk.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, long-term trends of impacts of global gasoline and diesel emissions on air quality and human health are not clear. In this study, we employ the Community Earth System Model in conjunction with the newly developed Community Emissions Data System as anthropogenic emission inventory to quantify the long-term trends of impacts of global gasoline and diesel emissions on ambient air quality and human health for the period of 2000–2015. Global gasoline and diesel emissions contributed to regional increases in annual mean surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm) concentrations by up to 17.5 and 13.7 µg m<sup>–3</sup>, and surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations by up to 7.1 and 7.2 ppbv, respectively, for 2000–2015. However, we also found substantial declines of surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations over Europe, the US, Canada, and China for the same period, which suggested the co-benefits of air quality and human health from improving gasoline and diesel fuel quality and tightening vehicle emissions standards. Globally, we estimate the mean annual total PM<sub>2.5-</sub> and O<sub>3</sub>-induced premature deaths are 139 700–170 700 for gasoline and 205 200–309 300 for diesel, with the corresponding years of life lost of 2.74–3.47 and 4.56–6.52 million years, respectively. Diesel and gasoline emissions create health-effect disparities between the developed and developing countries, which are likely to aggravate afterwards.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Building on the previously established concepts in GCMs evaluation frameworks, we develop a weighted averaging technique to remove the redundancy in the evaluation criteria and rank 37 GCMs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project over the contiguous United States. GCMs are rated based on their average performance across 66 evaluation measures in the historical period (1981–2014) after each metric is weighted between zero and one, depending on its uniqueness. The robustness of the outcome is tested by repeating the process with the empirical orthogonal function analysis in which each GCM is ranked based on its sum of distances from the reference in the principal component space. The two methodologies work in contrasting ways to remove the metrics redundancy but eventually develop similar GCMs rankings. A disparity in GCMs' behavior related to their sensitivity to the size of the evaluation suite is observed, highlighting the need for comprehensive multi-variable GCMs evaluation at varying timescales for determining their skillfulness over a region. The sub-selection goal is to use a representative set of skillful models over the region of interest without substantial overlap in their future climate responses and modeling errors in representing historical climate. Additional analyses of GCMs' independence and spread in their future projections provide the necessary information to objectively select GCMs while keeping all aspects of necessity in view.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Invisible ship tracks show large cloud sensitivity to aerosol","Manshausen, Peter; Watson-Parris, Duncan; Christensen, Matthew W.; Jalkanen, Jukka-Pekka; Stier, Philip","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric science; climate change","Cloud reflectivity is sensitive to atmospheric aerosol concentrations because aerosols provide the condensation nuclei on which water condenses. Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper describes the University of New Hampshire Water Balance Model, WBM, a process-based gridded global hydrologic model that simulates the land surface components of the global water cycle and includes water extraction for use in agriculture and domestic sectors. The WBM was first published in 1989; here, we describe the first fully open-source WBM version (v.1.0.0). Earlier descriptions of WBM methods provide the foundation for the most recent model version that is detailed here. We present an overview of the model functionality, utility, and evaluation of simulated global river discharge and irrigation water use. This new version adds a novel suite of water source tracking modules that enable the analysis of flow-path histories on water supply. A key feature of WBM v.1.0.0 is the ability to identify the partitioning of sources for each stock or flux within the model. Three different categories of tracking are available: (1) primary inputs of water to the surface of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle (liquid precipitation, snowmelt, glacier melt, and unsustainable groundwater); (2) water that has been extracted for human use and returned to the terrestrial hydrologic system; and (3) runoff originating from user-defined spatial land units. Such component tracking provides a more fully transparent model in that users can identify the underlying mechanisms generating the simulated behavior. We find that WBM v.1.0.0 simulates global river discharge and irrigation water withdrawals well, even with default parameter settings, and for the first time, we are able to show how the simulation arrives at these fluxes by using the novel tracking functions.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Univ. of New Hampshire, Durham, NH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences; Division of Social and Economic Sciences; Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems; Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences; NH EPSCoR New England Sustainability Consortium; NH EPSCoR Ecosystems and Society; Plum Island Long Term Ecological Research; The National Aeronautical and Space Administration, Earth Science Division's High Mountain Asia program; Earth Science Division's Sea Level Change program; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Swedish funding agency Formas","","Germany","2022-10-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geoscientific Model Development (Online) Journal Volume: 15 Journal Issue: 19","","Medium: X; Size: p. 7287-7323","","","SC0022141; SC0016162; SC005171; 1038818; 1639524; 1855937; 1114851; EPS-1330641; EPS-1101245; OCE-1637630; NNX17AB28G; 80NSSC20K1595; 80NSSC20K1296; R836169; 2017-00,608","Journal ID: ISSN 1991-9603","10.5194/gmd-15-7287-2022","","2022-10-06T00:00:00Z","1891044","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1891044","","Geoscientific Model Development (Online)","19","15"

However, the electron transfer processes that underpin photoreductive dissolution at particle/organic/solution interfaces occur on ultrafast timescales and thus remain difficult to probe. In this work, we report an ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) study of suspensions of hematite nanoplatelets (HNPs) sensitized by adsorbed rhodamine B (RhB) dye as a function of solution media and pH. The TAS results indicate a substantially longer fluorescence lifetime of RhB adsorbed on HNPs across a wide range of pH conditions, consistent with transient photoinduced electron transfer to the oxide with recombination kinetics controlled by electron migration back to the interface via small polaron hopping. Normalization of the observed kinetics to the measured surface loading of RhB at different pH values shows that the recombination rates are insensitive to environmental variables, likely controlled instead by particle properties that determine small polaron diffusion behavior.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Substantial influence of vapour buoyancy on tropospheric air temperature and subtropical cloud","Yang, Da; Zhou, Wenyu; Seidel, Seth D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric dynamics; climate and Earth system modelling","The molar mass of water vapor is less than that of dry air, making humid air lighter than dry air at the same temperature and pressure. This effect is known as vapor buoyancy and has been considered negligibly small in large-scale climate dynamics. Here we use theory, reanalysis data, and a hierarchy of climate models to show that vapor buoyancy has a similar magnitude to thermal buoyancy in the tropical free troposphere. We further show that vapor buoyancy makes cold air rise and increases subtropical stratiform low clouds by up to 70% of its climatological value. However, some widely used climate models fail to represent vapor buoyancy in the governing equations. Further, this flaw leads to inaccurate simulations of cloud distributions—the largest uncertainty in predicting climate change.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This cooling due to sulfate aerosol offsets some of the warming effect of greenhouse gasses and is the largest uncertainty in determining the change in the Earth’s radiative balance by human activity. Ship tracks—the visible manifestation of the indirect of effect of ship emissions on clouds as quasi-linear features—have long provided an opportunity to quantify these effects. However, they have been arduous to catalog and typically studied only in particular regions for short periods of time. Using a machine-learning algorithm to automate their detection we catalog more than 1 million ship tracks to provide a global climatology. We use this to investigate the effect of stringent fuel regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organization in 2020 on their global prevalence since then, while accounting for the disruption in global commerce caused by COVID-19. We find a marked, but clearly nonlinear, decline in ship tracks globally: An 80% reduction in SO<sub>x</sub> emissions causes only a 25% reduction in the number of tracks detected.","National Academy of Sciences","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The example problem setting we consider consists of predicting natural variability of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature on the interannual timescale in the pre-industrial control simulation of the Community Earth System Model. While previous works have considered the use of recurrent networks such as convolutional LSTMs and reservoir computing networks in this and other similar problem settings, we currently focus on the use of feedforward convolutional networks. In particular, we find that a feedforward convolutional network with a Densenet architecture is able to outperform a convolutional LSTM in terms of predictive skill. Next, we go on to consider a probabilistic formulation of the same network based on Stein variational gradient descent and find that in addition to providing useful measures of predictive uncertainty, the probabilistic (Bayesian) version improves on its deterministic counterpart in terms of predictive skill. Finally, we characterize the reliability of the ensemble of machine learning models obtained in the probabilistic setting by using analysis tools developed in the context of ensemble numerical weather prediction.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Modeling Spatial Distribution of Snow Water Equivalent by Combining Meteorological and Satellite Data with Lidar Maps","Mital, Utkarsh; Dwivedi, Dipankar; Özgen-Xian, Ilhan; Brown, James B.; Steefel, Carl I.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Machine Learning; Random Forests; Snow Water Equivalent; Upper Colorado","<title>Abstract</title> <p> An accurate characterization of the water content of snowpack, or snow water equivalent (SWE), is necessary to quantify water availability and constrain hydrologic and land surface models. Recently, airborne observations (e.g., lidar) have emerged as a promising method to accurately quantify SWE at high resolutions (scales of ∼100 m and finer). However, the frequency of these observations is very low, typically once or twice per season in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Here, we present a machine learning framework that is based on random forests to model temporally sparse lidar-derived SWE, enabling estimation of SWE at unmapped time points. We approximated the physical processes governing snow accumulation and melt as well as snow characteristics by obtaining 15 different variables from gridded estimates of precipitation, temperature, surface reflectance, elevation, and canopy. Results showed that, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, our framework is capable of modeling SWE with a higher accuracy when compared with estimates generated by the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). The mean value of the coefficient of determination <italic>R</italic> <sup>2</sup> using our approach was 0.57, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 13 cm, which was a significant improvement over SNODAS (mean <italic>R</italic> <sup>2</sup> = 0.13; RMSE = 20 cm). We explored the relative importance of the input variables and observed that, at the spatial resolution of 800 m, meteorological variables are more important drivers of predictive accuracy than surface variables that characterize the properties of snow on the ground. This research provides a framework to expand the applicability of lidar-derived SWE to unmapped time points. </p> <sec> <title>Significance Statement</title> <p>Snowpack is the main source of freshwater for close to 2 billion people globally and needs to be estimated accurately. Mountainous snowpack is highly variable and is challenging to quantify. Recently, lidar technology has been employed to observe snow in great detail, but it is costly and can only be used sparingly. To counter that, we use machine learning to estimate snowpack when lidar data are not available. We approximate the processes that govern snowpack by incorporating meteorological and satellite data. We found that variables associated with precipitation and temperature have more predictive power than variables that characterize snowpack properties. Our work helps to improve snowpack estimation, which is critical for sustainable management of water resources.</p> </sec>","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Contrasting Climatic Trends of Atmospheric River Occurrences Over East Asia","Wang, Qiang; Yang, Long; Yang, Yixin; Chen, Xiaodong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are increasingly recognized as a major driver of hydrological cycles, and are projected to increase around the world under a changing climate. However, the long-term trends of ARs over East Asia (EA) remains less elucidated. Here we fill the gap by developing a longest-ever archive of EA ARs, and examine its role in determining spatiotemporal precipitation variability over EA. We find contrasting changes in AR occurrences, with more frequent ARs in low latitudes but less in high latitudes during the period 1950-2020. The “dipole” pattern of decadal changes in AR occurrences is dictated by atmospheric dynamics (i.e., winds) in the north but thermodynamics (i.e., moisture) in the south. The reduced AR occurrences explain 49% of decreased annual precipitation in northern China, while more AR-related precipitation is observed in southern China. Furthermore, our results provide new insights into regional hydroclimate over EA by connecting it with large-scale weather systems.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluating Tropical Precipitation Relations in CMIP6 Models with ARM Data","Emmenegger, Todd; Kuo, Yi-Hung; Xie, Shaocheng; Zhang, Chengzhu; Tao, Cheng; Neelin, J. David","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atmosphere; Convection; Convective clouds; Precipitation; Climate models; Clouds","<title>Abstract</title> <p>A set of diagnostics based on simple, statistical relationships between precipitation and the thermodynamic environment in observations is implemented to assess phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) model behavior with respect to precipitation. Observational data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) permanent field observational sites are augmented with satellite observations of precipitation and temperature as an observational baseline. A robust relationship across observational datasets between column water vapor (CWV) and precipitation, in which conditionally averaged precipitation exhibits a sharp pickup at some critical CWV value, provides a useful convective onset diagnostic for climate model comparison. While a few models reproduce an appropriate precipitation pickup, most models begin their pickup at too low CWV and the increase in precipitation with increasing CWV is too weak. Convective transition statistics compiled in column relative humidity (CRH) partially compensate for model temperature biases—although imperfectly since the temperature dependence is more complex than that of column saturation. Significant errors remain in individual models and weak pickups are generally not improved. The conditional-average precipitation as a function of CRH can be decomposed into the product of the probability of raining and mean precipitation during raining times (conditional intensity). The pickup behavior is primarily dependent on the probability of raining near the transition and on the conditional intensity at higher CRH. Most models roughly capture the CRH dependence of these two factors. However, compensating biases often occur: model conditional intensity that is too low at a given CRH is compensated in part by excessive probability of precipitation.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The impact of assimilating targeted UAS observations in addition to surface observations was compared to that obtained when assimilating surface observations alone using observing system experiments (OSEs) for a terrain-driven flow case and a convection initiation (CI) case observed within Colorado’s San Luis Valley (SLV). The assimilation of UAS observations in addition to surface observations results in a clear increase in skill for both flow regimes over that obtained when assimilating surface observations alone. For the terrain-driven flow case, the UAS observations improved the representation of thermal stratification across the northern SLV, which produced stronger upvalley flow over the eastern half of the SLV that better matched the observations. For the CI case, the UAS observations improved the representation of the pre-convective environment by reducing dry biases across the SLV and over the surrounding terrain. This led to earlier CI and more organized convection over the foothills that spilled outflows into the SLV, ultimately helping to increase low-level convergence and CI there. In addition, the importance of UAS capturing an outflow that originated over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and triggered CI is discussed. These outflows and subsequent CI were not well captured in the simulation that assimilated surface observations alone. We report that observations obtained with a fleet of UAS are shown to notably improve high-resolution analyses and short-term predictions of two very different mesogamma-scale weather events.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous in-situ and remote sensing studies have found typhoons can enhance phytoplankton biomass and induce blooms in this region. However, the mechanistic links between phytoplankton blooms and typhoons have not been well elucidated due to the interplay of multiple processes along the land-ocean-atmosphere interfaces. Unravelling these interactions will have to rely on an integrated modelling system. In this work, we constructed a realistic, 3-dimensional, land-ocean-atmosphere modelling system with the marine ecosystem and sediment components for the China Great Bay Area. By using the integrated modelling system, we quantitatively investigated phytoplankton response to hydrological conditions variations under Typhoon Hato (2017), a strong typhoon case. Passive tracer experiments showed that with high river discharge induced by heavy rainfall, the residence time of Lingding Bay is as short as 15-day, less than half of that under the climatological discharge. The increase in freshwater pulse washed out the phytoplankton biomass within Lingding Bay. While for the offshore region, the source and sink terms analysis showed that the increase of phytoplankton biomass in the first week was because of the uplift of nutrient-rich subsurface water, while in the second week was because of the seaward propagated nearshore high phytoplankton biomass water. While riverine nutrients support phytoplankton growth in the third week, a large part of phytoplankton biomass was lost to zooplankton grazing, showing the system shifted from the bottom-up control to the top-down control.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We use aircraft data from the FIREX-AQ campaign to evaluate differences in evolving aerosol size distributions, OA, and oxygen to carbon ratios (O : C) between and within smoke plumes during the first several hours of aging as a function of smoke concentration. The observations show that the median particle diameter increases faster in smoke of a higher initial OA concentration (> 1000 µg m<sup>-3</sup>), with diameter growth of over 100 nm in 8 h – despite generally having a net decrease in OA enhancement ratios – than smoke of a lower initial OA concentration (< 100 µg m<sup>-3</sup>), which had net increases in OA. Observations of OA and O V C suggest that evaporation and/or secondary OA formation was greater in less concentrated smoke prior to the first measurement (5–57 min after emission). We simulate the size changes due to coagulation and dilution and adjust for OA condensation/evaporation based on the observed changes in OA. We found that coagulation explains the majority of the diameter growth, with OA evaporation/condensation having a relatively minor impact. We found that mixing between the core and edges of the plume generally occurred on timescales of hours, slow enough to maintain differences in aging between core and edge but too fast to ignore the role of mixing for most of our cases.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, how the hydraulic traits directly link to the mortality and recovery of SEBF trees remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a drought-rewatering experiment on tree seedlings of five dominant species to investigate how the hydraulic traits were related to tree mortality and the resistance and recovery of photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) under different drought severities. Species with greater embolism resistance (P<sub>50</sub>) survived longer than those with the weaker P<sub>50</sub>. However, there was no general hydraulic threshold associated with tree mortality, with the lethal hydraulic failure varying from 64% to 93% loss of conductance. Further, the photosynthesis and transpiration of tree species with greater P<sub>50</sub> were more resistant to and recovered faster from drought than those with lower P<sub>50</sub>. Other plant traits could not explain the interspecific variation in tree mortality and drought resistance and recovery. These results highlight the unique importance of embolism resistance in driving carbon and water process under persistent drought across different trees in SEBF. The absence of multiple efficient drought strategies in SEBF seedlings implies the difficulty of natural seedling regeneration under future droughts, which often occurs after destructive disturbances (e.g., extreme drought events and typhoon), suggesting that this biome may be highly vulnerable to co-occurring climate extremes.","Ecological Society of America (ESA)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, little is known about how surface warming trends of global cities differ from those characterized by weather observations in the rural background.

Here we quantify multiple aspects of model functional performance to evaluate improved process representations in ecosystem models. We compare semi-empirical stomatal models with hydraulic constraints against more mechanistic representations of stomatal and hydraulic functioning at a semi-arid pine site using a suite of metrics and analytical tools. We find that models generally perform similarly under unstressed conditions, but performance diverges under atmospheric and soil drought. The more empirical models better capture synergistic information flows between soil water potential and vapor pressure deficit to transpiration, while the more mechanistic models are overly deterministic. Although models can be parameterized to yield similar functional performance, alternate parameterizations could not overcome structural model constraints that underestimate the unique information contained in soil water potential about transpiration. Additionally, both multilayer canopy and big-leaf models were unable to capture the magnitude of canopy temperature divergence from air temperature, and we demonstrate that errors in leaf temperature can propagate to considerable error in simulated transpiration. This study demonstrates the value of merging underutilized observational data streams with emerging analytical tools to characterize ecosystem function and discriminate among model process representations.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Park; Lintner, Benjamin R.; Findell, Kirsten L.; Keenan, Trevor F.; Zhang, Yao; Gentine, Pierre","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; climate change; hydrology","Global warming is expected to cause wet seasons to get wetter and dry seasons to get drier, which would have broad social and ecological implications. However, the extent to which this seasonal paradigm holds over land remains unclear. Here we examine seasonal changes in surface water availability (precipitation minus evaporation, P–E) from CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections. While the P–E seasonal cycle does broadly intensify over much of the land surface, ~20% of land area experiences a diminished seasonal cycle, mostly over subtropical regions and the Amazon. Using land–atmosphere coupling experiments, we demonstrate that 63% of the seasonality reduction is driven by seasonally varying soil moisture (SM) feedbacks on P–E. Declining SM reduces evapotranspiration and modulates circulation to enhance moisture convergence and increase P–E in the dry season but not in the wet season. Our results underscore the importance of SM–atmosphere feedbacks for seasonal water availability changes in a warmer climate.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

When using wind measurements from various remote sensors to determine model forecast accuracy, it is important to understand the effects of measurement-uncertainty differences among the sensors resulting from differences in the methods of measurement, the vertical and temporal resolution of the measurements, and the spatial variability of these differences. Here we quantify instrument measurement variability in 80-m wind speed during WFIP2 and its impact on the calculated errors and the change in error from one model version to another. Here the model versions tested involved updates in model physics from HRRRv1 to HRRRv4, and reductions in grid interval from 3 km to 750 m. Model errors were found to be 2–3 m s<sup>–1</sup>. Differences in errors as determined by various instruments at each site amounted to about 10% of this value, or 0.2–0.3 m s<sup>–1</sup>. Changes in model skill due to physics or grid-resolution updates also differed depending on the instrument used to determine the errors; most of the instrument-to-instrument differences were ~0.1 m s<sup>–1</sup>, but some reached 0.3 m s<sup>–1</sup>. All instruments at a given site mostly showed consistency in the sign of the change in error. In two examples, though, the sign changed, illustrating a consequence of differences in measurements: errors determined using one instrument may show improvement in model skill, whereas errors determined using another instrument may indicate degradation. This possibility underscores the importance of having accurate measurements to determine the model error.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These changes in winter precipitation patterns affect in-stream freeze-thaw cycles, including ice and snow cover, and can trigger direct and indirect effects on in-stream physical, chemical, and biological processes in ~60% of river basins in the Northern Hemisphere. We used high-resolution, multi-parameter data collected in a headwater stream and its local environment (climate and soil) to determine interannual variability in physical, chemical, and biological signals in a montane stream during the winter of an El Niño and a La Niña year. We observed ~77% greater snow accumulation during the El Niño year, which caused the formation of an ice dam that shifted the system from a primarily lotic to a lentic environment. Water chemistry and stream metabolism parameters varied widely between years. They featured anoxic conditions lasting over a month, with no observable gross primary production (GPP) occurring under the ice and snow cover in the El Niño year. In contrast, dissolved oxygen and GPP remained relatively high during the winter months of the La Niña year. These redox and metabolic changes driven by changes in winter precipitation have significant implications for water chemistry and biological functioning beyond the winter. Our study suggests that as snow accumulation and hydrologic conditions shift during the winter due to climate change, hot-spots and hot-moments for biogeochemical processing may be reduced, with implications for the downstream movement of nutrients and transported materials.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Melt rates from sites along the Ronne Depression vary seasonally, consistent with the dynamics of the propagation of seasonal dense water from the western ice front into the cavity. Several sites at the back of the FRIS cavity feature a signal with two seasonal maxima. Sub-ice shelf oceanographic data available from one of the sites indicate that this signal is caused by two different pathways followed by the same source water. Inter-annual variability is strongest along a direct flow pathway between western Ronne Ice Front and western Berkner Island. Highest melting occurred in 1999 and 2018, following anomalously low summer sea-ice concentrations in front of the ice shelf. Inter-annual melt rate variability at the back of the FRIS cavity is limited. If present, it is expressed as a suppression or delay in the arrival of the seasonal melt rate minimum, which can be understood in terms of inter-annual stratification changes and variable inflow pathways toward the sites. Long term mean ApRES melt rates agree with estimates from satellite data over eastern FRIS. However, the satellite estimates overstate the area of active basal freezing in the western part of the ice shelf. Furthermore, the temporal melt rate variability from the satellite estimates exaggerates the range of variability at both seasonal and inter-annual time scales with any correspondence between the in-situ and remotely derived inter-annual variability being limited to a single site.","American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The effect of surface heterogeneity is challenging in the PBL parameterization for numerical weather and climate models. Here we use large eddy simulation data to investigate the impact of surface heating heterogeneity on the PBLH spatial variations and mean values over a domain of typical mesoscale model grid size. It is found that this impact depends on background wind condition. Variance decomposition and Fourier spectra both reveal that for the fully developed sheared convective PBL, surface heterogeneity contributes little to the spatial variation of PBLH, except for the case with heterogeneity scale of 14.4 km. This suggests that surface heterogeneity with length scales less than ~10 km, which is typical for mesoscale modeling, does not induce significant subgrid spatial variation of PBLH. The domain-averaged PBLH is found to generally increase as surface heterogeneity scale decreases, until reaching the scale on the order of PBLH. The findings can be used to inform the parameterization development of PBL processes over heterogeneous surface.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The plume also generates strong density fronts, features of the circulation that are known pathways for the exchange of water between the ocean surface and the deep. Using high-resolution ocean observations and numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the summer land-sea breeze generates rapid vertical exchange at the plume fronts. We show that the interaction between the land-sea breeze and the fronts leads to convergence/divergence in the surface mixed layer, which further facilitates a slantwise circulation that subducts surface water along isopycnals into the interior and upwells bottom waters to the surface. This process causes significant vertical displacements of water parcels and creates a ventilation pathway for the bottom water in the northern Gulf. The ventilation of bottom water can bypass the stratification barrier associated with the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river plume and might impact the dynamics of the region’s dead zone.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Thawing permafrost can be subject to dynamic hydrology, making redox processes an important factor controlling soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition rates and greenhouse gas production. In iron (Fe)-rich permafrost soils, Fe(III) can serve as a terminal electron acceptor, promoting anaerobic respiration of SOM and increasing pH. Current large-scale models of Arctic C cycling do not include Fe cycling or pH interactions. Here, a geochemical reaction model was developed by coupling Fe redox reactions and C cycling to simulate SOM decomposition, Fe(III) reduction, pH dynamics, and greenhouse gas production in permafrost soils subject to dynamic hydrology. In this study we parameterized the model using measured CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes as well as changes in pH, Fe(II), and dissolved organic C concentrations from oxic and anoxic incubations of permafrost soils from polygonal permafrost sites in northern Alaska, United States. In simulations of repeated oxic-anoxic cycles, Fe(III) reduction during anoxic periods enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> production, while the net effect of Fe(III) reduction on cumulative CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes depended on substrate C availability. With lower substrate availability, Fe(III) reduction decreased total CH<sub>4</sub> production by further limiting available substrate. With higher substrate availability, Fe(III) reduction enhanced CH<sub>4</sub> production by increasing pH. Our results suggest that interactions among Fe-redox reactions, pH and methanogenesis are important factors in predicting CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> production as well as SOM decomposition rates in Fe-rich, frequently waterlogged Arctic soils.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Fine resolution remote sensing spectra improves estimates of gross primary production of croplands","Shirkey, Gabriela; John, Ranjeet; Chen, Jiquan; Dahlin, Kyla; Abraha, Michael; Sciusco, Pietro; Lei, Cheyenne; Reed, David E.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; LUE; GPP; Carbon; Croplands; Remote sensing; Ecosystem function","Gross primary production (GPP) is a fundamental measure of the terrestrial carbon cycle critical to our understanding of ecosystem function under the changing climate and land use. Remote sensing enables access to continuous spatial coverage, but remains challenged in heterogeneous croplands. Coarse resolution products, like MOD17A (500 m), may aggregate fragmented land cover types commonly found in heavily managed landscapes and misrepresent their respective contribution to carbon production. Consequently, this study demonstrates the capability of fine-resolution imagery (20-30 m) and available red-edge vegetation indices to characterize GPP across seven Midwest cropping systems. Four sites were established on a 22-year-old USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and the other three on land conventionally farmed with corn-soybean-wheat rotation (AGR). We compare in situ GPP estimates from eddy-covariance towers with ten satellite models: eight variants of the vegetation photosynthesis models (VPM), of which five include a red-edge vegetation index, as well as conventional products Landsat CONUS GPP (30 m) and MOD17A2H V6 (500 m). Daily and cumulative fine-resolution imagery integrated within VPM generally agreed with tower-based GPP in heterogeneous landscapes more than those from MODIS 500 m VPM or conventional GPP products from MOD17AH V6 or Landsat 8 CONUS. Here, replacing EVI2 with red-edge indices NDRE2, NDRE1, and MTCI in Sentinel 2 VPMs notably improved explanation of variance and estimation of cumulative GPP. While existing methods using MODIS- and Landsat-derived GPP are important baselines for regional and global studies, future research may benefit from the higher spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution.","Elsevier","","Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI (United States).

"Multiple experimental studies of pore structure and mineral grain sizes of the Woodford shale in southern Oklahoma, USA","Zhao, Chen; Hu, Qinhong; Wang, Qiming; Ilavsky, Jan; Wang, Min; Zhang, Xiaobei; Yan, Jianping","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; characterization methods; connectivity; deposition; grain size; pore structure; woodford shale","Pore structure study is an important part of unconventional shale reservoir characterization, since the pore system provides the primary petroleum storage space and fluid flow pathways. Previous studies have suggested that the pore structure is related to the total organic carbon (TOC) content, mineral compositions, and the maturity of the organic matter (OM). However, few studies have focused on the mineral grains, the primary grains being deposited but before cementation, which are the building blocks of shale. Eight Woodford Shale outcrop samples from southern Oklahoma were chosen to study the effects of mineral grain size on the pore structure characterization, using multiple and complementary experimental approaches, including laser diffraction, mineralogy, TOC, pyrolysis, liquid immersion porosimetry, mercury intrusion porosimetry, gas physisorption, (ultra) small angle X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and spontaneous imbibition. The results from different experiments of eight samples show that the Woodford Shale has the mean mineral grain diameters at 3–6 μm, a wide range of porosity at 3–40% and pore diameters at 50–1,000 nm, and various pore connectivity. Grain size variation was probably caused by the sea-level fluctuation during its deposition, which affect the porosity, pore size distribution, and pore connectivity. With decreasing mineral grain sizes, the porosity tends to increase while the pore connectivity worsens. The results also indicate that OM and carbonates in this low-maturity Woodford Shale could block the pores and decrease the porosity. Coupling with the grain size analyses, the control of depositional environment on grain sizes and subsequent effects on pore structure is identified. The pore structure characteristics over a wide pore-diameter range provided by multiple experiments could improve the understanding of storage space and fluid flow in the Woodford Shale to further increase its petroleum production.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Argonne National Lab.

"Inequality in the availability of residential air conditioning across 115 US metropolitan areas","Romitti, Yasmin; Wing, Ian Sue; Spangler, Keith R.; Wellenius, Gregory A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; residential air conditioning; climate change; social vulnerability; inequality","Continued climate change is increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of populations’ high temperature exposures. Indoor cooling is a key adaptation, especially in urban areas, where heat extremes are intensified—the urban heat island effect (UHI)—making residential air conditioning (AC) availability critical to protecting human health. In the United States, the differences in residential AC prevalence from one metropolitan area to another is well understood, but its intra-urban variation is poorly characterized, obscuring neighborhood-scale variability in populations’ heat vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We address this gap by constructing empirically derived probabilities of residential AC for 45,995 census tracts across 115 metropolitan areas. Within cities, AC is unequally distributed, with census tracts in the urban “core” exhibiting systematically lower prevalence than their suburban counterparts. Moreover, this disparity correlates strongly with multiple indicators of social vulnerability and summer daytime surface UHI intensity, highlighting the challenges that vulnerable urban populations face in adapting to climate-change driven heat stress amplification.","Oxford University Press","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT)","","United States","2022-09-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PNAS Nexus; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 4; Related Information: PDF of open source manuscript available here: https://watermark.silverchair.com/pgac210.pdf","","Medium: ED","","","SC0016162; DGE 1735087; R01-ES029950","Journal ID: ISSN 2752-6542","10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac210","","2022-12-13T00:00:00Z","1901592","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1901592","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1901592","PNAS Nexus","4","1"

In this study, we developed a new process called shock ion extraction (shock IX) for selective and chemical-free removal of toxic heavy metals from water. Shock IX is a hybrid process that combines shock electrodialysis (shock ED) and ion exchange using an ion exchange resin wafer (IERW), and this method can be thought of functionally as an electrochemically assisted variation of traditional ion exchange. In particular, shock IX exhibits greater ion removal and selectivity for longer periods of time, compared to the use of ion exchange alone. Here, the use of an IERW in shock ED also increases multivalent ion selectivity, reduces energy consumption, and improves the hydrodynamics and scalability of the system.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 19","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14091-14098","","","SC0022304","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c05042","","2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","1889889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1889889","","Environmental Science and Technology","19","56"

Riming of ice crystals by supercooled water droplets is an efficient ice growth process, but its basic properties are still poorly known. While it has been shown to contribute significantly to surface precipitation at mid-latitudes, little is known about its occurrence at high latitudes. In Antarctica, two competing effects can influence the occurrence of riming: (i) the scarcity of supercooled liquid water clouds due to the extremely low tropospheric temperatures and (ii) the low aerosol concentration, which may lead to the formation of fewer and larger supercooled drops potentially resulting in an enhanced riming efficiency. In this work, by exploiting the deployment of an unprecedented number of multiwavelength remote sensing systems (including triple-frequency radar measurements) in West Antarctica, during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) field campaign, we evaluate the riming incidence at McMurdo Station and find that riming occurs at much lower temperatures when compared to previous results in the mid-latitudes. This suggests the possible occurrence of a common atmospheric state over Antarctica that includes a rather stable atmosphere inhibiting turbulent mixing, and a high riming efficiency driven by large cloud droplets. We then focus on a peculiar case study featuring a persistent layer with a particularly pronounced riming signature in triple-frequency radar data but only a relatively modest amount of supercooled liquid water. In-depth analysis of the radar observations suggests that such signatures can only be explained by the combined effects of moderately rimed aggregates or similarly shaped florid polycrystals and a narrow particle size distribution (PSD). Simulations of this case study performed with a one-dimensional bin model indicate that similar triple-frequency radar observations can be reproduced when narrow PSDs are simulated. Such narrow PSDs can in turn be explained by two key factors: (i) the presence of a shallow homogeneous droplet or humidified aerosol freezing layer aloft seeding an underlying supercooled liquid layer, and (ii) the absence of turbulent mixing throughout a stable polar atmosphere that sustains narrow PSDs, as hydrometeors grow from the nucleation region aloft to ice particles of several millimeters in size, by vapor deposition and then riming.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Super‐Droplet Method to Simulate Lagrangian Microphysics of Nuclear Fallout in a Homogeneous Cloud","McGuffin, D. L.; Lucas, D. D.; Morris, J. P.; Spriggs, G. D.; Knight, K. B.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 45 MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONRY, AND NATIONAL DEFENSE","Nuclear detonations produce hazardous local and global particles or fallout. Predicting fallout size, chemical components, and location is necessary to inform officials and determine immediate guidance for the public. However, existing nuclear detonation fallout models prescribe the particle size distributions based on limited observations. In this work, we apply the super-droplet method, which is a numerical modeling technique developed for cloud microphysics, to simulate size distributions of particles in a mushroom cloud formed post-detonation of a nuclear device. We model fallout formation and evolution with homogeneous nucleation and condensation of a single species and a Monte Carlo coagulation algorithm. We verify the numerical methods representing coagulation and condensation processes against analytical test problems. Additionally, we explore several scenarios for the integral system mass and yield in equivalent kilotons (kt) of TNT (trinitrotoluene). The fallout size distribution median diameter d<sub>pg</sub> follows a scaling law based on the integral system mass m<sub>v0</sub> kg and yield Y kt: d<sub>pg</sub> = 0.647m$^{0.609}_{v0}$/Y<sup>0.436</sup> nm. We test the effect of cloud turbulence, enhanced nucleation and growth, and vapor volatility with a sensitivity study. The range in median diameter predictions for simulations of historical tests performed over the Pacific encompass the measurements of particles sampled from the cloud caps. Predicted median particle size ranges up to 217, 123, 86, and 35 nm for historical tests with yields of 0.2, 0.7, 2, and 10 Mt, respectively. This work can be expanded in many different directions to build a more predictive model for fallout formation.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Lower Urban Humidity Moderates Outdoor Heat Stress","Chakraborty, T.; Venter, Z. S.; Qian, Y.; Lee, X.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Surface temperature is often used to examine heat exposure in multi-city studies and for informing urban heat mitigation efforts due to scarcity of urban air temperature measurements. Cities also have lower relative humidity, traditionally not accounted for in large-scale observational urban heat risk assessments. Here, using crowdsourced measurements from over 40,000 weather stations in ≈600 urban clusters in Europe, we show the moderating effect of this urbanization-induced humidity reduction on outdoor heat stress during the 2019 heatwave. We demonstrate that daytime differences in heat index between urban clusters and their surroundings are weak, and associations of this urban-rural difference with background climate, generally examined from the surface temperature perspective, are diminished due to moisture feedbacks. We also examine the spatial variability of surface temperature, air temperature, and heat index within these clusters—relevant for detecting hotspots and potential disparities in heat exposure—and find that surface temperature is a poor proxy for the intra-urban distribution of heat index during daytime. Finally, urban vegetation shows much weaker (~1/6th as strong) associations with heat index than with surface temperature, which has broad implications for optimizing urban heat stress mitigation strategies. These findings are valid for operational metrics of heat stress for shaded conditions (apparent temperature and humidex), thermodynamic proxies (wet-bulb temperature), and empirical heat indices. Based on this large-scale empirical evidence, surface temperature, used due to the lack of better alternatives, may not be suitable for accurately informing heat mitigation strategies within and across cities, necessitating more urban-scale observations and better urban-resolving models.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Smoke effects on the transition between overcast stratocumulus and scattered cumulus clouds are investigated along a Lagrangian (air-mass-following) trajectory in regional climate and large eddy simulation models. Results are compared with observations from three recent field campaigns that took place in August 2017: ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES), CLouds and Aerosol Radiative Impacts and Forcing: Year 2017 (CLARIFY), and Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC). The case study is set up around the joint ORACLES–CLARIFY flight that took place near Ascension Island on 18 August 2017. Smoke sampled upstream on an ORACLES flight on 15 August 2017 likely entrained into the marine boundary layer later sampled during the joint flight. The case is first simulated with the WRF-CAM5 regional climate model in three distinct setups: (1) FireOn, in which smoke emissions and any resulting smoke–cloud–radiation interactions are included; (2) FireOff, in which no smoke emissions are included; (3) RadOff, in which smoke emissions and their microphysical effects are included but aerosol does not interact directly with radiation. Over the course of the Lagrangian trajectory, differences in free tropospheric thermodynamic properties between FireOn and FireOff are nearly identical to those between FireOn and RadOff, showing that aerosol–radiation interactions are primarily responsible for the free tropospheric effects. These effects are non-intuitive: in addition to the expected heating within the core of the smoke plume, there is also a “banding” effect of cooler temperature (~1–2 K) and greatly enhanced moisture (>2 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) at the plume top. This banding effect is caused by a vertical displacement of the former continental boundary layer in the free troposphere in the FireOn simulation resulting from anomalous diabatic heating due to smoke absorption of sunlight that manifests primarily as a few hundred meters per day reduction in large-scale subsidence over the ocean. A large eddy simulation (LES) is then forced with free tropospheric fields taken from the outputs for the WRF-CAM5 FireOn and FireOff runs. Cases are run by selectively perturbing one variable (e.g., aerosol number concentration, temperature, moisture, vertical velocity) at a time to better understand the contributions from different indirect (microphysical), “large-scale” semi-direct (above-cloud thermodynamic and subsidence changes), and “local” semi-direct (below-cloud smoke absorption) effects. Despite a more than 5-fold increase in cloud droplet number concentration when including smoke aerosol concentrations, minimal differences in cloud fraction evolution are simulated by the LES when comparing the base case with a perturbed aerosol case with identical thermodynamic and dynamic forcings. A factor of 2 decrease in background free tropospheric aerosol concentrations from the FireOff simulation shifts the cloud evolution from a classical entrainment-driven “deepening–warming” transition to trade cumulus to a precipitation-driven “drizzle-depletion” transition to open cells, however. The thermodynamic and dynamic changes caused by the WRF-simulated large-scale adjustments to smoke diabatic heating strongly influence cloud evolution in terms of both the rate of deepening (especially for changes in the inversion temperature jump and in subsidence) and in cloud fraction on the final day of the simulation (especially for the moisture “banding” effect). Such large-scale semi-direct effects would not have been possible to simulate using a small-domain LES model alone.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Short-term, single-location studies have limited applicability, but long-term data from a network of many locations can provide a broader understanding across gradients of climate and management choices. Here we examine eddy covariance measured carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fluxes from cropland sites across the United States Department of Agriculture's Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network. The dataset was collected between 2001 and 2020, spanning 13 sites for a total of 182 site-years. Average seasonal patterns of net ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R<sub>eco</sub>) were determined, and subsequent regression analysis on these “flux climatologies” was used to identify relationships to mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), cropping systems, and management practices. At rainfed sites, carbon fluxes were better correlated with MAP (r2 ≤ 0.5) than MAT (r2 ≤ 0.22). Net carbon balance was different among cropping systems (p < 0.001), with the greatest net carbon uptake occurring in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) and the least in soybean (Glycine max) fields. Crop type had a greater effect on carbon balance than irrigation management at a Nebraska site. Across cropping systems, grain crops often had higher GPP and were more likely to have net uptake when compared to legume crops. This multi-site analysis highlights the potential of the LTAR network to further carbon flux research using eddy covariance measurements.","Elsevier","","Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-09-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Agricultural and Forest Meteorology; Journal Volume: 326","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 109154","","","SC0018409","Journal ID: ISSN 0168-1923","10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109154","","2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","1893922","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1893922","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1893922","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","326"

The expansion of utility-scale solar development across the globe has increased the pressure on land resources for energy generation and other land uses (e.g., agriculture, biodiversity conservation). To address this growing issue, greater emphasis has been placed on solar development strategies that maximize the benefits of solar energy generation and multiple ecosystem services, such as the development of agrivoltaics systems that co-locate solar energy production and various forms of conservation and agricultural land uses. The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the potential ecosystem services of agrivoltaics and summarize how these development strategies could address several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our review will focus on four broad potential ecosystem services of agrivoltaics: (1) energy and economic benefits; (2) agricultural provisioning services of food production and animal husbandry; (3) biodiversity conservation; and (4) regulating ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and water and soil conservation. In particular, we will highlight the state of the science, challenges, and knowledge gaps that represent opportunities for further study to better understand how solar energy deployment can facilitate sustainable development.","Frontiers","","Argonne National Lab.

In particular, it is emphasized that closing the energy budget is conceptually challenging and hard to achieve in practice without resorting to ad hoc fixers. As a concrete example, the energy budget terms are diagnosed in a realistic climate simulation using a global atmosphere model. The largest total energy errors in this example are spurious dynamical core energy dissipation, thermodynamic inconsistencies (e.g., coupling parameterizations with the host model) and missing processes/terms associated with falling precipitation and evaporation (e.g., enthalpy flux between components). The latter two errors are not, in general, reduced by increasing horizontal resolution. They are due to incomplete thermodynamic and dynamic formulations. Future research directions are proposed to reconcile and improve thermodynamics formulations and conservation principles.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For example, chick-rearing songbirds that must feed their offspring hourly might be expected to have smaller foraging ranges compared to non-breeding songbirds that return nightly to a roost. Methods: We used GPS units to compare the foraging behaviour of an aerial insectivorous bird, the purple martin (Progne subis), during the breeding season in three regions across North America, as well as the non-breeding season in South America. Specifically, we tested foraging range size and habitat selection. Results: Foraging range did not vary among regions during breeding (14.0 ± 39.2 km<sup>2</sup>) and was larger during the nonbreeding period (8840 ± 8150 km<sup>2</sup>). Purple martins strongly preferred aquatic habitats to other available habitats year-round and in the Amazon commuted from night roosts in low productivity sediment-poor water, where risk of predation was probably low, to daytime foraging sites in productive sediment-rich water sites. Conclusions: We provide the first estimates for foraging range size in purple martins and demonstrate foraging preference for aquatic habitats throughout two stages of the annual cycle. Understanding foraging constraints and habitat of aerial insectivores may help plan conservation actions throughout their annual cycle. Future research should quantify foraging behaviour during the post-breeding period and during migration.","BioMed Central","","Pantex Plant (PTX), Amarillo, TX (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-09-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Movement Ecology; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 39","","","NA0001942","Journal ID: ISSN 2051-3933","10.1186/s40462-022-00337-2","","2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","1897494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1897494","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1897494","Movement Ecology","1","10"

A new empirical parameterization (EP) for multiple groups of primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) is implemented in the aerosol–cloud model (AC) to investigate their roles as ice nucleating particles (INPs). The EP describes the heterogeneous ice nucleation by (1) fungal spores, (2) bacteria, (3) pollen, (4) detritus of plants, animals, and viruses, and (5) algae. Each group includes fragments from the originally emitted particles. A high-resolution simulation of a midlatitude mesoscale squall line by AC is validated against airborne and ground observations. Sensitivity tests are carried out by varying the initial vertical profiles of the loadings of individual PBAP groups. The resulting changes in warm and ice cloud microphysical parameters are investigated. The changes in warm microphysical parameters, including liquid water content and cloud droplet number concentration, are minimal (<10 %). Overall, PBAPs have little effect on the ice number concentration (<6 %) in the convective region. In the stratiform region, increasing the initial PBAP loadings by a factor of 1000 resulted in less than 40 % change in ice number concentrations. The total ice concentration is mostly controlled by various mechanisms of secondary ice production (SIP). However, when SIP is intentionally shut down in sensitivity tests, increasing the PBAP loading by a factor of 100 has an effect of less than 3 % on the ice phase. Further sensitivity tests revealed that PBAPs have little effect on surface precipitation and on the shortwave and longwave flux (<4 %) for a 100-fold perturbation in PBAPs.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Spatiotemporal-Aware Weighting Scheme for Improving Climate Model Ensemble Predictions","Fan, Ming; Lu, Dan; Rastogi, Deeksha; Pierce, Eric","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Bayesian neural network; multimodel ensemble; spatiotemporal-aware weighting; uncertainty quantification; interpretability","Multimodel ensembling has been widely used to improve climate model predictions, and the improvement strongly depends on the ensembling scheme. In this work, we propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN) ensembling method, which combines climate models within a Bayesian model averaging framework, to improve the predictive capability of model ensembles. Our proposed BNN approach calculates spatiotemporally varying model weights and biases by leveraging individual models' simulation skill, calibrates the ensemble prediction against observations by considering observation data uncertainty, and quantifies epistemic uncertainty when extrapolating to new conditions. More importantly, the BNN method provides interpretability about which climate model contributes more to the ensemble prediction at which locations and times. Thus, beyond its predictive capability, the method also brings insights and understanding of the models to guide further model and data development. In this study, we design experiments using an ensemble of CMIP6 climate model simulations to illustrate the BNN ensembling method's capability with respect to prediction accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate that BNN can correctly assign larger weights to the regions and seasons where the individual model fits the observation better. Moreover, its offered interpretability is consistent with our understanding of localized climate model performance. Additionally, BNN shows an increasing uncertainty when the prediction is farther away from the period with constrained data, which appropriately reflects our trustworthiness of the models in the changing climate.","Begell House","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We report simultaneous CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> observations near a coal mine vent and oil and gas (O&G) emission sources using ground-based in situ measurements in 2020/2021. During these campaigns, we observed a stable coal vent C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>:CH<sub>4</sub> ratio of 1.28% ± 0.11%, discernibly different than nearby O&G source ratios ranging from 0.9% to 16.8%. We analyze airborne observations of the SJB taken in 2014/2015 that exhibit similar coal vent ratios and further show the region's heterogeneity. We identify episodic O&G sources, including a gas plant source detected in 2014/2015 that is absent in our 2020/2021 data.

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the role of soil characteristics (organic carbon stock and clay content), study duration, and ecosystem type (e.g., forest, grassland, etc) in modifying the response of soil respiration to precipitation change. In general, decreased precipitation (N = 128 effect size pairs) decreased soil respiration rates. In contrast, increased precipitation (N = 141) had a more variable and on-average weak positive effect on this flux; significantly increasing soil respiration only in desert ecosystems. The long-term response of ecosystems varied, with those that are less constrained by water-availability (e.g., forests) showing acclimation over time to altered precipitation. Soil organic carbon stock strongly modified the response of soil respiration to decreased precipitation (p < 0.0001), but only weakly modified the response to increased precipitation (p < 0.01). Our results suggest that ecosystems with limited soil water-holding capacity and strong inherent water-limitation will show long-term dynamic change in soil respiration regardless of the direction of precipitation change.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The stochastic condensation framework and the three regimes of activation of cloud droplets – namely, mean-dominant, fluctuation-influenced, and fluctuation-dominant, are used for analyzing the data from high-resolution large-eddy simulations of the Pi convection-cloud chamber. Based on a detailed budget analysis the significance of all the terms in the evolution of the droplet size distribution equation is evaluated in all three regimes. The analysis indicates that the mean-growth rate is a dominant process in shaping the droplet size distribution in all three regimes. Turbulence introduces two sources of stochasticity, turbulent transport and particle lifetime, and supersaturation fluctuations. The transport of cloud droplets plays an important role in all three regimes, whereas the direct effect of supersaturation fluctuations is primarily related to the activation and growth of the small droplets in the fluctuation-influenced and fluctuation-dominant regimes. Here, we compare our results against the previous studies (experimental and theory) of the Pi chamber, and discuss the limitations of the existing models based on the stochastic condensation framework. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of our results to atmospheric clouds, and in particular focus on recent adiabatic turbulent cloud parcel simulations based on the stochastic condensation framework, and emphasize the importance of entrainment/mixing and turbulent transport in shaping the droplet size distribution.","American Meteorological Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Sensitivity of ice nucleation parameterizations to the variability in underlying ice nucleation rate coefficients","Steinke, Isabelle; Burrows, Susannah M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Deriving aerosol-type-dependent parameterizations for ice nucleation processes remains challenging due to large uncertainties associated with laboratory studies and field measurements. One source of uncertainty is a lack of knowledge about the magnitude of particle-to-particle differences in freezing efficiency associated with particles' chemical composition and surface features. In most experimental setups, it is challenging to disentangle the contributions of inherent experimental uncertainties, variability in aerosol surface area and the particle-to-particle differences in freezing efficiency. Therefore, in this study, we use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate synthetic ice nucleation experiments to better understand the impact of variability in heterogeneous ice nucleation propensities on simulated frozen fractions. We represent this variability by differently-shaped distributions of the heterogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients J<sub>het</sub>. Distributions spanning one order of magnitude result in simulated median frozen fractions that are up to a factor of two higher compared to simulations with narrow Gaussian distributions, in the case of small frozen fractions. For the assumed range of variability in J<sub>het</sub>, impacts on cloud variables (e.g., ice water path based on Hawker et al. (2021)) calculated from hypothetical parameterizations based on our simulated frozen fractions seem to be relatively small, with only up to 25% difference between lognormal and constant J<sub>het</sub> distributions. One of the major unknowns, however, is the interparticle variability in J<sub>het</sub>, which depends on particle composition and surface features. Resolving this uncertainty requires a combination of laboratory studies and field experiments relating physicochemical particle features and ice nucleation propensity in a size-resolved manner.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For offshore wind, the highest-ranked issues included cumulative effects, turbine collision risk, underwater noise (e.g. marine mammals and fish), and displacement. Emerging considerations for these priorities include potential application to future technologies (e.g. larger turbines and floating turbines), new stressors and species in frontier regions, and cumulative effects for multiple projects at a regional scale.

"Contribution of Atmospheric Rivers to Antarctic Precipitation","Maclennan, Michelle L.; Lenaerts, Jan T. M.; Shields, Christine; Wille, Jonathan D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are efficient mechanisms for transporting atmospheric moisture from low latitudes to the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). While AR events occur infrequently, they can lead to extreme precipitation and surface melt events on the AIS. Here we estimate the contribution of ARs to total Antarctic precipitation, by combining precipitation from atmospheric reanalyses and a polar-specific AR detection algorithm. We show that ARs contribute substantially to Antarctic precipitation, especially in East Antarctica at elevations below 3,000 m. ARs contribute substantially to year-to-year variability in Antarctic precipitation. Our results highlight that ARs are an important component for understanding present and future Antarctic mass balance trends and variability.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)","","United States","2022-09-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters Journal Volume: 49 Journal Issue: 18","","Medium: X","","","DE‐SC0022070; NSF IA 1947282; SC0022070; 80NSSC20K0888","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276","10.1029/2022GL100585","","2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","1887318","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1887318","","Geophysical Research Letters","18","49"

"Aggregation in bottom-up vulnerability assessments and equity implications: The case of Jordanian households’ water supply","Lachaut, Thibaut; Yoon, Jim; Klassert, Christian; Tilmant, Amaury","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Aggregation; Equity; Jordan; Bottom-up; Response surfaces; Water system; Multi-agent","Bottom-up methods for water resources modeling rely on acceptability thresholds to find, through a response surface, which deeply uncertain futures lead to system failure. They commonly treat water users as aggregate actors, which may preclude analysis of the equity impacts of interventions. This paper explores how aggregation choices for large groups of water users lead to different policy recommendations in response surface assessments. Herein, two aggregation methods with varying parameters are considered: percentile satisfaction targets and generalized mean. A 2-dimensional stress-test assessment across groundwater availability and population is applied to household water supply in Jordan. The study compares six different policies covering supply enhancement and rebalancing, using a country-wide multi-agent model that characterizes households across socioeconomic strata. For different aggregation levels, policies are ordered by their associated robustness index. Results show that aggregation choices may modify response surfaces as much as policy changes and strongly determine policy preference. Modifying allocation rules can substantially reduce the disparity in household vulnerability. Preferences defined by aggregation intervals provide a finer understanding of trade-offs among water users and may improve deliberation over equity under deep uncertainty.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Quantifying vertical wind shear effects in shallow cumulus clouds over Amazonia","Cecchini, Micael Amore; de Bruine, Marco; Vilà-Guerau de Arellano, Jordi (ORCID:0000000303429171); Artaxo, Paulo (ORCID:0000000177543036)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","This study analyses and quantifies the effects of vertical wind shear (VWS) on the properties of shallow cumulus cloud fields over Central Amazonia. We perform idealised simulations with high resolution (50 m horizontally and 20 m vertically) using the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model, changing the initial conditions and large-scale forcing of VWS. The resulting cloud field is analysed by applying a cloud tracking algorithm to generate Lagrangian datasets of the life cycle of individual clouds as well as their time-varying core and margin dimensions. The reference run has no wind speed or directional shear and represents a typical day in the local dry season. Numerical experiments with moderate and high wind speed shear are simulated by adding linear increases in the wind speed of 1.2 and 2.4 m s<sup>–1</sup> km<sup>–1</sup>, respectively. Three additional runs are made by adding 90° of wind rotation between the surface and the top of the domain (5 km) on top of the three wind speed shear conditions. We find that clouds developing in a sheared environment have horizontal equivalent diameter increased by up to 100 m on average, but the cloud depth is reduced. Our quantification shows that VWS tends to increase the size of the cloud cores but reduces their relative area, volume, and mass fractions compared to the overall cloud dimensions. The addition of 2.4 m s<sup>–1</sup> km<sup>–1</sup> of VWS decreases the relative core area by about 0.03 (about 10 % of the overall average) and its volume and mass ratios by about 0.05 (10 %–25 % in relative terms). Relevant for the cloud transport properties is that the updraught speed and the liquid water content are lower within the cores, and consequently so is the upward mass flux. All quantifications of mean cloud properties point to the inhibition of convective strength by VWS, therefore hampering the shallow-to-deep transition. However, open questions still remain given that the individually deepest clouds were simulated under high environmental shear, even though they occur in small numbers. This could indicate other indirect effects of VWS that have opposite effects on cloud development if found to be significant in the future.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

There is a lack of model-based global evaluation of the relative roles of the two types of water stresses in limiting canopy conductance (G<sub>c</sub>). Using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), we conducted four land-atmosphere coupled simulations for the historical period with and without a plant hydraulics scheme (PHS) and under present-day and quadrupling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. By fitting an empirical model of G<sub>c</sub> to the E3SM simulations, we evaluated the sensitivity of G<sub>c</sub> to water stresses caused by VPD and soil water (SW) in the growing season. The empirical model is based on a multiplicative algorithm that adjusts G<sub>c</sub> according to VPD, soil water saturation, and their interaction. Our results show positive trends of VPD over land during the historical period, with large differences between simulations with and without PHS. Despite the differences, a majority of land pixels that experience both SW and VPD stresses are in semi-arid and tropical savanna ecosystems. G<sub>c</sub> is more sensitive to VPD than SW in less than 20% of land pixels where the empirical model provides a good fit for the simulated G<sub>c</sub>. Ignoring SW and VPD interaction may underestimate the relative role of VPD on G<sub>c</sub> by as much as 28%. Including PHS accentuates SW stress limitation on G<sub>c</sub> by simulating wetter soil and higher ET that lower VPD. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> reduces G<sub>c</sub> by increasing water use efficiency and ameliorates SW stress on G<sub>c</sub>.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Extending the Heat Index","Lu, Yi-Chuan; Romps, David M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Conservation equations; Indices; Nonlinear models; Health","The Heat Index is a widely used measure of apparent temperature that accounts for the effects of humidity using Steadman’s model of human thermoregulation. Steadman’s model, however, gives unphysical results when the air is too hot and humid or too cold and dry, leading to an undefined Heat Index. For example, at a relative humidity of 80%, the Heat Index is only defined for temperatures in the range of 288-304 K (59-88 degrees Fahrenheit). Here, Steadman’s thermoregulation model is extended to define the Heat Index for all combinations of temperature and humidity, allowing for an assessment of Earth’s future habitability. The extended Heat Index can be mapped onto physiological responses of an idealized human, such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and even heat death, providing an indication of regional health outcomes for different degrees of global warming.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Evaluation of hydrograph separation techniques with uncertain end-member composition","Lukens, Eileen; Neilson, Bethany T.; Williams, Kenneth H.; Brahney, Janice","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; hydrograph separation; mass balance; end-member mixing; instream chemistry; data- limited; solutes","Hydrograph separation is one of many approaches used to analyse shifts in source water contributions to stream flow resulting from climate change in remote watersheds. Understanding these shifts is vital, as shifts in source water contributions to a stream can shape water management decisions. Because remote watersheds are often inaccessible and have poorly characterized contributing water sources, or end-members, it is critical to understand the implications of using different hydrograph separation techniques in these data-limited environments. To explore the uncertainty associated with different techniques, results from two hydrograph separation techniques, mass balance and principle component analysis, were compared using 3 years of aqueous geochemical data from the East River watershed located in the Elk Mountains of Central Colorado. Solute concentrations of the end-members were characterized by both a limited set of direct chemical measurements of different sources and detailed seasonal instream chemistry to examine the influences of uncertain end-member compositions in a data-limited environment. Annual volumetric end-member contributions to stream flow had relatively good agreement across separation techniques. Large variations in time were observed in the hydrograph separations, depending on the end-member type, and estimated flow contributions varied between the selected solutes. End-member concentrations characterized by stream chemistry showed several limitations including a reduced number of distinguishable end-members and differences in timing of flow contributions. Here the results highlight the benefits of using multiple hydrograph separation techniques by providing a ‘weight-of-evidence’ approach to environments with limited end-member concentration data.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here we analyze effects of observed spatial heterogeneity in soil and vegetation properties, hydrology, and thermal dynamics on ecosystem carbon dynamics in a watershed on the Seward Peninsula in Alaska. We apply a Morris global sensitivity analysis to a process-rich, successfully tested terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM), ecosys, varying soil properties, boundary conditions, and weather forcing. We show that landscape heterogeneity strongly impacts soil temperatures and vegetation composition. Snow depth, O-horizon thickness, and near-surface water content, which vary at scales of O(m), control the soil thermal regime more than an air temperature gradient corresponding to a 140&nbsp;km north–south distance. High shrub productivity is simulated only in talik (perennially unfrozen) soils with high nitrogen availability. Through these effects on plant and permafrost dynamics, landscape heterogeneity impacts ecosystem productivity. Simulations with near-surface taliks have higher microbial respiration (by 78.0&nbsp;gC&nbsp;m-2&nbsp;yr-1) and higher net primary productivity (by 104.9&nbsp;gC&nbsp;m-2&nbsp;yr-1) compared to runs with near-surface permafrost, and simulations with high shrub productivity have outlying values of net carbon uptake. We explored the prediction uncertainty associated with ignoring observed landscape heterogeneity, and found that watershed net carbon uptake is 60% larger when heterogeneity is accounted for. Our results highlight the complexity inherent in discontinuous permafrost environments and demonstrate that missing representation of subgrid heterogeneity in TEMs could bias predictions of high-latitude carbon budget.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","NGEE Arctic (United States); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

There is a lack of long-term and continuous observations of zi, however, particularly for remote regions, such as the Amazon forest. Reanalysis products, such as ERA5, can fill this gap by providing temporally and spatially resolved information on zi. In this work, we evaluate the ERA5 estimates of zi (zi-ERA5) for two locations in the Amazon and corrected them by means of ceilometer, radiosondes, and SODAR measurements (zi-experimental). The experimental data were obtained at the remote Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) with its pristine tropical forest cover and the T3 site downwind of the city of Manaus with a mixture of forest (63%), pasture (17%), and rivers (20%). We focus on the rather typical year 2014 and the El Niño year 2015. The comparison of the experimental vs. ERA5 zi data yielded the following results: (i) zi-ERA5 underestimates zi-experimental daytime at the T3 site for both years 2014 (30%, underestimate) and 2015 (15%, underestimate); (ii) zi-ERA5 overestimates zi-experimental daytime at ATTO site (12%, overestimate); (iii) during nighttime, no significant correlation between the zi-experimental and zi-ERA5 was observed. Based on these findings, we propose a correction for the daytime zi-ERA5, for both sites and for both years, which yields a better agreement between experimental and ERA5 data. These results and corrections are relevant for studies at ATTO and the T3 site and can likely also be applied at further locations in the Amazon.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

This is largely due to a lack of existing, systematic, and well-distributed REE and CM samples and analyses in United States sedimentary basins. In addition, the type of sampling and characterization performed to date has generally lacked the resolution and approach required to constrain geologic and geographic heterogeneities typical of subsurface, mineral resources. Here, we describe a robust and systematic method for collecting core scale characterization data that can be applied to studies on the contextual and spatial attributes, the geologic history, and lithostratigraphy of sedimentary basins. The methods were developed using drilled cores from coal bearing sedimentary strata in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming (PRB). The goal of this effort is to create a unified core characterization methodology to guide systematic collection of key data to achieve a foundation of spatially and geologically constrained REEs and CMs. This guidance covers a range of measurement types and methods that are each useful either individually or in combination to support characterization and delineation of REE and CM occurrences. The methods herein, whether used in part or in full, establish a framework to guide consistent acquisition of geological, geochemical, and geospatial datasets that are key to assessing and validating REE and CM occurrences from geologic sources to support future exploration, assessment, and techno-economic related models and analyses.","MDPI","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2022-09-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Minerals; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1159","","","89243318CFE000003; FE1022420","Journal ID: ISSN 2075-163X","10.3390/min12091159","","2023-01-26T00:00:00Z","1913807","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1913807","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1913807","Minerals","9","12"

In urban and suburban areas, satellite-based NO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a proxy to track the emissions of CO<sub>2ff</sub>. Because of NO<sub>2</sub>’s shorter lifetime, urban NO<sub>2</sub> plumes are more distinguishable from backgrounds and more sensitive to variations in emissions.

For single-track cases, the spatial correlations between NO<sub>2</sub> and ΔXCO<sub>2</sub> over Mexico City are stronger than DC-Balt because the NO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are mostly trapped in the valley of Mexico City, while DC-Balt is severely affected by distant sources (i.e., US East Coast cities). Using multi-track averaging, spatial correlation coefficients increase with the number of days used for averaging. The correlations reached a maximum when averaging >12 continuous images for DC-Balt and > 10 continuous images for Mexico City. This finding indicates that multi-track averaging using modeled CO<sub>2ff </sub>as a proxy is helpful to filter the noise in single-track images, to cancel the interference from distant sources, and to magnify correlations between NO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2ff</sub>. Mexico City showed stronger spatial correlations but weaker temporal correlations than DC-Balt due to biomass burning hot spots and large transport errors caused by the trapping effects of the surrounding mountains. Tracking the 20-day moving average of CO<sub>2ff </sub>emissions using TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> seems technically feasible, considering the relationship between correlation coefficients and the number of available satellite images.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Strong ozone depletion occurred over Antarctica in 2021 as well. The ozone holes developed in smoke-polluted air. In this article, the impact of Siberian and Australian wildfire smoke (dominated by organic aerosol) on the extraordinarily strong ozone reduction is discussed. The study is based on aerosol lidar observations in the North Pole region (October 2019–May 2020) and over Punta Arenas in southern Chile at 53.2°S (January 2020–November 2021) as well as on respective NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) ozone profile observations in the Arctic (Ny-Ålesund) and Antarctica (Neumayer and South Pole stations) in 2020 and 2021. We present a conceptual approach on how the smoke may have influenced the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which are of key importance in the ozone-depleting processes. The main results are as follows: (a) the direct impact of wildfire smoke below the PSC height range (at 10–12 km) on ozone reduction seems to be similar to well-known volcanic sulfate aerosol effects. At heights of 10–12 km, smoke particle surface area (SA) concentrations of 5–7 µm<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (Antarctica, spring 2021) and 6–10 µm<sup>2</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> (Arctic, spring 2020) were correlated with an ozone reduction in terms of ozone partial pressure of 0.4–1.2 mPa (about 30 % further ozone reduction over Antarctica) and of 2–3.5 mPa (Arctic, 20 %–30 % reduction with respect to the long-term springtime mean). (b) Within the PSC height range, we found indications that smoke was able to slightly increase the PSC particle number and surface area concentration. In particular, a smoke-related additional ozone loss of 1–2 mPa (10 %–20 % contribution to the total ozone loss over Antarctica) was observed in the 14–23 km PSC height range in September–October 2020 and 2021. Smoke particle number concentrations ranged from 10 to 100 cm<sup>-3</sup> and were about a factor of 10 (in 2020) and 5 (in 2021) above the stratospheric aerosol background level. Satellite observations indicated an additional mean column ozone loss (deviation from the long-term mean) of 26–30 Dobson units (9 %–10 %, September 2020, 2021) and 52–57 Dobson units (17 %–20 %, October 2020, 2021) in the smoke-polluted latitudinal Antarctic belt from 70–80 °S.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Turbulent Flux Measurements of the Near‐Surface and Residual‐Layer Small Particle Events","Islam, M. M.; Meskhidze, N.; Rasheeda Satheesh, A.; Petters, M. D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","According to recent field studies, almost half of the New Particle Formation (NPF) events occur aloft, in a residual layer, near the top of the boundary layer. Therefore, measurements of the meteorological parameters, precursor gas concentrations, and aerosol loadings conducted at the ground level are often not representative of the conditions where the NPFs take place. Here, we present new measurements obtained during the Turbulent Flux Measurements of the Residual Layer Nucleation Particles, conducted at the Southern Great Plains research site. Vertical turbulent fluxes of 3–10 nm-sized particles were measured using a sonic anemometer and two condensation particle counters with nominal cutoff diameters of ≥3 nm and ≥10 nm mounted at the top of the 10-m telescoping tower. Aerosol number size distribution (5 to 300 nm) was determined through the ground-based Scanning Mobility Particle Sizers. The size selected (15 to 50 nm) particle hygroscopicity was derived with the Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer. The ground-level observations were supplemented by vertically-resolved measurements of horizontal and vertical wind speed and aerosol backscatter. The data analysis suggests that 1) turbulent flux measurements of 3-10 nm particles can distinguish between near-surface and residual-layer small particle events; 2) sub-50 nm particles had hygroscopicity value 0.2, suggesting that organic compounds dominate atmospheric nanoparticle chemical composition at the site and 3) current methodologies are inadequate for estimating dry deposition velocity of sub-10 nm particles because it is not feasible to measure particle concentration very near the surface, in the diffusion sublayer.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

It is an important component of the tropical-extratropical exchange of heat and moisture in South America and favors deep moist convection in Southeastern South America (SESA). In the present study, the SALLJ characteristics during the 2002-2003 summer season are investigated using upper-air measurements collected during the SALLJ Experiment (SALLJEX). At most stations, the highest wind speed was observed below 3000 m between 06 and 12 UTC, mainly in association with a maximization of the northerly component of the wind while the zonal component reached its minimum. Here, an increase in the maximum wind speed from 10°S to Santa Cruz de la Sierra’s latitude and from there a weakening southward was found throughout the SALLJEX network. Additionally, SALLJEX observations allowed to locate SALLJ core purely from observations in a region just east of the Andes in agreement with previous studies. A new localized kinematic classification was developed and applied in this study to analyze the relationship between the SALLJ intensity and the thermodynamic properties of the lower layers of the atmosphere. Weak, moderate, and strong SALLJ categories were defined with a local threshold of the northerly wind speed maximum at each station. The strongest SALLJs were frequently observed at nighttime, while weaker SALLJs were likely to occur at any time of the day. A stabilization of the nocturnal boundary layer was observed between weak and moderate cases whereas a destabilization between moderate and strong cases were found near the time of the wind speed maximum (06 UTC) at Santiago del Estero and Resistencia stations. A deepening of the convective boundary layer and an increase of its mean temperature between weak and strong category during the previous afternoon to nocturnal SALLJs, reveal a possible contribution to the mechanisms that generate the maximum wind speed.","Royal Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Wildfire exacerbates high-latitude soil carbon losses from climate warming","Mekonnen, Zelalem A.; Riley, William J.; Randerson, James T.; Shirley, Ian A.; Bouskill, Nicholas J.; Grant, Robert F.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; soil carbon dynamics; high-latitude carbon cycle; wildfire and climate warming; nutrient cycling; vegetation change","<title>Abstract</title> <p> Arctic and boreal permafrost soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition has been slower than carbon inputs from plant growth since the last glaciation. Anthropogenic climate warming has threatened this historical trend by accelerating SOC decomposition and altering wildfire regimes. We accurately modeled observed plant biomass and carbon emissions from wildfires in Alaskan ecosystems under current climate conditions. In projections to 2300 under the RCP8.5 climate scenario, we found that warming and increased atmospheric CO <sub>2</sub> will result in plant biomass gains and higher litterfall. However, increased carbon losses from (a) wildfire combustion and (b) rapid SOC decomposition driven by increased deciduous litter production, root exudation, and active layer depth will lead to about 4.4 PgC of soil carbon losses from Alaska by 2300 and most (88%) of these loses will be from the top 1 m of soil. These SOC losses offset plant carbon gains, causing the ecosystem to transition to a net carbon source after 2200. Simulations excluding wildfire increases yielded about a factor of four lower SOC losses by 2300. Our results show that projected wildfire and its direct and indirect effects on plant and soil carbon may accelerate high-latitude soil carbon losses, resulting in a positive feedback to climate change. </p>","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To survey the large design space, we introduce a novel superstructure-based optimization framework integrating process design and fuel formulation. We show that biorefineries that produce middle distillates by upgrading lignocellulosic ethanol can have an energy return on investment (EROI) greater than 1. Additionally, we show that technological improvements can lead to significant increases in EROI. Furthermore, trade-offs between fuel properties and biorefinery profitability are established, showing how process economics are strongly influenced by fuel properties. In the case of diesel, the feasibility of producing high cetane number biofuels is demonstrated, coupled with a discussion of the technological requirements and costs to produce these superior fuels. It is also shown that the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) can be reduced by increasing the biorefinery complexity. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of satisfying current and projected middle distillates demand in the U.S. using biofuels produced by ethanol upgrading, and we estimate the potential CO2 mitigation of these technologies.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

The two-day intrusion, caused drastic changes in the aerosol size distribution, chemical composition and particle hygroscopicity. Here we show how the intrusion transformed the Arctic from a remote low-particle environment to an area comparable to a central-European urban setting. Additionally, the intrusion resulted in an explosive increase in cloud condensation nuclei, which can have direct effects on Arctic clouds’ radiation, their precipitation patterns, and their lifetime. Thus, unless prompt actions to significantly reduce emissions in the source regions are taken, such intrusion events are expected to continue to affect the Arctic climate.","Nature Publishing Group","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we demonstrate the deviations can be substantially reduced by two changes in the nudging implementation: first, revising the sequence of calculations in a nudged EAM simulation to improve consistency with the free-running baseline; second, increasing the frequency of constraining data from 6-hourly to 3-hourly to better capture strong sub-diurnal variations. The resulting improvements in climate representativeness motivates an investigation on the potential benefits of using newer reanalysis products with higher data frequency in nudged simulations that aim at capturing observed weather events. Simulations nudged towards 6-hourly ERA-Interim reanalysis or 6-hourly, 3-hourly, and hourly ERA5 reanalysis are evaluated against EAMv1's own climatology, global-scale satellite retrievals of outgoing longwave radiation and precipitation, as well as in-situ measurements of air temperature, humidity, and winds from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. Our overall recommendation is to use the revised sequence of calculation and 3-hourly data from ERA5 for the nudged simulations. The anthropogenic aerosol effects in various EAMv1 simulations are evaluated. For estimating the global mean effect, the source of constraining data has a relatively small impact. Consistent with conclusions from previous studies, in order to obtain estimates of global mean aerosol effects that are consistent with results from the free-running baseline, nudging the horizontal winds but not air temperature is recommended.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

W.; Santer, Benjamin D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; general circulation models; climate change; satellite data; natural climate variability","Climate-model simulations exhibit approximately two times more tropical tropospheric warming than satellite observations since 1979. The causes of this difference are not fully understood and are poorly quantified. Here, we apply machine learning to relate the patterns of surface-temperature change to the forced and unforced components of tropical tropospheric warming. This approach allows us to disentangle the forced and unforced change in the model-simulated temperature of the midtroposphere (TMT). In applying the climate-model-trained machine-learning framework to observations, we estimate that external forcing has produced a tropical TMT trend of 0.25 ± 0.08 K∙decade<sup>–1</sup> between 1979 and 2014, but internal variability has offset this warming by 0.07 ± 0.07 K∙decade<sup>–1</sup>. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) large ensemble, we also find that a discontinuity in the variability of prescribed biomass-burning aerosol emissions artificially enhances simulated tropical TMT change by 0.04 K∙decade<sup>–1</sup>. The magnitude of this aerosol-forcing bias will vary across climate models, but since the latest generation of climate models all use the same emissions dataset, the bias may systematically enhance climate-model trends over the satellite era. Our results indicate that internal variability and forcing uncertainties largely explain differences in satellite-versus-model warming and are important considerations when evaluating climate models.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"FORTE Measurements of Global Lightning Altitudes","Peterson, Michael","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; lightning; altitude; satellite; thunderstorm; remote sensing; FORTE","While multiple lightning detection systems provide geographical locations of lightning events across the globe, robust lightning altitude measurements on a global scale have proven elusive. Space-based platforms have an advantageous viewing geometry for making these measurements, but prior studies with the Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) satellite were limited to a few thousand events. In this study, we apply the same technique for calculating source altitude from the previous efforts to a large catalog of hundreds of thousands of global FORTE in-cloud lightning events that were coincident with flashes geolocated by its lightning imager between 1997 and 2003. We use this new data set to document global variations in lightning altitude. As in previous studies, we find that FORTE primarily resolves sources from the upper (positive) charge layer at ~11 km altitude in normal thunderstorms. However, sources are also recorded from other charge layers in the storm and from leaders developing between layers. In particular, we note a pronounced increase in source altitude in the first 20 ms of FORTE flashes from the negative leader developing upward into the upper positive charge layer. Regions known for wintertime and/or stratiform lightning have increased contributions from low-altitude sources, while tropical regions particularly around Panama and the Maritime Continent have the greatest concentrations of high-altitude sources.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The vulnerability of these soils to climate change-induced losses is uncertain with many hypothesizing these soils would be less sensitive to climate change because already-high temperatures in tropical systems might limit microbial sensitivity or due to increased mineral protection of organic carbon in highly weathered tropical soils. Here we present the results of a deep soil (0–100 cm) warming experiment in a tropical Andisol. Andisols can store large, persistent pools of soil carbon that are protected from decomposition by poorly and non-crystalline minerals (PNCM). In 20 cm depth intervals, we measured key soil properties including carbon, nitrogen, pH, PNCM, bacterial and fungal richness along with temperature, moisture, and CO<sub>2</sub> production. Over a year of soil warming, CO<sub>2</sub> production significantly increased by 50–300% per degree of warming, but only in the top 40 cm of the soil profile in contrast to the results of other deep soil warming experiments. Multimodal analysis supported our hypothesis that high concentrations of PNCM was the primary driver of the lack of CO<sub>2</sub> response, followed by high relative soil moisture and low bacterial richness, which may be a proxy for organic carbon availability. The lack of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> production in response to warming suggests a limited positive feedback to climate change in Andisols driven by their strong mineral protection of organic matter. Therefore, Andisols should be considered high priority restoration or protection areas when considering the management of soil carbon stocks as part of climate action.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Uncertainty in land carbon budget simulated by terrestrial biosphere models: the role of atmospheric forcing","Hardouin, Lucas; Delire, Christine; Decharme, Bertrand; Lawrence, David M.; Nabel, Julia S.; Brovkin, Victor; Collier, Nathan; Fisher, Rosie; Hoffman, Forrest M.; Koven, Charles D.; Séférian, Roland; Stacke, Tobias","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; uncertainty; land carbon sink; atmospheric forcing dataset; terrestrial biosphere model","Global estimates of the land carbon sink are often based on simulations by terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). The use of a large number of models that differ in their underlying hypotheses, structure and parameters is one way to assess the uncertainty in the historical land carbon sink. Here we show that the atmospheric forcing datasets used to drive these TBMs represent a significant source of uncertainty that is currently not systematically accounted for in land carbon cycle evaluations. We present results from three TBMs each forced with three different historical atmospheric forcing reconstructions over the period 1850–2015. We perform an analysis of variance to quantify the relative uncertainty in carbon fluxes arising from the models themselves, atmospheric forcing, and model-forcing interactions. We find that atmospheric forcing in this set of simulations plays a dominant role on uncertainties in global gross primary productivity (GPP) (75% of variability) and autotrophic respiration (90%), and a significant but reduced role on net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration (30%). Atmospheric forcing is the dominant driver (52%) of variability for the net ecosystem exchange flux, defined as the difference between GPP and respiration (both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration). In contrast, for wildfire-driven carbon emissions model uncertainties dominate and, as a result, model uncertainties dominate for net ecosystem productivity. At regional scales, the contribution of atmospheric forcing to uncertainty shows a very heterogeneous pattern and is smaller on average than at the global scale. We find that this difference in the relative importance of forcing uncertainty between global and regional scales is related to large differences in regional model flux estimates, which partially offset each other when integrated globally, while the flux differences driven by forcing are mainly consistent across the world and therefore add up to a larger fractional contribution to global uncertainty.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The impact of climate on solvent-based direct air capture systems","An, Keju; Farooqui, Azharuddin; McCoy, Sean T.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; direct air capture (DAC); climate impact; CO2 capture efficiency; levelized cost for CO2 capture","Direct air capture (DAC) is increasingly seen as a critical technology to reach mid-century net-zero targets and limit climate change to well below 2 °C. While the commercialization of DAC technologies is being pursued by numerous companies, there remains remarkably little information on their performance under “real-world” conditions. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the influence of temperature and relative humidity of air on the CO<sub>2</sub> capture rate at the air contactor, overall energy requirement, CO<sub>2</sub> capture efficiency, and levelized cost of liquid-solvent based DAC systems. We observe that the overall energy demand decreases from 11.1 to 8.3 GJ/tCO<sub>2</sub> as the CO<sub>2</sub> capture rate increases from 40 to 85 % and that high capture rates can only be achieved in hot and humid climate conditions. We observe that a CO<sub>2</sub> capture rate of 75 % is only possible above 17 °C and 90 % relative humidity, and this drops dramatically at lower temperatures. It is also observed that water evaporation in the air contactor is highest at dry and low relative humidity, as expected. The sensitivity analysis showed that CO<sub>2</sub> capture efficiency is relatively insensitive to climate conditions for the liquid-solvent based DAC plant. Lastly, the levelized cost of natural gas standalone scenario varies from $240/tCO<sub>2</sub> to $409/tCO<sub>2</sub>, and this is more sensitive to temperature than relative humidity. The levelized cost of the natural gas stand-alone case is between 7 % and 10 % lower than that of an electric grid-connected case across all climate conditions.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, the relationship between temperature inversion and the vertical distribution of aerosols is investigated based on Raman lidar observations taken from January 2010 to September 2015 at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in the Southern Great Plains, USA. First, the diurnal and seasonal variations of the surface-based inversion (SBI) and elevated temperature inversion (EI) are investigated. The results indicate that the occurrence frequency of SBI and EI have different seasonal trends. SBI has the highest frequency in summer, while EI has the highest frequency in winter. The diurnal variation of SBI is obvious, with a higher frequency in nighttime and a lower frequency in daytime. The inversion intensity (ΔT) and inversion depth (ΔZ) of SBI and EI have consistent diurnal and seasonal trends. The effects of SBI and EI on the vertical distribution of aerosols are then analyzed. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) below the SBI height shows a clear seasonal variation, which is consistent with the seasonal trends of ΔT and ΔZ. This phenomenon also occurs on the AOD below EI top height. The sensitivity analysis shows that the mean AOD below SBI height or EI top height increases with an increase of the ΔT and ΔZ of SBI (EI). It indicates that ΔT and ΔZ are the key factors affecting the vertical distribution of aerosols. In addition, the variation of AOD below and above EI top height is opposite to that of AOD below and above EI bottom height under different ΔT and ΔZ conditions. The correlation coefficients between ΔT (ΔZ) of EI with AOD in EI were 0.62 (0.65). These results indicate that the space between EI bottom height and EI top height can store aerosols. The larger the ΔZ of EI, the more aerosols are stored. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effect of temperature inversion on the vertical distribution of aerosols.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

(ORCID:0000000284894763)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Recent advances in deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based super resolution can be used to downscale atmospheric chemistry simulations with substantially higher accuracy than conventional downscaling methods. This work both demonstrates the downscaling capabilities of modern CNN-based single image super resolution and video super-resolution schemes and develops modifications to these schemes to ensure they are appropriate for use with physical science data. The CNN-based video super-resolution schemes in particular incur only 39 % to 54 % of the grid-cell-level error of interpolation schemes and generate outputs with extremely realistic small-scale variability based on multiple perceptual quality metrics while performing a large (8×10) increase in resolution in the spatial dimensions. Methods are introduced to strictly enforce physical conservation laws within CNNs, perform large and asymmetric resolution changes between common model grid resolutions, account for non-uniform grid-cell areas, super-resolve lognormally distributed datasets, and leverage additional inputs such as high-resolution climatologies and model state variables. High-resolution chemistry simulations are critical for modeling regional air quality and for understanding future climate, and CNN-based downscaling has the potential to generate these high-resolution simulations and ensembles at a fraction of the computational cost.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Multiple stratified shear mixing regimes appear and evolve with time. Initially the plume acts as a nearfield jet, with mixing in the plume (plume layer mixing) and over the plume-ambient interface (nearfield interfacial mixing). As the plume grows, interfacial mixing is suppressed offshore of the nearfield as currents slow, diminishing turbulent exchange between plume and shelf. At the end of ebb, ambient tidal currents reverse direction below plume, initiating another mode of internal, interfacial mixing (coined here as tidal interfacial mixing), allowing exchange between plume and ambient waters offshore. This work highlights previously unreported tidally modulated mixing within the near and midfield of a river plume.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

(ORCID:0000000168782553); Schroeder, Dustin M. (ORCID:0000000319163929)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Subglacial hydrology is a leading control on basal friction and the dynamics of glaciers and ice sheets. At low discharge, subglacial water flows through high-pressure, sheet-like systems that lead to low effective pressures. However, at high discharge, subglacial water melts the overlying ice into localized channels that efficiently remove water from the bed, thereby increasing effective pressure and basal friction. Recent observations suggest channelized subglacial flow exists beneath Thwaites Glacier, yet it remains unclear if stable channelization is feasible in West Antarctica, where surface melting is nonexistent and water at the bed is limited. Here, we use the MPAS-Albany Land Ice model to run a suite of over 130 subglacial hydrology simulations of Thwaites Glacier across a wide range of physical parameter choices to assess the likelihood of channelization. We then narrow our range of viable simulations by comparing modeled water thicknesses to previously observed radar specularity content, which indicates flat, spatially extensive water bodies at the bed. In all of our data-compatible simulations, stable channels reliably form within 100–200 km of the grounding line and reach individual discharge rates of 35–110 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at the ice–ocean boundary. While only one to two channels typically form across the 200 km width of the glacier in our simulations, their high efficiency drains water across the entire lateral extent of the glacier. We posit the large catchment size of Thwaites Glacier, its funnel-like geometry, and high basal melt rates together accumulate enough water to form stable channels. No simulations resembled observed specularity content when channelization was disabled. Our results suggest channelized subglacial hydrology has two consequences for Thwaites Glacier dynamics: (i) amplifying submarine melting of the terminus and ice shelf while (ii) simultaneously raising effective pressure within 100 km of the grounding line and increasing basal friction. The distribution of effective pressure implied from our modeling differs from parameterizations typically used in large-scale ice sheet models, suggesting the development of more process-based parameterizations may be necessary.","Copernicus GmbH","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Recently, an approach to avoid such inconsistency has been suggested: the use of thermodynamic potentials in terms of their natural variables, from which all thermodynamic quantities and relationships (equations of state) are derived. In this article, we develop this approach for unapproximated moist-air thermodynamics and two widely used approximations: the constant-κ approximation and the dry heat capacities approximation. The (consistent) constant-κ approximation is particularly attractive because it leads to, with the appropriate choice of thermodynamic variable, adiabatic dynamics that depend only on total mass and are independent of the breakdown between water forms. Additionally, a wide variety of material from different sources in the literature on thermodynamics in atmospheric modelling is brought together. It is hoped that this article provides a comprehensive reference for the use of thermodynamic potentials in atmospheric modelling, especially for the three systems considered here.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Sandia National Lab.

Processes controlling precipitation development, which is a key to the transition, are analyzed by leveraging unique benefits of Lagrangian microphysics, particularly the ability to track computational drops in the flow. Sufficient time is needed for coalescence growth of cloud drops to drizzle within the updraft-downdraft cycle of large eddies. This favors broad drop size distributions (DSDs) and drizzle growth in downdrafts, where drops are typically much older than in updrafts. During the closed cell stage, mean cloud drop radius is too small, and the DSDs are too narrow, so that the timescale for coalescence is much longer than the large eddy turnover time and drizzle growth is limited. The closed-to-open cell transition occurs when these timescales become comparable and the precipitation flux increases sharply.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Soil Carbonyl Sulfide (OCS) Fluxes in Terrestrial Ecosystems: An Empirical Model","Whelan, Mary E.; Shi, Mingjie; Sun, Wu; Vries, Linda Kooijmans‐de; Seibt, Ulli; Maseyk, Kadmiel","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Measurements of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) enable independent estimates of regional stomatal conductance provided that non-stomatal OCS fluxes are well constrained. OCS is taken up through plant leaves, following the same pathway as CO<sub>2</sub>; in contrast to CO<sub>2</sub>, OCS is irreversibly destroyed in plant leaves and plants do not typically exhibit OCS emissions. Ecosystem uptake of OCS can indicate changes in stomatal opening. Here we present an empirical model to assess the potential impact of soil OCS exchange, the non-Stomatal OCS exchange Empirical Model (SOCSEM, version 0). We created biome-specific response curves characterizing soil OCS exchange and restricted the model design to require only knowledge of soil moisture and surface temperature because remote sensing observations are available for these two features. Comparing the model to field-based chamber observations reveal deviations that can be attributed to missing complexity of the ground surface (having excluded litter and plants without regulated stomata), shortwave radiation, or the soil environment. For agricultural regions with known net emissions, we use remotely-sensed surface temperature data and demonstrate that data resolution can affect anticipated fluxes. We further investigate the influence of regions with unknown soil OCS responses, for example, Arctic tundra. We compare our model to a process-based and respiration-based soil OCS exchange model that has been implemented in a land surface model. Further field study of tropical and arctic ecosystems in conjunction with studies of non-stomatal surfaces in addition to soil (e.g., bryophytes) will increase confidence in applying OCS as a regional tracer for stomatal conductance.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Modeled and observed N <sub>2</sub> O <sub>gs</sub> -emissions after organic and inorganic fertilizer amendment did not differ due to high variability associated with the treatments.

The <sub>p</sub> CENTURY-derived N <sub>2</sub> O <sub>gs</sub> EFs (0.91 <inline-formula> <math id='m1'> <mo>±</mo> </math> </inline-formula> 0.19%) for counties investigated were only slightly lower than literature (1.07 <inline-formula> <math id='m2'> <mo>±</mo> </math> </inline-formula> 0.57%) or Tier-1 (1%) values. Our preliminary evaluation of regional soil moisture estimates showed reasonable agreement between monthly soil moisture estimates and the North American Soil Moisture Dataset during the growing season, but overestimation of soil moisture in winter-spring can influence the estimates of annual N <sub>2</sub> O emissions so future work is needed to calibrate soil moisture-associated model parameters. Our work provided scenario-based estimates of climate and management impacts on soil N <sub>2</sub> O <sub>gs</sub> -emissions together with valuable spatial insights into EFs that will be improved by more accurate information of fertilizer inputs and more temporally refined model evaluation. </p>","Frontiers Media SA","","Argonne National Lab.

This work reports on modifications of the Handix Scientific commercial version of the POPS to facilitate its use in multi-instrument aerosol sampling systems. The flow system is modified by replacing the internal pump with a needle valve and a vacuum pump. The instrument is integrated into closed-flow systems by routing the sheath flow from filtered inlet air. A high-precision multichannel analyzer (MCA) card is added to sample the analog pulse signal. The MCA card is polled at 10 Hz frequency using an external data acquisition system and improves upon the count-rate limitation associated with the POPS internal data acquisition system. The times required to change the concentration between 90 % and 10 % and vice versa for a step change in concentration were measured to be 0.17 and 0.41 s at a flow rate of 5 cm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. This yields a sampling frequency of ~1–2 Hz, below which the amplitude of measured fluctuations is captured with > 70 % efficiency. The modified POPS was integrated into the dual tandem differential mobility analyzer system to explore the coalescence of dimer particles. Results show that the pulse-height response increases upon dimer coalescence. The magnitude of the increase is broadly consistent with the change in light-scattering amplitude predicted by the T-matrix method. It is anticipated that this modified version of the POPS will extend the utilization of the technique for a range of field and laboratory applications.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The ability of chemical transport models to represent the multi-scale processes affecting the life cycle of aerosols depends on their spatial resolution since aerosol properties are assumed to be constant within a grid cell. Subgrid-scale-dependent processes that affect aerosol populations could have a significant impact on the formation of particles, their growth to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sizes, aerosol–cloud interactions, dry deposition and rainout and hence their burdens, lifetimes, and radiative forcing. To address this issue, we characterize subgrid-scale variability in terms of measured aerosol number, size, composition, hygroscopicity, and CCN concentrations made by repeated aircraft flight paths over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site during the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystem (HI-SCALE) campaign. Subgrid variability is quantified in terms of both normalized frequency distributions and percentage difference percentiles using grid spacings of 3, 9, 27, and 81 km that represent those typically used by cloud-system-resolving models as well as the current and next-generation climate models. Even though the SGP site is a rural location, surprisingly large horizontal gradients in aerosol properties were frequently observed. For example, 90 % of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean organic matter concentrations differed from the 81 km cell around the SGP site by as much as ~ 46 %, large spatial variability in aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were found during new particle formation events, and consequently 90 % of the 3, 9, and 27 km cell mean CCN number concentrations differed from the 81 km cell mean by as much as ~ 38 %. The spatial variability varied seasonally for some aerosol properties, with some having larger spatial variability during the spring and others having larger variability during the late summer. While measurements at a single surface site cannot reflect the surrounding variability of aerosol properties at a given time, aircraft measurements that are averaged within an 81 km cell were found to be similar to many, but not all, aerosol properties measured at the ground SGP site. This analysis suggests that it is reasonable to directly compare most ground SGP site aerosol measurements with coarse global climate model predictions. In addition, the variability quantified by the aircraft can be used as an uncertainty range when comparing the surface point measurements with model predictions that use coarse grid spacings.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This work addresses such challenges by developing a hierarchy of ML models that gradually introduce predictors to improve the forecast accuracy based on a physics-based framework. Three ML models (ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost) are examined and compared with four physics-informed persistence models reported in Part I and the simple persistence model to assess the improvement of different models. The 7-year measurements at the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement's Southern Great Plains Central Facility site are used for forecasts and evaluations. The results reveal that the step-by-step introduction of predictors leads to different improvements for models at different hierarchical levels. Comparison of the ML models with persistence models shows that LSTM and XGBoost outperform all the persistence models, with LSTM having the overall best performance; however, ARIMA underperforms the four physics-informed persistence models. This study demonstrates the importance and utility of incorporating physics into ML models in improving forecast accuracy by introducing a hierarchy of physics-based predictors, distinguishing predictor contributions, and enhancing the ML interpretability. The combined use of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) significantly improves the forecast accuracy compared to using individual irradiances alone because the pair contains more information on cloud-radiation interactions.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

First, a standalone RMM is developed to simulate daily release and storage during Water Year 1981–2015. Next, using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) as the ML technique, a standalone LSTM model is trained based on reservoir inflow and meteorological observations to simulate reservoir release and estimate reservoir storage through water balance calculation. Three hybrid modeling strategies are developed, one using RMM output as an additional LSTM input (H1), another using LSTM as the initial release estimate in RMM (H2), and the third combining the first two strategies (H3). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for release (NSE-r), storage (NSE-s), and their mean (NSE-avg) are used for model evaluation. Overall, H1 improves NSE-r to 0.65 and 0.54 for Allatoona and Lanier, respectively, compared to standalone RMM (0.44 and 0.21); however, its storage trajectory did not produce a physically feasible solution, similar to LSTM. H2 and especially H3 show that they can retain the best features from RMM and LSTM, with H3 NSE-avg being 0.695 and 0.55 for Allatoona and Lanier outperforming RMM (0.615 and 0.29). In conclusion, the findings suggest a robust simulation capacity for large-scale water management in future studies.","Wiley - American Water Resources Association","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This makes risk assessments vulnerable to aggregation bias, a well-studied, sometimes substantial outcome in analyses that model fine-grained spatial phenomena at coarse spatial units. To evaluate this potential in the context of large-scale flood risk assessments, we use data from a high-resolution flood hazard model and structure inventory for over 1.3 million properties in Massachusetts and examine how prominent data aggregation approaches affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of flood loss estimates. All considered aggregation approaches rely on aggregate structure inventories but differ in whether flood hazard is also aggregated. We find that aggregating only structure inventories slightly underestimates overall losses (–10% bias), and when flood hazard data is spatially aggregated to even relatively small spatial units (census block), statewide aggregation bias can reach +366%. All aggregation-based procedures fail to capture the spatial covariation of inputs distributions in the upper tails that disproportionately generate total expected losses. Our findings are robust to several key assumptions, add important context to published risk assessments and highlight opportunities to improve flood loss estimation uncertainty quantification.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United Kingdom","2022-08-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Flood Risk Management Journal Volume: 15 Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X","","","DE‐SC0016162; DE‐SC0022141; SC0016162","Journal ID: ISSN 1753-318X","10.1111/jfr3.12851","","2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","1884878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1884878","","Journal of Flood Risk Management","4","15"

Among the sources of LUC-related emissions for soy biodiesel, the contribution from peatland loss to agricultural plantations in Southeast Asia remains uncertain. Here, in this study, we analyzed LUC in Malaysia and Indonesia and modeled its impacts on the GHG emissions of soy biodiesel produced in the United States. It shows that oil palm plantations have more than doubled over 2001–2016 and the area of palm-on-peatlands (PoP) has expanded 3.7 times. Over new palm plantations, the share of PoP is about 19% regardless of time and location and the emission factor (EF) for peatland-to-palm conversion is estimated to be 41.5 Mg CO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>–1</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>. With these updates on PoP and EF, the contribution of peatland loss (0.7–5.1 g CO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>–1</sup>) to biodiesel emissions is only 40–65% of previous estimates, which reduces discrepancies among model simulations used by different agencies. Based on emerging evidence on LUC and related carbon changes, our analysis reexamines regional peatland loss and its impacts on LUC emissions modeling and provides new insights into the estimation of LUC impacts on biofuels’ carbon intensity.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In these polar regions covered by sea ice, the wind is relatively strong due to the absence of obstructions and redistributes a large part of the deposited snow mass, which complicates estimates for precipitation hardly distinguishable from blowing or drifting snow. Moreover, the snow mass balance in the sea ice system is still poorly understood, notably due to the complex structure of its surface. Quantitatively assessing the snow distribution on sea ice and its connection to the sea ice surface features is an important step to remove the snow mass balance uncertainties (i.e., snow transport contribution) in the Arctic environment. In this work we introduce snowBedFoam 1.0., a physics-based snow transport model implemented in the open-source fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. We combine the numerical simulations with terrestrial laser scan observations of surface dynamics to simulate snow deposition in a MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) sea ice domain with a complicated structure typical for pressure ridges. The results demonstrate that a large fraction of snow accumulates in their vicinity, which compares favorably against scanner measurements. However, the approximations imposed by the numerical framework, together with potential measurement errors (precipitation), give rise to quantitative inaccuracies, which should be addressed in future work. The modeling of snow distribution on sea ice should help to better constrain precipitation estimates and more generally assess and predict snow and ice dynamics in the Arctic.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Yet, few studies have measured aquatic carbon fluxes and constrained drivers of ecosystem carbon balance across heterogeneous Arctic landscapes. Here, we characterized hydrochemical and landscape controls on fluvial carbon cycling, quantified fluvial carbon fluxes, and estimated fluvial contributions to ecosystem carbon balance across 33 watersheds in four ecoregions in the continuous permafrost zone of the western Canadian Arctic: unglaciated uplands, ice-rich moraine, and organic-rich lowlands and till plains. Major ions, stable isotopes, and carbon speciation and fluxes revealed patterns in carbon cycling across ecoregions defined by terrain relief and accumulation of organics. In previously unglaciated mountainous watersheds, bicarbonate dominated carbon export (70% of total) due to chemical weathering of bedrock. In lowland watersheds, where soil organic carbon stores were largest, lateral transport of dissolved organic carbon (50%) and efflux of biotic CO<sub>2</sub> (25%) dominated. In watersheds affected by thaw-induced mass wasting, erosion of ice-rich tills enhanced chemical weathering and increased particulate carbon fluxes by two orders of magnitude. From an ecosystem carbon balance perspective, fluvial carbon export in watersheds not affected by thaw-induced wasting was, on average, equivalent to 6–16% of estimated net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Finally, in watersheds affected by thaw-induced wasting, fluvial carbon export approached 60% of NEE. Because future intensification of thermokarst activity will amplify fluvial carbon export, determining the fate of carbon across diverse northern landscapes is a priority for constraining trajectories of permafrost region ecosystem carbon balance.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here we address this question here using large ensembles (LEs) performed with five climate models. LEs provide many different sequences of internal variability noise superimposed on an underlying forced signal. Despite differences in historical external forcings, climate sensitivity, and MIV properties of the five models, their T<sub>AC</sub>(x, t) fingerprints are similar and statistically identifiable in 239 of the 240 LE realizations of historical climate change. Comparing simulated and observed variability spectra reveals that consistent fingerprint identification is unlikely to be biased by model underestimates of observed MIV. Even in the presence of large (factor of 3–4) intermodel and inter-realization differences in the amplitude of MIV, the anthropogenic fingerprints of seasonal cycle changes are robustly identifiable in models and satellite data. This is primarily due to the fact that the distinctive, global-scale fingerprint patterns are spatially dissimilar to the smaller-scale patterns of internal T<sub>AC</sub>(x, t) variability associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and El Niño–Southern Oscillation. The robustness of the seasonal cycle detection and attribution results shown here, taken together with the evidence from idealized aquaplanet simulations, suggest that basic physical processes are dictating a common pattern of forced T<sub>AC</sub>(x, t) changes in observations and in the five LEs.

The potential for multiyear prediction of impactful Earth system change remains relatively underexplored compared to shorter (subseasonal to seasonal) and longer (decadal) timescales. In this study, we introduce a new initialized prediction system using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) that is specifically designed to probe potential and actual prediction skill at lead times ranging from 1 month out to 2 years. The Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble (SMYLE) consists of a collection of 2-year-long hindcast simulations, with four initializations per year from 1970 to 2019 and an ensemble size of 20. A full suite of output is available for exploring near-term predictability of all Earth system components represented in CESM2. We show that SMYLE skill for El Niño–Southern Oscillation is competitive with other prominent seasonal prediction systems, with correlations exceeding 0.5 beyond a lead time of 12 months. A broad overview of prediction skill reveals varying degrees of potential for useful multiyear predictions of seasonal anomalies in the atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice.

"Chronically underestimated: a reassessment of US heat waves using the extended heat index","Romps, David M. (ORCID:0000000176495175); Lu, Yi-Chuan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The heat index, or apparent temperature, was never defined for extreme heat and humidity, leading to the widespread adoption of a polynomial extrapolation designed by the United States National Weather Service. Recently, however, the heat index has been extended to all combinations of temperature and humidity, presenting an opportunity to reassess past heat waves. Here, hourly temperature and humidity are used to evaluate the extended heat index over the contiguous United States during the years 1984 to 2020. It is found that the 99.9th percentile of the daily maximum heat index is highest over the Midwest. Identifying and ranking heat waves by the spatially integrated exceedance of that percentile, the Midwest once again stands out as home to the most extreme heat waves, including the top-ranked July 2011 and July 1995 heat waves. The extended heat index can also be used to evaluate the physiological stress induced by heat and humidity. It is found that the most extreme Midwest heat waves tax the cardiovascular system with a skin blood flow that is elevated several fold, approaching the physiological limit. These effects are not captured by the National Weather Service's polynomial extrapolation, which also underestimates the heat index by as much as 10 degrees Celsius (20 degrees Fahrenheit) during severe heat waves.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

This is especially true for isolated convective clouds that typically evolve faster than the observations captured by operational radar networks. This study investigates uncertainties in radar observations of the evolution of the microphysical and dynamical properties of isolated deep convective clouds developing in clean and polluted environments. It aims to optimize the radar observation strategy for deep convection through the use of high-spatiotemporal cloud-resolving model simulations, which resolve the evolution of individual convective cells every 1 min, coupled with a radar simulator and a cell tracking algorithm. The radar simulation settings are based on the Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) and Experiment of Sea Breeze Convection, Aerosols, Precipitation and Environment (ESCAPE) field campaigns held in the Houston, TX, area but are generalizable to other field campaigns focusing on isolated deep convection. Our analysis produces the following four outcomes. First, a 5–7 m s<sup>–1</sup> median difference in maximum updrafts of tracked cells is shown between the clean and polluted simulations in the early stages of the cloud lifetimes. This demonstrates the importance of obtaining accurate estimates of vertical velocity from observations if aerosol impacts are to be properly resolved. Second, tracking of individual cells and using vertical cross section scanning every minute capture the evolution of precipitation particle number concentration and size represented by polarimetric observables better than the operational radar observations that update the volume scan every 5 min. This approach also improves multi-Doppler radar updraft retrievals above 5 km above ground level for regions with updraft velocities greater than 10 m s<sup>–1</sup>. Third, we propose an optimized strategy composed of cell tracking by quick (1–2 min) vertical cross section scans from more than one radar in addition to the operational volume scans. We also propose the use of a single-RHI (range height indicator) updraft retrieval technique for cells close to the radars, for which multi-Doppler radar retrievals are still challenging. Finally, increasing the number of deep convective cells sampled by such observations better represents the median maximum updraft evolution with sample sizes of more than 10 deep cells, which decreases the error associated with sampling the true population to less than 3 m s<sup>–1</sup>.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Different numerical approximations of the governing equations of the hydrodynamic models have been documented, but the numerical accuracy of these models and its subsequent effects on the simulated vegetation function and dynamics have rarely been evaluated. Using different numerical solution methods (including implicit and explicit approaches) and vertical discrete grid resolutions, we evaluated the numerical performance of a plant hydrodynamic module in the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES-HYDRO version 0.1) based on single-point and global simulations. Our simulation results showed that when near-surface vertical grid spacing is coarsened (grid size >10 cm), the model significantly overestimates aboveground biomass (AGB) in most of the temperate forest locations and underestimates AGB in the boreal forest locations, as compared to a simulation with finer vertical grid spacing. Grid coarsening has a small effect on AGB in the tropical zones of Asia and South America. In particular, coarse surface grid resolution should not be used when there are large and prolonged water content differences among soil layers at depths due to long dry-season duration and/or well-drained soil or when soil evaporation is a dominant fraction of evapotranspiration. Similarly, coarse surface grid resolution should not be used when there is lithologic discontinuity along the soil depth. This information is useful for uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis, or the training of surrogate models to design the simulations when computational cost limits the use of ensemble simulations.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

State-of-the-art land and atmosphere models employ parameterizations to represent their subgrid heterogeneity, but the land-atmosphere coupling in ESMs typically operates on the grid scale. Communicating the information on the land surface heterogeneity with the overlying atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) remains a challenge in modeling land-atmosphere interactions. In order to account for the subgrid-scale heterogeneity in land-atmosphere coupling, we implement a new coupling scheme in the Energy Exascale Earth system model version 1 (E3SMv1) that uses adjusted surface variances and covariance of potential temperature and specific water content as the lower boundary condition for the atmosphere model. The new lower boundary condition accounts for both the variability of individual subgrid land surface patches and the inter-patch variability. The E3SMv1 single-column model (SCM) simulations over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plain (SGP) site were performed to assess the impacts. We find that the new coupling parameterization increases the magnitude and diurnal cycle of the temperature variance and humidity variance in the lower ABL on non-precipitating days. The im- pacts are primarily attributed to subgrid inter-patch variability rather than the variability of individual patches. These effects extend vertically from the surface to several levels in the lower ABL on clear days. We also find that accounting for surface heterogeneity increases low cloud cover and liquid water path (LWP). These cloud changes are associated with the change in cloud regime indicated by the skewness of the probability density function (PDF) of the subgrid vertical velocity. In precipitating days, the inter-patch variability reduces significantly so that the impact of accounting for surface heterogeneity vanishes. These results highlight the importance of accounting for subgrid heterogeneity in land-atmosphere coupling in next-generation ESMs.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As a first step towards quantifying parametric uncertainty in Arctic climate, we performed a variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA) using a fully-coupled, ultra-low resolution (ULR) configuration of version 1 of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). Specifically, we quantified the sensitivity of six quantities of interest (QOIs), which characterize changes in Arctic climate over a 75 year period, to uncertainties in nine model parameters spanning the sea ice, atmosphere and ocean components of E3SMv1. Sensitivity indices for each QOI were computed with a Gaussian process emulator using 139 random realizations of the random parameters and fixed pre-industrial forcing. Uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters in the CLUBB (Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals) scheme were found to have the most impact on sea ice status and the larger Arctic climate. Our results demonstrate the importance of conducting sensitivity analyses with fully coupled climate models. The ULR configuration makes such studies computationally feasible today due to its low computational cost. When advances in computational power and modeling algorithms enable the tractable use of higher-resolution models, our results will provide a baseline that can quantify the impact of model resolution on the accuracy of sensitivity indices. Moreover, the confidence intervals provided by our study, which we used to quantify the impact of the number of model evaluations on the accuracy of sensitivity estimates, have the potential to inform the computational resources needed for future sensitivity studies.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Sandia National Lab.

"A Package of Momentum and Heat Transfer Coefficients for the Stable Surface Layer Extended by New Coefficients over Sea Ice","Gryanik, Vladimir M.; Lüpkes, Christof","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric surface layer; polar boundary layer; transfer coefficients; turbulence","The bulk transfer coefficients of momentum, heat, and humidity belong to the main ingredients of numerical weather prediction and climate models. They are needed for the calculation of turbulent fluxes in the surface layer and often rely on the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory requiring universal stability functions. The problem of a derivation of transfer coefficients based on different stability functions has been considered by many researchers over the years but it remains to this day. In this work, dedicated to the memory of S.S. Zilitinkevich, we also address this task, and obtain transfer coefficients from three pairs of theoretically derived stability functions suggested by Zilitinkevich and co-authors for stable conditions. Additionally, we construct non-iterative parametrizations of these transfer coefficients based on earlier work. Results are compared with state-of-the-art coefficients for land, ocean, and sea ice. The combined parametrizations form a package in a universal framework relying on a semi-analytical solution of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory equations. A comparison with data of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean campaign (SHEBA) over sea ice reveals large differences between the coefficients for land conditions and the measurements over sea ice. However, two schemes of Zilitinkevich and co-authors show, after slight modification, good agreement with SHEBA although they had not been especially developed for sea ice. One pair of the modified transfer coefficients is superior and is compatible to earlier SHEBA-based parametrizations. Finally, an algorithm for practical use of all transfer coefficients in climate models is given.","Springer","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Across California’s mountains, substantial declines (30–100% loss) in median peak annual snow water equivalent accompany changes in snow seasonality throughout the region compared to the historic period. We find that 80% of historic seasonal snowpacks transition to ephemeral conditions. Subsetting empirical-statistical wildfire projections for California by snow seasonality transition regions indicates a two-to-four-fold increase in the area burned, consistent with recent observations of high elevation wildfires following extended drought conditions. By analyzing six of the major California snow-fed river systems, we demonstrate snowpack reductions and seasonality transitions result in concomitant declines in annual runoff (47–58% of historical values).

An observed southward shift in tropical rainfall over land between 1950 and 1985, followed by a weaker recovery post-1985, has been attributed to anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing and cooling of the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere. We might therefore expect models that have a strong historic hemispheric contrast in aerosol forcing to simulate a further northward tropical rainfall shift in the near-term future when anthropogenic aerosol emission reductions will predominantly warm the Northern Hemisphere. We investigate this paradigm using a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of transient coupled ocean–atmosphere climate simulations that span a range of aerosol radiative forcing comparable to multi-model studies. In the 20th century, in our single-model ensemble, we find no relationship between the magnitude of pre-industrial to 1975 inter-hemispheric anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing and tropical precipitation shifts. Instead, tropical precipitation shifts are associated with major volcanic eruptions and are strongly affected by internal variability. However, we do find a relationship between the magnitude of pre-industrial to 2005 inter-hemispheric anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing and future tropical precipitation shifts over 2006 to 2060 under scenario RCP8.5. Our results suggest that projections of tropical precipitation shifts will be improved by reducing aerosol radiative forcing uncertainty, but predictive gains may be offset by temporary shifts in tropical precipitation caused by future major volcanic eruptions.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The definition and detection of ARs over Antarctica accounts for large uncertainty in AR metrics, and consequently, impacts quantification. We find that Antarctic-specific detection tools consistently capture the AR footprint inland over ice sheets, whereas most global detection tools do not. Large-scale synoptic environments and associated ARs, however, are broadly consistent across detection tools. Using data from the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project and global reanalyses, we quantify the uncertainty in Antarctic AR metrics and evaluate large-scale environments in the context of decadal and interannual modes of variability. The Antarctic western hemisphere has stronger connections to both decadal and interannual modes of variability compared to East Antarctica, and the Indian Ocean Dipole’s influence on Antarctic ARs is stronger while in phase with El Nino Southern Oscillation.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-08-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters Journal Volume: 49 Journal Issue: 16","","Medium: X","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276","10.1029/2022GL099577","","2022-08-29T00:00:00Z","1883633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1883633","","Geophysical Research Letters","16","49"

But little research to date investigates if, and to what extent, there are social inequalities in climate change-attributed extreme weather event impacts. Here, we use climate change attribution science paired with hydrological flood models to estimate climate change-attributed flood depths and damages during Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. Using detailed land-parcel and census tract socio-economic data, we then describe the socio-spatial characteristics associated with these climate change-induced impacts. We show that 30 to 50% of the flooded properties would not have flooded without climate change. Climate change-attributed impacts were particularly felt in Latina/x/o neighborhoods, and especially so in Latina/x/o neighborhoods that were low-income and among those located outside of FEMA’s 100-year floodplain. Our focus is thus on climate justice challenges that not only concern future climate change-induced risks, but are already affecting vulnerable populations disproportionately now.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Evaluation of WRF simulation of deep convection in the US Southern Great Plains","Pryor, S. C.; Letson, F.; Shepherd, T.; Barthelmie, R. J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The Southern Great Plains (SGP) exhibits a relatively high frequency of periods with extremely high rainfall rates (RR) and hail. Here, seven months of 2017 are simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model applied at convection permitting resolution with the Mibrandt-Yau microphysics scheme. Simulation fidelity is evaluated, particularly during intense convective events, using data from ASOS stations, dual-polarization RADAR, gridded data sets and observations at the DoE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site. The spatial gradients and temporal variability of precipitation and the cumulative density functions for both RR and wind speeds exhibit fidelity. Odds ratios >1 indicate WRF is also skillful in simulating high composite reflectivity (cREF, used as a measure of widespread convection) and RR > 5 mmhr<sup>–1</sup> over the domain. Detailed analyses of the ten days with highest spatial coverage of cREF >30 dBZ show spatially similar reflectivity fields and high RR in both RADAR data and WRF simulations. However, during periods of high reflectivity, WRF exhibits a positive bias in terms of very high RR (> 25 mmhr<sup>–1</sup>) and hail occurrence, and during the summer and transition months, maximum hail size is underestimated. For some renewable energy applications fidelity is required with respect to the joint probabilities of wind speed and RR and/or hail. While partial fidelity is achieved for the marginal probabilities, performance during events of critical importance to these energy applications is currently not sufficient. Further research into optimal WRF configurations in support of potential damage quantification for these applications is warranted.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Observations and retrievals of liquid water path (LWP), cloud condensation nuclei concentration (NCCN), cloud depth, and cloud duration of more than 3000 separate warm clouds sampled during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign are analyzed in this work. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models are applied to assess the relative impact of these variables on RR. Overall, RR tends to increase as cloud depth, LWP, and cloud duration increase, or NCCN decreases. Cloud depth affects RR the most while NCCN impacts it the least. When considering over 170 warm clouds observed at least 1 hour in which in-cloud turbulence is retrieved, the effect of NCCN on RR remains most likely suppressive, but it is not significant at a 75% level for MLR and is highly uncertain for RF. The impact of in-cloud turbulence depends on the moment and location it is sampled. Cloud base turbulence around the time of RR suppresses RR, while cloud top turbulence effects are inconclusive. Possible difficulties in isolating robust CCN and turbulence effects on RR are discussed.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Extrapolating Contaminant Effects from Individuals to Populations: A Case Study on Nanoparticle Toxicity to <em>Daphnia</em> Fed Environmentally Relevant Food Levels","Stevenson, Louise M.; Krattenmaker, Katherine E.; McCauley, Edward; Nisbet, Roger M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Ecological risk assessment (ERA) is charged with assessing the likelihood a chemical will have adverse environmental or ecological effects. When assessing the risk of a potential contaminant to biological organisms, ecologists are most concerned with the sustainability of populations of organisms, rather than protecting every individual. However, ERA most commonly relies on data on the effect of a potential contaminant on individuals because these experiments are more feasible than costly population-level exposures. In this work, we address the challenge of extrapolating these individual-level results to predict population-level effects. Previous per-capita population growth rate estimates calculated from individual-level exposures of Daphnia pulicaria to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at different food rations predict a critical daily food requirement for daphnid populations exposed to 200 μg/L AgNPs to avoid extinction. To test this, we exposed daphnid populations to the same AgNP concentration at three different food inputs, with the lowest ration close to the extinction threshold predicted from data on individuals. The two populations with the higher food inputs persisted, and the population with the lowest food input went extinct after 50 days but did persist through two generations. Further, we demonstrate that we can extrapolate between these levels of biological organization by parameterizing an individual-level biomass model with data on individuals’ response to AgNPs and using these parameters to predict the outcome for control and AgNP-exposed populations. Key to successful extrapolation is careful modeling of temporal changes in resource density, driven by both the experimental protocols and feedback from the consumer. The implication for ecotoxicology is that estimates of extinction thresholds based on studies of individuals may be reliable predictors of population outcomes, but only with careful treatment of resource dynamics.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Several improvements focused on the vertical thermodynamics have been made in the model. Results from a series of one-dimensional experiments show that equilibrium ice thickness in our modified model is increased by about 45 cm when compared with the original Winton’s model. Sensitivity tests indicate that all modifications mentioned above contribute to this change of ice thickness, among which the increase of ice layer has the most significant effect followed by the sea ice conductivity parameterization. The modified thermodynamic sea ice model is then coupled into the sea ice component SIS in GFDL MOM4 to exert long-term integration experiments forced by CORE2.0 data. Results indicate that the modified model shows significant improvement in simulating the Arctic sea ice, including an increase in both the sea ice thickness and volume over the whole Arctic region. This confirms the above founding from 1-D simulations.","Elsevier","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Key Research and Development Program of China","","United States","2022-08-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Modelling; Journal Volume: 178","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 102096","","","SC0022070; 2018YFC1407104","Journal ID: ISSN 1463-5003","10.1016/j.ocemod.2022.102096","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970379","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970379","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1970379","Ocean Modelling","","178"
"Estimating mass-absorption cross-section of ambient black carbon aerosols: theoretical, empirical, and machine learning models","Li, Hanyang; May, Andrew A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The mass-absorption cross-section of black carbon (MAC<sub>BC</sub>) is an essential parameter to link the atmospheric concentration of black carbon (BC) with its radiative forcing. When a direct calculation of MAC<sub>BC</sub> based on observations of aerosol light absorption and BC mass concentration is impossible, we rely on modeling and simulations to estimate MAC<sub>BC</sub>, but currently, there is no consensus model that can be relied on for accurate predictions across all atmospheric environments when BC particles have different coating thicknesses. Here, we applied five MAC<sub>BC</sub> prediction models (including three light scattering theories, an empirical model based on observations of particle mass concentrations, and a machine learning model developed in our previous work) to aerosols from three Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) field campaigns. While many studies have found that increasing the complexity of the models helps to constrain biases of the estimated MAC<sub>BC</sub>, our effort is to evaluate the models based on the criteria of simplicity and accuracy. We find that our machine learning model (support vector machine for regression, SVM) generally performs well across all DOE ARM field campaign data, while the accuracy of core-shell Mie theory depends on the bias correction algorithm applied to filter-based light absorption data. Generally, the empirical model for internally-mixed particles that we considered tends to over-predict MAC<sub>BC</sub>, while Mie theory for externally-mixed particles tends to under-predict MAC<sub>BC</sub>. An examination of the influence of coating material on BC cores suggests that the performance of our current SVM model is degraded when the BC is thickly-coated (e.g., it has undergone aging and mixing with other materials in the atmosphere).","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the interactions between cropland and climate are usually poorly represented due to a lack of detailed representation in crop types and field management. Here, we coupled the Noah-MP-Crop model with the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to explore and evaluate the crop growth dynamics in response to climate variations across Northeast China. The default parameters of the crop model were not exactly suitable for the agricultural ecosystems in Northeast China. The detailed cropland distribution, and crop phenology parameters including growing degree days (GDD) and planting (harvesting) date were first created using multi-source remote sensing products and reanalysis data, and was then successfully used to simulate the growth and yield for corn and soybean and associated energy exchanges. We also optimized and calibrated other crop parameters using the time-series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface products. The modified crop model substantially improved the simulation of crop growth, plant physiology, and biomass accumulation for both corn and soybean. Coupling the localized dynamic crop model into the WRF led to considerable decreases in the simulated mean-absolute-errors (MAEs) and biases of the leaf area index, evapotranspiration, and gross primary production compared with the MODIS observed values. Compared with the statistical yield from each province, the modified crop model underestimated the corn yield from 11.1% to 48.6%, whereas overestimated the soybean yield from 16.5% to 162.6%.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The land surface temperature of croplands during the growing season showed a decreasing trend, suggesting negative surface temperature feedback to crop greening of agricultural ecosystems in mid-high latitude Northeast China. Here, using time-series remote sensing products and long-term scenario simulations, the present study highlights that crop greening can slow climate warming. Our study noted a stronger surface cooling effect induced by crop greening during the growing season in the day than at the night, which contributed to asymmetric diurnal temperature cycle changes in Northeast China. In addition, our biophysical mechanism analysis revealed aerodynamic and surface resistances as the major driving factors for the daytime land surface temperature (LST) cooling effect induced by crop greening, while the ground heat flux and ambient temperature feedback as the major attributes of the nighttime LST cooling impact due to crop greening.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we examine the role of accessory binding modules at industrially relevant PET solids loadings necessary for cost-effective enzymatic recycling. Using a thermostable variant of leaf compost cutinase (LCC), we produced synthetic fusion constructs of LCC with five type A carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). At solids loadings below 10 wt%, the CBMs improve aromatic monomer yield from PET, but above this threshold, conversion extents up to 97% are reached with no added benefits from the presence of CBM fusions. This suggests that fusion constructs with the herein studied CBMs are not necessary for industrial enzymatic PET recycling.","Cell Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

(Quart. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 2019, 145, 1535–1550) is extended to include moisture and horizontal wind shear. Turbulent kinetic energy is introduced as a prognostic variable, dependence on a diagnosed boundary-layer height is removed, and subfilter fluxes are approximated using a two-fluid version of a Mellor–Yamada scheme. Three mechanisms for entrainment and detrainment processes are introduced, which represent entrainment of unstable air at the surface, forced detrainment of air at the top of the boundary/cloud layers, and turbulent mixing that relaxes the convective fluid to a reference profile. A semi-implicit Eulerian discretization replaces the semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian implementation of Thuburn et al. (Quart. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 2019, 145, 1535–1550) to improve numerical stability and conservation. The equations for the implicit time step are solved using a quasi-Newton method, which is shown to perform well in numerical tests for conservation and convergence.

Here, we use the first principle and classical molecular simulations to probe the impact of nanoconfinement on physicochemical processes at the rock–water–CO<sub>2</sub> interface. We choose nanoporous calcium–silicate–hydrate (C–S–H) and forsterite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) as model metal silicate surfaces that are of significance in cement chemistry and geochemistry communities, respectively. We show that while a nanometer-thick interfacial water film persists at unsaturated conditions consistent with in situ infrared spectroscopy, the phase behavior of the water–CO<sub>2</sub> mixture changes from its bulk counterpart depending on the surface chemistry and nanoconfinement. We also observe enhanced solubility at the interface of water and CO<sub>2</sub> phases, which could amplify the CO<sub>2</sub> speciation rate. Additionally, through free energy calculations, we show that CO<sub>2</sub> could be found in a metastable state near the C–S–H surface, which can potentially react with surface water and hydroxyl groups to form carbonic acid and bicarbonate. These findings support the explicit consideration of nanoconfinement effects in reactive and non-reactive pore-scale processes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we present a modification of BI, the Entropic Braiding Index (eBI), which augments the information content in BI by using Shannon Entropy to encode the diversity of channels in each cross section. eBI is interpreted as the number of “effective channels” per cross-section, allowing a direct comparison with the traditional BI. We demonstrate the potential of the ratio BI/eBI to quantify channel disparity, differentiate types of multi-thread systems (braided vs. anastomosed), and assess the effect of discharge variability, such as seasonal flooding, on river cross-section stability.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

To investigate the robustness of ceilometer-estimated PBLHT under different atmospheric conditions, we compared ceilometer- and radiosonde-estimated PBLHTs using multiple years of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) ceilometer and balloon-borne sounding data at ARM fixed-location atmospheric observatories and from ARM mobile facilities deployed around the world for various field campaigns. These observatories cover from the tropics to the polar regions and over both ocean and land surfaces. Statistical comparisons of ceilometer-estimated PBLHTs from the Vaisala CL31 ceilometer data with radiosonde-estimated PBLHTs from the ARM PBLHT-SONDE Value-added Product (VAP) are performed under different atmospheric conditions including stable and unstable atmospheric boundary layer, low-level cloud-free conditions, and cloudy conditions at these ARM observatories. Under unstable conditions, good comparisons are found between ceilometer- and radiosonde-estimated PBLHTs at ARM low- and mid-latitude land observatories. However, it is still challenging to obtain reliable PBLHT estimations over ocean surfaces even using radiosonde data. Under stable conditions, ceilometer- and radiosonde-estimated PBLHTs have weak correlations. We compare different PBLHT estimations utilizing the Heffter, the Liu–Liang, and the bulk Richardson number methods applied to radiosonde data with ceilometer-estimated PBLHT. We find that ceilometer-estimated PBLHT compares better with the Liu–Liang method under unstable conditions and compares better with the bulk Richardson number method under stable conditions.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We present a cross-comparison and accuracy assessment of Google’s Dynamic World (DW), ESA’s World Cover (WC) and Esri’s Land Cover (Esri) products for the first time in order to inform the adoption and application of these maps going forward. For the year 2020, the three global LULC maps show strong spatial correspondence (i.e., near-equal area estimates) for water, built area, trees and crop LULC classes. However, relative to one another, WC is biased towards over-estimating grass cover, Esri towards shrub and scrub cover and DW towards snow and ice. Using global ground truth data with a minimum mapping unit of 250 m<sup>2</sup>, we found that Esri had the highest overall accuracy (75%) compared to DW (72%) and WC (65%). Across all global maps, water was the most accurately mapped class (92%), followed by built area (83%), tree cover (81%) and crops (78%), particularly in biomes characterized by temperate and boreal forests. The classes with the lowest accuracies, particularly in the tundra biome, included shrub and scrub (47%), grass (34%), bare ground (57%) and flooded vegetation (53%). When using European ground truth data from LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) with a minimum mapping unit of <100 m<sup>2</sup>, we found that WC had the highest accuracy (71%) compared to DW (66%) and Esri (63%), highlighting the ability of WC to resolve landscape elements with more detail compared to DW and Esri. Although not analyzed in our study, we discuss the relative advantages of DW due to its frequent and near real-time data delivery of both categorical predictions and class probability scores. We recommend that the use of global LULC products should involve critical evaluation of their suitability with respect to the application purpose, such as aggregate changes in ecosystem accounting versus site-specific change detection in monitoring, considering trade-offs between thematic resolution, global versus. local accuracy, class-specific biases and whether change analysis is necessary. We also emphasize the importance of not estimating areas from pixel-counting alone but adopting best practices in design-based inference and area estimation that quantify uncertainty for a given study area.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We integrate a plant productivity-optimizing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) acquisition model (fixation & uptake of nutrients, FUN) into the energy exascale Earth system (E3SM) land model (ELM). Global plant N and P uptake are dynamically simulated by ELM-FUN based on the C costs of nutrient acquisition from mycorrhizae, direct root uptake, retranslocation from senescing leaves, and biological N fixation. We benchmarked ELM-FUN with three classes of products: ILAMB, a remotely sensed nutrient limitation product, and CMIP6 models; we found significant improvements in C cycle variables, although the lack of more observed nutrient data prevents a comprehensive level of benchmarking. Overall, we found N and P co-limitation for 80% of land area, with the remaining 20% being either predominantly N or P limited. Globally, the new model predicts that plants invested 4.1 Pg C yr<sup>–1</sup> to acquire 841.8 Tg N yr<sup>–1</sup> and 48.1 Tg P yr<sup>–1</sup> (1994–2005), leading to significant downregulation of global net primary production (NPP). Global NPP is reduced by 20% with C costs of N and 50% with C costs of NP. Modeled and observed nutrient limitation agreement increases when N and P are considered together (r<sup>2</sup> from 0.73 to 0.83).","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We find that over 1871-1980, the Earth warmed with feedbacks largely consistent and strongly correlated with long term climate sensitivity feedbacks (diagnosed from corresponding atmosphere-ocean GCM abrupt 4xCO2 simulations). Post 1980 however, the Earth warmed with unusual trends in tropical Pacific SSTs (enhanced warming in the west, cooling in the east) and cooling in the Southern Ocean that drove climate feedback to be uncorrelated with – and indicating much lower climate sensitivity than – that expected for long-term CO<sub>2</sub> increase. We show that these conclusions are not strongly dependent on the AMIP II SST dataset used to force the AGCMs, though the magnitude of feedback post 1980 is generally smaller in nine AGCMs forced with alternative HadISST1 SST boundary conditions. We quantify a ‘pattern effect’ (defined as the difference between historical and longterm CO<sub>2</sub> feedback) equal to 0.48 ± 0.47 [5-95%] W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> for the time-period 1871-2010 when the AGCMs are forced with HadISST1 SSTs, or 0.70 ± 0.47 [5-95%] W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> when forced with AMIP II SSTs. Assessed changes in the Earth’s historical energy budget agree with the AGCM feedback estimates.

The sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation strongly regulates global vegetation dynamics and their responses to drought, yet sensitivity changes in response to climate change remain poorly understood. Here we use long-term satellite observations combined with a dynamic statistical learning approach to examine changes in the sensitivity of vegetation greenness to precipitation over the past four decades. We observe a robust increase in precipitation sensitivity (0.624% yr<sup>–1</sup>) for drylands, and a decrease (–0.618% yr<sup>–1</sup>) for wet regions. Using model simulations, we show that the contrasting trends between dry and wet regions are caused by elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>). eCO<sub>2</sub> universally decreases the precipitation sensitivity by reducing leaf-level transpiration, particularly in wet regions. However, in drylands, this leaf-level transpiration reduction is overridden at the canopy scale by a large proportional increase in leaf area. The increased sensitivity for global drylands implies a potential decrease in ecosystem stability and greater impacts of droughts in these vulnerable ecosystems under continued global change.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, such mesoscale-to-microscale coupled modeling frame works are potentially aected by a large number of uncertain closure parameters. Here we investigate the sensitivity associated with six closure parameters related to a 1.5-order subgrid-scale turbulence closure for an ensemble of mesoscale-coupled LES. The simulations are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting model nested from horizontal resolutions of greater than a kilometer down to tens of meters. Closure parameters are varied to generate perturbed parameter ensembles for two case studies of highly sheared, convective boundary layers observed in the Columbia Basin of Oregon and Washington during the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2). Machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting are used to explore the sensitivity of LES predictions, considering the eects of the perturbed physical parameters alongside categorical factors such as the case study identity, measurement location, and LES resolution. For the conditions we examine, a single parameter, the eddy viscosity coecient, is the dominant source of parametric sensitivity and its importance is comparable to the categorical factors for many of the simulation response variables we examine.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although continued metric developments enable model developers to better understand the impacts of decisions made in the model design process, metrics also have implications for the characterization of uncertainty and facilitating analyses of underlying physical processes.

Our results show secondary organic aerosol formation during the initial 3 days of transport, followed by decreases in organic aerosol via photolysis before reaching equilibrium. Aerosol absorption wavelength dependency decreases with ageing, due to an increase in particle size and photochemical bleaching of brown carbon. Cloud processing, including aqueous-phase reaction and scavenging, contributes to the oxidation of organic aerosols, while it strongly reduces large diameter particles and single-scattering albedo of biomass burning aerosols. Together, these processes resulted in a marine boundary layer with fewer yet more oxidized and absorbing aerosols.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Application of machine learning approaches in the analysis of mass absorption cross-section of black carbon aerosols: Aerosol composition dependencies and sensitivity analyses","May, Andrew A.; Li, Hanyang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Physics-based models typically require an in-depth understanding of a phenomenon and assumptions of the underlying process(es), which are often hard to obtain in practice, whereas data-driven machine learning models learn the structure and patterns in the training data without any prior theoretical assumptions and then use inference to develop useful predictions. A novel machine learning-based algorithm has been previously developed for the prediction of black carbon mass absorption cross-section (MAC<sub>BC</sub>) and applied to a variety of different atmospheric environments. In contrast to light scattering theories which require assumptions about the underlying physics, this algorithm uses time-series data of aerosol properties to estimate the temporally-varying MAC<sub>BC</sub> at 870 nm. Here, we analyze our algorithm and discuss the influence of aerosol optical properties (such as Ångström exponents and single scattering albedo) and chemical composition on the model outputs and the associated accuracy. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity analyses on our models to understand how the predictions change in response to different sets of input variables. Our support vector machine (SVM) for regression model is the least sensitive to variations in the input variables, although all models tend to exhibit a degradation to their accuracy when scattering Ångström exponents are less than one.","American Association for Aerosol Research","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

However, the spatial distribution of snow is not well understood, and therefore, it is not well modeled, which can lead to substantial uncertainties in snow cover representations. To capture key hydro-ecological controls on snow spatial distribution, we carried out intensive field studies over multiple years for two small (2017–2019; ~ 2.5 km<sup>2</sup>) sub-Arctic study sites located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Using an intensive suite of field observations (> 22 000 data points), we developed simple models of the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) using factors such as topographic characteristics, vegetation characteristics based on greenness (normalized different vegetation index, NDVI), and a simple metric for approximating winds. The most successful model was random forest, using both study sites and all years, which was able to accurately capture the complexity and variability of snow characteristics across the sites. Approximately 86 % of the SWE distribution could be accounted for, on average, by the random forest model at the study sites. Factors that impacted year-to-year snow distribution included NDVI, elevation, and a metric to represent coarse microtopography (topographic position index, TPI), while slope, wind, and fine microtopography factors were less important. The characterization of the SWE spatial distribution patterns will be used to validate and improve snow distribution modeling in the Department of Energy's Earth system model and for improved understanding of hydrology, topography, and vegetation dynamics in the sub-Arctic and Arctic regions of the globe.","Copernicus GmbH","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Drivers of Future Physical Water Scarcity and Its Economic Impacts in Latin America and the Caribbean","Birnbaum, Abigail; Lamontagne, Jonathan; Wild, Thomas B.; Dolan, Flannery; Yarlagadda, Brinda N.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; climate change; multisector dynamics; scenario discovery; water scarcity; integrated assessment modeling; Latin America","Future water scarcity is a global concern with significant impacts on the energy, water, and land (EWL) sectors. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are significant producers of agricultural goods consumed around the world, so disruptions resulting from land and water scarcity in LAC are a source of global supply chain risk. Understanding where water scarcity in LAC could occur and what could drive that scarcity to emerge is critical for strategic resource management and planning, both regionally and globally. Assessing future water scarcity impacts in LAC is challenging given the multisector dynamic interactions among the EWL sectors and the multiple uncertainties acting across different spatial scales. We use scenario discovery to explore the drivers of future water scarcity, considering assumptions related to climate, socioeconomics, and the EWL sectors. Understanding what factors drive uncertainty across outcomes can help stakeholders in targeting long-term solutions and future data collection efforts. To illuminate these dynamics, we use a database consisting of a large ensemble of scenarios representing diverse worlds simulated using the Global Change Analysis Model. We quantify future water scarcity and its economic impacts across the scenarios using three metrics: (1) physical water scarcity, (2) water price, and (3) crop profit. We find that physical water scarcity and water price are driven primarily by reservoir storage capacity assumptions, highlighting the importance of strategic water infrastructure development in maintaining future water availability and accessibility. Crop profit is driven by a combination of water supply and demand assumptions, which emphasizes the complex nature of EWL multisector dynamics. While most of LAC is poised to have abundant land and water resources available for development, water basins in Mexico and along the Pacific coast of South America experience high levels of severity and uncertainty across the future scenarios for at least one of the metrics. We find that the drivers of extreme scarcity vary spatially and across the metrics, further highlighting the heterogeneity of the region and the importance of considering multiple metrics to assess water scarcity vulnerability.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Microphysical piggybacking is to run a single simulation applying two microphysical schemes, the first scheme driving the simulation and the second piggybacking this simulated flow. “Driving the simulation” means that the simulated microphysical processes, affect the cloud buoyancy and thus force the simulated flow. In contrast, the piggybacking variables are advected by the simulated flow and undergo microphysical transformation, but they do not affect the simulated flow (like in prescribed flow—kinematic—simulations). The two sets of variables (driver and piggybacker) include temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, and all microphysical variables. We provide details of implementing piggybacking into the WRF model, illustrate its applications, and demonstrate the benefits of this methodology in two idealized three-dimensional cases: (a) a squall line case applying two microphysics schemes, the Thompson bulk microphysics scheme and the University of Pécs/NCAR bin (UPNB) scheme. The piggybacking simulations revealed that the microphysics-dynamics interaction plays a more important role than the pure microphysical size sorting effect in the transition zone formation. (b) A case of daytime shallow-to-deep convective development over land. This case uses the UPNB scheme and contrasts convection developing in environments with either pristine or polluted cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).

The low-volatility products can enhance new particle formation and particle growth, and thus have influences on climate feedbacks. Here, we present the results of α-pinene and Δ-3-carene photooxidation experiments conducted in continuous-flow mode in an environmental chamber under several reaction conditions. The roles of oxidants, addition of NO, and VOC molecular structure in influencing SOA yield are illustrated. SOA yield from α-pinene photooxidation shows a weak dependence on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration, which is a proxy for HO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The high O/C ratios observed in the a-pinene photooxidation products suggest the production of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM). Addition of ozone to the chamber during low-NO<sub>x</sub> photooxidation experiments leads to higher SOA yield. With the addition of NO, the production of N-containing HOMs is enhanced and the SOA yield shows a modest, non-linear dependence on input NO concentration. Carene photooxidation leads to higher SOA yield than α-pinene under similar reaction conditions, which agrees with the lower volatility retrieved from evaporation kinetics experiments. These results improve the understanding of SOA formation from monoterpene photooxidation and could be applied to refine the representation of biogenic SOA formation in models.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Attribution of North American Subseasonal Precipitation Prediction Skill","Sun, Lantao; Hoerling, Martin P.; Richter, Jadwiga H.; Hoell, Andrew; Kumar, Arun; Hurrell, James W.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; North America; ENSO; Precipitation; Climate prediction; Forecast verification/skill","The skill of NOAA’s official monthly U.S. precipitation forecasts (issued in the middle of the prior month) has historically been low, having shown modest skill over the southern United States, but little or no skill over large portions of the central United States. The goal of this study is to explain the seasonal and regional variations of the North American subseasonal (weeks 3–6) precipitation skill, specifically the reasons for its successes and its limitations. The performances of multiple recent-generation model reforecasts over 1999–2015 in predicting precipitation are compared to uninitialized simulation skill using the atmospheric component of the forecast systems. This parallel analysis permits attribution of precipitation skill to two distinct sources: one due to slowly evolving ocean surface boundary states and the other to faster time-scale initial atmospheric weather states. A strong regionality and seasonality in precipitation forecast performance is shown to be analogous to skill patterns dictated by boundary forcing constraints alone. The correspondence is found to be especially high for the North American pattern of the maximum monthly skill that is achieved in the reforecast. The boundary forcing of most importance originates from tropical Pacific SST influences, especially those related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation. Furthermore, we discuss physical constraints that may limit monthly precipitation skill and interpret the performance of existing models in the context of plausible upper limits.","American Meteorological Society","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Weather and Forecasting; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2069-2085","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 0882-8156","10.1175/waf-d-22-0076.1","","2022-12-29T00:00:00Z","1903584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1903584","","Weather and Forecasting","11","37"
"Mixing Driven by Critical Reflection of Near-Inertial Waves over the Texas–Louisiana Shelf","Qu, Lixin; Thomas, Leif N.; Hetland, Robert D.; Kobashi, Daĳiro","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Coastal flows; Inertia–gravity waves; Mixing","Studies of internal wave-driven mixing in the coastal ocean have been focused on internal tides, while wind-driven near-inertial waves (NIWs) have received less attention in this regard. Here, this study demonstrates a scenario of NIW-driven mixing over the Texas–Louisiana shelf. Supported by a high-resolution simulation over the shelf, the NIWs driven by land–sea breeze radiate downward at a sharp front and enhance the mixing in the bottom boundary layer where the NIWs are focused because of slantwise critical reflection. The criterion for slantwise critical reflection of NIWs is ω=$\sqrt{f{^2}+s^{2}_{bot}N{^2}(1-s_{ρ}/s_{bot})}$ (where ω is the wave frequency, s<sub>bot</sub> is the bottom slope, and s<sub>ρ</sub> is the isopycnal slope), under the assumption that the mean flow is in a thermal wind balance and only varies in the slope-normal direction. The mechanism driving the enhanced mixing is explored in an idealized simulation. During slantwise critical reflection, NIWs are amplified with enhanced shear and periodically destratify a bottom boundary layer via differential buoyancy advection, leading to periodically enhanced mixing. Turbulent transport of tracers is also enhanced during slantwise critical reflection of NIWs, which has implications for bottom hypoxia over the Texas–Louisiana shelf.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The summer NHL GPP is about 80% of the tropical peak, but both regions are still highly uncertain. Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) provides an important proxy for photosynthetic carbon uptake. Here we optimize the OCS plant uptake fluxes across the NHL by fitting atmospheric concentration simulation with the GEOS-CHEM global transport model to the aircraft profiles acquired over Alaska during NASA's Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (2012–2015). We use the empirical biome-specific linear relationship between OCS plant uptake flux and GPP to derive the six plant uptake OCS fluxes from different GPP data. Such GPP-based fluxes are used to drive the concentration simulations. We evaluate the simulations against the independent observations at two ground sites of Alaska. The optimized OCS fluxes suggest the NHL plant uptake OCS flux of -247 Gg S year<sup>-1</sup>, about 25% stronger than the ensemble mean of the six GPP-based OCS fluxes. GPP-based OCS fluxes systematically underestimate the peak growing season across the NHL, while a subset of models predict early start of season in Alaska, consistent with previous studies of net ecosystem exchange. The OCS optimized GPP of 34 PgC yr<sup>-1</sup> for NHL is also about 25% more than the ensembles mean from six GPP data. Further work is needed to fully understand the environmental and biotic drivers and quantify their rate of photosynthetic carbon uptake in Arctic ecosystems.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

David; Steefel, Carl","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Climate change and other disturbances significantly impact hydrogeochemical exports from mountainous headwater catchments such as the Upper Colorado River Basin. Developing a mechanistic understanding of how the physical and chemical processes interact in time and space in an integrated manner is key to quantifying the future impacts of such disturbances. The hydrogeochemical response of a mountainous catchment in the 2010–2019 period is evaluated quantitatively using a high-resolution model that simulates integrated hydrology, and transport and reactions for selected solutes and minerals. The model assumes that pyrite is present only at depth while calcite is distributed uniformly, and captures the observed C-Q reasonably well. Distinct C-Q dynamics are observed in an average (WY16), a wet (WY17), and a dry (WY18) water year. The model also quantifies the water fraction from surface, shallow and deep groundwater compartments using tracers, and suggests greater groundwater contributions to peak stream discharge in the dry WY18. Results demonstrate that calcium concentrations do not change significantly from year to year, while sulfate shows significant temporal variability. Pyrite dissolution is affected by the changing hydrological drivers where it is enhanced in the dry WY18; calcite dissolution supplements calcium dilution under high flow conditions. The model simulates the reaction hotspots controlled by hydrological conditions, and the spatially-resolved results show that higher soil saturation and less snowpack occur earlier on the south-facing side than on the north-facing side. This is a first-of-its-kind demonstration of a model that integrates hydrologic processes, including evapotranspiration, and reactive transport to enable a predictive understanding of hydrogeochemical exports.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Data were collected in situ at seven small experimental prescribed burns at Ft. Jackson, an army base in South Carolina, USA. Using airborne laser scanning (ALS) to map overstory tree crowns and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to characterize understory shrub fuel density, both pre- and postburn estimates of sparkleberry coverage were obtained. Sparkleberry clump polygons were manually digitized from a UAV-derived orthoimage of the understory and intersected with the TLS point cloud-derived rasters of pre- and postburn shrub fuel bulk density; these were compared in relation to overstory crown cover as well as to ground truth. Shrub fuel consumption was estimated from the digitized images; sparkleberry clump distributions were generally found to not correlate well to the overstory tree crowns, suggesting it is shade-tolerant. Moreover, no relationship was found between the magnitude of the fuel consumption and the chemical composition of pyrolysis gases, even though mixing ratios of 25 individual gases were measured.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, there is a lack of consensus in the partitioning of the sink between vegetation and soil, where models do not even agree on the direction of change in carbon stocks over the past 60 years. This uncertainty is driven by plant productivity, allocation, and turnover response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (and to a smaller extent to LULCC), and the response of soil to LULCC (and to a lesser extent climate). Overall, differences in turnover explain ~70% of model spread in both vegetation and soil carbon changes.

Yet, climate models have difficulties in representing these clouds and, especially, their phase in this observationally sparse region. This study aims to increase the knowledge of SO cloud phase by presenting in-situ cloud microphysical observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol, Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES). We investigate the occurrence of ice in summertime marine stratocumulus and cumulus clouds in the temperature range between 6 and -25°C. Our observations show that in ice-containing clouds, maximum ice number concentrations of up to several hundreds per liter were found. The observed ice crystal concentrations were on average one to two orders of magnitude higher than the simultaneously measured ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the temperature range below -10°C and up to five orders of magnitude higher than estimated INP concentrations in the temperature range above -10°C. These results highlight the importance of secondary ice production (SIP) in SO summertime marine boundary-layer clouds. Evidence for rime splintering was found in the Hallett-Mossop (HM) temperature range but the exact SIP mechanism active at lower temperatures remains unclear. Finally, instrument simulators were used to assess simulated co-located cloud ice concentrations and the role of modeled HM rime-splintering. We found that CAM6 is deficient in simulating number concentrations across the HM temperature range with little sensitivity to the model HM process, which is inconsistent with the aforementioned observational evidence of highly active SIP processes in SO low-level clouds.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

For a subset of systems, temperature and humidity dependence of particle viscosity as well as dry glass transition temperature were characterized using the dual tandem differential mobility analyzer method. Eleven unique monoterpene, sesquiterpene and aromatic precursors were used to generate secondary organic material (SOM) using either an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) or an environmental chamber (EC). For the SOM for which viscosity was measured, the particle glass transition temperatures varied between 6 and 23°C (n = 8). Measurements were performed to verify that increased relative humidity did not plasticize the particles below -10°C at residence times similar to those in the ice nucleation instrument. No heterogeneous ice nucleation was observed at the ~0.5% onset threshold for any of the materials generated. The ice nucleation occurs by the freezing of SOM solution droplets consistent with homogeneous freezing indicating that they form an aqueous solution, or the SOM particles required water saturation to freeze, indicating that they were hydrophobic. Experiments exploring the influence of functional groups and mass loading did not reveal any obvious influence of particle chemistry or generation conditions on the results. Close structural matches between known organic ice nucleating particles as precursor or formed products did not yield materials that promoted freezing. These experiments suggest that heterogeneous ice formation of glassy secondary organic materials is likely uncommon under upper free tropospheric conditions.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The complex nature of wetland CH<sub>4</sub> processes makes it challenging to identify causal relationships for improving our understanding and predictability of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. In this study, we used the flux measurements of CH<sub>4</sub> from eddy covariance towers (30 sites from 4 wetlands types: bog, fen, marsh, and wet tundra) to construct a causality-constrained machine learning (ML) framework to explain the regulative factors and to capture CH<sub>4</sub> emissions at sub-seasonal scale. We found that soil temperature is the dominant factor for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in all studied wetland types. Ecosystem respiration (CO<sub>2</sub>) and gross primary productivity exert controls at bog, fen, and marsh sites with lagged responses of days to weeks. Integrating these asynchronous environmental and biological causal relationships in predictive models significantly improved model performance. More importantly, modeled CH<sub>4</sub> emissions differed by up to a factor of 4 under a +1°C warming scenario when causality constraints were considered. These results highlight the significant role of causality in modeling wetland CH<sub>4</sub> emissions especially under future warming conditions, while traditional data-driven ML models may reproduce observations for the wrong reasons.

"Explicit quantification of residence and flushing times in the Salish Sea using a sub-basin scale shoreline resolving model","Premathilake, Lakshitha; Khangaonkar, Tarang P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Salish sea; Tides; Currents; Tidal ellipses; Residence time; Flushing time; Model skill assessment","The Salish Sea, located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America has complex currents and circulation features distributed over numerous interconnected deep basins with islands. Increased risk of exposure to oil spills and untreated wastewater from maritime emergencies and treatment plant failures have led to a need for quantifying residence and flushing characteristics at a sub-basin scale using a shoreline resolving hydrodynamic model. An unstructured grid model of the Salish Sea was developed using FVCOM with a ≈75-100m shoreline resolution. In addition to 7 tides and 23 salinity and temperature monitoring stations, an extensive currents data set from 135 stations collected over a span of three years was used for skill assessment and validation. Explicit forward computations were then conducted to define and quantify residence and flushing times in various sub-basins of interest using (a) Lagrangian particles and (b) Numerical/virtual dye experiments. The results in most basins show expected seasonal variability with longer flushing time associated with summer lower tides and lower freshwater inflows. However, contrary to expectation, flushing time is significantly longer in wintertime in large fjord-like basins such as Hood Canal (≈138 days), likely due to increased stratification and reduced mixing. The flushing time for the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea is ≈115 days, while Georgia Basin is 240 days when analyzed as stand-alone basins with zero background concentrations. When examined as part of the flushing of the entire Puget Sound filled with virtual dye, the compounded flushing times for embedded sub-basins can be significantly longer in order of magnitudes and largely dictated by the flushing time of Puget Sound. The computed residence and flushing time scales tabulated over 36 sub-basins provide an improved understanding of water renewal in the system, informing pollution management actions.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Non‐Linear Dimensionality Reduction With a Variational Encoder Decoder to Understand Convective Processes in Climate Models","Behrens, Gunnar; Beucler, Tom; Gentine, Pierre; Iglesias‐Suarez, Fernando; Pritchard, Michael; Eyring, Veronika","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Deep learning can accurately represent sub-grid-scale convective processes in climate models, learning from high resolution simulations. However, deep learning methods usually lack interpretability due to large internal dimensionality, resulting in reduced trustworthiness in these methods. Here, we use Variational Encoder Decoder structures (VED), a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, to learn and understand convective processes in an aquaplanet superparameterized climate model simulation, where deep convective processes are simulated explicitly. We show that similar to previous deep learning studies based on feed-forward neural nets, the VED is capable of learning and accurately reproducing convective processes. In contrast to past work, we show this can be achieved by compressing the original information into only five latent nodes. As a result, the VED can be used to understand convective processes and delineate modes of convection through the exploration of its latent dimensions. A close investigation of the latent space enables the identification of different convective regimes: (a) stable conditions are clearly distinguished from deep convection with low outgoing longwave radiation and strong precipitation; (b) high optically thin cirrus-like clouds are separated from low optically thick cumulus clouds; and (c) shallow convective processes are associated with large-scale moisture content and surface diabatic heating. Our results demonstrate that VEDs can accurately represent convective processes in climate models, while enabling interpretability and better understanding of sub-grid-scale physical processes, paving the way to increasingly interpretable machine learning parameterizations with promising generative properties.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Columbia Univ., New York, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR); European Research Council (ERC); Columbia University; National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center","","United States","2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems Journal Volume: 14 Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X","","","SC0022331; 855187; PG010560-01; 2019625","Journal ID: ISSN 1942-2466","10.1029/2022MS003130","","2022-08-16T00:00:00Z","1881374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1881374","","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","8","14"
"How May the Choice of Downscaling Techniques and Meteorological Reference Observations Affect Future Hydroclimate Projections?","Rastogi, Deeksha; Kao, Shih‐Chieh; Ashfaq, Moetasim","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We present an intercomparison of a suite of high-resolution downscaled climate projections based on a six-member General Circulation Model (GCM) ensemble from Coupled Models Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The CMIP6 GCMs have been downscaled using dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques based on two meteorological reference observations over the conterminous United States. We use the regional climate model, RegCM4, for dynamical downscaling, double bias correction constructed analogs method for statistical downscaling, and Daymet and Livneh datasets as the reference observations for statistical training and bias-correction. We evaluate the performances of downscaled data in both historical and future periods under the SSP585 scenario. While dynamical downscaling improves the simulation of some performance evaluation indices, it adds an extra bias in others, highlighting the need for statistical correction before its use in impact assessments. Downscaled datasets after bias-correction compare exceptionally well with observations. However, the choice of downscaling techniques and the underlying reference observations influence the hydroclimate characteristics of downscaled data. For instance, the statistical downscaling generally preserves the GCMs climate change signal but overestimates the frequency of hot extremes. Similarly, simulated future changes are sensitive to the choice of reference observations, particularly for precipitation extremes that exhibit a higher projected increase in the ensembles trained and/or corrected by Daymet than Livneh. Overall, these results demonstrate that multiple factors, including downscaling techniques and reference observations, can substantially influence the outcome of downscaled climate projections and stress the need for a comprehensive understanding of such method-based uncertainties.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Observed and Projected Changes of Large‐Scale Environments Conducive to Spring MCS Initiation Over the US Great Plains","Song, Fengfei; Leung, L. Ruby; Feng, Zhe; Chen, Xingchao; Yang, Qiu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are frequent over the US Great Plains during spring. The link between large-scale environments and spring MCS initiation were well established. Here, historical and future changes of spring large-scale environments favorable for MCS initiation are investigated using an MCS tracking data set, ERA5 reanalysis, and 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. The frequency of Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ)-related MCS environments is found to have increased by ~41% from 1979 to 2019, consistent with the enhanced GPLLJ and more frequent MCSs. Comparing CMIP6 AMIP and historical experiments, we find that the observed GPLLJ strengthening and more frequent MCS environments are mainly due to the decadal sea-surface temperature variations rather than external forcings. Under a high emission scenario, the frequency of GPLLJ-related environments favorable for MCS initiation will increase by ~65% during 2015–2100, along with a stronger GPLLJ, suggesting more frequent MCSs over the US Great Plains in a warming world.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the first part of the study, we used a CH<sub>4</sub> release experiment to evaluate three common flux footprint models: the Hsieh model (Hsieh et&nbsp;al., 2000), the Kljun model (Kljun et&nbsp;al., 2015), and the K &amp; M model (Kormann and Meixner, 2001), finding that the K &amp; M model was the most accurate under these conditions. In the second part of the study, we introduce the Footprint-Weighted Flux Map, a new technique to map spatial heterogeneity in fluxes. Using artificial CH<sub>4</sub> release experiments, natural tracer approaches and flux chambers we mapped the spatial flux heterogeneity, and detected and validated a hot spot of CH<sub>4</sub> flux in a oligohaline restored marsh. Through chamber measurements during the months of April and May, we found that fluxes at the hot spot were on average as high as 6589&nbsp;±&nbsp;7889&nbsp;nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> whereas background flux from the open water were on average 15.2&nbsp;±&nbsp;7.5&nbsp;nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>.

A detection method is developed to quantify characteristics of the checkerboard signal by cataloguing all possible configurations of the eight adjacent neighbors for each cell on the model's cubed sphere grid using daily mean data. The checkerboard pattern is only found in cloud-related quantities, such as precipitation and liquid water path. Instances of pure and partial checkerboard are found to occur more often in E3SMv2 and E3SM-MMF when compared to satellite data regridded to the model grid. Continuous periods of partial checkerboard state are found to be more persistent in both models compared to satellite data, with E3SM-MMF exhibiting more persistence than E3SMv2. The checkerboard signal in E3SMv2 is found to be a direct consequence of the recently added deep convective trigger condition based on dynamically generated CAPE (DCAPE). In E3SM-MMF the checkerboard signal is found to be associated with the “trapping” of cloud-scale fluctuations within the embedded cloud-resolving model.

"Convective Updraft and Downdraft Characteristics of Continental Mesoscale Convective Systems in the Model Gray Zone","Wang, Dié; Prein, Andreas F.; Giangrande, Scott E.; Ramos‐Valle, Alexandra; Ge, Ming; Jensen, Michael P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Here, the ""gray zone"" of convective modeling is defined as the range of horizontal grid spacings (Δx) at which turbulent transport processes are only partially resolved by the dynamics of the numerical model. This zone typically covers Δx from a few kilometers to several hundred meters, wherein the realistic representation of convective cloud processes can be challenging. This study characterizes the convective draft behaviors at multiple Δx across the gray zone and determines the appropriate Δx that can reliably capture these salient convective properties. We perform an ensemble of idealized simulations of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model at various Δx from 4 km to 250 m over the central U.S. An evaluation of key MCS kinematic properties is constrained using unique, long-term vertical velocity estimates obtained by radar wind profilers deployed by the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility. MCS simulations for all Δx tested overestimate (underestimate) the probabilities of convective updrafts (downdrafts) compared to the observations. In terms of the convective draft intensity, finer-Δx models overestimate the updraft intensity, while the opposite is found for downdrafts. Moving from Δx = 4 km to 250 m, downdrafts become stronger and more frequent especially at middle and upper levels, attributed to additional drag from an increasing graupel frequency and compensation of enhanced updraft velocity. Simulated draft characteristics, including core size, intensity, and probability of occurrence, exhibit pronounced changes at Δx greater than 500 m, but suggest less sensitivity when Δx is reduced below 500 m.","American Geophysical Union","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Regional expressions of such changes have yet to be fully advanced and may require the use of regional downscaling. Here, we employ regional climate modeling (RCM) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at convection-permitting resolution and nested in output from the HadGEM2 ESM. We quantify ENSO teleconnections to temperature and precipitation anomalies in historical and future climate scenarios over eastern North America. Two paired simulations are run, a strong El Niño (positive ENSO phase) and a weak La Niña (negative ENSO phase), for the historical and future years. The HadGEM2 direct output and HadGEM2-WRF simulation output are compared to the anomalies derived from the NOAA ENSO Climate Normals dataset. The near-surface temperature and precipitation differences by ENSO phase, as represented by the HadGEM2-WRF historical simulations, show a poor degree of association with the NOAA ENSO Climate Normals, in part because of the large biases in the HadGEM2 model. Downscaling with the WRF model does improve the agreement with the observations, and large discrepancies remain. The model chain HadGEM2-WRF reverses the sign of the ENSO phase response over eastern North America under simulations of the future climate with high greenhouse gas forcing, but due to the poor agreement with the NOAA ENSO Climate Normals it is difficult to assign confidence to this prediction.</p>","MDPI AG","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Understanding the Drivers of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability using a Stochastic Model Hierarchy","Liu, Glenn; Kwon, Young-Oh; Frankignoul, Claude; Lu, Jian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Atlantic Multidecadal Variability; atmosphere-ocean interaction","The relative importance of ocean and atmospheric dynamics in generating Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) remains an open question. Comparisons between climate models with SLAB and fully-dynamic (FULL) ocean components are often used to explore this question, but cannot reveal how individual ocean processes generate these differences. We build a hierarchy of physically interpretable stochastic models to investigate the contribution of two upper-ocean processes to AMV: the role of seasonal variation and mixed-layer entrainment. This interpretability arises from the stochastic model’s simplified representation of sea surface temperature (SST), considering only the local upper ocean response to white-noise atmospheric forcing and its impact on surface heat exchange. We focus on understanding differences between SLAB and FULL non-eddy resolving pre-industrial control simulations of the Community Earth System Model 1 (CESM), and estimate the stochastic model parameters from each respective simulation. Despite its simplicity, the stochastic model reproduces temporal characteristics of SST variability in the SPG, including reemergence, seasonal-to-interannual persistence and power spectra. Furthermore, unrealistically persistent SST of the CESM-SLAB ocean simulation is reproduced in the equivalent stochastic model configuration where the mixed-layer depth (MLD) is constant. The stochastic model also reveals that vertical entrainment primarily damps SST variability, thus explaining why SLAB exhibits larger SST variance than FULL. Here, the stochastic model driven by temporally stochastic, spatially coherent forcing patterns reproduces the canonical AMV pattern. However, the amplitude of low-frequency variability remains underestimated, suggesting a role for ocean dynamics beyond entrainment.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While nutrient fluxes generally increase post-fire, the composition of organic matter (OM) transported to streams immediately following a fire is poorly constrained, yet can play an integral role in downstream water quality and biogeochemistry. Here, we quantified the spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved OM (DOM) chemistry for five streams burned by wildfires in Oregon, USA in 2020. We sampled over a 24-hour storm event one month after the fire, revealing variable temporal behavior in DOM dynamics. DOM chemistry was directly related with burn severity spatially. Specifically, nitrogen and aromatic character of DOM increased in streams burned at greater severity. Our results suggest a spatial overprinting of DOM dynamics immediately following fire activity and highlight a key gap in our knowledge of post-fire DOM transport to streams.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Coupling Warm Rain With an Eddy Diffusivity/Mass Flux Parameterization: 2. Sensitivities and Comparison to Observations","Smalley, M. A.; Suselj, K.; Lebsock, M. D.; Witte, M. K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Herein is the second part of the description and validation of the coupling of a warm-rain microphysics scheme to a stochastic multi-plume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux parameterization. Part 1 provides the model description and initial validation of the parameterization in a single column model (SCM) against large eddy simulations. This manuscript provides additional comparisons against satellite observations of 500 unique simulation cases, an analysis of model parameter-based sensitivities in those 500 cases, and an evaluation of the idealized LES case study paradigm for parameterization development. The SCM is forced by a weather reanalysis in the subtropical northeast Pacific region characterized by the stratocumulus-to-cumulus cloud transition. 18 scalar outputs are examined to identify the sensitivities to 22 of the model's parameters. The model is highly sensitive to parameters that determine the behavior of convective plumes, which collectively lead to the most sensitivity in 13 of the 18 outputs. Only a few parameters contribute sensitivities that are not highly correlated with those of other parameters. While forcing the model with two canonical field campaign cases results in similar picture of which parameters lead to high sensitivity in model outputs, the sensitivity magnitudes can be overestimated compared to when the model is forced by weather reanalyzes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"A Multicomponent Reactive Transport Model for Integrated Surface‐Subsurface Hydrology Problems","Molins, Sergi; Svyatsky, Daniil; Xu, Zexuan; Coon, Ethan T.; Moulton, J. David","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; reactive transport; integrated hydrology; modeling","Despite the widespread use of integrated hydrology models in a variety of applications, consideration of multicomponent reactive transport is still not common. The implementation of these processes requires coupling transport at the surface-subsurface interface and efficient solution of the non-linear geochemical model that is consistent with the integrated hydrology solution. The Advanced Terrestrial Simulator provides a flexible multiphysics framework that facilitated this process. In this work, the integrated reactive transport process kernel (PK) was weakly coupled to the integrated hydrology PK. In turn, integrated transport and reactions were coupled using an operator splitting approach. This splitting enabled an explicit solution of the integrated transport problem, including a novel algorithm to calculate exchange fluxes across the surface-subsurface interface and a point-by-point solution of the geochemical problem. Geochemical capabilities were added using well-established external codes, but rather than using a custom interface to each, a generic interface was used that clearly specifies the variables and operations used by the chemistry PK. The implementation is demonstrated with two example simulations: transport of a tracer in a soil column as it saturates over time and water ponds on the surface and reactive transport in a hillslope driven by successive wet-dry cycles that result in infiltration, runoff and exfiltration processes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Development of Land‐River Two‐Way Hydrologic Coupling for Floodplain Inundation in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model","Xu, Donghui; Bisht, Gautam; Zhou, Tian; Leung, L. Ruby; Pan, Ming","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; floodplain inundation dynamics; Earth System Model; land-river interactions; surface-subsurface interactions; satellite data","Floodplain inundation links river and land systems through significant water, sediment, and nutrient exchanges. However, these two-way interactions between land and river are currently missing in most Earth System Models. In this study, we introduced the two-way hydrological coupling between the land component, ELM, and the river component, MOSART, in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to study the impacts of floodplain inundation on land and river processes. We calibrated the river channel geometry and developed a new data-driven inundation scheme to improve the simulation of inundation dynamics in E3SM. The new inundation scheme captures 96% of the spatial variation of inundation area in a satellite inundation product at global scale, in contrast with 7% when the default inundation scheme of E3SM was used. Global simulations including the new inundation scheme performed at 0.5°×0.5° resolution with and without two-way land-river coupling were used to quantify the impact of coupling. Comparisons show that two-way coupling modifies the water and energy cycle in 20% of the global land cells. Specifically, riverine inundation is reduced by two-way coupling, but inland inundation is intensified. Wetter periods are more impacted by the two-way coupling at the global scale, while regions with different climates exhibit different sensitivities. The two-way exchange of water between the land and river components of E3SM provides the foundation for enabling two-way coupling of land-river sediment and biogeochemical fluxes. These capabilities will be used to improve understanding of the interactions between water and biogeochemical cycles and their response to human perturbations.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study, we correct numerical errors in ice microphysics processes of the WDM6, in which the cloud-ice shape is assumed as single bullets and examine the impact on regional climate simulations. Here, by rederiving the relationships between cloud microphysics characteristics, including the one linking the cloud-ice mixing ratio and number concentration, we remove numerical errors intrinsic to the description of cloud-ice characteristics in the original WDM6 microphysics scheme. The revised WDM6 is tested using a WRF framework for regional climate simulations over the East Asian region. We find that our correction to the WDM6 improves the model’s performance in capturing the observed distribution of the monsoon rain band. A reduction in cloud ice is significant in the revised WDM6, which strengthens the Western North Pacific High. By conducting the additional sensitivity experiment in which the characteristics of cloud-ice shape are revised as the one for the column type, our study also finds out that the impacts of the existing numerical errors on the simulated monsoon is as large as the ones of the changes in cloud-ice shape.","Springer","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The leading mode turns out to be the most dominant mode excited by the climate forcing of doubling CO<sub>2</sub>, alone capturing 56% of the total spatial variances of the surface temperature response. The pattern of the leading mode is partly organized by the atmospheric annular modes in both hemispheres, and further modulated by the feedbacks from ocean circulations. Though derived from a single model, the leading mode can capture the spatio-temporal variabilities of the global mean surface temperature over the past century in both the CMIP6 model simulations and observations. Moreover, the leading mode is most efficiently excited by radiative forcings from the midlatitude bands centered around 45°N and 25°S, where most human activities take place, suggesting the potency of human influence on the climate change.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Diffuse Radiation Forcing Constraints on Gross Primary Productivity and Global Terrestrial Evapotranspiration","Chakraborty, T.; Lee, X.; Lawrence, D. M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; diffuse radiation fertilization effect; gross primary productivity; evapotranspiration; land-surface models; atmosphere-biosphere interactions","The diffuse radiation fertilization effect—the increase in plant productivity in the presence of higher diffuse radiation (K<sub>↓,d</sub>)—is an important yet understudied aspect of atmosphere-biosphere interactions and can modify the terrestrial carbon, energy, and water budgets. The K<sub>↓,d</sub> fertilization effect links the carbon cycle with clouds and aerosols, all of which are large sources of uncertainties for our current understanding of the Earth system and for future climate projections. Here we establish to what extent observational and modeling uncertainty in sunlight's diffuse fraction (k<sub>d</sub>) affects simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) and terrestrial evapotranspiration (λE). We find only 48 eddy covariance sites with simultaneous sufficient measurements of K<sub>↓,d</sub> with none in the tropical climate zone, making it difficult to constrain this mechanism globally using observations. Using a land modeling framework based on the latest version of the Community Land Model, we find that global GPP ranges from 114 Pg C year<sup>–1</sup> when using k<sub>d</sub> forcing from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 reanalysis to a ~7% higher value of 122 Pg C year<sup>–1</sup> when using the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System satellite product, with especially strong differences apparent over the tropical region (mean increase ~9%). The differences in λE, although smaller (–0.4%) due to competing changes in shaded and sunlit leaf transpiration, can be greater than regional impacts of individual forcing agents like aerosols. Our results demonstrate the importance of comprehensively and systematically validating the simulated k<sub>d</sub> by atmosphere modules as well as the response to differences in k<sub>d</sub> within land modules across Earth System Models.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Sulfuric acid is a key contributor to new particle formation, though measurements of its gaseous concentrations are difficult to make. Several parameterizations to estimate sulfuric acid exist, all of which were constructed using measurements from the Northern Hemisphere. In this work, we report the first measurements of sulfuric acid from the Amazon basin. These measurements are consistent with concentrations measured in Hyytiälä, Finland, though, unlike Hyytiälä, there is no clear correlation of sulfuric acid with global radiation. There was a minimal difference in sulfuric acid observed between the wet and dry seasons in the Amazon basin. We also test the efficacy of existing proxies to estimate sulfuric acid in this region. Our results suggest that nighttime sulfuric acid production is due to both a stabilized Criegee intermediate pathway and oxidation of SO2 by OH, the latter of which is not currently accounted for in existing proxies. These results also illustrate the drawbacks of the common substitution of radiation for OH concentrations. None of the tested proxies effectively estimate sulfuric acid measurements at night. For estimates at all times of day, a recently published proxy based on data from the boreal forest should be used. If only daytime estimates are needed, several recent proxies that do not include the Criegee pathway are sufficient. More investigation of nighttime sulfuric acid production pathways is necessary to close the gap between measurements and estimates with existing proxies.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As energy systems transition away from the thermoelectric technologies that have traditionally balanced electricity supply and demand, hydropower and its representation in PCMs is of increasing importance. A limitation of PCMs applied to continental power grids with diverse generation portfolios is that hydropower generation is simulated without full consideration of complex river dynamics, leading to possible misrepresentation of grid flexibility and performance. In addition, data used in PCMs may reflect outdated operating policies. In this paper we propose a hydropower generation feasibility test for PCMs. The approach uses a detailed hydropower model to determine whether the hourly hydropower schedule from a PCM with simplified monthly parameterization can be attained after accounting for realistic river dynamics and operating policies, such as spill requirements and general water movement and balance through a cascade reservoir system. We perform this hydropower generation test for the ‘Big 10’ hydropower system on the Columbia River (part of the Western Interconnect of the United States), revealing 9% overestimation of available hydropower generation in a PCM solution in an average hydrologic year. Our evaluation provides insight on the cost and opportunities for better representing hydropower in PCMs.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Spectral and broadband albedos of Arctic sea ice were spatially and temporally sampled by on-ice observers along individual survey lines throughout the sunlit season (April–September, 2020) during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. The seasonal evolution of albedo for the MOSAiC year was constructed from spatially averaged broadband albedo values for each line. Specific locations were identified as representative of individual ice surface types, including accumulated dry snow, melting snow, bare and melting ice, melting and refreezing ponded ice, and sediment-laden ice. The area-averaged seasonal progression of total albedo recorded during MOSAiC showed remarkable similarity to that recorded 22 years prior on multiyear sea ice during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) expedition. In accord with these and other previous field efforts, the spectral albedo of relatively thick, snow-free, melting sea ice shows invariance across location, decade, and ice type. In particular, the albedo of snow-free, melting seasonal ice was indistinguishable from that of snow-free, melting second-year ice, suggesting that the highly scattering surface layer that forms on sea ice during the summer is robust and stabilizing. In contrast, the albedo of ponded ice was observed to be highly variable at visible wavelengths. Notable temporal changes in albedo were documented during melt and freeze onset, formation and deepening of melt ponds, and during melt evolution of sediment-laden ice. While model simulations show considerable agreement with the observed seasonal albedo progression, disparities suggest the need to improve how the albedo of both ponded ice and thin, melting ice are simulated.","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"On the Diffusivity of Moist Static Energy and Implications for the Polar Amplification Response to Climate Warming","Lu, Jian; Zhou, Wenyu; Kong, Hailu; Leung, Lai-Yung Ruby; Harrop, Bryce E.; Song, Fengfei","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; diffusivity; polar amplification; atmospheric circulation; eddies; mixing; transport; climate change","Energy balance models (EBMs) have been widely used in a range of climate problems, but the assumption of constant diffusivity in the parameterization of the moist static energy (MSE) flux can be hardly justified. We demonstrate in this study that the diffusive MSE flux can be derived from the basic energy balance equation with a few tolerable assumptions. The estimated diffusivity is both spatially and seasonally dependent, and its midlatitude average is then tested against several scaling theories for the midlatitude eddy diffusivity. The result supports the diffusivity theory of Held and Larichev (1996) modified for the moist atmosphere, affording a dynamics-based parameterization of MSE diffusivity. The implementation of the parameterization in an EBM leads to an interactive MSE diffusivity that accounts for the midlatitude eddy response to climate forcing perturbations. Under a uniform radiative forcing, the EBM with a diffusivity so parameterized produces a weakening of the midlatitude diffusivity and a modestly polar-amplified surface temperature response as an inevitable outcome under the dual constraints of the nonlinear Clausius-Clapeyron relation and the temperature gradient-dependent diffusivity, even in the absence of any poleward amplifying radiative feedbacks. As the consequence of more isothermal temperature and reduced diffusivity, the variance of the midlatitude surface temperature also decreases with warming.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Altered fire regimes are a fundamental cause and consequence of global change, impacting people and the biophysical systems on which they depend. As part of the newly emerging Anthropocene, marked by human-caused climate change and radical changes to ecosystems, fire danger is increasing, and fires are having increasingly devastating impacts on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystem services. Increasing fire danger is a vexing problem that requires deep transdisciplinary, trans-sector, and inclusive partnerships to address. Here, we outline barriers and opportunities in the next generation of fire science and provide guidance for investment in future research. We synthesize insights needed to better address the long-standing challenges of innovation across disciplines to (i) promote coordinated research efforts; (ii) embrace different ways of knowing and knowledge generation; (iii) promote exploration of fundamental science; (iv) capitalize on the “firehose” of data for societal benefit; and (v) integrate human and natural systems into models across multiple scales. Fire science is thus at a critical transitional moment. We need to shift from observation and modeled representations of varying components of climate, people, vegetation, and fire to more integrative and predictive approaches that support pathways toward mitigating and adapting to our increasingly flammable world, including the utilization of fire for human safety and benefit. Only through overcoming institutional silos and accessing knowledge across diverse communities can we effectively undertake research that improves outcomes in our more fiery future.","Oxford University Press","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Simulations of aerosol pH in China using WRF-Chem (v4.0): sensitivities of aerosol pH and its temporal variations during haze episodes","Ruan, Xueyin; Zhao, Chun; Zaveri, Rahul A.; He, Pengzhen; Wang, Xinming; Shao, Jingyuan; Geng, Lei","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Aerosol pH is a fundamental property of aerosols in terms of atmospheric chemistry and its impact on air quality, climate, and health. Precise estimation of aerosol pH in chemical transport models (CTMs) is critical for aerosol modeling and thus influences policy development that partially relies on results from model simulations. We report the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulated PM<sub>2.5</sub> pH over China during a period with heavy haze episodes in Beijing, and explore the sensitivity of the modeled aerosol pH to factors including emissions of nonvolatile cations (NVCs) and NH<sub>3</sub>, aerosol phase state assumption, and heterogeneous production of sulfate. We find that default WRF-Chem could predict spatial patterns of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pH over China similar to other CTMs, but with generally lower pH values, largely due to the underestimation of alkaline species (NVCs and NH<sub>3</sub>) and the difference in thermodynamic treatments between different models. Increasing NH<sub>3</sub> emissions in the model would improve the modeled pH in comparison with offline thermodynamic model calculations of pH constrained by observations. In addition, we find that the aerosol phase state assumption and heterogeneous sulfate production are important in aerosol pH predictions for regions with low relative humidity (RH) and high anthropogenic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, respectively. These factors should be better constrained in model simulations of aerosol pH in the future. Analysis of the modeled temporal trend of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pH in Beijing over a haze episode reveals a clear decrease in pH from 5.2 ± 0.9 in a clean period to 3.6 ± 0.5 in a heavily polluted period. The increased acidity under more polluted conditions is largely due to the formation and accumulation of secondary species including sulfuric acid and nitric acid, even though being modified by alkaline species (NVCs, NH<sub>3</sub>). Our result suggests that NO<sub>2</sub> oxidation is unlikely to be important for heterogeneous sulfate production during the Beijing haze as the effective pH for NO<sub>2</sub> oxidation of S(IV) is at a higher pH of ~6.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Towards a Unified Setup to Simulate Mid‐Latitude and Tropical Mesoscale Convective Systems at Kilometer‐Scales","Prein, Andreas F.; Ge, Ming; Valle, Alexandra Ramos; Wang, Dié; Giangrande, Scott E.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES","Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are the main source of precipitation in the tropics and parts of the mid-latitudes and are responsible for high-impact weather worldwide. Studies showed that deficiencies in simulating mid-latitude MCSs in state-of-the-art climate models can be alleviated by kilometer-scale models. However, whether these models can also improve tropical MCSs and whether we can find model settings that perform well in both regions is understudied. We take advantage of high-quality MCS observations collected over the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facilities in the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) and the Amazon basin near Manaus (MAO) to evaluate a perturbed physics ensemble of simulated MCSs with 4 km horizontal grid spacing. A new model evaluation method is developed that enables to distinguish biases stemming from spatiotemporal displacements of MCSs from biases in their reflectivity and cloud shield. Amazon MCSs are similarly well simulated across these evaluation metrics than SGP MCSs despite the challenges anticipated from weaker large-scale forcing in the tropics. Generally, SGP MCSs are more sensitive to the choice of model microphysics, while Amazon cases are more sensitive to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. Although our tested model physics combinations had strengths and weaknesses, combinations that performed well for SGP simulations result in worse results in the Amazon basin and vice versa. However, we identified model settings that perform well at both locations, which include the Thompson and Morrison microphysics coupled with the Yonsei University (YSU) PBL scheme and the Thompson scheme coupled with the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic PBL scheme.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As a key factor in dictating the development of the boundary layer, the entrainment process in the context of aerosol-boundary layer interactions is still poorly understood. Using comprehensive field observations made at a superstation in Beijing, we gain insight into the response of the entrainment process to aerosols. We found that high aerosol loading can significantly suppress the entrainment rate, breaking the conventional linear relationship between sensible heat fluxes and entrainment fluxes. Related to aerosol vertical distributions, aerosol heating effects can alter vertical heat fluxes, leading to a strong interaction between aerosols and the entrainment process in the upper boundary layer. Such aerosol-entrainment coupling can inhibit boundary layer development and explains the great sensitivity of observed entrainment rates to aerosols than can traditional calculations. The notable impact of aerosols on the entrainment process raises holistic thinking about the dynamic framework of the boundary layer in a polluted atmosphere, which may have a significant bearing on the dispersion of air pollutants and the land-atmosphere coupling.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Important role of stratospheric injection height for the distribution and radiative forcing of smoke aerosol from the 2019–2020 Australian wildfires","Heinold, Bernd; Baars, Holger; Barja, Boris; Christensen, Matthew; Kubin, Anne; Ohneiser, Kevin; Schepanski, Kerstin; Schutgens, Nick; Senf, Fabian; Schrödner, Roland; Villanueva, Diego; Tegen, Ina","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","More than 1 Tg smoke aerosol was emitted into the atmosphere by the exceptional 2019–2020 southeastern Australian wildfires. Triggered by the extreme fire heat, several deep pyroconvective events carried the smoke directly into the stratosphere. Once there, smoke aerosol remained airborne considerably longer than in lower atmospheric layers. The thick plumes traveled eastward, thereby being distributed across the high and mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, enhancing the atmospheric opacity. Due to the increased atmospheric lifetime of the smoke plume, its radiative effect increased compared to smoke that remains in lower altitudes. Global models describing aerosol-climate impacts lack adequate descriptions of the emission height of aerosols from intense wildfires. Here, we demonstrate, by a combination of aerosol-climate modeling and lidar observations, the importance of the representation of those high-altitude fire smoke layers for estimating the atmospheric energy budget. Through observation-based input into the simulations, the Australian wildfire emissions by pyroconvection are explicitly prescribed to the lower stratosphere in different scenarios. Based on our simulations, the 2019–2020 Australian fires caused a significant top-of-atmosphere (TOA) hemispheric instantaneous direct radiative forcing signal that reached a magnitude comparable to the radiative forcing induced by anthropogenic absorbing aerosol. Up to +0.50 W m<sup>-2</sup> instantaneous direct radiative forcing was modeled at TOA, averaged for the Southern Hemisphere (+0.25 W m<sup>-2</sup> globally) from January to March 2020 under all-sky conditions. At the surface, on the other hand, an instantaneous solar radiative forcing of up to -0.81 W m<sup>-2</sup> was found for clear-sky conditions, with the respective estimates depending on the model configuration and subject to the model uncertainties in the smoke optical properties. Since extreme wildfires are expected to occur more frequently in the rapidly changing climate, our findings suggest that high-altitude wildfire plumes must be adequately considered in climate projections in order to obtain reasonable estimates of atmospheric energy budget changes.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Characterizing vertical upper ocean temperature structures in the European Arctic through unsupervised machine learning","Thomas, Erin E.; Müller, Malte","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences; Self-organizing maps; Unsupervised neural network; Arctic ocean; Vertical temperature structures; Argo; CTD","In-situ observations of subsurface ocean temperatures are, in many regions, inconsistently distributed in time and space. These spatio-temporal inconsistencies in the observational network lead to difficulties in utilizing those observations effectively for ocean model evaluation or understanding larger-scale ocean characteristics. Model accuracy of subsurface ocean characteristics is especially important within regions that contain complex ocean structures. One such region is the European Arctic which not only contains several types of water masses with unique characteristics, but also wintertime sea ice coverage and complex bathymetry. This study presents an unsupervised neural networking technique that can be used in combination with traditional ocean model evaluation techniques to provide additional information on the accuracy of modeled vertical ocean temperature profiles. Self-organizing maps is an unsupervised machine learning technique that we apply to approximately twenty thousand Argo and CTD temperature profiles from 2012 to 2020 in the European Arctic to categorize the observed vertical ocean temperature structures in the top 150 m. The observed ocean profile categories, or neurons, defined by the self-organizing map show strong spatial and temporal dependencies. We then use the neuron weights, or the learned temperature profile structure of each neuron, to validate the spatial and temporal variability of modeled vertical temperature structures. This analysis gives us new insights about the model’s capabilities to reproduce specific vertical structures of the top-most ocean layer within different regions and seasons. Mapping modeled ocean temperature profiles onto the neuron-space of the observationally-defined self organized map highlights the potential of this method to advance our understanding of model deficiencies in that region.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

In the present paper, near-surface data during MOSAiC are used for the verification of the RCM COnsortium for Small-scale MOdel–Climate Limited area Mode (COSMO-CLM or CCLM). CCLM is used in a forecast mode (nested in ERA5) for the whole Arctic with 15 km resolution and is run with different configurations of sea ice data. These include the standard sea ice concentration taken from passive microwave data with around 6 km resolution, sea ice concentration from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared data and MODIS sea ice lead fraction data for the winter period. CCLM simulations show a good agreement with the measurements. Relatively large negative biases for temperature occur for November and December, which are likely associated with a too large ice thickness used by CCLM. The consideration of sea ice leads in the sub-grid parameterization in CCLM yields improved results for the near-surface temperature. ERA5 data show a large warm bias of about 2.5°C and an underestimation of the temperature variability.","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

With a complete cycle typically lasting almost 2.5 years, this quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is arguably the most predictable mode of atmospheric variability that is not linked to the changing seasons. Here, the QBO affects climate phenomena outside the tropical stratosphere, including ozone transport, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and its high predictability could enable better forecasts of these phenomena if models can accurately represent the coupling processes. Climate and forecasting models are increasingly able to simulate stratospheric oscillations resembling the QBO, but exhibit common systematic errors such as weak amplitude in the lowermost tropical stratosphere. Uncertainties about the waves that force the oscillation, particularly the momentum fluxes from small-scale gravity waves excited by deep convection, make its simulation challenging. Improved representation of the processes governing the QBO is expected to lead to better forecasts of the oscillation and its impacts, increased understanding of unusual events such as the two QBO disruptions observed since 2016, and more reliable future projections of QBO behaviour under climate change.","Springer Nature","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); NERC North Atlantic Climate System Integrated Study (ACSIS)","","United States","2022-08-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Reviews Earth & Environment; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 588-603","","","SC0022070; IA 1844590; 1642644; 1829373; 80NSSC17K0169; NE/N018001; NE/P006779/1","Journal ID: ISSN 2662-138X","10.1038/s43017-022-00323-7","","2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","1891516","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1891516","","Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","9","3"

"Newton trust-region methods with primary variable switching for simulating high temperature multiphase porous media flow","Park, Heeho D.; Paul, Matthew; Hammond, Glenn E.; Valocchi, Albert J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Nonisothermal; High temperature; Porous media; Multiphase flow; Miscible; Trust-region","Coupling multiphase flow with energy transport due to high temperature heat sources introduces significant new challenges since boiling and condensation processes can lead to dry-out conditions with subsequent re-wetting. The transition between two-phase and single-phase behavior can require changes to the primary dependent variables adding discontinuities as well as extending constitutive nonlinear relations to extreme physical conditions. Practical simulations of large-scale engineered domains lead to Jacobian systems with a very large number of unknowns that must be solved efficiently using iterative methods in parallel on high-performance computers. Performance assessment of potential nuclear repositories, carbon sequestration sites and geothermal reservoirs can require numerous Monte-Carlo simulations to explore uncertainty in material properties, boundary conditions, and failure scenarios. Due to the numerical challenges, standard NR iteration may not converge over the range of required simulations and require more sophisticated optimization method like trust-region. In this study, we use the open-source simulator PFLOTRAN for the important practical problem of the safety assessment of future nuclear waste repositories in the U.S. DOE geologic disposal safety assessment Framework. The simulator applies the PETSc parallel framework and a backward Euler, finite volume discretization. We demonstrate failure of the conventional NR method and the success of trust-region modifications to Newton’s method for a series of test problems of increasing complexity. Trust-region methods essentially modify the Newton step size and direction under some circumstances where the standard NR iteration can cause the solution to diverge or oscillate. Furthermore, we show how the Newton Trust-Region method can be adapted for Primary Variable Switching (PVS) when the multiphase state changes due to boiling or condensation. The simulations with high-temperature heat sources which led to extreme nonlinear processes with many state changes in the domain did not converge with NR, but they do complete successfully with the trust-region methods modified for PVS. This implementation effectively decreased weeks of simulation time needing manual adjustments to complete a simulation down to a day. Finally, we show the strong scalability of the methods on a single node and multiple nodes in an HPC cluster.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Atmospheric Structure Prediction for Infrasound Propagation Modeling Using Deep Learning","Albert, S. A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Infrasound is generated by a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Infrasonic waves travel through the dynamic atmosphere, which can change on the order of minutes to hours. Infrasound propagation largely depends on the wind and temperature structure of the atmosphere. Numerical weather prediction models are available to provide atmospheric specifications, but uncertainties in these models exist and they are computationally expensive to run. Machine learning has proven useful in predicting tropospheric weather using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. An LSTM network is utilized to make atmospheric specification predictions up to ~30 km for three different training and testing scenarios: (a) the model is trained and tested using only radiosonde data from the Albuquerque, NM, USA station, (b) the model is trained on radiosonde stations across the contiguous US, excluding the Albuquerque, NM, USA station, which was reserved for testing, and (c) the model is trained and tested on radiosonde stations across the contiguous US. Long Short-Term Memory predictions are compared to a state-of-the-art reanalysis model and show cases where the LSTM outperforms, performs equally as well, or underperforms in comparison to the state-of-the-art. Regional and temporal trends in model performance across the US are also discussed. Results suggest that the LSTM model is a viable tool for predicting atmospheric specifications for infrasound propagation modeling.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Sandia National Lab.

"Assessing Physical Relationships Between Atmospheric State, Fluxes, and Boundary Layer Stability at McMurdo Station, Antarctica","Dice, Mckenzie J.; Cassano, John J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Observations at McMurdo Station, Antarctica from 24 November 2015 through 3 January 2017 were used to characterize the physical relationships between boundary layer stability and atmospheric state and fluxes. The basis of this analysis was self-organizing maps (SOMs), a neural network algorithm, used to identify the range of potential temperature profiles present in the twice-daily radiosonde data during the ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) campaign. The SOM identified profiles ranging from strongly stable to weakly stable regimes over the lowest 500 m of the atmosphere. It was found that in the winter (MJJA), moderate and strongly stable regimes occur most frequently (61%), while weakly stable regimes dominate in the summer (DJ, 83.4%). The mechanisms responsible for the dominance of different stability regimes in each season were analyzed to determine why these regimes occur with varying frequency throughout the year. This analysis found that wind speed variations and radiative cooling are responsible for the stability observed in the winter, radiative warming, as well as weaker wind speeds, are responsible for summer weak stability, and stability variations in the transition seasons (FMA, SON) are characterized by a change in sign of net radiation with increasing stability, as wind speed changes little across stability regimes. Low-level jets were observed to occur about 50% of the time below areas of enhanced stability aloft and were observed most frequently in the transition seasons. The boundary layer depth, as determined by the Bulk Richardson number, was found to decrease with increasing stability.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Stream and ocean hydrodynamics mediate partial migration strategies in an amphidromous Hawaiian goby","Lisi, Peter J.; Hogan, J. Derek; Holt, Galen; Moody, Kristine N.; Wren, Johanna L. K.; Kobayashi, Donald R.; Blum, Michael J.; McIntyre, Peter B.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; amphidromy; bet-hedging; dispersal; partial migration; connectivity","Partial migration strategies, in which some individuals migrate but others do not, are widely observed in populations of migratory animals. Such patterns could arise via variation in migratory behaviors made by individual animals, via genetic variation in migratory predisposition, or simply by variation in migration opportunities mediated by environmental conditions. Here we use spatiotemporal variation in partial migration across populations of an amphidromous Hawaiian goby to test whether stream or ocean conditions favor completing its life cycle entirely within freshwater streams rather than undergoing an oceanic larval migration. Across 35 watersheds, microchemical analysis of otoliths revealed that most adult Awaous stamineus were freshwater residents (62% of n = 316 in 2009, 83% of n = 274 in 2011), but we found considerable variation among watersheds. We then tested the hypothesis that the prevalence of freshwater residency increases with the stability of stream flows and decreases with the availability of dispersal pathways arising from ocean hydrodynamics. We found that streams with low variation of daily discharge were home to a higher incidence of freshwater residents in each survey year. The magnitude of the shift in freshwater residency between survey years was positively associated with predicted interannual variability in the success of larval settlement in streams on each island based on passive drift in ocean currents. We built on these findings by developing a theoretical model of goby life history to further evaluate whether mediation of migration outcomes by stream and ocean hydrodynamics could be sufficient to explain the range of partial migration frequency observed across populations. The model illustrates that the proportion of larvae entering the ocean and differential survival of freshwater-resident versus ocean-going larvae are plausible mechanisms for range-wide shifts in migration strategies. Thus, we propose that hydrologic variation in both ocean and stream environments contributes to spatiotemporal variation in the prevalence of migration phenotypes in A. stamineus. Our empirical and theoretical results suggest that the capacity for partial migration could enhance the persistence of metapopulations of diadromous fish when confronted with variable ocean and stream conditions.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This increase in adoption has been made more accessible through the interfaces of many popular software tools used in the regulation and assessment of water quality. Customized applications of these tools will increase, as ease of access and affordability of directly monitored and remotely sensed datasets improve over time. Concurrently, there is a need for inclusive participatory engagement with stakeholders to achieve solutions to current watershed management challenges. This paper explores the potential of these GIS and remote sensing datasets, tools, models, and immersive engagement technologies from other domains, for improving public participation and stakeholder engagement throughout the watershed planning process. To do so, an initial review is presented about the use of GIS and remote sensing in watershed management and its role in impairment identification, model development, and planning and implementation. Then, ways in which GIS and remote sensing can be integrated with stakeholder engagement through (1) leveraging GIS and remote sensing datasets, and (2) stakeholder engagement approaches including outreach and education, modeler-led development, and stakeholder-led involvement and feedback, are discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the potential for transforming public participation and stakeholder engagement in the watershed management process through applications of GIS and remote sensing are presented.","International Environmental Modelling and Software Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The heterogeneous nature of arctic landscapes creates challenges for monitoring and improving understanding of these ecosystems, as current efforts typically rely on ground, airborne, or satellite-based observations that are limited in space, time, or pixel resolution. The use of remote sensing instruments on small Unoccupied Aerial Systems (UASs) has emerged as an important tool to bridge the gap between detailed, but spatially limited ground-level measurements, and lower resolution, but spatially extensive high-altitude airborne and satellite observations. UASs allow researchers to view, describe and quantify vegetation dynamics at fine spatial scales (1-10 cm) over areas much larger than typical field plots. UASs can be deployed with a high degree of temporal flexibility, enabling observation across diurnal, seasonal, and annual timescales. In this work, we review how established and emerging UAS remote sensing technologies can enhance arctic plant ecological research by quantifying fine-scale vegetation patterns and processes, and by enhancing the ability to link ground-based measurements with broader-scale information obtained from airborne and satellite platforms. Synthesis: Improved ecological understanding and model representation of arctic vegetation is needed to forecast the fate of the Arctic in a rapidly changing climate. Observations from UASs provide an approach to address this need, however, the use of this technology in the Arctic currently remains limited. Here we share recommendations to better enable and encourage the use of UASs to improve the description, scaling, and model representation of arctic vegetation.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Developing a Decision Support System for Regional Agricultural Nonpoint Salinity Pollution Management: Application to the San Joaquin River, California","Dinar, Ariel; Quinn, Nigel W. T.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; San Joaquin River; salinity; decision support system; policy; assimilative capacity; real-time management economics","Environmental problems and production losses associated with irrigated agriculture, such as salinity, degradation of receiving waters, such as rivers, and deep percolation of saline water to aquifers, highlight water-quality concerns that require a paradigm shift in resource-management policy. New tools are needed to assist environmental managers in developing sustainable solutions to these problems, given the nonpoint source nature of salt loads to surface water and groundwater from irrigated agriculture. Equity issues arise in distributing responsibility and costs to the generators of this source of pollution. This paper describes an alternative approach to salt regulation and control using the concept of “Real-Time Water Quality management”. The approach relies on a continually updateable WARMF (Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework) forecasting model to provide daily estimates of salt load assimilative capacity in the San Joaquin River and assessments of compliance with salinity concentration objectives at key monitoring sites on the river. The results of the study showed that the policy combination of well-crafted river salinity objectives by the regulator and the application of an easy-to use and maintain decision support tool by stakeholders have succeeded in minimizing water quality (salinity) exceedances over a 20-year study period.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Multi-level impacts of climate change and supply disruption events on a potato supply chain: An agent-based modeling approach","Rahman, Md Mamunur; Nguyen, Ruby; Lu, Liang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 99 GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS; Potato Supply Chain; Supply Disruption; Climate Change; Drought; Agent Based Modeling; Simulation; Snowstorm","Context: The world is experiencing frequent extreme weather events like droughts, snowstorms, and shifting of seasons due to climate change. Increased frequency and severity of these extreme weather events threaten food security because agriculture depends on climate conditions. Impacts of climate change on the agricultural system not only occur at the grower’s level, but also cascade to other levels along the supply chain. Objective: In this study, we aim to quantify a wide range of economic impacts of different extreme climate events on different stages of a food supply chain. Methods: We chose the potato supply chain in Idaho as a case study. We developed a multi-echelon supply chain simulation model using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach with five types of agents—farmers, shippers, processors, retailers, and logistics companies. In addition to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, we designed two climate-related disruption events—drought and snowstorm. We quantified the heterogeneous impacts at different stages of the supply chain for both fresh and processed potatoes using key performance indicators (KPIs) including revenues, prices, lead times, traded quantities, and food waste quantity. Results and Conclusion: The impacts of the disruption events are different on different agents in the supply chain for different product categories. The price hike of fresh potatoes is far higher than processed potatoes during disruption events. This price hike makes consumers switch to processed potatoes, which require more fresh potatoes as an input that further reinforces the price hike. However, because processed potatoes have an elastic demand, once their prices go up due to higher input cost, their demand drops. Non-contracted farmers gain additional revenues from the disruption events, whereas contracted farmers incur a loss due to lock-in price and lower than usual harvest. Significance: The methodology developed in this study could be applied to other food and agricultural supply chains for understanding the vulnerabilities at agent levels due to climate change disruption events. Furthermore, the findings would help develop mitigation strategies or policies to improve the well-being of the overall supply chain.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

True color and multi-spectral images at 10 m resolution are used over 50x50 km2 domain centered on the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site over Southern Great Plains to recognize green pixels and estimate the vegetation fraction. The GVF retrieved from several spectral bands is compared with Sentinel-2 true color images, Sentinel-3, and MODIS vegetation products, and observations from the US DOE research aircraft on selected days from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign. Unlike MODIS or Sentinel-3, our approach to retrieve the GVF is independent of absolute reflectance or photosynthetic response. Spatial patterns in vegetation distribution is similar in all three satellite approaches, however MODIS approximately underestimates the vegetation cover by 10% compared to the Sentinel-2, 3 retrievals over the study domain. The largest contrast in MODIS and Sentinel-2,-3 is found when the GVF is less than 0.2 or greater than 0.9, likely as a result of different retrieval approaches and spectral bands used to estimate the vegetation products. The NDVI retrieved from MODIS is also underestimated compared to the aircraft observations suggesting that MODIS underestimates both NDVI and GVF. In the past, various satellite observations have been used to retrieve the vegetation fraction at medium (0.25-0.50 km) and coarser resolutions (15 km) but our approach is extended to a much higher (10 m) resolution. Our analysis from Sentinel-2 shows large spatial variability in GVF and a clear disparity with estimates from MODIS and Sentinel-3 satellites. The new approach to estimate GVF has the potential to increase spatial accuracy and precision of surface properties relevant for crop and forest management, surface and energy balance processes, and land surface parameterizations in atmospheric models.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

In this study, biotic and abiotic column experiments were performed to investigate the removal and degradation of five EOCs in soils with different soil organic matter (SOM) contents under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions. In biotic experiments, 54–90% of bisphenol A (BPA) and 9–22% of ibuprofen (IBU) were removed from the aqueous phase of saturated columns due to adsorption and biodegradation. The biodegradation removed 26–65% of BPA and 1–22% of IBU. Decreasing soil pore water saturation from 100 to 80% increased BPA removal to 97–100% and IBU removal to 42–43% due to increased biodegradation (67–81% for BPA and 36–39% for IBU). No significant removal of BPA and IBU was observed in SOM-removed soils under saturated and unsaturated flow conditions. The desaturation did not influence sorptive losses of BPA (< 27%) and IBU (< 7%), suggesting their negligible adsorption at air–water interfaces but increased biodegradation of BPA and IBU sorbed at SOM–water interfaces. The study shows that soil drying and SOM can synergistically degrade BPA and IBU but have no effect on recalcitrant carbamazepine, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Global production of forest fire ash, derived from wildfires and prescribed burns, is rapidly increasing due to a warming climate, but their interactions with aqueous and sedimentary Hg are poorly understood. In this study, we compared the differences of wildfire ash with activated carbon and biochar on the sorption of aqueous inorganic Hg and sedimentary Hg methylation. Sorption of aqueous inorganic Hg was greatest for wildfire ash materials (up to 0.21 μg g<sup>₋1</sup> or 2.2 μg g<sup>₋1</sup> C) among all of the solid sorbents evaluated. A similar Hg adsorption mechanism for activated carbon, biochar made of walnut, and wildfire ash was found that involves the formation of complexes between Hg and oxygen-containing functional groups, especially the ₋COO group. Notably, increasing dissolved organic matter from 2.4 to 70 mg C L<sup>₋1</sup> remarkably reduced Hg sorption (up to 40% reduction) and increased the time required to reach Hg–sorbent pseudo-equilibrium. Surprisingly, biochar and wildfire ash, but not activated carbon, stimulated MeHg production during anoxic sediment incubation, possibly due to the release of labile organic matter. Overall, our study indicates that while wildfire ash can sequester aqueous Hg, the leaching of its labile organic matter may promote production of toxic MeHg in anoxic sediments, which has an important implication for potential MeHg contamination in downstream aquatic ecosystems after wildfires.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Cloud Radiative Effects on MJO Development in DYNAMO","Hu, Qi; Han, Zihang; Wang, Shuguang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Madden-Julian oscillation; Cloud radiative effects; Tropical variability","Observed Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events are examined with the aid of regional model simulations to understand the role of cloud radiative effects in the MJO development. The importance of this role is demonstrated by the absence of MJO in the model simulations that contain no cloud radiative effects. Comparisons of model simulations with and without the cloud radiative effects and observation help identify the major processes arising from those effects. Those processes develop essentially from heating in the upper-troposphere due to shortwave absorption within anvil clouds in the upper troposphere and the convergence of longwave radiation in the middle-upper troposphere, with a peak at 300-hPa, during deep convection. First, that heating adds extra buoyancy and accelerates the rising motion in the upper troposphere in deep convection. The vertical acceleration in the upper troposphere creates a vacuum effect and demands for more deep convection to develop. Second, in response to that demand and required by mass balance arises the large-scale horizontal and vertical mass, moisture, and energy convergence. It strengthens deep convection and, with the feedback from continuing cloud radiative effect, creates conditions that can perpetuate deep convection and MJO development. That perpetuation does not occur however because those processes arising from the cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere stabilize the troposphere till it supports no further deep convection. Weakening deep convection reduces cloud radiative effects. The subsequent reduction of the vacuum effect in the upper troposphere diminishes deep convection completing an MJO cycle. These results advance our understanding of the development of the MJO in the radiative-convective system over warm waters in the tropics. They show that while the embryo of intraseasonal oscillation may exist in the system its growth/development is largely dependent on cloud radiative effects and feedbacks.","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Yet synthesis projects encounter challenges at all steps of the data reuse pipeline, including unavailable data, labor-intensive transcription of datasets, incomplete metadata, and a lack of communication between collaborators. Here, using insights from a diversity of soil, data, and climate scientists, we summarize current practices in soil data synthesis across all stages of database creation: availability, input, harmonization, curation, and publication. We then suggest new soil-focused semantic tools to improve existing data pipelines, such as ontologies, vocabulary lists, and community practices. Our goal is to provide the soil data community with an overview of current practices in soil data and where we need to go to fully leverage big data to solve soil problems in the next century.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The status and prospects of materials for carbon capture technologies","Ozkan, Mihrimah; Custelcean, Radu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","In order to combat climate change, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from industry, transportation, buildings, and other sources need to be captured and long-term stored. Decarbonization of these sources requires special types of materials that have high affinities for CO<sub>2</sub>. Potassium hydroxide is a benchmark aqueous sorbent that reacts with CO<sub>2</sub> to convert it into K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and subsequently precipitated as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Another class of carbon capture materials is solid sorbents that are usually functionalized with amines or have natural affinities for CO<sub>2</sub>. The next wave of materials for carbon capture under investigation includes activated carbon, metal–organic frameworks, zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and ionic liquids. In this issue of MRS Bulletin, some of these materials are highlighted, including solvents and sorbents, membranes, ionic liquids, and hydrides. Other materials that can capture CO2 from low concentrations of gas streams, such as air (direct air capture) are also discussed. Also covered in this issue are machine learning-based computer algorithms developed with the goal to speed up the progress of carbon capture materials development, and to design advanced materials with high CO<sub>2 </sub>capacity, improved capture and release kinetics, and improved cyclic durability.","Materials Research Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Coffee supply chain planning under climate change","Zhou, Rui; Wang, Yaoping; Jin, Mingzhou; Mao, Jiafu; Zheng, Xu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; coffee supply chain; climate change; sustainability; agriculture management practices; optimization","The growing demand but uncertain supply makes the sustainability of the coffee industry a shared concern for all participants along the coffee supply chain. This study proposed a decision-making model that comprises the cultivation management, including shade management and annual agriculture management, and the supply chain logistics. A two-stage stochastic program is presented and used within a rolling horizon scheme that periodically updates input data information to deal with uncertainty associated with future climate scenarios. The program minimizes the total expected cost of the entire supply chain of arabica coffee. The study applied the model to the real case study of arabica coffee bean supply to the U.S. market, trying to answer whether arabica coffee supply can meet the U.S. demand from 2022 to 2050 and how to best mitigate any shortage through corporate-farmer partnerships. The results show that the coffee supply will have a 3% shortage in the future; medium-level shade management and more irrigation and fertilization are possible mitigation strategies. These results demonstrate the need for all participants to adopt suitable technologies for the sustainability of global coffee supply chains together.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Augmentation of WRF-Hydro to simulate overland-flow- and streamflow-generated debris flow susceptibility in burn scars","Li, Chuxuan; Handwerger, Alexander L.; Wang, Jiali; Yu, Wei; Li, Xiang; Finnegan, Noah J.; Xie, Yingying; Buscarnera, Giuseppe; Horton, Daniel E.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In steep wildfire-burned terrains, intense rainfall can produce large runoff that can trigger highly destructive debris flows. However, the ability to accurately characterize and forecast debris flow susceptibility in burned terrains using physics-based tools remains limited. Here, we augment the Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) to simulate both overland and channelized flows and assess postfire debris flow susceptibility over a regional domain. We perform hindcast simulations using high-resolution weather-radar-derived precipitation and reanalysis data to drive non-burned baseline and burn scar sensitivity experiments. Our simulations focus on January 2021 when an atmospheric river triggered numerous debris flows within a wildfire burn scar in Big Sur – one of which destroyed California's famous Highway 1. Compared to the baseline, our burn scar simulation yields dramatic increases in total and peak discharge and shorter lags between rainfall onset and peak discharge, consistent with streamflow observations at nearby US Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow gage sites. For the 404 catchments located in the simulated burn scar area, median catchment-area-normalized peak discharge increases by ~ 450 % compared to the baseline. Catchments with anomalously high catchment-area-normalized peak discharge correspond well with post-event field-based and remotely sensed debris flow observations. We suggest that our regional postfire debris flow susceptibility analysis demonstrates WRF-Hydro as a compelling new physics-based tool whose utility could be further extended via coupling to sediment erosion and transport models and/or ensemble-based operational weather forecasts. Given the high-fidelity performance of our augmented version of WRF-Hydro, as well as its potential usage in probabilistic hazard forecasts, we argue for its continued development and application in postfire hydrologic and natural hazard assessments.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Argonne National Lab.

Rapid warming at northern latitudes, where peatlands are abundant, can disturb their CO<sub>2</sub> sink function. In this work, we show that sensitivity of peatland net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange to warming changes in sign and magnitude across seasons, resulting in complex net CO<sub>2</sub> sink responses. We use multiannual net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange observations from 20 northern peatlands to show that warmer early summers are linked to increased net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, while warmer late summers lead to decreased net CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. Thus, net CO<sub>2</sub> sinks of peatlands in regions experiencing early summer warming, such as central Siberia, are more likely to persist under warmer climate conditions than are those in other regions.

The clustering of acid and base molecules is a major mechanism driving fast nucleation and initial growth of new particles in the atmosphere. However, the acid–base cluster composition, measured using state-of-the-art mass spectrometers, cannot explain the measured high formation rate of new particles. Here we present strong evidence for the existence of base molecules such as amines in the smallest atmospheric sulfuric acid clusters prior to their detection by mass spectrometers.

The proposed mechanism is very consistent with measured new particle formation in urban Beijing, in which dimethylamine is the key base for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> nucleation while other bases such as ammonia may contribute to the growth of larger clusters.

However, the radiative impacts of dust aerosols on planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure have not been explored sufficiently. During a typical dust storm event over Tarim Basin, dust aerosols exhibit a well-mixed distribution during the daytime in spite of a shallow layer of dust particles accumulated at higher altitudes. By contrast, nocturnal dust plumes are located near the surface due to stable stratification. We demonstrate that these differentiated vertical distributions determine the spatial heterogeneity of dust loading, radiative fluxes and PBL height variations. Dust aerosols cause daytime PBL suppression and nighttime PBL promotion through modulating surface and atmospheric radiative budgets. Specifically, dust-induced cooling effect within PBL directly inhibits the daytime PBL development. PBL suppression effect is then amplified by entrainment processes resulting in excessively low PBL height, especially for dust particles below but near the PBL top. Dust plumes weaken updrafts from PBL and downdrafts of the free atmosphere, which further reduce the entrainment mixing through attenuating horizontal and vertical advection, and eventually amplify PBL suppression. At night, near-surface dust aerosols stimulate a warm and unstable lower atmosphere, generate warm advection heating and promote the PBL development. Our study highlights the importance of specifying entrainment parameters and nighttime advection activities in quantifying the dust-PBL interactions.","Elsevier","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Three indices were employed to characterize cyclone activity, including cyclone count, cyclone intensity, and a cyclone activity index (CAI) that combines the count and intensity. The results show that the cyclone indices in the three datasets have comparable annual climatologies and seasonal evolution over the northern extratropical land and ocean in recent decades. Based on the cyclone indices over the period 1951–2010 in 80 ensemble members of 20CRv3, cyclone count and intensity are negatively correlated in winter and tend to be positively and weakly correlated in summer. The interannual CAI variability is dominated by the cyclone count variability. Regional mean cyclone activity can be well represented using the ensemble average cyclone index. We then examined the linkage of the cyclone activity in 20CRv3 and observed cold and warm extremes over Eurasia and North America over the period 1951–2010. In winter, the principal components of interannual cold and warm extreme anomalies are more correlated with the regional mean cyclone count index over Eurasia, while they are more correlated with the cyclone intensity index over North America. The temperature anomalies associated with the regional and ensemble mean cyclone count index explain about 10% (20%) of interannual cold (warm) extreme variances averaged over Eurasia. The temperature anomalies associated with the mean cyclone intensity explain about 10% of interannual cold and warm extreme variances over North America. Large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies in association with cyclone activity and the induced temperature advection drive temperature anomalies over Eurasia and North America. In summer, circulation and thermal advection anomalies associated with cyclone activity are weak over the two continents. Hence, that season’s relationship between cyclone activity and extreme temperature variability is weak.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, we calibrate a reactive transport model on a series of dual-domain column experiments, where centimeter-scale, low-permeability, organic-rich anoxic lenses are embedded in coarser-grained aquifer material. Simulations explicitly account for C, Fe, and S cycling at the interface between the lenses and the aquifer in water-saturated conditions. Our results highlight the role of fine-grained, organic-rich inclusions not only as sources or sinks for redox-sensitive species, but also as exporters of nutrients that stimulate downgradient biogeochemical cycling. By releasing large amounts of organic carbon into the surrounding aquifer, such lenses drive the development of proximal secondary reduction zones (""halos""), characterized by high microbial activity (e.g., sulfate reduction) and accumulation of reduced reaction products (e.g., iron sulfide). If similar secondary reduction zones develop within the hydraulically conductive domain of an aquifer, they would be highly susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions, for instance oxygen pulses associated with seasonal snowmelt. Furthermore, our results also emphasize the limitations of relying solely on aqueous species measurements to inform reactivity in systems where fast redox cycling and/or sizeable particulate transport may limit the signature of reactivity in the dissolved phase.","Elsevier; The Geochemical Society; The Meteoritical Society","","Stanford Univ., CA (United States); SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

In this study, we evaluate the performances of a Variable-Resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) regionally refined over eastern China (14 km) in reproducing the seasonal evolution of EASM precipitation over China. Compared with reference datasets, VR-CESM shows better performance than the corresponding globally uniform coarse-resolution model CESM (quasi-uniform 1°), especially over western China where complex local topography exists. The northward monsoon migration is closely related to low-level southerly flows and vertical moisture advection, which are more reasonably simulated in VR-CESM. The four critical timings of the EASM (monsoon onset, withdrawal, peak, and duration) are also better captured in VR-CESM than in CESM. The corresponding spatial Pearson correlation coefficients of the four critical timings with respect to reference datasets are about 0.1 higher in VR-CESM than those in CESM. Both models are most accurate in simulating monsoon onset and least accurate at simulating the monsoon peak. The overestimated zonal thermal contrast in CESM is responsible for the earlier monsoon onset and excessive precipitation in September over the Yangtze River valley. Finer resolution in VR-CESM, especially over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), appears to be a main factor in simulating better zonal thermal contrast and seasonal evolution of the EASM.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

While these canopy dynamics are well understood in forest ecosystems, studies of canopy structure of woody shrubs in grasslands are lacking. To evaluate the investment strategy used by these shrubs, we investigated the vertical distribution of leaf traits and physiology across canopies of Cornus drummondii, the predominant woody encroaching shrub in the Kansas tallgrass prairie. We also examined the impact of disturbance by browsing and grazing on these factors. Our results reveal that leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf nitrogen per area (Na) varied approximately threefold across canopies of C. drummondii, resulting in major differences in the physiological functioning of leaves. High LMA leaves had high photosynthetic capacity, while low LMA leaves had a novel strategy for maintaining light compensation points below ambient light levels. The vertical allocation of leaf traits in C. drummondii canopies was also modified in response to browsing, which increased light availability at deeper canopy depths. As a result, LMA and Na increased at lower canopy depths, leading to a greater photosynthetic capacity deeper in browsed canopies compared to control canopies. This response, along with increased light availability, facilitated greater photosynthesis and resource-use efficiency deeper in browsed canopies compared to control canopies. Furthermore, our results illustrate how C. drummondii facilitates high LAI canopies and a compensatory growth response to browsing—both of which are key factors contributing to the success of C. drummondii and other species responsible for grassland woody encroachment.","Oxford University Press","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","Konza Prairie LTER","United States","2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Tree Physiology (Online); Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2186–2202","","","SC0019037","Journal ID: ISSN 1758-4469","10.1093/treephys/tpac078","","2023-04-19T00:00:00Z","1891008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1891008","","Tree Physiology (Online)","11","42"
"Seasonally and Regionally Dependent Shifts of the Atmospheric Westerly Jets under Global Warming","Zhou, Wenyu; Leung, Lai-Yung Ruby; Lu, Jian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atmospheric circulation; Jets; Climate change","A distinct feature of the atmospheric circulation response to increasing greenhouse gas forcing is the poleward shift of the zonal-mean westerly jet. The dynamical mechanisms of the zonal-mean poleward jet shift have been extensively studied in literature. At seasonal/regional scales, however, the westerly jets can shift equatorward, such as in the early-summer Asia–Pacific region, the late-winter America–Atlantic region, and the winter/spring east Pacific. These equatorward jet shifts imply climate impacts distinct from those of the poleward shifts, yet their causes are not well understood. In this work, based on a hierarchy of coupled, prescribed-SST, and aquaplanet simulations, we attribute the seasonal/regional equatorward jet shifts to the enhanced tropical upper-level warming (ETUW), which arises from both the tropical moist adiabat and the enhanced equatorial surface warming. By steepening the meridional temperature gradient in the subtropical upper-to-middle level and assisted by positive eddy feedback, the ETUW increases the zonal wind equatorward of the climatological jet. When the regional/seasonal meridional temperature gradients (or equivalently the westerly jets) are weak and peak close to the tropics, the ETUW effect overcomes the poleward jet-shift mechanisms and leads to the equatorward jet shifts. This climatological-state dependency is consistently seen in the decomposed jet responses to uniform warming and surface warming pattern, and further demonstrated through idealized aquaplanet experiments with designed climatological states. For uniform warming, the ETUW arising from moist adiabat makes the general poleward jet shifts insignificant in the aforementioned favorable regions/seasons. For warming pattern, the ETUW from enhanced equatorial warming drives substantial equatorward jet shifts in these favorable seasons/regions.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although rivers have a small global surface area, they contribute substantially to worldwide greenhouse gas emissions through microbially mediated processes within the river hyporheic zone. Despite this importance, research linking microbial and viral communities to specific biogeochemical reactions is still nascent in these sediment environments. To survey the metabolic potential and gene expression underpinning carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling in river sediments, we collected an integrated data set of 33 metagenomes, metaproteomes, and paired metabolomes. We reconstructed over 500 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which we dereplicated into 55 unique, nearly complete medium- and high-quality MAGs spanning 12 bacterial and archaeal phyla. We also reconstructed 2,482 viral genomic contigs, which were dereplicated into 111 viral MAGs (vMAGs) of >10 kb in size. As a result of integrating gene expression data with geochemical and metabolite data, we created a conceptual model that uncovered new roles for microorganisms in organic matter decomposition, carbon sequestration, nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification. We show how these metabolic pathways, integrated through shared resource pools of ammonium, carbon dioxide, and inorganic nitrogen, could ultimately contribute to carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes from hyporheic sediments. Further, by linking viral MAGs to these active microbial hosts, we provide some of the first insights into viral modulation of river sediment carbon and nitrogen cycling.","American Society for Microbiology","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In particular the study describes aged biomass burning aerosol (BBA), its interaction with the marine boundary layer and the influence of biomass burning (BB) air on marine aerosol. The study finds evidence of BBA influenced by marine boundary layer processing as well as sea salt influenced by BB air. Secondary chloride aerosols were observed in clean marine air as well as in BB-influenced air in the free troposphere. Higher-volatility organic aerosol appears to be associated with increased age of biomass burning plumes, and photolysis or oxidation may be a mechanism for the apparent increased volatility. Aqueous processing and interaction with the marine boundary layer air may be a mechanism for the presence of sodium on many aged potassium salts. By number, biomass burning potassium salts and modified sea salts are the most observed particles on filter samples. The most commonly observed BC coatings are inorganic salts. These results suggest that atmospheric processes such as photolysis, oxidation and cloud processing are key drivers in the elemental composition and morphology of aged BBA. Fresh BBA inorganic salt content, as it has an important role in the particles' ability to uptake water, may be a key driver in how aqueous processing and atmospheric aging proceed.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Calculations of the aerosol direct effect on climate rely on simulated aerosol fields. The model representation of aerosol mixing state potentially introduces large uncertainties into these calculations, since the simulated aerosol optical properties are sensitive to mixing state. In this study, we systematically quantified the impact of aerosol mixing state on aerosol optical properties using an ensemble of 1800 aerosol populations from particle-resolved simulations as a basis for Mie calculations for optical properties. Assuming the aerosol to be internally mixed within prescribed size bins caused overestimations of aerosol absorptivity and underestimations of aerosol scattering. Together, these led to errors in the populations' single scattering albedo of up to −22.3 % with a median of −0.9 %. The mixing state metric χ proved useful in relating errors in the volume absorption coefficient, the volume scattering coefficient and the single scattering albedo to the degree of internally mixing of the aerosol, with larger errors being associated with more external mixtures. At the same time, a range of errors existed for any given value of χ. We attributed this range to the extent to which the internal mixture assumption distorted the particles' black carbon content and the refractive index of the particle coatings. Both can vary for populations with the same value of χ. These results are further evidence of the important yet complicated role of mixing state in calculating aerosol optical properties.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Ruby (ORCID:0000000232219467)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Understanding the influence of land surface heterogeneity on surface water and energy fluxes is crucial for modeling earth system variability and change. This study investigates the effects of four dominant heterogeneity sources on land surface modeling, including atmospheric forcing (ATM), soil properties (SOIL), land use and land cover (LULC), and topography (TOPO). Our analysis focused on their impacts on the partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff (R), partitioning of net radiation into sensible heat and latent heat, and corresponding water and energy fluxes. An initial set of 16 experiments were performed over the continental US (CONUS) using the E3SM land model (ELMv1) with different combinations of heterogeneous and homogeneous datasets. The Sobol' total and first-order sensitivity indices were utilized to quantify the relative importance of the four heterogeneity sources. Sobol' total sensitivity index measures the total heterogeneity effects induced by a given heterogeneity source, consisting of the contribution from its own heterogeneity (i.e., the first-order index) and its interactions with other heterogeneity sources. ATM and LULC are the most dominant heterogeneity sources in determining spatial variability of water and energy partitioning, mainly contributed by their own heterogeneity and slightly contributed by their interactions with other heterogeneity sources. Their heterogeneity effects are complementary, both spatially and temporally. The overall impacts of SOIL and TOPO are negligible, except TOPO dominates the spatial variability of R/P across the transitional climate zone between the arid western and humid eastern CONUS. Accounting for more heterogeneity sources improves the simulated spatial variability of water and energy fluxes when compared with ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset. An additional set of 13 experiments identified the most critical components within each heterogeneity source, which are precipitation, temperature, and longwave radiation for ATM, soil texture, and soil color for SOIL and maximum fractional saturated area parameter for TOPO.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Hillslope similarity is an active topic in hydrology because of its importance in improving our understanding of hydrologic processes and enabling comparisons and paired studies. In this study, we propose a holistic bottom-up hillslope clustering based on a region's integrative hydrodynamic response quantified by the seasonal changes in groundwater levels ΔP. The main advantage of the ΔP clustering is its ability to capture recharge and discharge processes. We test the performance of the ΔP clustering by comparing it to seven other common hillslope clustering approaches. These include clustering approaches based on the aridity index, topographic wetness index, elevation, land cover, and machine-learning that jointly integrate multiple data. We assess the ability of these clustering approaches to identify and categorize hillslopes with similar static characteristics, hydroclimate, land surface processes, and subsurface dynamics in a mountainous watershed – the East River – located in the headwaters of the Upper Colorado River Basin. The ΔP clustering performs very well in identifying hillslopes with six out of the nine characteristics studied. The variability among clusters as quantified by the coefficient of variation (0.2) is less in the ΔP and the machine learning approaches than in the others (> 0.3 for TWI, elevation, and land cover). We further demonstrate the robustness of the ΔP clustering by testing its ability to predict hillslope responses to wet and dry hydrologic conditions, of which it performs well when based on average conditions.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Atmospheric observations in remote locations offer a possibility of exploring trace gas and particle concentrations in pristine environments. However, data from remote areas are often contaminated by pollution from local sources. Detecting this contamination is thus a central and frequently encountered issue. Consequently, many different methods exist today to identify local contamination in atmospheric composition measurement time series, but no single method has been widely accepted. In this study, we present a new method to identify primary pollution in remote atmospheric datasets, e.g., from ship campaigns or stations with a low background signal compared to the contaminated signal. The pollution detection algorithm (PDA) identifies and flags periods of polluted data in five steps. The first and most important step identifies polluted periods based on the derivative (time derivative) of a concentration over time. If this derivative exceeds a given threshold, data are flagged as polluted. Further pollution identification steps are a simple concentration threshold filter, a neighboring points filter (optional), a median, and a sparse data filter (optional). The PDA only relies on the target dataset itself and is independent of ancillary datasets such as meteorological variables. All parameters of each step are adjustable so that the PDA can be “tuned” to be more or less stringent (e.g., flag more or fewer data points as contaminated). The PDA was developed and tested with a particle number concentration dataset collected during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the central Arctic. Using strict settings, we identified 62 % of the data as influenced by local contamination. Using a second independent particle number concentration dataset also collected during MOSAiC, we evaluated the performance of the PDA against the same dataset cleaned by visual inspection. The two methods agreed in 94 % of the cases. Additionally, the PDA was successfully applied to a trace gas dataset (CO2), also collected during MOSAiC, and to another particle number concentration dataset, collected at the high-altitude background station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. Thus, the PDA proves to be a useful and flexible tool to identify periods affected by local contamination in atmospheric composition datasets without the need for ancillary measurements. It is best applied to data representing primary pollution. The user-friendly and open-access code enables reproducible application to a wide suite of different datasets.

However, the role of forest structure as both a material legacy and feature supporting carbon (C) cycling stability following disturbance has not been widely investigated. We used a large-scale disturbance manipulation to ask whether legacies of lidar-derived canopy structures drive 3-year primary production responses to disturbance. As part of the Forest Resilience Threshold Experiment (FoRTE) in northern Michigan, USA we simulated phloem-disrupting disturbances producing a range of severities and affecting canopy trees of different sizes. We quantified the legacies of forest structure using two approaches: one measuring the change in structure and primary production from pre-to post-disturbance and the second estimating resistance as log transformed ratios of control and treatment values. We found that total aboveground wood net primary production (ANPP<sub>w</sub>) was similar across disturbance severities as legacy trees rapidly increased rates of primary production. Experiment-wide, the disturbance had limited effects on change in mean structural complexity values; however, high variance underscored large differences in the magnitude and direction of complexity's response at the plot-scale.

"Transient Storage Model Parameter Optimization Using the Simulated Annealing Method","Tsai, Chia-Hsing; Rucker, Dale F.; Brooks, Scott C.; Ginn, Timothy; Carroll, Kenneth C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; simulated annealing; transient storage model; parameter optimization; hyporheic; TSM; parameter estimation","Hyporheic exchange in streams is critical to ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling along river corridors, especially for slowly moving or small stream systems. The transient storage model (TSM) has been widely used for modeling of hyporheic exchange. TSM calibration, for hyporheic exchange, is typically used to estimate four parameters, including the mass exchange rate coefficient, the dispersion coefficient, stream cross-sectional area, and hyporheic zone cross-sectional area. Prior studies have raised concerns regarding the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem for the TSM, that is, the occurrence of different parameter vectors resulting in TSM solution that reproduces the observed in-stream tracer break through curve (BTC) with the same error. This leads to practical non-identifiability in determining the unknown parameter vector values even when global-optimal values exist, and the parameter optimization becomes practically non-unique. To address this problem, we applied the simulated annealing method to calibrate the TSM to BTCs, because it is less susceptible to local minima-induced non-identifiability. A hypothetical (or synthetic) tracer test data set with known parameters was developed to demonstrate the capability of the simulated annealing method to find the global minimum parameter vector, and it identified the “hypothetically-true” global minimum parameter vector even with input data that were modified with up to 10% noise without increasing the number of iterations required for convergence. The simulated annealing TSM was then calibrated using two in-stream tracer tests conducted in East Fork Poplar Creek, Tennessee. In conclusion, simulated annealing was determined to be appropriate for quantifying the TSM parameter vector because of its search capability for the global minimum parameter vector.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Only profiles that are transparent to the RL with ice clouds only are considered in this study. The MMCR underestimates the RL ice cloud optical depth (COD) by 20%. The MMCR detects no ice clouds in 37% of the profiles. These profiles where ice cloud goes undetected by the MMCR typically contain very optically thin clouds, with a mean RL ice COD of 0.03. Higher ice cloud detection sensitivity is found for the KAZR, which underestimates the RL ice COD by 15%. The decrease in the ice COD bias for the KAZR compared to the MMCR is largely due to a decrease in the ice COD bias for the situation where the transparent profiles with ice clouds are detected by both the RL and cloud radar. The climatic net ice cloud radiative effects (CREs) from the RL at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface are 3.2 W m<sup>-2</sup> and -0.6 W m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The ice CREs at the TOA and surface are underestimated for the MMCR by 0.7 W m<sup>-2</sup> and 0.16 W m<sup>-2</sup> (21% and 29%) and underestimated for the KAZR by 0.6 W m<sup>-2</sup> and 0.14 W m<sup>-2</sup> (17% and 24%).

"Light absorption by brown carbon over the South-East Atlantic Ocean","Zhang, Lu; Segal-Rozenhaimer, Michal; Che, Haochi; Dang, Caroline; Sedlacek III, Arthur J.; Lewis, Ernie R.; Dobracki, Amie; Wong, Jenny S.; Formenti, Paola; Howell, Steven G.; Nenes, Athanasios","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Brown Carbon, Optical properties, TEM, Mie scattering","Biomass burning emissions often contain brown carbon (BrC), which represents a large family of light-absorbing organics that are chemically complex, thus making it difficult to estimate their absorption of incoming solar radiation, resulting in large uncertainties in the estimation of the global direct radiative effect of aerosols. Here we investigate the contribution of BrC to the total light absorption of biomass burning aerosols over the South-East Atlantic Ocean with different optical models, utilizing a suite of airborne measurements from the ORACLES 2018 campaign. An effective refractive index of black carbon (BC), m<sub>eBC</sub> = 1.95 + ik<sub>eBC</sub>, that characterizes the absorptivity of all absorbing components at 660 nm wavelength was introduced to facilitate the attribution of absorption at shorter wavelengths, i.e. 470 nm. Most values of the imaginary part of the effective refractive index, k<sub>eBC</sub>, were larger than those commonly used for BC from biomass burning emissions, suggesting contributions from absorbers besides BC at 660 nm. The TEM-EDX single-particle analysis further suggests that these long-wavelength absorbers might include iron oxides, as iron is found to be present only when large values of k<sub>eBC</sub> are derived. Using this effective BC refractive index, we find that the contribution of BrC to the total absorption at 470 nm (R<sub>BrC,470</sub>) ranges from ~8 %–22 %, with the organic aerosol mass absorption coefficient (MAC<sub>OA,470</sub>) at this wavelength ranging from 0.30±0.27 to 0.68±0.08 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The core–shell model yielded much higher estimates of MAC<sub>OA,470</sub> and R<sub>BrC,470</sub> than homogeneous mixing models, underscoring the importance of model treatment. Absorption attribution using the Bruggeman mixing Mie model suggests a minor BrC contribution of 4 % at 530 nm, while its removal would triple the BrC contribution to the total absorption at 470 nm obtained using the AAE (absorption Ångström exponent) attribution method. Thus, it is recommended that the application of any optical properties-based attribution method use absorption coefficients at the longest possible wavelength to minimize the influence of BrC and to account for potential contributions from other absorbing materials.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spread across the globe in 2020, which disrupted human activities and resulted in substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions. Here, we investigate the effects of the emissions reductions of aerosols, precursors, and greenhouse gases during the pandemic on wildfire weather conditions in 2020 over western United States by using an earth system model together with observational data. We show that the COVID-19 emissions reductions in model experiments increased surface air temperature and decreased precipitation and relative humidity due to a weakened moisture transport, which explains 10-40% of the observed increase in the risk of wildfires over western United States in 2020. In conclusion, this study suggests that COVID-19-related abrupt emissions reductions have an unexpected influence on wildfires, highlighting a different but important role of human activities in affecting wildfire risks.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Impact of Changing Winds on the Mauna Loa CO <sub>2</sub> Seasonal Cycle in Relation to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation","Jin, Yuming; Keeling, Ralph F.; Rödenbeck, Christian; Patra, Prabir K.; Piper, Stephen C.; Schwartzman, Armin","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Long-term measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) show that the CO<sub>2</sub> seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) increased from 1959 to 2019 at an overall rate of 0.22 AA ± 0.034 ppm decade<sup>-1</sup> while also varying on interannual to decadal time scales. These SCA changes are a signature of changes in land ecological CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes as well as shifting winds. Simulations with the TM3 tracer transport model and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from the Jena CarboScope CO<sub>2</sub> Inversion suggest that shifting winds alone have contributed to a decrease in SCA of -0.10 AA ± 0.022 ppm decade<sup>-1</sup> from 1959 to 2019, partly offsetting the observed long-term SCA increase associated with enhanced ecosystem net primary production. According to these simulations and MIROC-ACTM simulations, the shorter-term variability of MLO SCA is nearly equally driven by varying ecological CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes (49%) and varying winds (51%). We also show that the MLO SCA is strongly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) due to varying winds, as well as with a closely related wind index (U-PDO). Since 1980, 44% of the wind-driven SCA decrease has been tied to a secular trend in the U-PDO, which is associated with a progressive weakening of westerly winds at 700 mbar over the central Pacific from 20°N to 40°N. Similar impacts of varying winds on the SCA are seen in simulations at other low-latitude Pacific stations, illustrating the difficulty of constraining trend and variability of land CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes using observations from low latitudes due to the complexity of circulation changes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)","","United States","2022-07-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Journal Volume: 127 Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X","","","AGS-1623748; NNX17AE74G; OPP-1304270; OPP-1922922","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-897X","10.1029/2021JD035892","","2022-07-05T00:00:00Z","1874724","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1874724","","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","13","127"

Four separate MBL structural regimes representing non- or weakly drizzling single-layer stratocumulus, drizzling stratocumulus and cumulus-coupled stratocumulus, deep convection, and broken clouds embedded in northerly flow are identified. Single-layer stratocumulus is indicated when weak subtropical anticyclones are significantly west of the ENA site, and the MBL is cooler and drier than when drizzling and cumulus-coupled stratocumulus and broken clouds are observed. Drizzling and cumulus-coupled stratocumulus clouds are observed on the eastern flank of strong subtropical anticyclones in deep warm moist air masses with wind speeds exceeding 7 m s <sup>−1</sup> and strong near-surface wind shear. Broken clouds exhibit strong wind shear near the inversion, while single-layer stratocumulus clouds have lower wind speeds and minimal shear. Net latent heat fluxes in the subcloud layer resulting from a combination of the ocean surface heat flux and evaporating drizzle average near zero over long periods in drizzling and cumulus-coupled stratocumulus. The ECMWF reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) is found to accurately represent single-layer stratocumulus properties, while producing significant discrepancies when drizzling stratocumulus and cumulus-coupled stratocumulus are observed. </p>","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Current modeling approaches fix properties such as aerosol refractive index, introducing spatial and temporal errors in the radiative impacts. Further progress requires a process-level description of the refractive indices as the particles age and experience physicochemical transformations. We present two multivariate modeling approaches of light absorption by brown carbon (BrC). The initial approach was to extend the modeling framework of the refractive index at 589 nm (n<sub>D</sub>), but that result was insufficient. We developed a second multivariate model using aromatic rings and functional groups to predict the imaginary part of the complex refractive index. This second model agreed better with measured spectral absorption peaks, showing promise for a simplified treatment of BrC optics. In addition to absorption, organic functionalities also alter the water affinity of the molecules, leading to a hygroscopic uptake and increased light absorption, which we show through measurements and modeling.","American Chemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

However, temporal patterns in hydropower generation (and flow releases that affect aquatic biota) may change with increased wind and solar penetration. We used power cost modeling to characterize current and future within-day and seasonal patterns in hydropower generation across the Eastern Interconnection in a wet and a dry year. Compared to the baseline, future hydropower generation across the grid decreased during the day and increased before dawn and after dusk. At a project level, such a pattern would suggest 'double peaking' operation (up- and down-ramping before dawn and after dusk, with lower releases midday). Variation in generation was higher in wet years than dry years, foreshadowing possible flow constraints on hydropower flexibility. At the grid scale, projected ramping rates were higher in all seasons. A review of the ecological literature suggests that these changes would shift the timing of invertebrate drift and elevate the risk of nest scouring during up-ramping and the risk of stranding or dewatering during down ramping. Thermal conditions may be moderated by increased ramping. Strategies for adapting to future shifts in the renewable portfolio range from re-regulation in reservoir cascades to providing flow refuge (structures and vegetation) below individual projects. Coordinated basin-scale operation can distribute peaking operation to maintain grid support while restricting local ramping at critical ecological times. In addition, research to design hybrid renewable systems that add battery storage is needed to understand how we can mitigate future risks to aquatic communities while promoting the use of renewable energy. This study, which is among the first to examine ecological side-effects of the shift to renewable energy in freshwater ecosystems, lays out a path toward understanding and navigating changes to flow regimes under the energy transition.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Aerosol mass spectrometry was used <em>in situ</em> to characterize aging and chemical evolution of BB aerosols in real time throughout the event. During this dynamic period of BB emissions, particle samples were collected for chemical imaging using spectromicroscopy techniques. Computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis identified multiple particle types including highly carbonaceous (54–83%) particles, aged mineral dust (1–6%), and sulfur-containing particles (17–41%). Synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy coupled with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (STXM/NEXAFS) was used to assess the internal chemical heterogeneity of individual BB particles and the morphology of soot inclusions. The observed higher contribution of mixed component particles along with an increase in particle organic volume fraction suggests an atmospheric aging process, consistent with <em>in situ</em> measurements. An estimation method for particle component masses (i.e., organics, elemental carbon, and inorganics) inferred from STXM measurements was used to determine quantitative mixing state metrics of particles based on entropy-derived diversity measures for different periods of the BB event. In general, there was a small difference in the particle-specific diversity among the samples (D<sub>α</sub> = 1.3–1.8). However, the disparity from the bulk population diversity observed during the intense periods was found to have high values of D<sub>γ</sub> = 2.5–2.9, while particles collected outside of the burning event displayed lower bulk diversity of D<sub>γ</sub> = 1.5–2.0.

"Projecting end-of-century climate extremes and their impacts on the hydrology of a representative California watershed","Maina, Fadji Z.; Rhoades, Alan (ORCID:0000000337232422); Siirila-Woodburn, Erica R.; Dennedy-Frank, Peter-James","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. In California, it is essential to understand the evolution of water resources in response to a changing climate to sustain its economy and agriculture and to build resilient communities. Although extreme conditions have characterized the historical hydroclimate of California, climate change will likely intensify hydroclimatic extremes by the end of the century (EoC). However, few studies have investigated the impacts of EoC extremes on watershed hydrology. We use cutting-edge global climate and integrated hydrologic models to simulate EoC extremes and their effects on the water-energy balance. We assess the impacts of projected driest, median, and wettest water years under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 on the hydrodynamics of the Cosumnes River basin. Substantial changes to annual average temperature (>+2.5 ∘C) and precipitation (>+38 %) will characterize the EoC extreme water years compared to their historical counterparts. A shift in the dominant form of precipitation, mostly in the form of rain, is projected to fall earlier. These changes reduce snowpack by more than 90 %, increase peak surface water and groundwater storages up to 75 % and 23 %, respectively, and drive the timing of peak storage to occur earlier in the year. Because EoC temperatures and soil moisture are high, both potential and actual evapotranspiration (ET) increase. The latter, along with the lack of snowmelt in the warm EoC, causes surface water and groundwater storages to significantly decrease in summer, with groundwater showing the highest rates of decrease.

In this study, we investigated the chemical composition and provided an overview of the phase state of individual particles that have been long-range transported over the North Atlantic Ocean in June and July 2014, 2015, and 2017 to the Observatory of Mount Pico (OMP), in the Azores. OMP is an ideal site for studying long-range transported free tropospheric particles with negligible influence from local emissions and rare contributions from the boundary layer. We used the FLEXible PARTicle Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) to determine the origin and transport trajectories of sampled air masses and found that most originated from North America and recirculated over the North Atlantic Ocean. The FLEXPART analysis show that the sampled air masses were highly aged (average plume age >10 days). Size-resolved chemical compositions of individual particles were probed using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (CCSEM-EDX) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS). CCSEM-EDX results show that the most abundant particle types were carbonaceous (~29.9 to 82.0 %), sea salt (~0.3 to 31.6 %), and sea salt with sulfate (~2.4 to 31.5 %). We used a tilted stage interfaced within an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) to determine the phase state of individual submicron particles. We found that most particles (~47 to 99 %) were in the liquid state at the time of collection due to inorganic inclusions. Moreover, we also observed a substantial fraction of solid and semisolid particles (~0 to 30 % and ~1 to 42 %, respectively) during different transport patterns/events, reflecting the particles’ phase state variability for different atmospheric transport events and sources. Combining phase state measurements with FLEXPART CO tracer analysis, we found that wildfire-influenced plumes can result in particles with a wide range of viscosities after long-range transport in the free troposphere. We also used temperature and RH values extracted from the Global Forecast System (GFS) along the FLEXPART simulated path to predict the phase state of the particles during transport and found that neglecting internal mixing with inorganics would overestimate the viscosity of free tropospheric particles. Our findings warrant future investigation on the quantitative assessment of the influence of internal mixing on the phase state of the individual particles. This study also provides insights into the chemical composition and phase state of free tropospheric particles, which can benefit models to reduce uncertainties in ambient aerosol particles’ effects on climate.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Emerging signals of declining forest resilience under climate change","Forzieri, Giovanni; Dakos, Vasilis; McDowell, Nate G.; Ramdane, Alkama; Cescatti, Alessandro","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; climate change ecology; climate sciences","Forest ecosystems depend on their capacity to withstand and recover from natural and anthropogenic perturbations (that is, their resilience). Experimental evidence of sudden increases in tree mortality is raising concerns about variation in forest resilience, yet little is known about how it is evolving in response to climate change. Here we integrate satellite-based vegetation indices with machine learning to show how forest resilience, quantified in terms of critical slowing down indicators, has changed during the period 2000–2020. We show that tropical, arid and temperate forests are experiencing a significant decline in resilience, probably related to increased water limitations and climate variability. By contrast, boreal forests show divergent local patterns with an average increasing trend in resilience, probably benefiting from warming and CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization, which may outweigh the adverse effects of climate change. These patterns emerge consistently in both managed and intact forests, corroborating the existence of common large-scale climate drivers. Reductions in resilience are statistically linked to abrupt declines in forest primary productivity, occurring in response to slow drifting towards a critical resilience threshold. Approximately 23% of intact undisturbed forests, corresponding to 3.32 Pg C of gross primary productivity, have already reached a critical threshold and are experiencing a further degradation in resilience. Together, these signals reveal a widespread decline in the capacity of forests to withstand perturbation that should be accounted for in the design of land-based mitigation and adaptation plans.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Their strong association with short-lived, intense convective storms poses a great challenge in predicting their future changes. Here, we conducted model simulations at 1.2 km grid spacing for severe convective storms with large hail and heavy precipitation that occurred in two typical types of synoptic-scale environments in spring seasons over the central US under both current and future climate conditions. We find that the responses of large hail (diameters >2.5 cm) to anthropogenic climate change (ACC) are markedly different between the hailstorms developed in the two types of synoptic-scale environments, with over 110% increase in large hail occurrences for the frontal systems, whereas less than 30% increase for the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) systems. This is explained by the larger increase in convective intensity and updraft width and a smaller increase in warm cloud depth in the frontal storms compared with the GPLLJ storms. Interestingly, the occurrences and intensity of heavy precipitation (rain rate >20 mm hr-1) in both types of systems are similarly sensitive to ACC (e.g., 40% and 33% increases in the occurrences for the frontal and GPLLJ systems, respectively). These results advance our knowledge of hail projection and have important implications for managing risks for future hail.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Diel mercury concentration variations in a mercury-impacted stream","Brooks, Scott C.; Riscassi, Ami L.; Miller, Carrie L.; Lowe, Kenneth A.; Yin, Xiangping; Mehlhorn, Tonia L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Here, filtered and particulate mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MMHg), and associated water chemistry parameters, were evaluated bi-hourly for several 30 h periods during the summer and winter seasons at several distinct locations (downstream forested, midstream urban/suburban, upstream industrial) along a creek contaminated with high levels of inorganic Hg to determine if biogeochemical Hg and MMHg cycles respond to the daily photocycle. In summer particulate Hg and MMHg concentrations doubled overnight (excluding the upstream industrial site) concurrent with increases in turbidity and total suspended sediment; no such pattern was evident in winter. Seasonal and diel changes in the activity of macrobiota affecting the suspension of contaminated sediments are likely responsible for these patterns as other potential explanatory variables (e.g., instrument drift, pH, discharge) could not account for the range and timing of our observations. Diel patterns in filtered Hg (Hg<sub>D</sub>) were significant only at locations and times of the year when channel shading was not present and daytime concentrations increased 22–89% above nighttime minima likely caused by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. Relationships between Hg<sub>D</sub> and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration or character were inconsistent between sites. Unlike Hg<sub>D</sub>, there were significant diel patterns in filtered MMHg (MMHg<sub>D</sub>) at all sites and times of year, with summer concentrations peaking in mid to late afternoon while the timing differed in winter, with concentrations peaking after sunset. Daily variability in MMHg<sub>D</sub> concentration ranged between 25 and 75%. The results imply key controls on net methylation occur within the stream or on the stream bed and include factors such as small-scale temperature changes in the water column and photosynthetic activity of stream biofilm. With respect to stream monitoring, results from this study indicate (1) consistent timing in stream Hg and MMHg sampling is required for accurate assessment of long-term trends, (2) in situ measurements of turbidity can be used to quantify diel dynamics of both particulate Hg and MMHg concentrations, and (3) in situ fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM), a potential proxy for DOC, was not capable of resolving diel dynamics of filtered Hg or MMHg.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Observed Covariations in Boundary Layer and Cumulus Cloud Layer Processes","Daub, Brandon J.; Lareau, Neil P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In this paper we examine variations in boundary-layer processes spanning the shallow to deep cumulus transition. This is accomplished by differentiating boundary layer properties on the basis of convective outcomes, ranging from shallow to deep, as observed at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Oklahoma, USA. Doppler lidar, radar, and radiosonde data are combined to determine statistical differences in boundary layer and cloud layer properties using a large sample (236) of days with a range of convective outcomes: shallow, congestus, and deep convection. In these analyses, the radar characterizes diurnal cloud depth, the lidar quantifies updraft and downdraft properties in the subcloud layer, and daily radiosonde data provides the convective inhibition (CIN). Combined, these data are used to test the hypothesis that deep convection occurs when the strength of the boundary layer turbulence (i.e., TKE) exceeds the strength of the energy barrier (i.e., CIN) at the top of the CBL. Results show that days with deep convective clouds have significantly lower vertical velocity variance and weaker updrafts within the subcloud layer. However, CIN values are also found to be significantly lower on deep convective days, allowing for these weaker updrafts to penetrate the energy barrier and reach the level of free convection (LFC). In contrast, shallow convective outcomes occur when the updrafts are strong in an absolute sense, but are weak when compared to the strength of the energy barrier. These findings support the use of the CIN/TKE framework in parameterizing convection in coarse resolution models.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Fiber optic (FO) based chemical sensor systems are promising field-deployable systems for real-time monitoring of CO<sub>2</sub> in geological formations for long-range distributed sensing. Here, a mixed-matrix composite integrated FO sensor system was developed with a purely optical readout that reliably operates as a detector for gas-phase and dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>. A mixed-matrix composite sensor coating consisting of plasmonic nanocrystals and hydrophobic zeolite embedded in a polymer matrix was integrated on the FO sensor. The mixed-matrix composite FO sensor showed excellent reversibility/stability in a high humidity environment and sensitivity to gas-phase CO<sub>2</sub> over a large concentration range. This remarkable sensing performance was enabled by using plasmonic nanocrystals to significantly enhance the sensitivity and a hydrophobic zeolite to effectively mitigate interference from water vapor. The sensor exhibited the ability to sense CO<sub>2</sub> in the presence of other geologically relevant gases, which is of importance for applications in geological formations. A prototype FO sensor configuration which possesses a robust sensing capability for monitoring dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in natural water was demonstrated. Reproducibility was confirmed over many cycles, both in a laboratory setting and in the field. More importantly, we demonstrated on-line monitoring capabilities with a wireless telemetry system, which transferred the data from the field to a website. The combination of outstanding CO<sub>2</sub> sensing properties and facile coating processability makes this mixed-matrix composite FO sensor a good candidate suitable for practical carbon storage applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2022-07-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 15","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 10891-10903","","","89243318CFE000003","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.2c02723","","2022-10-31T00:00:00Z","1888747","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1888747","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","56"

The results confirm that the scheme is between the first and second order accurate, and conserves the total energy and potential enstrophy up to the time truncation errors. Here, the scheme is capable of producing more physically realistic energy and enstrophy spectra, indicating that it can help prevent the unphysical energy cascade towards the finest resolvable scales.

This knowledge deficiency, combined with rapidly changing water levels, storm surges, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and vapor pressure deficit, creates large predictive uncertainty regarding how coastal ecosystems will respond to global change. Here we synthesize the literature on the mechanisms that underlie coastal woody-plant mortality, with the goal of producing a testable hypothesis framework. The key emergent mechanisms underlying mortality include hypoxic, osmotic, and ionic-driven reductions in whole-plant hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis that ultimately drive the coupled processes of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation. The relative importance of these processes in driving mortality, their order of progression, and their degree of coupling depends on the characteristics of the anomalous water exposure, on topographic effects, and on taxa-specific variation in traits and trait acclimation. Greater inundation exposure could accelerate mortality globally; however, the interaction of changing inundation exposure with elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, drought, and rising vapor pressure deficit could influence mortality likelihood. Models of coastal forests that incorporate the frequency and duration of inundation, the role of climatic drivers, and the processes of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation can yield improved estimates of inundation-induced woody-plant mortality.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Glacial deposits offer discrete snapshots of glacier extent but cannot provide the continuous records required for detailed interhemispheric comparisons. By contrast, lakes located within glaciated catchments can provide continuous archives of upstream glacial activity, but few such records extend beyond the last glacial cycle. Here a piston core from Lake Junín in the uppermost Amazon basin provides the first, to our knowledge, continuous, independently dated archive of tropical glaciation spanning 700,000 years. We find that tropical glaciers tracked changes in global ice volume and followed a clear approximately 100,000-year periodicity. An enhancement in the extent of tropical Andean glaciers relative to global ice volume occurred between 200,000 and 400,000 years ago, during sustained intervals of regionally elevated hydrologic balance that modified the regular approximately 23,000-year pacing of monsoon-driven precipitation. Millennial-scale variations in the extent of tropical Andean glaciers during the last glacial cycle were driven by variations in regional monsoon strength that were linked to temperature perturbations in Greenland ice cores; these interhemispheric connections may have existed during previous glacial cycles.","Nature Publishing Group","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

(ORCID:000000024845594X)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Mixed-phase clouds are ubiquitous in the Arctic. These clouds can persist for days and dissipate in a matter of hours. It is sometimes unknown what causes this sudden dissipation, but aerosol–cloud interactions may be involved. Arctic aerosol concentrations can be low enough to affect cloud formation and structure, and it has been hypothesized that, in some instances, concentrations can drop below some critical value needed to maintain a cloud. We use observations from a Department of Energy ARM site on the northern slope of Alaska at Oliktok Point (OLI), the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) field campaign in the high Arctic Ocean, and the Integrated Characterisation of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric state, and Precipitation at Summit – Aerosol Cloud Experiment (ICECAPS-ACE) project at the NSF (National Science Foundation) Summit Station in Greenland (SMT) to identify one case per site where Arctic boundary layer clouds dissipated coincidentally with a decrease in surface aerosol concentrations. These cases are used to initialize idealized large eddy simulations (LESs) in which aerosol concentrations are held constant until, at a specified time, all aerosols are removed instantaneously – effectively creating an extreme case of aerosol-limited dissipation which represents the fastest a cloud could possibly dissipate via this process. These LESs are compared against the observed data to determine whether cases could, potentially, be dissipating due to insufficient aerosol. The OLI case's observed liquid water path (LWP) dissipated faster than its simulation, indicating that other processes are likely the primary drivers of the dissipation. The ASCOS and SMT observed LWP dissipated at similar rates to their respective simulations, suggesting that aerosol-limited dissipation may be occurring in these instances. We also find that the microphysical response to this extreme aerosol forcing depends greatly on the specific case being simulated. Cases with drizzling liquid layers are simulated to dissipate by accelerating precipitation when aerosol is removed while the case with a non-drizzling liquid layer dissipates quickly, possibly glaciating via the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process. The non-drizzling case is also more sensitive to ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations than the drizzling cases. Overall, the simulations suggest that aerosol-limited cloud dissipation in the Arctic is plausible and that there are at least two microphysical pathways by which aerosol-limited dissipation can occur.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Estimating Drizzle Parameters by Aircraft Sampling","Senum, Gunnar I.; McGraw, R","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In-cloud supersaturation is calculated from aircraft derived measurements of the in-cloud vertical gradient of liquid water content, vertical velocity, the pt and 3 rd cloud droplet radius moments and a parameter related to the heat and mass transport during condensation and evaporation of cloud droplets. The aircraft data where taken during the VOCALS 2008 study in marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of Chile. Approximately 16000 discrete samples, 2.5 meter in length, were used in the present analysis of in-cloud supersaturation and its variability, both of which are indicative of turbulent processes within the cloud and their significant impact on drizzle formation. Two additional drizzle parameters, the eddy persistence time and the variance of fluctuations in in-cloud droplet growth rate were also estimated from this data set.

"A Machine‐Learning‐Assisted Stochastic Cloud Population Model as a Parameterization of Cumulus Convection","Hagos, Samson; Chen, Jingyi; Barber, Katelyn; Sakaguchi, Koichi; Plant, Robert S.; Feng, Zhe; Xiao, Heng","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; cloud population; stochastic; machine learning; cumulus parameterization; wrf","A machine-learning-assisted stochastic cloud population model is coupled with the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to represent fluctuations in cloud-base mass flux associated with the life cycles and interactions among cumulus convection cells. In this cloud population model, the size distribution and associated cloud-base mass flux of the convective cells are related to their previous state and to the change in the total convective area via a transition function. The convective area tendency in turn is assumed to depend on the cloud base mass flux that is resolved by the host WRF model. The transition function is represented by a single hidden-layer neural network trained by the evolution of convective cell size distributions in a 1 km grid-spacing WRF simulation run over the Australian Monsoon region. At every grid point of the host model, the cloud population model predicts the cell size and cloud-base mass flux distributions from which a random sample of cells is fed to an entraining parcel model that calculates precipitation as well as the associated liquid water potential temperature and total moisture tendencies. These tendencies are averaged over the cells and provided to the host model. Several regional simulations are performed over tropical and mid-latitude domains to test this as a potential approach to scale-aware parameterization. Compared to control simulations without parameterization, it is shown that such an approach can produce realistic precipitation statistics and propagation of precipitation associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation, while maintaining realistic depictions of the diurnal cycle over both land and ocean.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Knowledge on how environmental changes influence microbial community dynamics is crucial but currently limited. Here we unraveled ecological processes generating distribution patterns of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton communities in a river draining an urbanizing watershed in southern China. In this ecosystem, longitudinal environmental heterogeneity and directional flow potentially have counteracting effects on planktonic community assembly. Using simultaneously multiple approaches, we showed that the observed compositional patterns result from an interplay of stochastic and deterministic processes, indicating that dispersal via fluvial connectivity could not override local selective pressures. Successional shifts in the relative importance of the above processes were associated with trends in climatic factors. High diversity was observed at the intermediate levels of ecological processes alongside intense inter-species interactions maintained by a few keystone taxa. Altogether, interactions between climatic conditions, landscape and hydrology control plankton community dynamics.","Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography - Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Mitigating life cycle GHG emissions of roads to be built through 2030: Case study of a Chinese province","Huang, Yuqiao; Wolfram, Paul; Miller, Reed; Azarijafari, Hessam; Guo, Fengdi; An, Kangxin; Li, Jin; Hertwich, Edgar; Gregory, Jeremy; Wang, Can","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We report the expansion of road networks in emerging economies such as China causes significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This development is conflicting with China's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality. Thus, there is a need to better understand life cycle emissions of road infrastructure and opportunities to mitigate these emissions. Existing impact studies of roads in developing countries do not address recycled materials, improved pavement maintenance, or pavement-vehicle interaction and electric vehicle (EV) adoption. Combining firsthand information from Chinese road construction engineers with publicly available data, this paper estimates a comprehensive account of GHG emissions of the road pavement network to be constructed in the next ten years in the Shandong province in Northern China. Further, we estimate the potential of GHG emission reductions achievable under three scenario sets: maintenance optimization, alternative pavement material replacement, and EV adoption. Results show that the life cycle GHG emissions of highways and Class 1–4 roads to be constructed in the next 10 years amount to 147 Mt CO2-eq. Considering the use phase in our model reveals that it is the dominant stage in terms of emissions, largely due to pavement-vehicle interaction. Vehicle electrification can only moderately mitigate these emissions. Other stages, such as materials production and road maintenance and rehabilitation, contribute substantially to GHG emissions as well, highlighting the importance of optimizing the management of these stages. Surprisingly, longer, not shorter maintenance intervals, yield significant emission reductions. Another counter-intuitive finding is that thicker and more material-intensive pavement surfaces cause lower emissions overall. Taken together, optimal maintenance and rehabilitation schedules, alternative material use, and vehicle electrification provide GHG reduction potentials of 11%, 4%–16% and 2%–6%, respectively.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Particle Size Reduction of Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Increases the Rate of Enzymatic Depolymerization But Does Not Increase the Overall Conversion Extent","Brizendine, Richard K.; Erickson, Erika; Haugen, Stefan J.; Ramirez, Kelsey J.; Miscall, Joel; Salvachúa, Davinia; Pickford, Andrew R.; Sobkowicz, Margaret J.; McGeehan, John E.; Beckham, Gregg T.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; plastic recycling; cutinase; interfacial biocatalysis; kinetics; crystallinity; particle size; analytical apparatus; monomers; peptides and proteins","Enzymatic depolymerization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has emerged as a potential method for PET recycling, but extensive thermomechanical preprocessing to reduce both the crystallinity and particle size of PET is often conducted, which is costly and energy-intensive. In the current work, we use high-crystallinity PET (HC-PET) and low-crystallinity cryomilled PET (CM-PET) with three distinct particle size distributions to investigate the effect of PET particle size and crystallinity on the performance of a variant of the leaf compost-cutinase enzyme (LCC-ICCG). We show that LCC-ICCG hydrolyzes PET, resulting in the accumulation of terephthalic acid and, interestingly, also releases significant amount of mono(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate. Particle size reduction of PET increased the maximum rate of reaction for HC-PET, while the maximum hydrolysis rate for CM-PET was not significantly different across particle sizes. For both substrates, however, we show that particle size reduction has little effect on the overall conversion extent. Specifically, the CM-PET film was converted to 99 ± 0.2% mass loss within 48 h, while the HC-PET powder reached only 23.5 ± 0.0% conversion in 144 h. Altogether, these results suggest that amorphization of PET is a necessary pretreatment step for enzymatic PET recycling using the LCC-ICCG enzyme but that particle size reduction may not be required.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, to understand the forms of community-level resilience that emerged while hard infrastructure systems took time recover, this article (1) abductively explores resilience as an emergent phenomenon of complex adaptive systems; (2) identifies subsequent forms of social capital, local adaptive capacities, and manifestations of quantifiable variables, such as infrastructure performance, in community experiences; and (3) demonstrates a framework to integrate disparate methodologies for resilience assessments via a multiplicity of mappings of space and place. We combine ethnographic and geospatial methods into an interactive GeoApp for analysis using participant-coded narratives and a series of geospatial indicators as a thick map. Thick mapping facilitates quantitative and qualitative data analysis at several scales, while enabling qualitative query of collected narratives. Results highlight local innovation, community bonding and bridging, and nuances in the role of public institutions as emergent elements of resilience. The thick map shows how top-down assessments can be augmented by thick data and how multiple framings can be anchored in the same system or place.

BB aerosols are transported westward over the south-eastern Atlantic with the mid-tropospheric winds, resulting in significant radiative effects. Ascension Island (ASI) is located midway between Africa and South America. From June 2016 to October 2017, a 17-month in situ observation campaign on ASI found a low single-scattering albedo (SSA) as well as a high mass absorption cross-section of black carbon (MAC<sub>BC</sub>), demonstrating the strong absorbing marine boundary layer in the south-eastern Atlantic. Here we investigate the monthly variations of critical optical properties of BB aerosols, i.e. SSA and MAC<sub>BC</sub>, during the BB seasons and the driving factors behind these variations. Both SSA and MAC<sub>BC</sub> increase from June to August and decrease in September and October. The average SSA during the BB seasons is 0.81 at 529 nm wavelength, with the highest mean ~0.85 in October and the lowest ~0.78 in August. The absorption enhancement (E<sub>abs</sub>) derived from the MAC<sub>BC </sub>shows similar trends with SSA, with the average during the whole of the BB seasons at ~1.96 and ~2.07 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. As the E<sub>abs</sub> is higher than the ~1.5 commonly adopted value by climate models, this result suggests the marine boundary layer in the south-eastern Atlantic is more absorbing than model simulations. We find the enhanced ratio of BC to CO (ΔBC/ΔCO, equal to BC/ΔCO as the BC background concentration is considered to be 0) is well correlated with SSA and MAC<sub>BC</sub>, providing a simple way to estimate the aerosol optical characteristics in the south-eastern Atlantic. The exponential function we proposed can approximate SSA and MAC<sub>BC</sub> with BC/ΔCO, and when BC/ΔCO is small it can capture the rapid growth of SSA as BC/ΔCO decreases. BC/ΔCO is influenced by combustion conditions and aerosol scavenging. From the analysis of the location of BB, the primary source fuel, the water content in the fuel, combined with the mean cloud cover and precipitation in the transport areas of the BB plume, we conclude that the increase in BC/ΔCO from June to August is likely to be caused by burning becoming more flaming. The reduction in the water content of fuels may be responsible for the change in the burning conditions from June to August. The decrease in BC/ΔCO in September and October may be caused by two factors, one being a lower proportion of flaming conditions, possibly associated with a decrease in mean surface wind speed in the burning area, and the other being an increase in precipitation in the BB transport pathway, leading to enhanced aerosol scavenging, which ultimately results in an increase in SSA and MAC<sub>BC</sub>.","Copernicus GmbH","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Effect of dust on rainfall over the Red Sea coast based on WRF-Chem model simulations","Parajuli, Sagar P.; Stenchikov, Georgiy L.; Ukhov, Alexander; Mostamandi, Suleiman; Kucera, Paul A.; Axisa, Duncan; Gustafson Jr., William I.; Zhu, Yannian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Water is the single most important element of life. Rainfall plays an important role in the spatial and temporal distribution of this precious natural resource, and it has a direct impact on agricultural production, daily life activities, and human health. One of the important elements that govern rainfall formation and distribution is atmospheric aerosol, which also affects the Earth's radiation balance and climate. Therefore, understanding how dust compositions and distributions affect the regional rainfall pattern is crucial, particularly in regions with high atmospheric dust loads such as the Middle East. Although aerosol and rainfall research has garnered increasing attention as both an independent and interdisciplinary topic in the last few decades, the details of various direct and indirect pathways by which dust affects rainfall are not yet fully understood. Here, we explored the effects of dust on rainfall formation and distribution as well as the physical mechanisms that govern these phenomena, using high-resolution WRF-Chem simulations (~1.5 km × 1.5 km) configured with an advanced double-moment cloud microphysics scheme coupled with a sectional eight-bin aerosol scheme. Our model-simulated results were realistic, as evaluated from multiple perspectives including vertical profiles of aerosol concentrations, aerosol size distributions, vertical profiles of air temperature, diurnal wind cycles, and spatio-temporal rainfall patterns. Rainfall over the Red Sea coast is mainly caused by warm rain processes, which are typically confined within a height of ~6 km over the Sarawat mountains and exhibit a strong diurnal cycle that peaks in the evening at approximately 18:00 local time under the influence of sea breezes. Numerical experiments indicated that dust could both suppress or enhance rainfall. The effect of dust on rainfall was calculated as total, indirect, and direct effects, based on 10-year August-average daily-accumulated rainfall over the study domain covering the eastern Red Sea coast. For extreme rainfall events (domain-average daily-accumulated rainfall of ≥ 1.33 mm), the net effect of dust on rainfall was positive or enhancement (6.05 %), with the indirect effect (4.54 %) and direct effect (1.51 %) both causing rainfall increase. At a 5 % significance level, the total and indirect effects were statistically significant whereas the direct effect was not. For normal rainfall events (domain-average daily-accumulated rainfall < 1.33 mm), the indirect effect enhanced rainfall (4.76 %) whereas the direct effect suppressed rainfall (-5.78 %), resulting in a negative net suppressing effect (-1.02 %), all of which were statistically significant. We investigated the possible physical mechanisms of the effects and found that the rainfall suppression by dust direct effects was mainly caused by the scattering of solar radiation by dust. The surface cooling induced by dust weakens the sea breeze circulation, which decreases the associated landward moisture transport, ultimately suppressing rainfall. For extreme rainfall events, dust causes net rainfall enhancement through indirect effects as the high dust concentration facilitates raindrops to grow when the water vapor is sufficiently available. Our results have broader scientific and environmental implications. Specifically, although dust is considered a problem from an air quality perspective, our results highlight the important role of dust on sea breeze circulation and associated rainfall over the Red Sea coastal regions. Our results also have implications for cloud seeding and water resource management.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Competitive Metabolism of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs): An Assessment Using In Vitro Metabolism and Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling","Smith, Jordan N.; Gaither, Kari A.; Pande, Paritosh","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; benzo[a]pyrene; dibenzo[def,p]chrysene; Relative Potency Factor approach; mixture risk assessment","Humans are routinely exposed to complex mixtures such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) rather than to single compounds, as are often assessed for hazards. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) metabolize PAHs, and multiple PAHs found in mixtures can compete as substrates for individual CYPs (e.g., CYP1A1, CYP1B1, etc.). The objective of this study was to assess competitive inhibition of metabolism of PAH mixtures in humans and evaluate a key assumption of the Relative Potency Factor approach that common human exposures will not cause interactions among mixture components. To test this objective, we co-incubated binary mixtures of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC) in human hepatic microsomes and measured rates of enzymatic BaP and DBC disappearance. We observed competitive inhibition of BaP and DBC metabolism and measured inhibition coefficients (K<sub>i</sub>), observing that BaP inhibited DBC metabolism more potently than DBC inhibited BaP metabolism (0.061 vs. 0.44 µM K<sub>i</sub>, respectively). We developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) interaction model by integrating PBPK models of DBC and BaP and incorporating measured metabolism inhibition coefficients. The PBPK model predicts significant increases in BaP and DBC concentrations in blood AUCs following high oral doses of PAHs (≥100 mg), five orders of magnitude higher than typical human exposures. We also measured inhibition coefficients of Supermix-10, a mixture of the most abundant PAHs measured at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site, on BaP and DBC metabolism. We observed similar potencies of inhibition coefficients of Supermix-10 compared to BaP and DBC. Overall, results of this study demonstrate that these PAHs compete for the same enzymes and, at high doses, inhibit metabolism and alter internal dosimetry of exposed PAHs. This approach predicts that BaP and DBC exposures required to observe metabolic interaction are much higher than typical human exposures, consistent with assumptions used when applying the Relative Potency Factor approach for PAH mixture risk assessment.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The impact of hurricane disturbances on a tropical forest: implementing a palm plant functional type and hurricane disturbance module in ED2-HuDi V1.0","Zhang, Jiaying; Bras, Rafael L.; Longo, Marcos; Scalley, Tamara Heartsill","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Hurricanes commonly disturb and damage tropical forests. Hurricane frequency and intensity are predicted to change under the changing climate. The short-term impacts of hurricane disturbances to tropical forests have been widely studied, but the long-term impacts are rarely investigated. Modeling is critical to investigate the potential response of forests to future disturbances, particularly if the nature of the disturbances is changing with climate. Unfortunately, existing models of forest dynamics are not presently able to account for hurricane disturbances. Therefore, we implement the Hurricane Disturbance in the Ecosystem Demography model (ED2) (ED2-HuDi). The hurricane disturbance includes hurricane-induced immediate mortality and subsequent recovery modules. The parameterizations are based on observations at the Bisley Experimental Watersheds (BEW) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico. We add one new plant functional type (PFT) to the model – Palm, as palms cannot be categorized into one of the current existing PFTs and are known to be an abundant component of tropical forests worldwide. The model is calibrated with observations at BEW using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach. The optimal simulation obtained from GLUE has a mean relative error of –21 %, –12 %, and –15 % for stem density, basal area, and aboveground biomass, respectively. The optimal simulation also agrees well with the observation in terms of PFT composition (+1 %, –8 %, –2 %, and +9 % differences in the percentages of “Early”, “Mid”, “Late”, and “Palm” PFTs, respectively) and size structure of the forest (+0.8 % differences in the percentage of large stems). Lastly, using the optimal parameter set, we study the impact of forest initial condition on the recovery of the forest from a single hurricane disturbance. The results indicate that, compared to a no-hurricane scenario, a single hurricane disturbance has little impact on forest structure (+1 % change in the percentage of large stems) and composition (<1 % change in the percentage of each of the four PFTs) but leads to 5 % higher aboveground biomass after 80 years of succession. The assumption of a less severe hurricane disturbance leads to a 4 % increase in aboveground biomass.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Long-term erosion rates inferred from <sup>10</sup>Be concentrations in quartz extracted from central Cuban river sand range from 3.4–189 Mg km<sup>–2</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup> (mean 59, median 45). Dissolved loads (10–176 Mg km<sup>–2</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>; mean 92, median 97), calculated from stream solute concentrations and modeled runoff, exceed measured cosmogenic-<sup>10</sup>Be-derived erosion rates in 18 of 23 basins. This disparity mandates that in this environment landscape-scale mass loss is not fully represented by the cosmogenic nuclide measurements. The <sup>26</sup>Al /<sup>10</sup>Be ratios are lower than expected for steadystate exposure or erosion in 16 of 24 samples. Depressed <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be ratios occur in many of the basins that have the greatest disparity between dissolved loads (high) and erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic nuclide concentrations (low). Depressed <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be ratios are consistent with the presence of a deep, mixed, regolith layer providing extended storage times on slopes and/or burial and extended storage during fluvial transport. River water chemical analyses indicate that many basins with lower <sup>26</sup>Al/<sup>10</sup>Be ratios and high <sup>10</sup>Be concentrations are underlain at least in part by evaporitic rocks that rapidly dissolve. Our data show that when assessing mass loss in humid tropical landscapes, accounting for the contribution of rock dissolution at depth is particularly important. In such warm, wet climates, mineral dissolution can occur many meters below the surface, beyond the penetration depth of most cosmic rays and thus the production of most cosmogenic nuclides. Our data suggest the importance of estimating solute fluxes and measuring paired cosmogenic nuclides to better understand the processes and rates of mass transfer at a basin scale.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Observational studies and models typically use relationships between observed shrub presence and current environmental suitability (bioclimate and topography) to predict shrub expansion, while omitting shrub demographic processes and non-stationary response to changing climate. Here, we use high-resolution satellite imagery across Alaska and western Canada to show that observed shrub expansion has not been controlled by environmental suitability during 1984–2014, but can only be explained by considering seed dispersal and fire. These findings provide the impetus for better observations of recruitment and for incorporating currently underrepresented processes of seed dispersal and fire in land models to project shrub expansion and climate feedbacks. Integrating these dynamic processes with projected fire extent and climate, we estimate shrubs will expand into 25% of the non-shrub tundra by 2100, in contrast to 39% predicted based on increasing environmental suitability alone. Thus, using environmental suitability alone likely overestimates and misrepresents shrub expansion pattern and its associated carbon sink.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Concentrations of labile copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), sulfate, chloride, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured with the diffusive gradients in thin film (DGT) and peeper. A good agreement between peeper- and DGT-measured metals was observed for Cu (regression r<sup>2</sup> = 0.3, 95% CI of the slopes > 0), but not for Zn (95% CI of the slopes overlapped with 0), which was attributed to the different complexed compounds between Cu and Zn in porewater. The depth profile of labile metals in sediment porewater varied with time and was consistent with the solid-phase metal deposition, showing higher concentrations in the surface layer (3 to –3 cm) than in the bottom layer (–4 to –13 cm). The depth-averaged labile Cu and Zn concentrations measured by DGT were 1.0 and 3.1 µg/L, and labile sulfate, chloride, and DOC concentrations measured by peeper were 1.8, 3.6, and 2.1 mg/L, respectively. A sharp decrease in sulfate occurred in September when sulfate concentrations became the lowest among sampling months. This was caused by the seasonal sulfur cycles in the wetland, where the dominant sulfur reaction is sulfate reduction in warm seasons and sulfide oxidation in cold seasons. Different metal-removal mechanisms were observed in the two wetland cells; sulfur dynamics controlled the removal processes in the cell without frequent disturbance but failed to influence metal removal in the cell with frequent disturbance due to the interruption of anoxic layers. The flux ratios that compare labile element concentrations between the water column and the SWI (R-Cu, R-Zn, R-DOC, R-sulfate, and R-chloride) were generated to determine metal diffusive fluxes at the interface. Labile Zn was mostly transported from the water to the SWI during all seasons (R-Zn < 1 for all months except January). Labile Cu moved from the SWI to the water during the warm months (R-Cu < 1), which was explained by the bioturbation-induced transport of organic matter based on the positive correlations between R-Cu and R-DOC. In general, sediment can serve either as a sink or a source depending on the environmental conditions, metal speciation, and presence of living organisms. Here, metal flux at the SWI is a key component in the biogeochemical cycling of a constructed wetland.","Springer","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

In this study, we combined the CLM-Microbe model with three footprint algorithms to scale up CH <sub>4</sub> flux from a plot level to eddy covariance (EC) tower domains (200 m × 200 m) in the Alaska North Slope, for three sites in Utqiaġvik (US-Beo, US-Bes, and US-Brw), one in Atqasuk (US-Atq) and one in Ivotuk (US-Ivo), for a period of 2013–2015. Three footprint algorithms were the homogenous footprint (HF) that assumes even contribution of all grid cells, the gradient footprint (GF) that assumes gradually declining contribution from center grid cells to edges, and the dynamic footprint (DF) that considers the impacts of wind and heterogeneity of land surface. Simulated annual CH <sub>4</sub> flux was highly consistent with the EC measurements at US-Beo and US-Bes. In contrast, flux was overestimated at US-Brw, US-Atq, and US-Ivo due to the higher simulated CH <sub>4</sub> flux in early growing seasons. The simulated monthly CH <sub>4</sub> flux was consistent with EC measurements but with different accuracies among footprint algorithms. At US-Bes in September 2013, RMSE and NNSE were 0.002 μmol m <sup>−2</sup>  s <sup>−1</sup> and 0.782 using the DF algorithm, but 0.007 μmol m <sup>−2</sup>  s <sup>−1</sup> and 0.758 using HF and 0.007 μmol m <sup>−2</sup>  s <sup>−1</sup> and 0.765 using GF, respectively. DF algorithm performed better than the HF and GF algorithms in capturing the temporal variation in daily CH <sub>4</sub> flux each month, while the model accuracy was similar among the three algorithms due to flat landscapes. Temporal variations in CH <sub>4</sub> flux during 2013–2015 were predominately explained by air temperature (67–74%), followed by precipitation (22–36%). Spatial heterogeneities in vegetation fraction and elevation dominated the spatial variations in CH <sub>4</sub> flux for all five tower domains despite relatively weak differences in simulated CH <sub>4</sub> flux among three footprint algorithms. The CLM-Microbe model can simulate CH <sub>4</sub> flux at both plot and landscape scales at a high temporal resolution, which should be applied to other landscapes. Integrating land surface models with an appropriate algorithm provides a powerful tool for upscaling CH <sub>4</sub> flux in terrestrial ecosystems. </p>","Frontiers Media SA","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Probabilistic estimation of depth-resolved profiles of soil thermal diffusivity from temperature time series","Brunetti, Carlotta; Lamb, John; Wielandt, Stijn; Uhlemann, Sebastian; Shirley, Ian; McClure, Patrick; Dafflon, Baptiste (ORCID:0000000198715650)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Improving the quantification of soil thermal and physical properties is key to achieving a better understanding and prediction of soil hydro-biogeochemical processes and their responses to changes in atmospheric forcing. Obtaining such information at numerous locations and/or over time with conventional soil sampling is challenging. The increasing availability of low-cost, vertically resolved temperature sensor arrays offers promise for improving the estimation of soil thermal properties from temperature time series, and the possible indirect estimation of physical properties. Still, the reliability and limitations of such an approach need to be assessed. In the present study, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on a combination of thermal modeling, sliding time windows, Bayesian inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate thermal diffusivity and its uncertainty over time, at numerous locations and at an unprecedented vertical spatial resolution (i.e., down to 5 to 10 cm vertical resolution) from soil temperature time series. We provide the necessary framework to assess under which environmental conditions (soil temperature gradient, fluctuations, and trend), temperature sensor characteristics (bias and level of noise), and deployment geometries (sensor number and position) soil thermal diffusivity can be reliably inferred. We validate the method with synthetic experiments and field studies. The synthetic experiments show that in the presence of median diurnal fluctuations ≥ 1.5 ∘C at 5 cm below the ground surface, temperature gradients > 2 ∘C m−1, and a sliding time window of at least 4 d the proposed method provides reliable depth-resolved thermal diffusivity estimates with percentage errors ≤ 10 % and posterior relative standard deviations ≤ 5 % up to 1 m depth. Reliable thermal diffusivity under such environmental conditions also requires temperature sensors to be spaced precisely (with accuracy to a few millimeters), with a level of noise ≤ 0.02 ∘C, and with a bias defined by a standard deviation ≤ 0.01 ∘C. Finally, the application of the developed approach to field data indicates significant repeatability in results and similarity with independent measurements, as well as promise in using a sliding time window to estimate temporal changes in soil thermal diffusivity, as needed to potentially capture changes in bulk density or water content.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This human influence operates at multiple scales: from short-term (hourly to daily) to long-term (annually to centennial) timescales, and from the local to the global, pushing systems towards either desirable or undesirable outcomes. However, the effort to represent human systems in multisector models has been fragmented across philosophical, methodological, and disciplinary lines. To cohere insights across diverse modeling approaches, we present a new typology for classifying how human actors are represented in the broad suite of coupled human-natural system models that are applied in MultiSector Dynamics (MSD) research. The typology conceptualizes a “sector” as a system-of-systems that includes a diverse group of human actors, defined across individual to collective social levels, involved in governing, provisioning, and utilizing products, goods, or services towards some human end. We trace the salient features of modeled representations of human systems by organizing the typology around three key questions: 1) Who are the modeled actors in MSD systems? 2) What are their modeled actions? 3) How and for what purpose are these actors and actions operationalized in a computational model? The typology is used to critically examine existing models and chart the frontier of future human systems modeling for MSD research.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Tropical Oceanic Influences on Observed Global Tropical Cyclone Frequency","Patricola, Christina M.; Cassidy, Daniel J.; Klotzbach, Philip J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The global tropical cyclone (TC) number has historically been relatively constant from year-to-year however, the reason remains unknown. Furthermore, climate projections are inconclusive regarding future global TC frequency changes. Here, we investigated years in which observed global TC activity deviated from the mean and potential links to ocean drivers from 1980–2021. We found that the annual global number of named storm days and accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) were significantly linked with El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM). La Niña and positive AMM are associated with the bottom percentiles of both TC metrics, and vice versa for El Niño and negative AMM. The ENSO Longitude Index explains variability in annual global named storm days and ACE as well as the Niño 3.4 index. This research reveals that reliable future projections of ENSO are necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding future changes in global TC frequency.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

Here, we produce spatially-resolved global estimates of mineral-associated organic carbon stocks and carbon-storage capacity by analyzing 1144 globally-distributed soil profiles. We show that current stocks total 899 Pg C to a depth of 1 m in non-permafrost mineral soils.

Regions under agricultural management and deeper soil layers show the largest undersaturation of mineral-associated carbon. Critically, the degree of undersaturation indicates sequestration efficiency over years to decades. We show that, across 103 carbon-accrual measurements spanning management interventions globally, soils furthest from their mineralogical capacity are more effective at accruing carbon; sequestration rates average 3-times higher in soils at one tenth of their capacity compared to soils at one half of their capacity.

Much of this C is thousands of years old, suggesting that subsoils offer considerable potential for long-term C sequestration. However, knowledge of subsoil C behaviour and manageability remains incomplete, and subsoil C storage potential has yet to be realised at a large scale, particularly in agricultural systems. A range of biological (e.g. deep-rooting), chemical (e.g. biochar burial) and physical (e.g. deep ploughing) C sequestration strategies have been proposed, but are yet to be assessed. In this review, we identify the main factors that regulate subsoil C cycling and critically evaluate the evidence and mechanistic basis of subsoil strategies designed to promote greater C storage, with particular emphasis on agroecosystems. We assess the barriers and opportunities for the implementation of strategies to enhance subsoil C sequestration and identify 5 key current gaps in scientific understanding. We conclude that subsoils, while highly heterogeneous, are in many cases more suited to long-term C sequestration than topsoils. The proposed strategies may also bring other tangible benefits to cropping systems (e.g. enhanced water holding capacity and nutrient use efficiency). Furthermore, while the subsoil C sequestration strategies we reviewed have large potential, more long-term studies are needed across a diverse range of soils and climates, in conjunction with chronosequence and space-for-time substitutions. Also, it is vital that subsoils are more consistently included in modelled estimations of soil C stocks and C sequestration potential, and that subsoil-explicit C models are developed to specifically reflect subsoil processes. Finally, further mapping of subsoil C is needed in specific regions (e.g. in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Africa). Conducting both immediate and long-term subsoil C studies will fill the knowledge gaps to devise appropriate soil C sequestration strategies and policies to help in the global fight against climate change and decline in soil quality. In conclusion, our evidence-based analysis reveals that subsoils offer an untapped potential to enhance global C storage in terrestrial ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

While canopy structural indicators such as leaf area index (LAI), canopy cover, and canopy height have been widely studied in the context of disturbance, the post-disturbance temporal dynamics of structural complexity, which summarizes the heterogeneity of vegetation arrangement, are poorly understood. With the goal of advancing conceptual and empirical understanding of the temporal dynamics of structural complexity following disturbance, we synthesized results from three large-scale disturbance manipulation experiments at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS): the 4-year Forest Resilience Threshold Experiment (FoRTE) manipulating levels of disturbance severity; the decade-long Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET), in which all early successional tree species were stem-girdled within 39 ha in the same landscape; and forest chronosequences established following clear-cut harvesting. We found that the temporal dynamics of canopy structure following disturbance were dependent upon three factors: (1) the source and severity of disturbance; (2) the spatial and temporal scales of analysis; and (3) the measure of structure assessed. Unlike vegetation area index and canopy cover, which initially decreased in response to disturbance, structural complexity measures such as canopy and top rugosity did not consistently respond to moderate levels of disturbance severity. Over multi-decadal timescales, structural complexity increased to a maximum, regardless of whether fire occurred at the time of stand establishment, but intervening low-to-moderate severity disturbance in regrown century-old forests altered trajectories of canopy rugosity. We conclude that structural complexity indicators display a more nuanced temporal and directional response to disturbance than conventional leaf area and cover indexes. Predicting what disturbance conditions modify trajectories of structural complexity remains critical to disturbance characterization and the inference of ecosystem functioning.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Dissolved pyrogenic carbon leaching in soil: Effects of soil depth and pyrolysis temperature","Santos, Fernanda; Bird, Jeffrey A.; Asefaw Berhe, Asmeret","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; dissolved pyrogenic carbon; biochar; leaching; soil depth; pyrolysis temperature; pine wood","We report Pyrogenic organic carbon (PyC) is found in soils as a heterogeneous mixture of thermally altered plant residues that range in their susceptibility to losses via mineralization, leaching, and erosion. Leaching of PyC as DOC (DPyC) within the soil profile is likely influenced by the chemical composition of solid PyC and the dominant soil processes and properties at a particular depth. Here we report the results of a 2-year laboratory decomposition and leaching study designed to investigate the interactive effects of pyrolysis temperature levels (no pyrolysis, 300 °C, and 450 °C) and soil depth (surface soil, 0–10 cm depth; subsurface soil, 50–70 cm depth) on losses of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled jack pine (Pinus banksiana) wood, wood pyrolyzed at 300 °C (PyC300) and wood pyrolyzed at 450 °C (PyC450) as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Losses of wood and PyC in the <sup>13</sup>C- DOC pool were measured in leachates drained from soils once a month over the course of 1 year, and at one single leaching event after 2 years. We found that pyrolysis temperature levels interacted with time and soil depth to affect losses of wood and PyC as DOC throughout the 1-year incubation and leaching study, with greater DOC losses from wood in surface soil (0.73 ± 0.076% of added C) than in subsurface soil (0.40 ± 0.063% of added C) averaged across sampling time. Monthly DOC losses from PyC were not affected by soil depth. Cumulative data indicated a small contribution of wood (2.86 ± 0.07%), PyC300 (0.40 ± 0.04%), and PyC450 (0.16 ± 0.01%) to total DOC leached from soils. DOC losses from wood and PyC300 (as a proportion of added C) were greater in surface soil than in subsurface soil, whereas DOC losses from PyC450 were unaffected by differences between surface and subsurface soil. Losses of DOC were greater from PyC300 than from PyC450 in surface soil, with no significant differences in DOC losses between PyC300 and PyC450 in subsurface soil. One single leaching event at the end of the 2-year decomposition study resulted in higher DOC losses from wood in subsurface soil than in surface soil likely due to desorption, and no differences in DOC losses between PyC300 and PyC450 regardless of soil depth. Our results suggest strong interactions between the initial physicochemical composition of organic C inputs and soil properties (soil depth as a proxy) that control the mobility and transport of PyC and should be better represented in Earth system models.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Quantifying the Impact of Lagged Hydrological Responses on the Effectiveness of Groundwater Conservation","Glose, Thomas J.; Zipper, Sam C.; Hyndman, David W.; Kendall, Anthony D.; Deines, Jillian M.; Butler, Jr., James J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; numerical modeling; lagged processes; groundwater conservation; pumping reductions","Many irrigated agricultural areas seek to prolong the lifetime of their groundwater resources by reducing pumping. However, it is unclear how lagged responses, such as reduced groundwater recharge caused by more efficient irrigation, may impact the long-term effectiveness of conservation initiatives. Here, we use a variably saturated, simplified surrogate groundwater model to: 1) analyze aquifer responses to pumping reductions, 2) quantify time lags between reductions and groundwater level responses, and 3) identify the physical controls on lagged responses. We explore a range of plausible model parameters for an area of the High Plains Aquifer (USA) where stakeholder-driven conservation has slowed groundwater depletion. We identify two types of lagged responses that reduce the long-term effectiveness of groundwater conservation, recharge-dominated and lateral-flow-dominated, with vertical hydraulic conductivity (K<sub>Z</sub>) the major controlling variable. When high K<sub>z</sub> allows percolation to reach the aquifer, more efficient irrigation reduces groundwater recharge. By contrast, when low K<sub>z</sub> impedes vertical flow, short term changes in recharge are negligible, but pumping reductions alter the lateral flow between the groundwater conservation area and the surrounding regions (lateral-flow-dominated response). For the modeled area, we found that a pumping reduction of 30% resulted in median usable lifetime extensions of 20 or 25 years, depending on the dominant lagged response mechanism (recharge- vs. lateral-flow-dominated). These estimates are far shorter than estimates that do not account for lagged responses. To conclude, results indicate that conservation-based pumping reductions can extend aquifer lifetimes, but lagged responses can create a sizable difference between the initially perceived and actual long-term effectiveness.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The impact of multi-sensor land data assimilation on river discharge estimation","Wu, Wen-Ying; Yang, Zong-Liang; Zhao, Long; Lin, Peirong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Data assimilation; River discharge; Terrestrial water storage; GRACE; MODIS; AMSR-E","River discharge is one of the most critical renewable water resources. Accurately estimating river discharge with land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging due to the difficulty in estimating land water storages such as snow, soil moisture, and groundwater. While data assimilation (DA) ingesting optical, microwave, and gravity measurements from space can help constrain theses storage states, its impacts on runoff and eventually river discharge are not fully understood. In this study, by taking advantage of recently published land DA results that jointly assimilate eight different combinations of observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), we quantify to what degree multi-sensor land DA improves the river discharge simulation skills over 40 global river basins, and investigate the complementary strengths of different satellite measurements on river discharge. To be more specific, river discharge is updated by feeding gridded runoff from the eight multi-sensor DA simulations into a vector-based river routing model named the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID). Our modeling results, including 7-year simulations at 177,458 river reaches globally, are used to study the seasonal to interannual variability of river discharge. It is found that assimilating GRACE has the greatest impact on global runoff patterns, leading to the most pronounced improvements in spatial river discharge in the middle and high latitudes with the R<sup>2</sup> increased by 0.16. The seasonal variation of spatial discharge is most skillful during the boreal summer. However, our evaluation also shows model and DA still struggle to generate reasonable variability and averaged discharge over permafrost regions. Finally, by assessing how different satellites add value to discharge forecasts, this study paves the way for more advanced multi-sensor satellite data assimilation to predict the terrestrial hydrological cycle.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The main objective of this study is to explore paleorecharge processes in the deep regional Nubian Sandstone Aquifer (NSA), which stretches below the hyperarid deserts of the Sinai Peninsula (Egypt) and the Negev (Israel), using dissolved noble gas data. Extremely high amounts of dissolved excess air (Ne concentrations up to 4 × solubility equilibrium) were observed in the ancient ( <sup>81</sup>Kr-depleted) groundwater that was recharged during past pluvial epochs in the basin. Here, the observed unique excess air signal and the clear spatiotemporal structure of the noble gas compositions in the aquifer are hypothesized to reflect two major characteristics of the groundwater system: (a) large-scale, long-term rises in the water table that facilitate the entrapment and dissolution of air bubbles under increased hydrostatic pressure, and (b) the geological settings in the southern recharge area in Sinai, including an almost horizontal position of the layers and intercalation of low-permeability rock formations within the aquifer, which inefficiently reject air bubbles from groundwater, thereby allowing for substantial entrapment of bubbles that dissolve as the water table rises. Enhanced dissolution of entrapped air was also observed in other paleo-groundwater-containing regional sandstone aquifers across North Africa, which, together with the recent findings from the NSA, suggest that largescale water table fluctuations have likely extensively occurred during past pluvial periods over these (and possibly other) arid regions. A preliminary assessment of noble gas recharge temperatures (NGTs) indicates an apparent decoupling of surface and water table temperatures in the case of deep aquifers with a thick (hundreds of m) unsaturated zone. This observed decoupling calls for a re-evaluation of previously obtained NGT records and a need for future work to consider the modification of NGTs due to soil air fractionation and geothermal heating of the underlying deep unsaturated zones.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Why the Forcing from Carbon Dioxide Scales as the Logarithm of Its Concentration","Romps, David M.; Seeley, Jacob T.; Edman, Jacob P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; carbon dioxide; radiative forcing; radiative transfer","The radiative forcing from carbon dioxide is approximately logarithmic in its concentration, producing about 4 W m<sup>–2</sup> of global-mean forcing for each doubling. Although these are basic facts of climate science, competing explanations for them have been given in the literature. Here, the reasons for the logarithmic forcing of carbon dioxide are explored in detail and a simplified model for the forcing is constructed. An essential component is the particular distribution of absorption coefficients within the 15-μm band of carbon dioxide. Further, an alternative explanation, which does not depend on the spectrum of carbon dioxide but instead hinges on the tropospheric lapse rate, is shown to be neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the logarithmic forcing of carbon dioxide and to be generally inapplicable to well-mixed greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Automated Identification of Characteristic Droplet Size Distributions in Stratocumulus Clouds Utilizing a Data Clustering Algorithm","Allwayin, Nithin; Larsen, Michael L.; Shaw, Alexander G.; Shaw, Raymond A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Cloud droplets; Cloud microphysics; In situ atmospheric observations; Machine learning; Microscale processes/variability","<title>Abstract</title> <p>Droplet-level interactions in clouds are often parameterized by a modified gamma fitted to a “global” droplet size distribution. Do “local” droplet size distributions of relevance to microphysical processes look like these average distributions? This paper describes an algorithm to search and classify characteristic size distributions within a cloud. The approach combines hypothesis testing, specifically, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, and a widely used class of machine learning algorithms for identifying clusters of samples with similar properties: density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is used as the specific example for illustration. The two-sample KS test does not presume any specific distribution, is parameter free, and avoids biases from binning. Importantly, the number of clusters is not an input parameter of the DBSCAN-type algorithms but is independently determined in an unsupervised fashion. As implemented, it works on an abstract space from the KS test results, and hence spatial correlation is not required for a cluster. The method is explored using data obtained from the Holographic Detector for Clouds (HOLODEC) deployed during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) field campaign. The algorithm identifies evidence of the existence of clusters of nearly identical local size distributions. It is found that cloud segments have as few as one and as many as seven characteristic size distributions. To validate the algorithm’s robustness, it is tested on a synthetic dataset and successfully identifies the predefined distributions at plausible noise levels. The algorithm is general and is expected to be useful in other applications, such as remote sensing of cloud and rain properties.</p> <sec> <title>Significance Statement</title> <p>A typical cloud can have billions of drops spread over tens or hundreds of kilometers in space. Keeping track of the sizes, positions, and interactions of all of these droplets is impractical, and, as such, information about the relative abundance of large and small drops is typically quantified with a “size distribution.” Droplets in a cloud interact locally, however, so this work is motivated by the question of whether the cloud droplet size distribution is different in different parts of a cloud. A new method, based on hypothesis testing and machine learning, determines how many different size distributions are contained in a given cloud. This is important because the size distribution describes processes such as cloud droplet growth and light transmission through clouds.</p> </sec>","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The complexity, immensity, and remoteness of permafrost ecosystems make it difficult to grasp how quickly things are changing and what can be done about it. Here, we summarize terrestrial and marine changes in the permafrost domain with an eye toward global policy. While many questions remain, we know that continued fossil fuel burning is incompatible with the continued existence of the permafrost domain as we know it. If we fail to protect permafrost ecosystems, the consequences for human rights, biosphere integrity, and global climate will be severe. The policy implications are clear: the faster we reduce human emissions and draw down atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, the more of the permafrost domain we can save. Emissions reduction targets must be strengthened and accompanied by support for local peoples to protect intact ecological communities and natural carbon sinks within the permafrost domain. Some proposed geoengineering interventions such as solar shading, surface albedo modification, and vegetation manipulations are unproven and may exacerbate environmental injustice without providing lasting protection. Conversely, astounding advances in renewable energy have reopened viable pathways to halve human greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and effectively stop them well before 2050.

"Hurricane‐Like Vortices in Conditionally Unstable Moist Convection","Chien, Mu‐Hua; Pauluis, Olivier M.; Almgren, Ann S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; moist convection; quasi-equilibrium; tropical cyclone; idealized simulation","This study investigates the emergence of hurricane-like vortices in idealized simulations of rotating moist convection. A Boussinesq atmosphere with simplified thermodynamics for phase transitions is forced by prescribing the temperature and humidity at the upper and lower boundaries. The governing equations are solved numerically using a variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes solver with adaptive mesh refinement to explore the behavior of moist convection under a broad range of conditions. In the absence of rotation, convection aggregates into active patches separated by large unsaturated regions. Rotation modulates this statistical equilibrium state so that the self-aggregated convection organizes hurricane-like vortices. The warm and saturated air converges to the center of the vortices, and the latent heat released through the upwelling, forms the warm core structure. These hurricane-like vortices share characteristics similar to tropical cyclones in the earth's atmosphere. The hurricane-like vortices occur under conditionally unstable conditions where the potential energy given at the boundaries is large enough, corresponding to a moderate rate of rotation. This regime shares many similar characteristics to the tropical atmosphere indicating that the formation of intense mesoscale vortices is a general characteristic of rotating moist convection. The model used here does not include any interactions with radiation, wind-evaporation feedback, or cloud microphysics, indicating that, while these processes may be relevant for tropical cyclogenesis in the Earth atmosphere, they are not its primary cause. Instead, our results confirm that the formation and maintenance of hurricane-like vortices involve a combination of atmospheric dynamics under the presence of rotation and of phase transitions.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Statistical analysis indicates that sea level rose locally by 0.12 to 0.31 m (95% confidence) from 3.26 to 2.84 thousand years (ka) ago (2σ) and remained within 0.08 m (95% confidence) of preindustrial levels from 2.84 ka to 1900 CE.

Here, using a reconstructed long-term proxy of annual TC numbers together with high-resolution climate model experiments, we show robust declining trends in the annual number of TCs at global and regional scales during the twentieth century. The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset is used for reconstruction because, compared with other reanalyses, it assimilates only sea-level pressure fields rather than utilize all available observations in the troposphere, making it less sensitive to temporal inhomogeneities in the observations. It can also capture TC signatures from the pre-satellite era reasonably well. The declining trends found are consistent with the twentieth century weakening of the Hadley and Walker circulations, which make conditions for TC formation less favourable.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Thus, clarifying how primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems responds to climatic variability can reveal key mechanisms that will drive future changes in the global carbon budget. Satellite products of canopy greenness are widely used as proxies for vegetation productivity to evaluate how ecosystems respond to climate variability. However, to what degree inter-annual variations in productivity are consistent with greenness and how this relationship varies spatially remains unclear. Here we investigated the strength of the coupling between inter-annual variations in leaf area index (LAI, a measure of greenness) and ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from eddy covariance towers, i.e., the r2 of the LAI-GPP relationship. Overall, inter-annual GPP and LAI were highly coupled (i.e., high r2) in arid grasslands, but were fully decoupled in mesic evergreen broadleaf forests, indicating that this relationship varies strongly along aridity gradients. A possible mechanism of the spatial variation in the LAI-GPP relationship is that the tradeoff between ecosystem structure (LAI) and physiology (photosynthesis per unit leaf area) becomes stronger in more humid climates. Land models overestimated the r2 of LAI-GPP correlation for most ecosystem types and failed to capture the spatial pattern along aridity gradients. We conclude that relying on greenness products for evaluating inter-annual changes in vegetation productivity may bias assessments, especially in tropical rainforest ecosystems. Our findings may also reconcile observed disparities between responses in greenness and GPP during drought in Amazon forests.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study examines the global life cycle and direct radiative effects (DREs) of dust in the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1), and the impact of increasing model resolution both horizontally and vertically. The default 1° E3SMv1 captures the spatial and temporal variability in the observed dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) reasonably well, but overpredicts dust absorption in the shortwave (SW). Simulations underestimate the dust vertical and long-range transport, compared with the satellite dust extinction profiles. After updating dust refractive indices and correcting for a bias in partitioning size-segregated emissions, both SW cooling and longwave (LW) warming of dust simulated by E3SMv1 are increased and agree better with other recent studies. The estimated net dust DRE of -0.42 Wm<sup>-2</sup> represents a stronger cooling effect than the observationally based estimate -0.2 Wm<sup>-2</sup> (-0.48 to +0.2), due to a smaller LW warming. Constrained by a global mean DAOD, model sensitivity studies of increasing horizontal and vertical resolution show strong influences on the simulated global dust burden and lifetime primarily through the change of dust dry deposition rate; there are also remarkable differences in simulated spatial distributions of DAOD, DRE, and deposition fluxes. Thus, constraining the global DAOD is insufficient for accurate representation of dust climate effects, especially in transitioning to higher- or variable-resolution ESMs. Better observational constraints of dust vertical profiles, dry deposition, size, and LW properties are needed.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Typological representation of the offshore oceanographic environment along the Alaskan North Slope","Eymold, William K.; Flanary, Christopher; Erikson, Li; Nederhoff, Kees; Chartrand, Christopher C.; Jones, Craig; Kasper, Jeremy; Bull, Diana L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Erosion and flooding impacts to Arctic coastal environments are intensifying with nearshore oceanographic conditions acting as a key environmental driver. Robust and comprehensive assessment of the nearshore oceanographic conditions require knowledge of the following boundary conditions: incident wave energy, water level, incident wind energy, ocean temperature and salinity, bathymetry, and shoreline orientation. The number of offshore oceanographic boundary conditions can be large, requiring a significant computational investment to reproduce nearshore conditions. This present study develops location-independent typologies to reduce the number of boundary conditions needed to assess nearshore oceanographic environments in both a Historical (2007–2019) and Future (2020–2040) timespan along the Alaskan North Slope. We used WAVEWATCH III® and Delft3D Flexible Mesh model output from six oceanographic sites located along a constant ~50 m bathymetric line spanning the Chukchi to Beaufort Seas. K-means clustering was applied to the energy-weighted joint-probability distribution of significant wave height (H<sub>s</sub>) and peak period (T<sub>p</sub>). Distributions of wave and wind direction, wind speed, and water level associated with location-independent centroids were assigned single values to describe a reduced order, typological rendition of offshore oceanographic conditions. Reanalysis data (e.g., ASRv2, ERA5, and GOFS) grounded the historical simulations while projected conditions were obtained from downscaled GFDL-CM3 forced under RCP8.5 conditions. Location-dependence for each site is established through the occurrence joint-probability distribution in the form of unique scaling factors representing the fraction of time that the typology would occupy over a representative year. As anticipated, these typologies show increasingly energetic ocean conditions in the future. They also enable computationally efficient simulation of the nearshore oceanographic environment along the North Slope of Alaska for better characterization of coastal processes (e.g., erosion, flooding, or sediment transport).","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Sediment cores, porewaters, and biota were sampled from four sites along the Fourmile Branch (SC, USA) and measured for total Hg (THg) and methyl-Hg (MHg) concentrations. Water quality parameters were also measured at the sediment–water interface (SWI) to model the Hg speciation. In general, Hg concentrations in porewaters and bulk sediment were relatively high, and most of the sediment Hg was in the solid phase as non-labile species. Surface sediment presented higher Hg concentrations than the medium and bottom layers. Mercury methylation and MHg production in the sediment was primarily influenced by sulfate levels, since positive correlations were observed between sulfate and Hg in the porewaters. The majority of Hg species at the SWI were in non-labile form, and the dominant labile Hg species was complexed with dissolved organic carbon. MHg concentrations in the aquatic food web biomagnified with trophic levels (biofilm, invertebrates, and fish), increasing by 3.31 times per trophic level.

During those steps the mean global surface air temperature trend remained almost constant, while the Arctic trend increased. Although the “best” CMIP6 models reproduce the increasing trend of the AA in 1980s they do not capture the sharply increasing trend of the AA after 1999 including its rapid step-like increase.

"Impacts of active satellite sensors' low-level cloud detection limitations on cloud radiative forcing in the Arctic","Liu, Yinghui","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Previous studies revealed that satellites sensors with the best detection capability identify 25 %–40 % and 0 %–25 % fewer clouds below 0.5 and between 0.5–1.0 km, respectively, over the Arctic. Quantifying the impacts of cloud detection limitations on the radiation flux are critical especially over the Arctic Ocean considering the dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice. In this study, the proxies of the space-based radar, CloudSat, and lidar, CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations), cloud masks are derived based on simulated radar reflectivity with QuickBeam and cloud optical thickness using retrieved cloud properties from surface-based radar and lidar during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment. Limitations in low-level cloud detection by the space-based active sensors, and the impact of these limitations on the radiation fluxes at the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA), are estimated with radiative transfer model Streamer. The results show that the combined CloudSat and CALIPSO product generally detects all clouds above 1 km, while detecting 25 % (9 %) fewer in absolute values below 600 m (600 m to 1 km) than surface observations. These detection limitations lead to uncertainties in the monthly mean cloud radiative forcing (CRF), with maximum absolute monthly mean values of 2.5 and 3.4 Wm<sup>–2</sup> at the surface and TOA, respectively. Cloud information from only CALIPSO or CloudSat lead to larger cloud detection differences compared to the surface observations and larger CRF uncertainties with absolute monthly means larger than 10.0 Wm<sup>–2</sup> at the surface and TOA. The uncertainties for individual cases are larger – up to 30 Wm<sup>–2</sup>. These uncertainties need to be considered when radiation flux products from CloudSat and CALIPSO are used in climate and weather studies.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Pockets of open cells (POCs) have been shown to develop within closed-cell stratocumulus (StCu), and a large body of evidence suggests that the development of POCs result from changes in small-scale processes internal to the boundary layer rather than large-scale forcings. Precipitation is widely viewed as a key process important to POC development and maintenance. In this study, GOES-16 satellite observations are used in conjunction with MERRA-2 winds to track and compare the microphysical and environmental evolution of two populations of closed-cell StCu selected by visual inspection over the southeastern Pacific Ocean: one group that transitions to POCs and another comparison group (CLOSED) that does not. The high spatiotemporal resolution of the new GOES-16 data allows for a detailed examination of the temporal evolution of POCs in this region. We find that POCs tend to develop near the coast, last tens of hours, are larger than 104 km2, and often (88 % of cases) do not re-close before they exit the StCu deck. Most POCs are observed to form at night and tend to exit the StCu during the day when the StCu is contracting in area. Relative to the CLOSED trajectories, POCs have systematically larger effective radii, lower cloud drop number concentrations, a comparable conditional in-cloud liquid water path, and a higher frequency of more intense precipitation. Meanwhile, no systematic environmental differences other than boundary layer height are observed between POC and CLOSED trajectories. Interestingly, there are no differences in reanalysis aerosol optical depth between both sets of trajectories, which may lead one to the interpretation that differences in aerosol concentrations are not influencing POC development or resulting in a large number that re-close. However, this largely depends on the reanalysis treatment of aerosol–cloud interactions, and the product used in this study has no explicit handling of these important processes. These results support the consensus view regarding the importance of precipitation on the formation and maintenance of POCs and demonstrate the utility of modern geostationary remote sensing data in evaluating the POC life cycle.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The Unexpected Oceanic Peak in Energy Input to the Atmosphere and Its Consequences for Monsoon Rainfall","Ramesh, Nandini; Boos, William R.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; monsoons; atmospheric dynamics; tropical climate; cloud radiative effects; land-sea contrast","Monsoons have historically been understood to be caused by the low thermal inertia of land, allowing more energy from summer insolation to be transferred to the overlying atmosphere than over adjacent ocean. Here, we show that during boreal summer, the global maximum net energy input (NEI) to the atmosphere unexpectedly lies over the Indian Ocean, not over land. Observed radiative fluxes suggest that cloud-radiative effects (CRE) almost double the NEI over ocean, shifting the NEI peak from land to ocean. Global climate model experiments with both land and interactive sea surface temperatures confirm that CRE create the oceanic NEI maximum. Interactions between CRE, NEI, circulation, and land-sea contrast in surface heat capacity shift precipitation from Southeast to South Asia. CRE thus alter the global partitioning of precipitation between land and ocean and the spatial structure of Earth's strongest monsoon, in ways that can be understood through the NEI.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Joint estimation of biogeochemical model parameters from multiple experiments: A bayesian approach applied to mercury methylation","Rathore, Saubhagya S.; Schwartz, Grace E.; Brooks, Scott C.; Painter, Scott L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; Bayesian inference; parameter uncertainty; mercury methylation","Here, to characterize complex biogeochemical systems, results from multiple experiments, where each targets a specific subprocess, are commonly combined. The resulting datasets are interpreted through the calibration of biogeochemical models for process inference and predictions. Commonly used calibration approaches of fitting datasets from individual experiments to subprocess models one at a time is prone to missing information shared between datasets and incomplete uncertainty propagation. We propose a Bayesian joint-fitting scheme addressing the above-mentioned concerns by jointly fitting all the available datasets, thus calibrating the entire biogeochemical model in one go using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The identification of null spaces in the parameter distributions from MCMC guided the simplification of certain subprocess models.

(ORCID:0000000340144896)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The chemical composition of ambient organic aerosols plays a critical role in driving their climate and health-relevant properties and holds important clues to the sources and formation mechanisms of secondary aerosol material. In most ambient atmospheric environments, this composition remains incompletely characterized, with the number of identifiable species consistently outnumbered by those that have no mass spectral matches in the literature or the National Institute of Standards and Technology/National Institutes of Health/Environmental Protection Agency (NIST/NIH/EPA) mass spectral databases, making them nearly impossible to definitively identify. This creates significant challenges in utilizing the full analytical capabilities of techniques which separate and generate spectra for complex environmental samples. In this work, we develop the use of machine learning techniques to quantify and characterize novel, or unidentifiable, organic material. This work introduces Ch3MS-RF (Chemical Characterization by Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Random Forest Modeling), an open-source, R-based software tool, for efficient machine-learning-enabled characterization of compounds separated in chromatography–mass spectrometry applications but not identifiable by comparison to mass spectral databases. A random forest model is trained and tested on a known 130 component representative external standard to predict the response factors of novel environmental organics based on position in volatility–polarity space and mass spectrum, enabling the reproducible, efficient, and optimized quantification of novel environmental species. Quantification accuracy on a reserved 20 % test set randomly split from the external standard compound list indicates that random forest modeling significantly outperforms the commonly used methods in both precision and accuracy, with a median response factor percent error of -2 %, for modeled response factors, compared to > 15 %, for typically used proxy assignment-based methods. Chemical properties modeling, evaluated on the same reserved 20 % test set and an extrapolation set of species identified in ambient organic aerosol samples collected in the Amazon rainforest, also demonstrate robust performance. Extrapolation set property prediction mean absolute errors for carbon number, oxygen to carbon ratio (O : C), average carbon oxidation state (<SPAN STYLE=""text-decoration:overline"">OS</SPAN><sub>c</sub>), and vapor pressure are 1.8, 0.15, 0.25, and 1.0 (log(atm)), respectively. Extrapolation set out-of-sample R2 for all properties modeled are above 0.75, with the exception of vapor pressure. While predictive performance for vapor pressure is less robust compared to the other chemical properties modeled, random-forest-based modeling was significantly more accurate than other commonly used methods of vapor pressure prediction, decreasing the mean vapor pressure prediction error to 0.24 (log(atm)) from 0.55 (log(atm)) (chromatography-based vapor pressure prediction) and 1.2 (log(atm)) (chemical formula-based vapor pressure prediction). The random forest model significantly advances an untargeted analysis of the full scope of chemical speciation yielded by two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-MS) techniques and can be applied to gas chromatography coupled with electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as well. It enables the accurate estimation of key chemical properties commonly utilized in the atmospheric chemistry community, which may be used to more efficiently identify important tracers for further individual analysis and to characterize compound populations uniquely formed under specific ambient conditions.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"The impact of <scp>forest–controlled</scp> snow variability on <scp>late–season</scp> streamflow varies by climatic region and forest structure","Currier, William Ryan; Sun, Ning; Wigmosta, Mark; Cristea, Nicoleta; Lundquist, Jessica D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; forest-snow dynamics; forest edges; late-season flow; snow water equivalent; tiled model; DHSVM; subgrid canopy structure; summer low streamflow; radiation; silviculture","Previous studies have documented how forests influence snow at fine spatial scales, but none have documented the influence that existing forest-snow variability has on streamflow. Here to test how much forest-controlled snow variability influences streamflow, a tiling parameterization based on classifications from high-resolution (1–3 m) vegetation maps was incorporated into the Distributed Hydrology and Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Within each grid cell (90–150 m), the tiling parameterization simulated forest-snow variability with four independently evolving snowpacks. Each tile had unique radiation conditions to represent conditions underneath the canopy, in exposed areas, and along north- and south-facing forest edges. This tiled parameterization was used to test where and when detailed forest-snow modelling should be considered further and where and when the impacts are too small to be worth the effort. To test this, tiled model simulations of streamflow were compared to non-tiled model simulations in the Sierra Nevada, CA, the Jemez Mountains, NM, and the Eastern Cascades, WA. In Tuolumne, CA, the tiled model simulated little difference in grid cell average SWE, and late-season streamflow decreased by only 3%–4% compared to the non-tiled model. In Jemez, NM, the tiled model decreased late-season streamflow by 18% due to increased sublimation. In Chiwawa, WA, the tiled model increased late-season streamflow by 15% due to high shortwave radiation attenuation and less longwave radiation enhancement from the forest. Furthermore, within the Chiwawa, a substantial silvicultural practice was synthetically implemented to increase the north-facing edge's fractional area. This silvicultural experiment, which used the same fractional forest area in all simulations increased late-season streamflow by 35% compared to tiled model simulations that did not represent forest edges. In conclusion, representing forest-SWE variability had an effect on late-season streamflow in some watersheds but not in others based on the fractional area of the forest edges, forest characteristics, and climate conditions.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The annual C4 crop corn and perennial C4 crop miscanthus differ in phenology, canopy structure and leaf physiology. Investigating the SIF-GPP relationships in these species could deepen our understanding of SIF-GPP relationships within C4 crops. Using in situ canopy SIF and GPP measurements for both species along with leaf-level measurements, we found considerable differences in the SIF-GPP relationships between corn and miscanthus, with a stronger SIF-GPP relationship and higher slope of SIF-GPP observed in corn compared to miscanthus. These differences were mainly caused by leaf physiology. For miscanthus, high non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under high light, temperature and water vapor deficit (VPD) conditions caused a large decline of fluorescence yield (Φ<sub>F</sub>), which further led to a SIF midday depression and weakened the SIF-GPP relationship. The larger slope in corn than miscanthus was mainly due to its higher GPP in mid-summer, largely attributed to the higher leaf photosynthesis and less NPQ. Furthermore, our results demonstrated variation of the SIF-GPP relationship within C4 crops and highlighted the importance of leaf physiology in determining canopy SIF behaviors and SIF-GPP relationships.","Elsevier","","Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-06-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Agricultural and Forest Meteorology; Journal Volume: 323","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 109046","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 0168-1923","10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109046","","2022-08-30T00:00:00Z","1875077","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1875077","","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","323"

This study examined the regional-scale microbial community of the Death Valley Regional Flow System and evaluated whether subsurface communities can be used to identify groundwater-flow paths between recharge and discharge areas. Samples were collected from 36 sites in three groundwater basins: Pahute Mesa–Oasis Valley (PMOV), Ash Meadows (AM), and Alkali Flat–Furnace Creek Ranch (AFFCR). Microbial diversity within and between communities varied by location, and communities were separated into two overall groups that affiliated with the AM and PMOV/AFFCR basins. Network analysis revealed patterns between clusters of common microbes that represented groundwaters with similar geochemical conditions and largely corroborated hydraulic connections between recharge and discharge areas. Null model analyses identified deterministic and stochastic ecological processes contributing to microbial community assemblages. Most communities were more different than expected and governed by dispersal limitation, geochemical differences, or undominating processes. However, certain communities from sites located within or near the Nevada National Security Site were more similar than expected and dominated by homogeneous dispersal or selection. Overall, the (dis)similarities between the microbial communities of DVRFS recharge and discharge areas supported previously documented hydraulic connections between: (1) Spring Mountains and Ash Meadows; (2) Frenchman and Yucca Flat and Amargosa Desert; and (3) Amargosa Desert and Death Valley. However, only a portion of the flow path between Pahute Mesa and Oasis Valley could be supported by microbial community analyses, likely due to well-associated artifacts in samples from the two Oasis Valley sites. This study demonstrates the utility of combining microbial data with hydrologic, geologic, and water-chemistry information to comprehensively characterize groundwater systems, highlighting both strengths and limitations of this approach.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This region is unique among the places frequently affected by sea breeze due to it being a continental location with relatively flat topography. The thermal gradient between land and water environments is a factor in introducing the sea breeze, but its role in the inland extent of sea breeze propagation isn’t as well known. We investigate the role of the thermal gradient in previously catalogued sea breeze events observed at the Savannah River Site (SRS) by taking differences of temperature measurements at inland and coastal weather stations for the days that the events occurred. We saw that the temperature differences for those days were much higher than in the non-sea breeze days during the mornings and afternoon. Numerical models were also used to conduct a sensitivity study on a sea breeze case, using simple modifications of the temperature gradient. We found that while the modifications did not stop the generation of a sea breeze circulation, the extent of the inland propagation was dependent on the magnitude of the thermal gradient.</p>","MDPI AG","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

Within catchments, persistent chemicals linked to negative health outcomes such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have great potential to be transported, through adsorption or biological uptake, with downstream locations acting as sinks for accumulation. Here we present long-term trends in PCB bioaccumulation in fish found in lower-order tributaries on the Oak Ridge Reservation, an impacted US Department of Energy property in East Tennessee, USA, and a large reservoir system adjacent to it composed of parts of the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers. Given that the reservoir system has experienced no direct PCB mitigation activities, this record offers an opportunity to explore potential natural attenuation of PCBs within a large lotic ecosystem. Additionally, attenuation rates ranged from 0% to 8% yr<sup>-1</sup> in minnows and sunfish at stream sites and 5.4–11.3% yr<sup>-1</sup> in catfish at reservoir sites. These rates are comparable to findings from similar studies in other regions, suggesting a consistency in responses since the banning of PCB production in 1979. Further, results suggest that PCB sources from discharge outfalls are important locally but are not primarily responsible for sustaining PCB contamination in downstream reservoirs.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The Role of Groundwater Withdrawals on River Regulation: Example From the Columbia River Basin","Eldardiry, Hisham; Zhou, Tian; Huang, Maoyi; Chegwidden, Oriana S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Columbia River; reservoir operation; VIC; groundwater; irrigation; water management","The Columbia River Basin (CRB) is heavily regulated by more than 250 dams on its river system while depending significantly on groundwater withdrawals in certain sub-basins. Neglecting groundwater withdrawals in hydrologic models of the basin could result in inaccurate predictions of its water budget and thus mislead water management decisions in the basin. This work aims to understand the impacts of groundwater pumping on the spatiotemporal patterns of modeling regulated streamflow in the CRB using a modified version of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model integrated with a water management component that accounts for groundwater withdrawals, irrigation demands, and reservoir operation (VIC-GIRR). The VIC-GIRR simulations showed that considering additional groundwater withdrawals would alleviate the stress of irrigation water deficit in the Snake River Basin with an average reduction of 10 km<sup>3</sup>/year. Such a reduction in water deficit resulted in slight streamflow increase over the CRB with maximum increase up to 40% during dry period in certain locations. We also note that the implementation of groundwater withdrawal does not, however, improve the overall model performance in long-term averaged streamflow and storage predictions. Our results highlight the efforts needed to examine additional important processes in representing the interactions between water withdrawals and reservoir operations. Such efforts will aid in better simulation of multi-reservoir system and improve effectiveness for agricultural productivity, power generation, flood control, and navigation purposes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These severe consequences induce feedbacks that contribute to amplified warming, affecting weather and climate globally. Aerosols and clouds play a critical role in regulating radiation reaching the Arctic surface. However, the magnitude of their effects is not adequately quantified, especially in the central Arctic where they impact the energy balance over the sea ice. Specifically, aerosols called ice nucleating particles (INPs) remain understudied yet are necessary for cloud ice production and subsequent changes in cloud lifetime, radiative effects, and precipitation. Here, we report observations of INPs in the central Arctic over a full year, spanning the entire sea ice growth and decline cycle. Further, these observations are size-resolved, affording valuable information on INP sources. Our results reveal a strong seasonality of INPs, with lower concentrations in the winter and spring controlled by transport from lower latitudes, to enhanced concentrations of INPs during the summer melt, likely from marine biological production in local open waters. This comprehensive characterization of INPs will ultimately help inform cloud parameterizations in models of all scales.","Nature Publishing Group","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Transition of Large-Scale Environmental Conditions and Characteristics of Four Rainfall Types Observed by S-PolKa During the MJO-1 Active Phase of DYNAMO/CINDY/AMIE","Thayer, Jeffrey D.; Hence, Deanna A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Analyses of National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) S-PolKa dual-polarization radar data and ERA5 reanalysis fields indicate gradual changes in convection characteristics and large-scale environmental conditions during a central Indian Ocean Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) event observed by the DYNAMO/CINDY/AMIE field campaigns in late October 2011 (MJO-1). Examination of four rainfall types (isolated convective cores, convective, mixed, and stratiform) reveals a transition of convection characteristics (i.e., areal coverage and depth) between distinct 5-day environmental periods at the beginning and end of this ~2-week MJO active phase. A shift toward less frequent rainfall covering less of the radar domain for all four rainfall types occurs when large-scale lower-tropospheric dry air advects into the region with the westerly wind burst (WWB). Drier and warmer lower-free-tropospheric conditions associated with the WWB contribute to increased large-scale surface-based convective inhibition (CIN), surface-based convective available potential energy (CAPE), and cloud base heights. A thermodynamic budget analysis indicates reduced surface heat fluxes contribute to the increased surface-based CAPE. Greater CAPE at the end of MJO-1 coincides with deeper 50-dBZ convective echoes, while decreased 10-dBZ depth for all rainfall types corresponds in time with WWB-related dry-air advection. Increased (decreased) reflectivity values in the lower-level vertical reflectivity distribution of convective (stratiform) precipitation indicate increased (decreased) convective (stratiform) intensities when the WWB is present.

Although changes to microbial metabolism and community structure are documented following thaw, the generality of post-thaw assembly patterns across permafrost soils of the world remains uncertain, limiting our ability to predict biogeochemistry and microbial community responses to climate change. Based on our review of the Arctic microbiome, permafrost microbiology, and community ecology, we propose that Assembly Theory provides a framework to better understand thaw-mediated microbiome changes and the implications for community function and climate feedbacks. This framework posits that the prevalence of deterministic or stochastic processes indicates whether the community is well-suited to thrive in changing environmental conditions. We predict that on a short timescale and following high-disturbance thaw (e.g., thermokarst), stochasticity dominates post-thaw microbiome assembly, suggesting that functional predictions will be aided by detailed information about the microbiome. At a longer timescale and lower-intensity disturbance (e.g., active layer deepening), deterministic processes likely dominate, making environmental parameters sufficient for predicting function. We propose that the contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes to post-thaw microbiome assembly depends on the characteristics of the thaw disturbance, as well as characteristics of the microbial community, such as the ecological and phylogenetic breadth of functional guilds, their functional redundancy, and biotic interactions. These propagate across space and time, potentially providing a means for predicting the microbial forcing of greenhouse gas feedbacks to global climate change.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We formulate the heat-transport problem as a state-space model (SSM), in which the spatial derivatives in the convection/conduction equation are approximated using finite differences. The SSM is calibrated to estimate time-varying specific discharge using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Extended Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother (ERTSS). Whereas the EKF is suited to real-time (“online”) applications and uses only past and current measurements for estimation (filtering), the ERTSS is intended for offline applications and uses all available data for batch estimation (smoothing). The two algorithms are demonstrated with synthetic and field-experimental data and shown to be efficient and rapid for estimation of time-varying flux over seasonal periods; further, the recursive approaches are effective in the presence of rapidly changing flux and (or) non-periodic thermal boundary conditions, both of which are problematic for existing approaches to heat tracing of time varying groundwater/surface-water exchange.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Using the Black Carbon Particle Mixing State to Characterize the Lifecycle of Biomass Burn Aerosols","Sedlacek III, Arthur J. (ORCID:0000000195953653)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The lifecycle of black carbon (BC)-containing particles from biomass burns is examined using aircraft and surface observations of BC mixing state for plume ages from ~15 minutes to 10 days. Because BC is non-volatile and chemically inert, changes in the mixing state of BC-containing particles are driven solely by changes in particle coating, which is mainly secondary organic aerosol (SOA). The coating mass initially increases rapidly (k = 0.84 hr-1), then remains growth relatively constant for 1 to 2 days as plume dilution no longer supports further growth, then decreases slowly until only ~30 % of the maximum coating mass remains after 10 days, (kloss = 0.011 hr-1). The mass ratio of coating-to-core for a BC-containing particle with a 100 nm mass- equivalent diameter BC core reaches a maximum of ~20 after a few hours and drops to ~5 after 10 days of aging. The initial increase in coating mass can be used to determine SOA formation rates. The slow loss of coating material, not captured in global models, comprises the dominant fraction of the lifecycle of these particles. Coating-to-core mass ratios of BC particles in the stratosphere are much greater than those in the free troposphere indicating a different lifecycle.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Airborne flux measurements of ammonia over the Southern Great Plains using chemical ionization mass spectrometry","Schobesberger, Siegfried; D'Ambro, Emma L.; Vettikkat, Lejish; Lee, Ben H.; Peng, Qiaoyun; Bell, David M.; Shilling, John E.; Shrivastava, Manish; Pekour, Mikhail; Fast, Jerome; Thornton, Joel A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is an abundant trace gas in the atmosphere and an important player in atmospheric chemistry, aerosol formation and the atmosphere-surface exchange of nitrogen. It is recognized as a major source of aerosol pollution, and it may limit the formation of cloud nuclei in remote or cold parts of the atmosphere. For soil and plants, NH<sub>3</sub>-mediated nitrogen can act as a harmful pollutant or as a desirable nutrient, mostly in natural and agricultural settings, respectively. Agriculture is also the main source of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub> via volatilization from fertilizers and manure processing in livestock farming. The accurate determination of NH<sub>3</sub> emission rates remains a challenge, partly due to the propensity of NH<sub>3</sub> to interact with instrument surfaces leading to high detection limits and slow response times. In this paper, we present a new method for quantifying ambient NH<sub>3</sub>, using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) with deuterated benzene cations as reagents. The setup aimed at limiting sample-surface interactions and achieved a 1-σ precision of 10–20 pptv and an immediate 1/e response rate < 0.4 s, which compares favorably to the existing state of the art. The sensitivity exhibited an inverse humidity dependence, in particular in relatively dry conditions. Background of up to 10 % of the total signal required consideration as well, as it responded on the order of a few minutes. To showcase the method’s capabilities, we quantified NH3 mixing ratios from measurements obtained during deployment on a Gulfstream I aircraft during the HI-SCALE (Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystems) field campaign in rural Oklahoma during May 2016. Typical mixing ratios were 1–10 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) for the boundary layer and 0.1–1 ppbv in the lower free troposphere. Sharp plumes of up to 10s of ppbv of NH3 were encountered as well. We identified two of their sources as a large fertilizer plant and a cattle farm, and our mixing ratio measurements yielded upper bounds of 350 ± 50 and 0.6 kg NH<sub>3</sub> h<sup>–1</sup> for their respective momentary source rates. The fast response of the CIMS also allowed us to derive vertical NH<sub>3</sub> fluxes within the turbulent boundary layer via eddy covariance, for which we chiefly used the continuous wavelet transform technique. As expected for a region dominated by agriculture, we observed predominantly upward fluxes, implying net NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from surface. The corresponding analysis focused on the most suitable flight, which contained two straight-and-level legs at ~300 m above ground. We derived NH<sub>3</sub> fluxes between –4 and 18 mol km<sup>–2</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> for these legs, at an effective spatial resolution of 1–2 km. The analysis demonstrated how flux measurements benefit from suitably arranged flight tracks with sufficiently long straight-and-level legs, and explores the detrimental effect of measurement discontinuities. Following flux footprint estimations, comparison to the NH<sub>3</sub> area emissions inventory provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency indicated overall agreement, but also the absence of some sources, for instance the identified cattle farm. Our study concludes that high-precision CIMS measurements are a powerful tool for in-situ measurements of ambient NH<sub>3</sub> mixing ratios, and even allow for the airborne mapping of the air-surface exchange of NH<sub>3</sub>.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we studied the fidelity of model simulations in reproducing the observed summer AMV and the associated impacts on the mid-latitude climate by analysing simulations using the National Centre for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1), including CESM1 North Atlantic idealized and pacemaker simulations, CESM1 large ensemble twentieth century uninitialized simulations and large ensemble initialized CESM1 decadal predictions. To further compare the fidelity of CESM1, we also analysed large ensemble simulations from three other models. Our results suggest that the uninitialized large ensemble simulations from all models can produce an AMV time evolution and its regional climate impacts similar to the observations to certain degree. By initializing the observed oceanic condition in decadal prediction simulations, the simulated AMV and its regional impacts are closer to the observed ones than those in uninitialized ensemble simulations. In addition, the pacemaker simulations that nudged the time-evolving observed North Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies produce spatiotemporal characteristics of the AMV and AMV climate impacts closer to the observed ones than the uninitialized simulations. We conclude that although coupled models can produce AMV and its regional impacts similar to observed, proper initialization and bias correction of the sea surface temperature spatial and temporal structure can improve this capability.","Springer-Verlag","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-06-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Climate Dynamics; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 3-4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1043-1060","","","SC0022070; AC02-05CH11231; 41875104; 41991284; XDA20100304; 2019QZKK0101; IA 1844590","Journal ID: ISSN 0930-7575","10.1007/s00382-022-06331-z","","2023-04-13T00:00:00Z","1968862","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1968862","","Climate Dynamics","3-4","60"

We computed cumulative snow water equivalent (SWE) over the sea ice based on snow depth and density retrievals from a SnowMicroPen and approximately weekly measured snow depths along fixed transect paths. We used the derived SWE from the snow cover to compare with precipitation sensors installed during MOSAiC. The data were also compared with ERA5 reanalysis snowfall rates for the drift track. We found an accumulated snow mass of 38 mm SWE between the end of October 2019 and end of April 2020. The initial SWE over first-year ice relative to second-year ice increased from 50 % to 90 % by end of the investigation period. Further, we found that the Vaisala Present Weather Detector 22, an optical precipitation sensor, and installed on a railing on the top deck of research vessel Polarstern, was least affected by blowing snow and showed good agreements with SWE retrievals along the transect. On the contrary, the OTT Pluvio<sup>2</sup> pluviometer and the OTT Parsivel<sup>2</sup> laser disdrometer were largely affected by wind and blowing snow, leading to too high measured precipitation rates. These are largely reduced when eliminating drifting snow periods in the comparison. ERA5 reveals good timing of the snowfall events and good agreement with ground measurements with an overestimation tendency. Retrieved snowfall from the ship-based K<sub>a</sub>-band ARM zenith radar shows good agreements with SWE of the snow cover and differences comparable to those of ERA5. Based on the results, we suggest the K<sub>a</sub>-band radar-derived snowfall as an upper limit and the present weather detector on RV Polarstern as a lower limit of a cumulative snowfall range. Based on these findings, we suggest a cumulative snowfall of 72 to 107 mm and a precipitation mass loss of the snow cover due to erosion and sublimation as between 47 % and 68 %, for the time period between 31 October 2019 and 26 April 2020. Extending this period beyond available snow cover measurements, we suggest a cumulative snowfall of 98–114 mm.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The Amazon and La Plata River Basins as Moisture Sources of South America: Climatology and Intraseasonal Variability","Chug, Divyansh; Dominguez, Francina; Yang, Zhao","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Land-atmosphere interactions through moisture pathways are critical for precipitation over South America where terrestrial moisture constitutes a significant fraction of rainfall, specifically over the ecologically and socio-economically vital Amazon (AMZ) and La Plata (LPB) river basins. While previous work has quantified the seasonal importance of terrestrial moisture sources for precipitation (PPT), there is a dearth of knowledge on how the transport and recycling of evapotranspired moisture (ET) is modulated at intra-seasonal time scale. We employ numerical tracers embedded in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and track the moisture originating from the AMZ and LPB basins to study its interaction with the intra-seasonal hydroclimate variability. First, we present high resolution simulated maps of annual and seasonal recycling ratio for South American PPT and isolate the role of AMZ and LPB ET in the regional atmospheric water budget. Our findings indicate that AMZ tracers contribute more than 40% of rainfall over the eastern foothills of Andes and LPB tracers account for greater than 30% over northern Argentina. We then analyze the patterns of terrestrial moisture transport and precipitation recycling during both phases of the well identified ""see-saw"" pattern over South America. Results show a clear intra-seasonal ""sloshing"" of terrestrial moisture between the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) and the southeastern South America (SESA) regions. AMZ and LPB each account for approximately 6% of SACZ PPT highlighting the predominant role of oceanic moisture. Conversely, nearly on third of PPT over SESA is of terrestrial origin, of which LPB alone accounts for 23%.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"The Influence of Dust-Smoke Mixtures on Boundary Layer Processes and Nocturnal Warming in the Sahel","Phillips, Christopher; Nair, Udaysankar; Christopher, Sundar","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Using a single column model with ground-based, aircraft, and satellite data sets we assess the combined role of smoke and dust aerosols, land degradation/aridization (LDA), and their impact on the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in influencing near-surface air temperature over the Sahel. Our study is unique because it assesses the combined role of smoke and dust aerosols on PBL evolution and near-surface air temperatures during both day and nighttime. More importantly, using a theoretical framework, we provide a careful explanation of the geophysical processes responsible for the changes in PBL and near-surface air temperature. Our results indicate that during northern hemisphere winter months, dust, and smoke over Sahel radiatively combine to impact the PBL. We show that aerosol mixtures dominated by dust modify PBL height in a manner that minimizes/maximizes surface layer cooling/warming at times when daytime maximum/nocturnal minimum temperatures occur. Furthermore, we find that increasing smoke contribution to total column aerosol optical extinction counteracts nighttime warming through daytime cooling. When smoke constitutes half or more of to the total column aerosol optical extinction, the ratio of longwave to shortwave radiative forcing is less than 10%, and nighttime cooling ensues. Minimum temperature is most sensitive to changes in mid-visible aerosol optical depth (AOD) values <1 and doubling of dust AOD within this range during the 1950–1980 Sahelian LDA event is estimated to have a nocturnal warming potential of 0.6°C.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Influence of Aerosol Embedded in Shallow Cumulus Cloud Fields on the Surface Solar Irradiance","Gristey, Jake J.; Feingold, Graham; Schmidt, K. Sebastian; Chen, Hong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; surface solar irradiance; 3D radiative transfer; large eddy simulation; cloud; aerosol","Ubiquitous shallow cumulus clouds are associated with complex variability in surface solar irradiance (SSI). Aerosol embedded in the cloud field typically has a much smaller overall radiative effect, but can significantly perturb the shape of the SSI probability density function (PDF). These perturbations have important implications for several applications that utilize SSI, but are poorly quantified and are the subject of this study. Multiple cases of shallow cumulus cloud fields with embedded aerosol are simulated at the Southern Great Plains Atmospheric Observatory using large eddy simulation (LES). The LES-derived cloud and aerosol fields are then ingested into Monte Carlo three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer to simulate SSI. We find a variety of perturbations to the SSI PDF that depend on aerosol presence and optical properties. The processes leading to these perturbations include extinction of the direct beam that often increases from the clear-sky region toward cloud edge due to aerosol hygroscopic growth, and scattering of radiation by aerosol into cloud shadows. The ability to predict the SSI PDF in the presence of aerosol is assessed by adding three representative aerosol optical properties into an existing machine learning framework. We show that machine learning accurately predicts the SSI PDF across a wide range of conditions with negligible computational expense. Importance metrics reveal the relatively high influence of aerosol optical properties in making the predictions. These new findings highlight the important role that aerosol plays in SSI variability for highly 3D cloud-aerosol environments and provides a computationally efficient route forward for its simulation.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Limitations in modeling precipitation underscore the need for diagnostics and metrics to evaluate precipitation in simulations and predictions. While routine use of basic metrics is important for documenting model skill, more sophisticated diagnostics and metrics aimed at connecting model biases to their sources and revealing precipitation characteristics relevant to how model precipitation is used are critical for improving models and their uses. This paper illustrates examples of exploratory diagnostics and metrics including 1) spatiotemporal characteristics metrics such as diurnal variability, probability of extremes, duration of dry spells, spectral characteristics, and spatiotemporal coherence of precipitation; 2) process-oriented metrics based on the rainfall–moisture coupling and temperature–water vapor environments of precipitation; and 3) phenomena-based metrics focusing on precipitation associated with weather phenomena including low pressure systems, mesoscale convective systems, frontal systems, and atmospheric rivers. Together, these diagnostics and metrics delineate the multifaceted and multiscale nature of precipitation, its relations with the environments, and its generation mechanisms. The metrics are applied to historical simulations from phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Models exhibit diverse skill as measured by the suite of metrics, with very few models consistently ranked as top or bottom performers compared to other models in multiple metrics. Analysis of model skill across metrics and models suggests possible relationships among subsets of metrics, motivating the need for more systematic analysis to understand model biases for informing model development.","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Molecular-level understanding of metal ion retention in clay-rich materials","Liu, Xiandong; Tournassat, Christophe; Grangeon, Sylvain; Kalinichev, Andrey G.; Takahashi, Yoshio; Marques Fernandes, Maria","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Clay minerals retain or adsorb metal ions in the Earth’s critical zone. Rocks, sediments and soils rich in clay minerals can concentrate rare earth elements (REEs) in ion adsorption-type deposits (IADs) and are similarly effective at metallic contaminant remediation. However, the molecular-scale chemical and physical mechanisms of metal ion retention remain only partly understood. Here, we describe the nature, location and energy requirements of metal retention at clay mineral surfaces. Retention originates mainly from electrostatic interactions during cation exchange at low pH and chemical bonding in surface complexation and precipitation at neutral and high pH. Surface complexation can induce surface redox reactions and precipitation mechanisms including neoformation of clay mineral layered structures. In IADs, outer-sphere adsorption is the major retention mechanism of REE ions. By contrast, the use of clay minerals in pollution control relies on various mechanisms that can coexist, including cation exchange, surface complexation and nucleation growth. To more effectively leverage clay mineral–metal interactions in resource recovery and contaminant remediation, complex mechanisms such as surface precipitation and redox reactions must be better understood; for instance, by utilizing advances in quantum mechanical calculations, close combination between synchrotron and simulation techniques, and upscaling of molecular-level information in macroscopic thermokinetic predictive models.","Springer Nature","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

When loaded onto mesoporous oxide supports, the polymer becomes particularly attractive for direct air capture (DAC) applications given the high surface area of the composites, the low volatility of the polymer, and the excellent cyclability of the system. As polymer segmental mobility is coupled with CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and diffusion, understanding how that mobility is influenced by nanoconfinement will ultimately be critical to the development of more efficient DAC systems. Here, we discuss our development of a fluorescent probe molecule based on tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylene. As the fluorescence intensity of this molecule and the shape of the emission spectra are strongly dependent on the viscosity of the supporting medium, doping PEI-composites with this fluorescent probe can provide sensitive indication of polymer glass transition and/or melting temperatures across a wide range of temperatures (-100 to +100 °C). Herein, we demonstrate how this molecule can be used as a ratiometric probe to study bulk PEI dynamics and confinement effects in mesoporous silica as influenced by pore functionality, polymer fill fraction, and polymer architecture.","American Chemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Tropopause Characteristics Based on Long-Term ARM Radiosonde Data: A Fine-Scale Comparison at the Extratropical SGP Site and Arctic NSA Site","Zhang, Jinqiang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; tropopause inversion layer; stability transition layer; tropopause sharpness; tropopause height; climate features","The variations in the characteristics of the tropopause are sensitive indicators for the climate system and climate change. By using Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) radiosonde data that were recorded at the extratropical Southern Great Plains (SGP) and Arctic North Slope of Alaska (NSA) sites over an 18-year period (January 2003 to December 2020), this study performs a fine-scale comparison of the climatological tropopause features between these two sites that are characterized by different climates. The static stability increases rapidly above the tropopause at both sites, indicating the widespread existence of a tropopause inversion layer. The structures of both the tropopause inversion layer and the stability transition layer are more obvious at NSA than at SGP, and the seasonal variation trends of the tropopause inversion layer and stability transition layer are distinctly different between the two sites. A fitting method was used to derive the fitted tropopause height and tropopause sharpness (λ). Although this fitting method may determine a secondary tropopause rather than the primary tropopause when multiple tropopause heights are identified on one radiosonde profile, the fitted tropopause heights generally agree well with the observed tropopause heights. Broad tropopause sharpness values (λ > 2 km) occur more frequently at SGP than at NSA, resulting in a greater average tropopause sharpness at SGP (1.0 km) than at NSA (0.6 km). Significant positive trends are exhibited by the tropopause heights over the two sites, with rates of increase of 23.7 ± 6.5 m yr<sup>⁻1</sup> at SGP and 28.0 ± 4.0 m yr<sup>⁻1</sup> at NSA during the study period.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

A comprehensive evaluation of its accuracy and precision will be helpful for product users in climate studies and atmospheric models. In this study, the VIIRS LST is validated with ground observations from multiple high-quality radiation networks, including six stations from the Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) network, two stations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), and 13 stations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) network, to evaluate its performance over various land-cover types. The VNP21A1 LST was validated against the same ground observations as a reference. The results yield a close agreement between the SNPP VIIRS LST and ground LSTs with a bias of -0.4 K and a RMSE of 1.96 K over six SURFRAD sites; a bias of -0.2 K and a RMSE of 1.93 K over two BSRN sites; and a bias of -0.1 K and a RMSE of 1.7 K over the 13 ARM sites. The time series of the LST errors over individual sites indicate seasonal cycles. The data anomaly over the BSRN site in Cabauw and the SURFRAD site in Desert Rock is revealed and discussed in this study. In addition, a method using Landsat-8 data is applied to quantify the heterogeneity level of each ground station and the results provide promising insights.

Here, we examined the effects of warming, altered precipitation and annual biomass removal on grassland soil bacterial, fungal and protistan communities over 7 years to determine how these representative climate changes impact microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We show that experimental warming and the concomitant reductions in soil moisture play a predominant role in shaping microbial biodiversity by decreasing the richness of bacteria (9.6%), fungi (14.5%) and protists (7.5%). Our results also show positive associations between microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functional processes, such as gross primary productivity and microbial biomass.

"Resolving glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in response to modern and future ice loss at marine grounding lines in West Antarctica","Wan, Jeannette Xiu Wen; Gomez, Natalya; Latychev, Konstantin; Han, Holly Kyeore","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Accurate glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling in the cryosphere is required for interpreting satellite, geophysical and geological records and for assessing the feedbacks of Earth deformation and sea-level change on marine ice-sheet grounding lines. GIA modelling in areas of active ice loss in West Antarctica is particularly challenging because the ice is underlain by laterally varying mantle viscosities that are up to several orders of magnitude lower than the global average, leading to a faster and more localised response of the solid Earth to ongoing and future ice-sheet retreat and necessitating GIA models that incorporate 3-D viscoelastic Earth structure. Improvements to GIA models allow for computation of the viscoelastic response of the Earth to surface ice loading at sub-kilometre resolution, and ice-sheet models and observational products now provide the inputs to GIA models at comparably unprecedented detail. However, the resolution required to accurately capture GIA in models remains poorly understood, and high-resolution calculations come at heavy computational expense. We adopt a 3-D GIA model with a range of Earth structure models based on recent seismic tomography and geodetic data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the influence of grid resolution on predictions of GIA in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) in West Antarctica. Through idealised sensitivity testing down to sub-kilometre resolution with spatially isolated ice loading changes, we find that a grid resolution of ~$\frac{1}{3}$ of the radius of the load or higher is required to accurately capture the elastic response of the Earth. However, when we consider more realistic, spatially coherent ice loss scenarios based on modern observational records and future ice-sheet model projections and adopt a viscoelastic Earth, we find that predicted deformation and sea-level change along the grounding line converge to within 5 % with grid resolutions of 7.5 km or higher, and to within 2% for grid resolutions of 3.75 km and higher, even when the input ice model is on a 1 km grid. Furthermore, we show that low mantle viscosities beneath the ASE lead to viscous deformation that contributes to the instrumental record on decadal timescales and equals or dominates over elastic effects by the end of the 21st century. Our findings suggest that for the range of resolutions of 1.9–15 km that we considered, the error due to adopting a coarser grid in this region is negligible compared to the effect of neglecting viscous effects and the uncertainty in the adopted mantle viscosity structure.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Deficient precipitation sensitivity to Sahel land surface forcings among <scp>CMIP5</scp> models","Wang, Fuyao; Notaro, Michael; Yu, Yan; Mao, Jiafu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CMIP5; DGVM; land surface feedback; precipitation; Sahel","The overall performance of the simulated seasonal precipitation response to local terrestrial forcings, namely vegetation abundance and soil moisture, in the Sahel among the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5) Earth System Models (ESMs) is systematically investigated and compared with its observational counterpart using a multivariate statistical method. The observed seasonal precipitation response is evaluated against a large ensemble of observational, reanalysis, and satellite data sets to provide quantification of uncertainties. The behaviour of models with and without a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) component is also explored, along with the mechanisms responsible for terrestrial feedback on rainfall. In general, the CMIP5 models can reasonably capture the seasonal evolution of Sahel precipitation and soil moisture, albeit with wet biases during the pre-monsoon period and dry biases during the peak monsoon period. The non-DGVM ESMs simulate comparable leaf area indices (LAIs) with observations, while DGVM-enabled ESMs simulate too much year-round LAI. The variance of precipitation that is attributed to oceanic forcings in CMIP5 is comparable with observations; however, the variance of precipitation that is attributed to terrestrial forcings is smaller in CMIP5 models than observed, especially for non-DGVM ESMs. CMIP5 models, especially those without DGVMs, undervalue precipitation's observed response strength to soil moisture anomalies. In both observations and CMIP5 models, none of the atmospheric variables show significant responses to direct vegetation forcing, except for the response in transpiration. Although vegetation has minimal direct effect on the atmospheric state, it can affect the atmosphere by modifying soil moisture and transpiration rate indirectly, which helps explain the more realistic simulation of rainfall in DGVM-enabled ESMs than non-DGVM ESMs. Coupling of an ESM to a DGVM is critical in generating reasonable land–atmosphere feedback and examining future ecological and climatic changes over the Sahel.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This review highlights one of the two main approaches to DAC based on aqueous solvents. The discussion focuses on different aspects of DAC with solvents, starting with the fundamental chemistry that includes the chemical species and reactions involved and the thermodynamics and kinetics of CO<sub>2</sub> binding and release. Chemical engineering aspects are also discussed, including air–liquid contactor design, process development, and technoeconomic assessments to estimate the cost of the DAC technologies. Various solvents employed in DAC are reviewed, from aqueous alkaline solutions (NaOH, KOH) to aqueous amines, amino acids, and peptides, along with different solvent regeneration methods, from the traditional thermal swinging to the more exploratory carbonate crystallization with guanidines or electrochemical methods.","Annual Reviews","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These growth forms respond differently to contemporary variation in climate and resource availability, but their responses to future climate change are poorly understood because there are very few predictive ecosystem models representing lianas. We compile a database of liana functional traits (846 species) and use it to parameterize a mechanistic model of liana-tree competition. The substantial difference between liana and tree hydraulic conductivity represents a critical source of inter-growth form variation. Here, we show that lianas are many times more sensitive to drying atmospheric conditions than trees as a result of this trait difference. Further, we use our competition model and projections of tropical hydroclimate based on Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 to show that lianas are more susceptible to reaching a hydraulic threshold for viability by 2100.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of Notre Dame, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"New insights on the prevalence of drizzle in marine stratocumulus clouds based on a machine learning algorithm applied to radar Doppler spectra","Zhu, Zeen; Kollias, Pavlos; Luke, Edward; Yang, Fan (ORCID:0000000188666664)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The detection of the early growth of drizzle particles in marine stratocumulus clouds is important for studying the transition from cloud water to rainwater. Radar reflectivity is commonly used to detect drizzle; however, its utility is limited to larger drizzle particles. Alternatively, radar Doppler spectrum skewness has proven to be a more sensitive quantity for the detection of drizzle embryos. Here, a machine learning (ML)-based technique that uses radar reflectivity and skewness for detecting small drizzle particles is presented. Aircraft in situ measurements are used to develop and validate the ML algorithm. The drizzle detection algorithm is applied to three Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) observational campaigns to investigate the drizzle occurrence in marine boundary layer clouds. It is found that drizzle is far more ubiquitous than previously thought; the traditional radar-reflectivity-based approach significantly underestimates the drizzle occurrence, especially in thin clouds with liquid water paths lower than 50 g m<sup>-2</sup>. Furthermore, the drizzle occurrence in marine boundary layer clouds differs among the three ARM campaigns, indicating that the drizzle formation, which is controlled by the microphysical process, is regime dependent. A complete understanding of the drizzle distribution climatology in marine stratocumulus clouds calls for more observational campaigns and continuing investigations.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"FORTE Measurements of Global Optical Lightning Waveforms and Implications for Optical Lightning Detection","Peterson, Michael Jay","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; lightning; satellite; remote sensing; FORTE; optical; RF","Lightning processes generate a diverse collection of optical pulses from current traversing the lightning channels. These signals are then broadened spatially and temporally via scattering in the clouds. The resulting waveforms measured from space with instruments like the photodiode detector (PDD) on the Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) satellite have a variety of shapes. In this study, we use coincident optical and Radio-Frequency measurements to document the properties of optical PDD waveforms associated with different types of lightning, estimate delays from scattering in the clouds, and comment on how pulse shape impacts optical lightning detection. We find that the attributes of optical pulses recorded by the PDD are consistent with prior studies, but vary globally and with event amplitude. The most powerful lightning tends to be single-peaked with faster rise times (median: ~100 µs) and shorter effective widths (median: ~400 µs) than normal lightning. Particularly dim events, meanwhile, include cases of broad optical waveforms with sustained optical emission throughout the PDD record, which the pixelated FORTE Lightning Location System (LLS) instrument has difficulty detecting. We propose that this is due to the optical signal being divided between individual LLS pixels that are each, individually, not bright enough to trigger. We use PDD waveforms and Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling to demonstrate that increasing the temporal and spatial resolution of a pixelated lightning imager will make it more difficult to detect these broad/dim pulses as their energy becomes divided between additional pixels/integration frames.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Photosynthesis phenology, as defined by solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, is overestimated by vegetation indices in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere","Chen, Anping; Meng, Fandong; Mao, Jiafu; Ricciuto, Daniel; Knapp, Alan K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; phenology; start of the growing season (SOS); end of the growing season (EOS); length of the growing season (GS); solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF); phenology modelling","Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change, although the data and methods used to estimate key phenological states can influence this sensitivity. Because of its direct relation to leaf photosynthetic carbon uptake, remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can provide new insight assessing changes in vegetation phenology. In this work, we investigated the potential of using a SIF time series product named contiguous SIF (CSIF) to estimate spring, summer, and autumn phenology in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere (>30°N) and compared the results with those based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period 2001–2018. Overall, we found similar spatial patterns in phenological states. However, specific dates of key phenological events differed when using CSIF vs. MODIS NDVI data. NDVI data indicated that the growing season started earlier (by 10.1 days on average) and ended later (11.5 days on average) relative to CSIF data. This implies that actual periods for photosynthetic activity are shorter (by 21.6 days on average) than those estimated from vegetation indices more directly related to changes in canopy structure. These large differences between results from NDVI and that from CSIF suggest that vegetation indices such as NDVI seem to overestimate the period for active photosynthesis over the extratropical Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, while phenology of the early growing season is dominated by temperature for both NDVI and CSIF data, phenology of the late growing season is mainly controlled by temperature for NDVI but by precipitation for CSIF. Our findings were further confirmed by other SIF (GOME-2 SIF) and vegetation index (MODIS EVI) datasets. Phenology modes in Earth system modelling are often parameterized using leaf unfolding and senescence from either station or satellite observations. Our results imply that canopy structure-based parameterization schemes may have overestimated photosynthesis active period, and thus productivity responses. We conclude that SIF data offers a novel and unique approach for assessing phenological change - one that is more directly tied to the carbon cycle and how it is being influenced by climate change.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

But the planet’s climate is complex, and climate models are far from perfect. For example, we cannot yet predict with confidence changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the periodic variation in winds and sea temperatures in the eastern Pacific that holds enormous sway over the climate in the tropics and subtropics. Here, as an innovative technique to evaluate and improve climate models, we propose employing methods stemming from dynamical systems and manifold learning. Manifold learning is based on the idea that the observed data of a system reside on some lower-dimensional surface, or manifold, embedded in a higher-dimensional space. By characterizing the manifold, we explore the dynamics of high-dimensional and complex climate fields in a simpler but comprehensive way. We argue that this approach provides a physically sound way to evaluate climate models by quantifying dependencies among variables and their feedbacks in time and space, and to visualize the climate-system attractor—the set of states toward which the climate system tends to evolve. We then showcase such a framework in the tropical Pacific, where the ENSO reigns, in observations and two state-of-the-art climate models. Our work sets the stage for manifold learning approaches to climate modeling and climate prediction, which is a first step toward developing simpler models to simulate the evolution of the effective degrees of freedom of the climate system. These new models will be physically grounded and will exploit novel artificial-intelligence approaches.","American Physical Society","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

"Quantifying Carbon Cycle Extremes and Attributing Their Causes Under Climate and Land Use and Land Cover Change From 1850 to 2300","Sharma, Bharat; Kumar, Jitendra; Collier, Nathan; Ganguly, Auroop R.; Hoffman, Forrest M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) mole fraction affects global climate through radiative (trapping longwave radiation) and physiological effects (reduction of plant transpiration). We use the simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1-BGC) forced with Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 to investigate climate-vegetation feedbacks from 1850 to the year 2300. Human-induced land use and land cover change (LULCC), through biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes, alter the climate and modify photosynthetic activity. The changing characteristics of extreme anomalies in photosynthesis, referred to as carbon cycle extremes, increase the uncertainty of terrestrial ecosystems to act as a net carbon sink. However, the role of LULCC in altering carbon cycle extremes under business-as-usual (continuously rising) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is unknown. Here we show that LULCC magnifies the intensity, frequency, and extent of carbon cycle extremes, resulting in a net reduction in expected photosynthetic activity in the future. We found that large temporally contiguous negative carbon cycle extremes are due to a persistent decrease in soil moisture, which is triggered by declines in precipitation. With LULCC and global warming, vegetation exhibits increased vulnerability to hot and dry environmental conditions, increasing the frequency of fire events and resulting in considerable losses in photosynthetic activity. While most regions show strengthening of negative carbon cycle extremes, a few locations show a weakening effect driven by declining vegetation cover or benign climate conditions for photosynthesis. Increasing hot, dry, and fire-driven carbon cycle extremes are essential for improving carbon cycle modeling and estimation of ecosystem responses to LULCC and rising CO<sub>2</sub> mole fractions. Moreover, large aberrations in vegetation productivity represent potential and growing threats to human lives, wildlife, and food security.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Evaluating seasonal and regional distribution of snowfall in regional climate model simulations in the Arctic","von Lerber, Annakaisa; Mech, Mario; Rinke, Annette; Zhang, Damao; Lauer, Melanie; Radovan, Ana; Gorodetskaya, Irina; Crewell, Susanne","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In this study, we investigate how the regional climate model HIRHAM5 reproduces the spatial and temporal distribution of Arctic snowfall when compared to CloudSat satellite observations during the examined period of 2007–2010. For this purpose, both approaches, i.e., the assessments of the surface snowfall rate (observation-to-model) and the radar reflectivity factor profiles (model-to-observation), are carried out considering spatial and temporal sampling differences. The HIRHAM5 model, which is constrained in its synoptic representation by nudging to ERA-Interim, represents the snowfall in the Arctic region well in comparison to CloudSat products. The spatial distribution of the snowfall patterns is similar in both identifying the southeastern coast of Greenland and the North Atlantic corridor as regions gaining more than twice as much snowfall as the Arctic average, defined here for latitudes between 66 and 81°N. Excellent agreement (difference less than 1%) in the Arctic-averaged annual snowfall rate between HIRHAM5 and CloudSat is found, whereas ERA-Interim reanalysis shows an underestimation of 45% and significant deficits in the representation of the snowfall rate distribution. From the spatial analysis, it can be seen that the largest differences in the mean annual snowfall rates are an overestimation near the coastlines of Greenland and other regions with large orographic variations as well as an underestimation in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. To a large extent, the differences can be explained by clutter contamination, blind zone or higher resolution of CloudSat measurements, but clearly HIRHAM5 overestimates the orographic-driven precipitation. The underestimation of HIRHAM5 within the North Atlantic corridor south of Svalbard is likely connected to a poor description of the marine cold air outbreaks which could be identified by separating snowfall into different circulation weather type regimes. By simulating the radar reflectivity factor profiles from HIRHAM5 utilizing the Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer (PAMTRA) forward-modeling operator, the contribution of individual hydrometeor types can be assessed. Looking at a latitude band at 72–73°N, snow can be identified as the hydrometeor type dominating radar reflectivity factor values across all seasons. The largest differences between the observed and simulated reflectivity factor values are related to the contribution of cloud ice particles, which is underestimated in the model, most likely due to the small sizes of the particles. The model-to-observation approach offers a promising diagnostic when improving cloud schemes, as illustrated by comparison of different schemes available for HIRHAM5.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we worked with natural resource managers in the Snoqualmie River (Washington, USA) to develop riparian management scenarios, and used a process-based modeling system to examine how a threatened population of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytcha) may respond to climate change and whether riparian restoration could reduce climate effects. Linking models of global climate, regional hydrology and water temperature, and fish, we projected that streams would become warmer year-round and drier during summer, further stressing salmon. Climate change accelerated egg emergence, increased juvenile growth and survival, and accelerated outmigration of sub-yearling migrants. Growth was depressed for salmon remaining instream during summer (potential yearling migrants). Riparian restoration counteracted ~10% of summer increases in water temperature, and affected salmon similarly regardless of whether riparian buffers were partially or fully restored, whereas riparian degradation further warmed streams. Riparian restoration fully mitigated climate change effects on potential yearling migrant size, but only minimally affected sub-yearling migrants (assessment metrics changed <2%). Our results will be useful for watershed managers in aligning priorities for fish and humans and our framework can be applied elsewhere.","Wiley - American Water Resources Association","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Climate Leads to Reversed Latitudinal Changes in Chinese Flood Peak Timing","Yang, Yixin; Yang, Long; Chen, Xiaodong; Wang, Qiang; Tian, Fuqiang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Changes in river floods under a changing climate are of worldwide concerns, but relevant knowledge is limited especially over the East Asia monsoon region. Here we examine changes in flood peak timing based on the most comprehensive flood dataset to date across China during 1961-2017. The temporal shifts of Chinese flood peak timing range from -19.0 days earlier to +14.0 days later per decade. Earlier flood occurrences are mainly observed in northern China, with delayed flood occurrences in the south. The spatial pattern of reversed latitudinal changes in flood timing leads to growing spatial extents of concurrent river floods over China. Soil moisture plays an important role in modulating such changes, despite precipitation determines the climatological mean dates of flood occurrences. Our results highlight a strong climate signal on the changes in flood timing over China, and call for coordinated efforts in alleviating expanding flood hazards related to the changes in flood timing.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Empirical relationships between environmental factors and soil organic carbon produce comparable prediction accuracy as the Machine Learning","Mishra, Umakant; Yeo, Kyongmin; Adhikari, Kabindra; Riley, William J.; Hoffman, Forrest M.; Hudson, Corey; Gautam, Sagar","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Accurate representation of environmental controllers of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in Earth System Model (ESM) land models could reduce uncertainties in future carbon-climate feedback projections. Using empirical relationships between environmental factors and SOC stocks to evaluate land models can help modelers understand prediction biases beyond what can be achieved with the observed SOC stocks alone. In this study, we used 31 observed environmental factors, field SOC observations (n = 6,213) from the continental US, and two Machine Learning approaches [Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Additive Modeling (GAM)] to (1) select important environmental predictors of SOC stocks, (2) derive empirical relationships between environmental factors and SOC stocks, and (3) use the derived relationships to predict SOC stocks and compare the prediction accuracy of simpler model developed with the machine learning predictions. Out of the 31 environmental factors we investigated, 12 were identified as important predictors of SOC stocks by the RF approach. In contrast, the GAM approach identified six (of those 12) environmental factors as important controllers of SOC stocks: potential evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index, soil drainage condition, precipitation, elevation, and net primary productivity. The GAM approach showed minimal SOC predictive importance of the remaining six environmental factors identified by the RF approach. Our derived empirical relations produced comparable prediction accuracy as the GAM and RF approach using only a subset of environmental factors. The empirical relationships we derived using the GAM approach can serve as important benchmarks to evaluate environmental control representations of SOC stocks in ESMs, which could reduce uncertainty in predicting future carbon-climate feedbacks.","Alliance of Crop, Soil, and Environmental Science Societies","","Sandia National Lab.

Stomata play a central role in regulating the exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor between ecosystems and the atmosphere. Their function is represented in land surface models (LSMs) by conductance models. The Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) is a dynamic vegetation demography model that can simulate both detailed plant demographic and physiological dynamics. To evaluate the effect of stomatal conductance model formulation on forest water and carbon fluxes in FATES, we implemented an optimality-based stomatal conductance model – the Medlyn (MED) model – that simulates the relationship between photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (gsw) as an alternative to the FATES default Ball–Woodrow–Berry (BWB) model. To evaluate how the behavior of FATES is affected by stomatal model choice, we conducted a model sensitivity analysis to explore the response of gsw to climate forcing, including atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature, radiation, and vapor pressure deficit in the air (VPDa). We found that modeled gsw values varied greatly between the BWB and MED formulations due to the different default stomatal slope parameters (g1). After harmonizing g1 and holding the stomatal intercept parameter (g0) constant for both model formulations, we found that the divergence in modeled gsw was limited to conditions when the VPDa exceeded 1.5 kPa. We then evaluated model simulation results against measurements from a wet evergreen forest in Panama. Results showed that both the MED and BWB model formulations were able to capture the magnitude and diurnal changes of measured gsw and A but underestimated both by about 30 % when the soil was predicted to be very dry. Comparison of modeled soil water content from FATES to a reanalysis product showed that FATES captured soil drying well, but translation of drying soil to modeled physiology reduced the models' ability to match observations. Our study suggests that the parameterization of stomatal conductance models and current model response to drought are the critical areas for improving model simulation of CO2 and water fluxes in tropical forests.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this study, the Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing Data (PMFD) and the high spatial resolution and upscaled China Meteorological Forcing Data (CMFD) were used to drive the Simplified Simple Biosphere model version 4/Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics (SSiB4/TRIFFID) and investigate how meteorological forcing datasets with different spatial resolutions affect simulations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), a region with complex topography and sparse observations. By comparing the monthly Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Production (GPP) against observations, we found that SSiB4/TRIFFID driven by upscaled CMFD improved the performance in simulating the spatial distributions of LAI and GPP over the TP, reducing RMSEs by 24.3% and 20.5%, respectively. The multi-year averaged GPP decreased from 364.68 gC m<sup>–2</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup> to 241.21 gC m<sup>–2</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup> with the percentage bias dropping from 50.2% to –1.7%. When using the high spatial resolution CMFD, the RMSEs of the spatial distributions of LAI and GPP simulations were further reduced by 7.5% and 9.5%, respectively.

Brine properties are discussed in terms of atmospheric corrosion of austenitic stainless steel, using spent nuclear fuel dry storage canisters as an example. After initial loading with spent fuel, during dry storage, the canisters cool over time, leading to increased surface relative humidities and evolving brine chemistries and properties. Furthermore, these parameters affect corrosion kinetics and damage distributions, and may offer important constraints on the expected timing, rate, and long-term impacts of canister corrosion.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Fast climate responses to emission reductions in aerosol and ozone precursors in China during 2013-2017","Gao, Jiyuan; Yang, Yang; Wang, Hailong; Wang, Pinya; Li, Huimin; Li, Mengyun; Ren, Lili; Yue, Xu; Liao, Hong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","China has been implementing a sequence of policies for clean air since the year 2013, and the aerosol pollution has been substantially improved, but ozone (O<sub>3</sub>)-related issues arose. Here, fast climate responses to emission reductions in aerosol and O<sub>3</sub> precursors over China during 2013–2017 are investigated using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). The overall decreases in aerosols produced an anomalous warming of 0.09 ± 0.10°C in eastern China (22–40° N, 110–122.5° E), which is further intensified by the increase in O<sub>3</sub> in the lower troposphere, resulting in an enhanced warming of 0.16 ± 0.15° C in eastern China. Reductions in industrial emissions contributed the most to the aerosol-induced warming, while emission reductions from residential sector induced a cooling effect due to a substantial decrease in light-absorbing black carbon aerosols. This implies that switching the residential sector to cleaner energy is more effective to achieve climate and health benefits in China.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Simulation of ENSO Teleconnections to Precipitation Extremes over the United States in the High-Resolution Version of E3SM","Mahajan, Salil; Tang, Qi; Keen, Noel D.; Golaz, Jean-Christophe; van Roekel, Luke P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We evaluate the simulated teleconnection of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to winter season precipitation extremes over the United States in a long (98 years) 1950-control high resolution version (HR, 25 km nominal atmosphere model horizontal resolution) of US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1). Model bias and spatial pattern of ENSO teleconnections to mean and extreme precipitation in HR overall are similar to the low-resolution model’s (LR, 110 km) historical simulation (4-member ensemble, 1925-1959). However, over the Southeast US (SE-US), HR produces stronger El Niño associated extremes, reducing upon LR’s model bias. Both LR and HR produce weaker than observed increase in storm track activity during El Niño events there. But, HR improves the ENSO associated variability of moisture transport over SE-US. During El Niño, stronger vertical velocities in HR produce stronger large-scale precipitation causing larger latent heating of the troposphere that pulls in more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the SE-US. This positive feedback also contributes to the stronger mean and extreme precipitation response in HR. Over the Pacific Northwest, LR’s bias of stronger than observed La Niña associated extremes is amplified in HR. Both models simulate stronger than observed moisture transport from the Pacific Ocean into the region during La Niña years. The amplified HR bias there is due to stronger orographically driven vertical updrafts that create stronger large scale precipitation, despite weaker La Niña induced storm track activity.","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These hot spots are accompanied by a chain of high pressure ridges from an anomalous, circumglobal Rossby wave train in the upper troposphere. From reanalysis data and several baseline experiments from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we find that the circulation trend pattern is associated with fluctuations of the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation. The phase shift of AMV in the 1990s is particularly noteworthy for accelerating warming averaged over the northern midlatitude land. The amplitude of the observed trend in both surface air temperature and the upper-level geopotential height generally falls beyond the range of multidecadal trends simulated by the CMIP6 preindustrial control runs, supporting the likelihood that anthropogenic forcing played a critical role in the observed trend. On the other hand, the fidelity of the simulated low-frequency modes of variability and their teleconnections, especially on multidecadal time scales, is difficult to assess because of the relatively short observational records. Our mechanistic modeling results indicate that synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction is a key to the formation of the anomalous wave train but how the multidecadal modes can modulate the synoptic eddies through atmosphere–ocean and atmosphere–land interactions remains poorly understood. This gap in our knowledge makes it challenging to quantify the roles of the low-frequency modes and external forcings in causing the observed multidecadal trends.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

(ORCID:0000000220592790); Monahan, Adam H.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; bulk and tails; climate change; nonstationary; temperature extremes","In traditional extreme value analysis, the bulk of the data is ignored, and only the tails of the distribution are used for inference. Extreme observations are specified as values that exceed a threshold or as maximum values over distinct blocks of time, and subsequent estimation procedures are motivated by asymptotic theory for extremes of random processes. For environmental data, nonstationary behavior in the bulk of the distribution, such as seasonality or climate change, will also be observed in the tails. To accurately model such nonstationarity, it seems natural to use the entire dataset rather than just the most extreme values. It is also common to observe different types of nonstationarity in each tail of a distribution. Most work on extremes only focuses on one tail of a distribution, but for temperature, both tails are of interest. This paper builds on a recently proposed parametric model for the entire probability distribution that has flexible behavior in both tails. We apply an extension of this model to historical records of daily mean temperature at several locations across the United States with different climates and local conditions. We highlight the ability of the method to quantify changes in the bulk and tails across the year over the past decades and under different geographic and climatic conditions. The proposed model shows good performance when compared to several benchmark models that are typically used in extreme value analysis of temperature.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"A Vertically Resolved MSE Framework Highlights the Role of the Boundary Layer in Convective Self-Aggregation","Yao, Lin; Yang, Da; Tan, Zhe-Min","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Atmosphere; Deep convection; Large-scale motions; Boundary layer; Radiative-convective equilibrium","<title>Abstract</title> <p>Convective self-aggregation refers to a phenomenon in which random convection can self-organize into large-scale clusters over an ocean surface with uniform temperature in cloud-resolving models. Previous literature studies convective aggregation primarily by analyzing vertically integrated (VI) moist static energy (MSE) variance. That is the global MSE variance, including both the local MSE variance at a given altitude and the covariance of MSE anomalies between different altitudes. Here we present a vertically resolved (VR) MSE framework that focuses on the local MSE variance to study convective self-aggregation. Using a cloud-resolving simulation, we show that the development of self-aggregation is associated with an increase of local MSE variance, and that the diabatic and adiabatic generation of the MSE variance is mainly dominated by the boundary layer (BL; the lowest 2 km). The results agree with recent numerical simulation results and the available potential energy analyses showing that the BL plays a key role in the development of self-aggregation. Additionally, we find that the lower free troposphere (2–4 km) also generates significant MSE variance in the first 15 days. We further present a detailed comparison between the global and local MSE variance frameworks in their mathematical formulation and diagnostic results, highlighting their differences.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Detecting impacts of surface development near weather stations since 1895 in the San Joaquin Valley of California","Kim, Diane; Christy, John R.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Temperature; Urbanization; Climate; Time series construction","<title>Abstract</title> <p> Temperature readings observed at surface weather stations have been used for detecting changes in climate due to their long period of observations. The most common temperature metrics recorded are the daily maximum (TMax) and minimum (TMin) extremes. Unfortunately, influences besides background climate variations impact these measurements such as changes in (1) instruments, (2) location, (3) time of observation, and (4) the surrounding artifacts of human civilization (buildings, farms, streets, etc.) Quantifying (4) is difficult because the surrounding infrastructure, unique to each site, often changes slowly and variably and is thus resistant to general algorithms for adjustment. We explore a direct method of detecting this impact by comparing a single station that experienced significant development from 1895 to 2019, and especially since 1970, relative to several other stations with lesser degrees of such development (after adjustments for the (1) to (3) are applied). The target station is Fresno, California (metro population ~ 15,000 in 1900 and ~ 1 million in 2019) situated on the eastern side of the broad, flat San Joaquin Valley in which several other stations reside. A unique component of this study is the use of pentad (5-day averages) as the test metric. Results indicate that Fresno experienced + 0.4 °C decade <sup>−1</sup> more nighttime warming (TMin) since 1970 than its neighbors—a time when population grew almost 300%. There was little difference seen in TMax trends between Fresno and non-Fresno stations since 1895 with TMax trends being near zero. A case is made for the use of TMax as the preferred climate metric relative to TMin for a variety of physical reasons. Additionally, temperatures measured at systematic times of the day (i.e., hourly) show promise as climate indicators as compared with TMax and especially TMin (and thus TAvg) due to several complicating factors involved with daily high and low measurements. </p>","Springer Science + Business Media","","Univ. of Alabama, Huntsville, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","Austria","2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Theoretical and Applied Climatology Journal Volume: 149 Journal Issue: 3-4","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1223-1238","","","SC0019296","Journal ID: ISSN 0177-798X; PII: 4107","10.1007/s00704-022-04107-3","","2022-08-30T00:00:00Z","1871052","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1871052","","Theoretical and Applied Climatology","3-4","149"

The 2017 National Academies of Science Decadal Survey highlighted that observations of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) from the current space-based observing system are not of the necessary accuracy or resolution for monitoring and predicting high-impact weather phenomena. One possible solution to improving observations of the PBL is supplementing the existing space-based observing system with a network of ground-based profilers. A synthetic information content study is developed utilizing profiles from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program sites at the Southern Great Plains (SGP), east North Atlantic (ENA), and North Slope of Alaska (NSA) to assess the benefits, in terms of degrees of freedom (DOF), vertical resolution, and uncertainties, of a synergy between the ground-based Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) with space-based hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounders. A combination of AERI with any of the three polar-orbiting IR sounders: the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), or the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), results in a DOF increase of 30%–40% in the surface-to-700-hPa layer compared to the space-based instrument alone. Introducing AERI measurements to the observing system also results in significant improvements to vertical resolution and uncertainties in the bottom 1000 m of the atmosphere compared to CrIS measurements alone.

"Toward a more realistic representation of surface albedo in NASA CERES-derived surface radiative fluxes","Huang, Yiyi; Taylor, Patrick C.; Rose, Fred G.; Rutan, David A.; Shupe, Matthew D.; Webster, Melinda A.; Smith, Madison M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Arctic surface energy budget; Sea ice surface albedo; Satellite-derived surface energy budget","Accurate multidecadal radiative flux records are vital to understand Arctic amplification and constrain climate model uncertainties. Uncertainty in the NASA Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES)-derived irradiances is larger over sea ice than any other surface type and comes from several sources. The year-long Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition in the central Arctic provides a rare opportunity to explore uncertainty in CERES-derived radiative fluxes. First, a systematic and statistically robust assessment of surface shortwave and longwave fluxes was conducted using in situ measurements from MOSAiC flux stations. The CERES Synoptic 1degree (SYN1deg) product overestimates the downwelling shortwave flux by +11.40 Wm<sup>–2 </sup>and underestimates the upwelling shortwave flux by –15.70 Wm<sup>–2</sup> and downwelling longwave fluxes by –12.58 Wm<sup>–2</sup> at the surface during summer. In addition, large differences are found in the upwelling longwave flux when the surface approaches the melting point (approximately 0°C). The biases in downwelling shortwave and longwave fluxes suggest that the atmosphere represented in CERES is too optically thin. The large negative bias in upwelling shortwave flux can be attributed in large part to lower surface albedo (–0.15) in satellite footprint relative to surface sensors. Additionally, the results show that the spectral surface albedo used in SYN1deg overestimates albedo in visible and mid-infrared bands. A series of radiative transfer model perturbation experiments are performed to quantify the factors contributing to the differences. The CERES-MOSAiC broadband albedo differences (approximately 20 Wm<sup>–2</sup>) explain a larger portion of the upwelling shortwave flux difference than the spectral albedo shape differences (approximately 3 Wm<sup>–2</sup>). In addition, the differences between perturbation experiments using hourly and monthly MOSAiC surface albedo suggest that approximately 25% of the sea ice surface albedo variability is explained by factors not correlated with daily sea ice concentration variability. Biases in net shortwave and longwave flux can be reduced to less than half by adjusting both albedo and cloud inputs toward observed values.

"Flow-Assisted Selective Mineral Extraction from Seawater","Wang, Qingpu; Nakouzi, Elias; Ryan, Elisabeth A.; Subban, Chinmayee V.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Seawater mining; Selectivity; Non-equilibrium; Magnesium; Mineral","The sustainable production of critical materials from natural sources requires a paradigm shift away from currently used resource-intensive processes. In this paper, we report a single-step, laminar co-flow method (LCM) that leverages non-equilibrium conditions to selectively extract pure Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> from natural seawater. Conventional seawater-based Mg extraction involves adding individual or a combination of precipitants to obtain Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, but the co-existence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> unavoidably results in CaCO<sub>3</sub> impurities requiring additional purification steps. Here we show that the non-equilibrium conditions in LCM achieved using a microfluidics device and by simply co-injecting a NaOH solution with seawater can result in improved selectivity for Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> unlike in conventional bulk mixing method. The resulting precipitates are characterized for composition and the process yield and purity are optimized through systematic variations of the reaction time and the concentration of NaOH. This is the first demonstration of LCM for selective separation, and as a one-step process that does not rely on novel sorbents, membranes, or external stimuli, it is easy to scale-up. LCM has the potential to be broadly relevant to selective separations from complex feed streams and diverse chemistries—enabling more sustainable materials extraction and processing.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"rabpro: global watershed boundaries, river elevation profiles, and catchment statistics","Schwenk, Jonathan Paul; Zussman, Tal; Stachelek, Jemma; Rowland, Joel C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Earth sciences; watersheds; basins; rivers; DEM; Google Earth engine","River and Basin Profiler (rabpro) is a Python package to delineate watersheds, extract river flowlines and elevation profiles, and compute watershed statistics for any location on the Earth’s surface. As fundamental hydrologically-relevant units of surface area, watersheds are areas of land that drain via aboveground pathways to the same location, or outlet. Delineations of watershed boundaries are typically performed on digital elevation models (DEMs) that represent surface elevations as gridded rasters. Depending on the resolution of the DEM and the size of the watershed, delineation may be very computationally expensive. With this in mind, we designed rabpro to provide user-friendly workflows to manage the complexity and computational expense of watershed calculations given an arbitrary coordinate pair. In addition to basic watershed delineation, rabpro will extract the elevation profile for a watershed’s mainchannel flowline. This enables the computation of river slope, which is a critical parameter in many hydrologic and geomorphologic models. Finally, rabpro provides a user-friendly wrapper around Google Earth Engine’s (GEE) Python API to enable cloud-computing of zonal watershed statistics and/or time-varying forcing data from hundreds of available datasets. Altogether, rabpro provides the ability to automate or semi-automate complex watershed analysis workflows across broad spatial extents.","Open Source Initiative - NumFOCUS","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The 216-Z-9 (Z-9) unlined trench received over 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> L of mixed Pu processing waste from the Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) consisting of high ionic strength (~ 5 M nitrate, ~ 0.6 M aluminum), acidic (pH ~2.5) solutions, which also contained the organic solvents: tributyl phosphate (TBP), dibutyl butylphosphonate (DBBP), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and lard oil. A small fraction of Pu migrated deep into the subsurface vadose zone to depths of 37 m, but the mechanisms controlling Pu migration beneath the trench are unknown. In this study, we determined Pu partitioning behavior in a series of binary and ternary batch experiments containing aqueous, organic, and solid phases representative of the waste constituents and natural sediments of the Z-9 trench in order to develop a conceptual model for the transport of Pu in the subsurface. Our results show that Pu at equilibrium with low pH, high nitrate waste and in the presence of a TBP/organic phase can migrate as a Pu-TBP-nitrate complex in the organic phase as long as the low pH and high nitrate concentrations are maintained. Reducing the nitrate concentrations or increasing the pH will lead to Pu partitioning into the aqueous phase from the organic phase with subsequent sorption to native Hanford sediments. The results of this work suggest that Pu migration in the subsurface is likely driven by weak sorption of aqueous Pu under low pH conditions as well as the formation of Pu-TBP-nitrate complexes in the organic phase. Long-term Pu migration will be limited by the transient nature of the low pH conditions and the dispersion of the nitrate plume.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

At each half-daily time step, fire pixels are clustered according to their spatial proximity, and are either appended to an existing active fire object or are assigned to a new object. This automatic system allows us to update the attributes of each fire event, delineate the fire perimeter, and identify the active fire front shortly after satellite data acquisition. Using this system, we mapped the history of California fires during 2012–2020.

However, the resources that compare the life cycle global warming potential (GWP) of various RNG production pathways are lacking and focus mostly on a singular pathway. This effort is an attempt to close this gap and provide a comparison between the life cycle GWP of three major RNG pathways and the FNG pathway.

Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; deep convection parameterization; aquaplanet; model resolution; climate model","The Grell-Freitas deep convection scheme (GF) has been implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) with the nonhydrostatic Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) dynamical core. Aquaplanet simulations have been performed with a global quasi-uniform resolution mesh with ~120 km grid spacing and a variable resolution mesh employing a circular refined region with ~30 km grid spacing centering at the equator and ~120 km elsewhere. GF produces overall patterns of the general circulations comparable to those of other aquaplanet experiments, including those produced using the default Zhang-McFarlane convection scheme (ZM) in CAM Version 5.4. GF alleviates the overestimated occurrence of weak intensity precipitation characteristic of ZM due to GF’s different closure methods and deep-convection trigger conditions. Compared to ZM, the GF characteristics of the equatorial Kelvin waves are closer to observations. GF also better simulates precipitation at variable resolution, with no unrealistic wave distortion by the refinement. Overall, GF shows less sensitivity of convective precipitation and heating/moistening tendencies to changes in horizontal resolution compared to ZM. However, vertically-overlapped total cloud fraction simulated with GF in the tropics is more sensitive to the resolution than ZM due to the larger resolution-sensitivity of high-level cloud fraction in the tropics.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the impact of concomitant changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on seawater-induced tree mortality is uncertain. We examined the mechanisms of seawater-induced mortality under varying climate scenarios using a photosynthetic gain and hydraulic cost optimization model validated against observations in a mature stand of Sitka-spruce (Picea sitchensis) trees in the Pacific Northwest, USA, that were dying from recent seawater exposure. The simulations matched well with observations of photosynthesis, transpiration, nonstructural carbohydrates concentrations, leaf water potential, the percentage loss of xylem conductivity, and stand-level mortality rates. The simulations suggest that seawater-induced mortality could decrease by ~16.7% with increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels due to reduced risk of carbon starvation. Conversely, rising VPD could increase mortality by ~5.6% because of increasing risk of hydraulic failure. Across all scenarios, seawater-induced mortality was driven by hydraulic failure in the first two years after seawater exposure began, with carbon starvation becoming more important in subsequent years. Changing CO<sub>2</sub> and climate appear unlikely to have a significant impact on coastal tree mortality under rising sea levels.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While significant, the resulting models are often scenario specific and/or require a host of individual component parameters to estimate emission rates. This study developed an approach to estimate aggregated emissions rates based on a wide number of field measurements. We used a multi-parameter regression model based on previous mass transfer models to predict formaldehyde emission rate for a whole dwelling using field-measured, time-resolved formaldehyde concentrations, air exchange rates, and indoor environmental parameters in 63 California single-family houses built between 2011 and 2017. The resulting model provides time-varying formaldehyde emission rates, normalized by floor area, for each study home, assuming a well-mixed mass balance transport model of the home, and a well-mixed layer transport model of indoor surfaces. The surface layer model asserts an equilibrium concentration within the surface layer of the emitted materials that is a function of temperature and RH; the dwelling ventilation rate serves as a surrogate for indoor concentration. We also developed a more generic emission model that is suitable for broad prediction of emission for a population of buildings. This model is also based on measurements aggregated from 27 homes from the same study. We showed that errors in predicting household formaldehyde concentrations using this approach were substantially less than those using a traditional constant emission rate model, despite requiring less unique building information.</p>","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Sensitivity of Cloud-Radiative Effects to Cloud Fraction Parametrizations in Tropical, Mid-Latitude and Arctic Kilometre-Scale Simulations","Van Weverberg, Kwinten; Morcrette, Cyril J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; cloud fraction parametrization; clouds; radiation; convection-permitting; evaluation","The Regional Atmosphere (RA) configuration of the Met Office Unified Model currently requires different cloud fraction parametrizations (CFP) for tropical and midlatitude simulations. To explore the scope for unification of these two RA configurations, this paper presents a detailed evaluation of simulations over tropical, midlatitude and arctic domains, with two different diagnostic CFPs, a prognostic CFP, and no CFP at all. Furthermore, a novel, hybrid approach was used that treats liquid cloud diagnostically and ice cloud prognostically. Using observations from three U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement supersites, it is shown that none of these CFPs stands out as superior over all domains. Over the frequently overcast Arctic, the all-or-nothing approach best captures the cloud radiative properties. Conversely, CFPs are of benefit in regions with frequent partial cloudiness, such as the midlatitudes and the tropics. However, their improved cloud radiative properties often hide an error compensation. All models underestimate overcast, low-base cloud with small water paths in convective environments. In addition, mid-latitude overcast, low-base, optically thick clouds in the morning, possibly associated with overnight convection, are frequently too broken. Diagnostic schemes compensate for these errors by producing spurious, scattered afternoon cloud, which could be due to a correct cloud response to too eager convective initiation. Winter clouds over the midlatitudes are improved when liquid cloud is represented diagnostically with a bimodal saturation-departure PDF, without error compensation. While it is difficult to unify the RA across the globe around a single CFP scheme, the newly proposed Hybrid scheme performs reasonably well for cloud cover across all regions. It also exhibits SW biases that are smaller than most other configurations and is less affected by excessive liquid water paths and compensating errors than fully diagnostic schemes. Surface precipitation is fairly insensitive to the CFP in the simulations shown here.","Royal Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The observations, collected during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE), provide a unique dataset for evaluating AMPS, especially the radar observations that facilitate a three-dimensional depiction of winds and precipitation. Comparisons of AMPS forecast data with surface meteorology, balloon-sounding, and profiling radar observations at and above sites near McMurdo Station reveal a mixture of similarities and differences. A generally southerly flow is evident at low levels in both the AMPS simulations and observed Doppler radial velocities. AMPS winds are comparable to those observed at the surface and aloft in terms of magnitude, direction, and timing but the strongest simulated southerly flow is displaced eastward relative to the observations. AMPS-simulated reflectivity over the broader Ross Island region is more limited in areal extent and smaller in magnitude than observed by a scanning Doppler radar. Three episodes of surface precipitation are observed near McMurdo Station over the five-day event with peak rates of ~3 mm h<sup>-1</sup> and a total accumulation of ~22 mm.

"Soil moisture thresholds explain a shift from light-limited to water-limited sap velocity in the Central Amazon during the 2015–16 El Niño drought","Meng, Lin; Chambers, Jeffrey; Koven, Charles; Pastorello, Gilberto; Gimenez, Bruno; Jardine, Kolby; Tang, Yao; McDowell, Nate; Negron-Juarez, Robinson; Longo, Marcos; Araujo, Alessandro; Tomasella, Javier; Fontes, Clarissa; Mohan, Midhun; Higuchi, Niro","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; drought; tropical forests; water cycle; soil moisture; evapotranspiration","Transpiration is often considered to be light- but not water-limited in humid tropical rainforests due to abundant soil water, even during the dry seasons. The record-breaking 2015–16 El Niño drought provided a unique opportunity to examine whether transpiration is constrained by water under severe lack of rainfall. We measured sap velocity, soil water content, and meteorological variables in an old-growth upland forest in the Central Amazon throughout the 2015–16 drought. We found a rapid decline in sap velocity (-38 ± 21%, mean ± SD.) and in its temporal variability (-88%) during the drought compared to the wet season. Such changes were accompanied by a marked decline in soil moisture and an increase in temperature and vapor pressure deficit. Sap velocity was largely limited by net radiation during the wet and normal dry seasons; however, it shifted to be primarily limited by soil moisture during the drought. The threshold in which sap velocity became dominated by soil moisture was at 0.33 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>-3</sup> (around -150 kPa in soil matric potential), below which sap velocity dropped steeply. Our study provides evidence for a soil water threshold on transpiration in a moist tropical forest, suggesting a shift from light limitation to water limitation under future climate characterized by increased temperature and an increased frequency, intensity, duration and extent of extreme drought events.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although India’s per capita emissions are well below global average, the country is one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. Indian policymakers and stakeholders require high-quality data and research to assess low-emissions, sustainable development strategies. Peer-reviewed literature is a key source of this information and also a key venue for conversation amongst research leaders. This paper examines the recent peer-reviewed literature on India’s 2030 and 2050 pathways. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify key quantitative national modeling studies. From the 34 studies identified, we synthesized scenario data to draw common conclusions and identify critical research gaps. The main focus was on examining the coverage and the state of information available on low-carbon pathways. Overall, we find a few scenarios that are potentially consistent with a 2070 net-zero goal, but more limited assessment of pathways to reach net-zero emissions before this date. Mitigation pathways with greater ambition are required across all energy sectors to ensure a smooth transition to net-zero emissions by or before 2070. The scenarios confirm that reducing emissions to below 2 GtCO <sub>2</sub> yr <sup>−1</sup> by mid-century would necessitate significant transformations of the Indian energy sector, such as, a decrease in unabated coal power capacity, transportation modal shift, and industrial process switching. The assessment also finds substantial differences in final energy estimates reported across studies, particularly in transportation. The lack of consistency in, and transparency about underlying drivers, assumptions, and even outputs across studies points to the critical need for the sorts of coordinated, multi-model studies that have proven exceptionally valuable for decision makers in other major emitting countries. </p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Future climate change, especially intensified sea level rise (SLR), is expected to trigger SWI to encroach on coastal freshwater aquifers more intensively. Numerous studies have investigated decadal/century scale SWI under SLR by assuming a static coastal landscape topography. However, coastal landscapes are highly dynamic in response to SLR, and the impact of coastal landscape evolution on SWI has received very little attention. Thus, this study used a coastal marsh landscape as an example and investigated how coastal marsh evolution affects future SWI with a physically-based coastal hydro-eco-geomorphologic model, Advanced Terrestrial Simulator. Our numerical experiments showed that it is very likely that the marsh elevation increases with future SLR due to sediment deposition, and a depression zone is formed due to different marsh accretion rates between the ocean boundary and the inland. We found that marsh accretion may significantly reduce the surface saltwater inflow at the ocean boundary, and the evolved topographic depression zone may prolong the residence time of surface ponded saltwater, affecting subsurface salinity distribution differently. We also predicted that marshlands may become more sensitive to upland freshwater supply under future SLR, compared with previous predictions without marsh evolution. This study demonstrates the importance of coastal evolution to coastal freshwater-saltwater interaction. The eco-geomorphologic effect may not be ignored when evaluating coastal SWI under SLR at decadal or century scales.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

However, linking the development of CPOs to the ice flow history requires a proper understanding of the ice aggregate's microstructural response to flow transitions. In this contribution the influence of ice deformation history on the CPO development is investigated by means of full-field numerical simulations at the microscale. We simulate the CPO evolution of polycrystalline ice under combinations of two consecutive deformation events up to high strain, using the code VPFFT (visco-plastic fast Fourier transform algorithm) within ELLE. A volume of ice is first deformed under coaxial boundary conditions, which results in a CPO. The sample is then subjected to different boundary conditions (coaxial or non-coaxial) in order to observe how the deformation regime switch impacts the CPO. The model results indicate that the second flow event tends to destroy the first, inherited fabric with a range of transitional fabrics. However, the transition is slow when crystallographic axes are critically oriented with respect to the second imposed regime. Therefore, interpretations of past deformation events from observed CPOs must be carried out with caution, particularly in areas with complex deformation histories.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The first version focuses on comparing simulated aerosol properties with aircraft, ship, and surface measurements, which are mostly measured in situ. The diagnostics currently cover six field campaigns in four geographical regions: eastern North Atlantic (ENA), central US (CUS), northeastern Pacific (NEP), and Southern Ocean (SO). These regions produce frequent liquid- or mixed-phase clouds, with extensive measurements available from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and other agencies. Various types of diagnostics and metrics are performed for aerosol number, size distribution, chemical composition, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration, and various meteorological quantities to assess how well E3SM represents observed aerosol properties across spatial scales. Overall, E3SM qualitatively reproduces the observed aerosol number concentration, size distribution, and chemical composition reasonably well, but it overestimates Aitken-mode aerosols and underestimates accumulation-mode aerosols over the CUS and ENA regions, suggesting that processes related to particle growth or coagulation might be too weak in the model. The current version of E3SM struggles to reproduce the new particle formation events frequently observed over both the CUS and ENA regions, indicating missing processes in current parameterizations. The diagnostics package is coded and organized in a way that can be extended to other field campaign datasets and adapted to higher-resolution model simulations.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Evidence increasingly suggests that locations on the landscape that experience biogeochemical fluxes disproportionate to the surrounding matrix (hot spots) and time periods that show disproportionately high fluxes relative to the background (hot moments) strongly influence landscape-scale soil N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. However, substantial uncertainties remain regarding how to measure and model where and when these extreme soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes occur. High-frequency datasets of soil N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes are newly possible due to advancements in field-ready instrumentation that uses cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). Here, we outline the opportunities and challenges that are provided by the deployment of this field-based instrumentation and the collection of high-frequency soil N<sub>2</sub>O flux datasets. While there are substantial challenges associated with automated CRDS systems, there are also opportunities to utilize these near-continuous data to constrain our understanding of dynamics of the terrestrial N cycle across space and time.

Transported African and Asian dust and marine aerosols from the Pacific Ocean may act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) to affect cloud and precipitation properties over the region. Here we explored the effects of INPs from marine aerosols on orographic mixed-phase clouds and precipitation at different AR stages for an AR event observed during the 2015 ACAPEX field campaign under low dust (<0.02 cm<sup>-3</sup>) conditions. Simulations were conducted using the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with the spectral-bin microphysics at 1 km grid spacing, with ice nucleation connected with dust and marine aerosols. By comparing against airborne and ground-based observations, accounting for marine INP effects improves the simulation of AR-precipitation. The marine INPs enhance the formation of ice and snow, leading to less shallow warm clouds but more mixed-phase and deep clouds, as well as to a large spillover effect of precipitation after AR landfall. The responses of cloud and precipitation to marine INPs vary with the AR stages, with more significant effects before AR landfall and post-AR than after AR landfall, mainly because the moisture and temperature conditions change with the AR evolution. This work suggests weather and climate models need to consider the impacts of marine INPs since their contribution is notable under low dust conditions despite the much lower relative ice nucleation efficiency of marine INPs.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"National-scale impacts on wind energy production under curtailment scenarios to reduce bat fatalities","Maclaurin, Galen; Hein, Cris; Williams, Travis; Roberts, Owen; Lantz, Eric; Buster, Grant; Lopez, Anthony","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; annual energy production; bat fatalities; curtailment; wind energy","Wind energy often plays a major role in meeting renewable energy policy objectives; however, increased deployment can raise concerns regarding the impacts of wind plants on certain wildlife. Particularly, estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities occur annually at wind plants across North America, with potential implications for the viability of several bat species. One approach to reducing bat fatalities is shutting down (or curtailing) turbines when bats are most at risk, such as at night during relatively low wind speed periods throughout summer and early autumn. While curtailment has consistently been shown to reduce bat fatalities, the lost power production reduces revenues for wind plants. This study conducted simulations with a range of curtailment scenarios across the contiguous United States to examine sensitivities of annual energy production (AEP) loss and potential impacts on economic metrics for future wind energy deployment. We found that AEP reduction can vary across the country from less than 1% to more than 10% for different curtailment scenarios. From an estimated 2891 gigawatts (GW) of simulated economically viable wind capacity (measured by a positive net present value), we found the mid curtailment scenario (6.0 m/s wind speed cut-in from July 1 through October 31) reduced the quantity of economic wind capacity by 274 GW or 9.5%. Our results indicate that high levels of curtailment could substantially reduce the future footprint of financially viable wind energy. In this context, future work that illuminates cost-effective strategies to minimize curtailment while reducing bat fatalities would be of value.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We demonstrate that the spatial-temporal variation of grid-mean in-cloud <PoP> can be largely explained by the variation of the joint probability density function (PDF) of LWP and CDNC in the phase space specified by the bivariate PoP(LWP, CDNC) function. Through a series of sensitivity tests guided by this understanding, we find that in the South-Eastern Pacific and Atlantic the stratocumulus to cumulus transition of <PoP> is mainly due to the variation of CDNC while the annual cycle is mainly due to the variation of LWP.

"Large‐Eddy Simulations of a Convection Cloud Chamber: Sensitivity to Bin Microphysics and Advection","Yang, Fan; Ovchinnikov, Mikhail; Thomas, Subin; Khain, Alexander; McGraw, Robert; Shaw, Raymond A.; Vogelmann, Andrew M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Bin microphysics schemes are useful tools for cloud simulations and are often considered to provide a benchmark for model intercomparison. However, they may experience issues with numerical diffusion, which are not well quantified, and the transport of hydrometeors depends on the choice of advection scheme, which can also change cloud simulation results. Here, an atmospheric large-eddy simulation model is adapted to simulate a statistically steady-state cloud in a convection cloud chamber under well-constrained conditions. Two bin microphysics schemes, a spectral bin method and the method of moments, as well as several advection methods for the transport of the microphysical variables are employed for model intercomparison. Results show that different combinations of microphysics and advection schemes can lead to considerable differences in simulated cloud properties, such as cloud droplet number concentration. We find that simulations using the advection scheme that suffers more from numerical diffusion tends to have a smaller droplet number concentration and liquid water content, while simulation with the microphysics scheme that suffers more from numerical diffusion tends to have a broader size distribution and thus larger mean droplet sizes. Sensitivities of simulations to bin resolution, spatial resolution, and temporal resolution are also tested. We find that refining the microphysical bin resolution leads to a broader cloud droplet size distribution due to the advection of hydrometeors. Our results provide insight for using different advection and microphysics schemes in cloud chamber simulations, which might also help understand the uncertainties of the schemes used in atmospheric cloud simulations.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Here, VPD is used to identify short-term drought with the Standardized VPD Drought Index (SVDI); and used to characterize future extreme droughts using grid dependent stationary and non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) models, and a random sampling technique is developed to quantify multimodel uncertainties. The GEV analysis was performed with projections using the Weather Research and Forecasting model, downscaled from three Global Climate Models based on the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for present, mid-century and late-century. Results show the VPD based index (SVDI) accurately identifies the timing and magnitude short-term droughts, and extreme VPD is increasing across the United States and by the end of the twenty-first century. The number of days VPD is above 9 kPa increases by 10 days along California’s coastline, 30–40 days in the northwest and Midwest, and 100 days in California’s Central Valley.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Researchers have identified two primary mechanisms that increase nitrogen and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability within permafrost soils: (1) the ‘frozen feast’, where previously frozen organic material becomes available as it thaws, and (2) ‘shrubification’, where expansion of nitrogen-fixing shrubs promotes increased soil nitrogen. Through the synthesis of original and previously published observational data, and the application of multiple geospatial approaches, this study investigates and highlights a third mechanism that increases NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability: the hydrogeomorphic evolution of polygonal permafrost landscapes. Permafrost thaw drives changes in microtopography, increasing the drainage of topographic highs, thus increasing oxic conditions that promote NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production and accumulation. We extrapolate relationships between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and soil moisture in elevated topographic features within our study area and the broader Alaskan Coastal Plain and investigate potential changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability in response to possible hydrogeomorphic evolution scenarios of permafrost landscapes. These approximations indicate that such changes could increase Arctic tundra NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability by ~250–1000%. Thus, hydrogeomorphic changes that accompany continued permafrost degradation in polygonal permafrost landscapes will substantially increase soil pore water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> availability and boost future fertilization and productivity in the Arctic.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

After comprehensive evaluation with spatially and temporally complete satellite retrievals, the model shows that LAPs in snow reduce snow albedo by 0.013 (0-0.045) in the Sierra Nevada during the ablation season (April-July), producing a midday mean radiative forcing (RF) of 4.5 W m<sup>-2</sup> which increases to 15-22 W m<sup>-2</sup> in July. LAPs in snow accelerate snow aging processes and reduce snow cover fraction, which doubles the albedo change and radiative forcing caused by LAPs. The impurity-induced snow darkening effects decrease snow water equivalent and snow depth by 20 mm and 70 mm in June in Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep habitat. The earlier snowmelt reduces root zone soil moisture by 20%, deteriorating the forage productivity and playing a negative role in the survival of bighorn sheep.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper outlines a multi-criteria evaluation methodology that incorporates disparate sets of quantitative, spatially variable data into a decision-making framework for screening the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) outer continental shelf (OCS) for potentially viable CO<sub>2</sub> storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) sites. Criteria categories include favorable geologic characteristics, logistics, and potential risks. Data compiled for 14 criteria from several publicly available geographic information system (GIS) layers was aggregated over 2559 spatially balanced points across the study area using the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL)-developed Cumulative Spatial Impact Layers™ (CSIL) GIS tool. Criteria are weighted by qualitative expert opinion relative to their perceived importance to given scenarios— the output of combined criteria values and weights enables regional CO<sub>2</sub> storage suitability differentiation. The methodology considers both technical and non-technical factors impacting CCUS decision-making. The flexible methodology enables a systematic approach to regional ranking at high spatial resolution over a large study domain. Additionally, the framework enables high-grading of priority sites that warrant further characterization and follow-on analysis. Areas along the Louisiana coast and Mississippi River Delta consistently rank high for all scenarios largely a result of the favorable geology with the potential for stacked storage, as well as the density of existing pipelines and platforms, and proximity to several onshore CO<sub>2</sub> sources. High-graded regions for the CO<sub>2</sub> EOR-related scenarios are typically located further offshore towards the middle and edge of the OCS compared to higher priority regions for the geologic storage scenarios which fall closer to the Louisiana coastline.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2022-05-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: May 2022","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 103688","","","FE0025912","Journal ID: ISSN 1750-5836","10.1016/j.ijggc.2022.103688","","2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","1873872","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1873872","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1873872","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control","May 2022","118"

The implications of this expansion to the biogeochemistry of Arctic ecosystems are of critical importance and more work is needed to better understand the form, availability, and transportation potential of N from these shrubs across a variety of Arctic landscapes. To gain insights into the processes controlling N within a permafrost hillslope system, the spatiotemporal variability of nitrate (NO$_{3}^{-}$) and its environmental controls were investigated at an alder (Alnus viridis spp. fruticosa) dominated permafrost tundra landscape in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, USA. Soil pore water was collected from locations within alder shrubland growing along a well-drained hillslope and was compared to soil pore water collected from locations outside (upslope, downslope, and between) the alder shrubland. Soil pore water collected within alder shrubland had an average NO<sub>3<sup>-</sup></sub>N (nitrogen from nitrate) concentration of 4.27±8.02 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and differed significantly from locations outside alder shrubland (0.23±0.83 mg L<sup>-1</sup>; p<0.05). Temporal variation in NO<sub>3<sup>-</sup></sub>N within and downslope of alder shrubland co-occurred with precipitation events where NO$_{3}^{-}$ that accumulated in the soil was likely flushed downslope during rainfall. These findings have important implications for nutrient availability and mobility in N-limited permafrost systems that are experiencing shrub expansion in response to a warming Arctic.","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Application of a Machine Learning Algorithm in Generating an Evapotranspiration Data Product From Coupled Thermal Infrared and Microwave Satellite Observations","Fang, Li; Zhan, Xiwu; Kalluri, Satya; Yu, Peng; Hain, Chris; Anderson, Martha; Laszlo, Istvan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; evapotranspiration (ET); land surface temperature (LST); GOES-R; machine learning (ML); regression tree (RT)","Land surface evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the main energy sources for atmospheric dynamics and a critical component of the local, regional, and global water cycles. Consequently, accurate measurement or estimation of ET is one of the most active topics in hydro-climatology research. With massive and spatially distributed observational data sets of land surface properties and environmental conditions being collected from the ground, airborne or space-borne platforms daily over the past few decades, many research teams have started to use big data science to advance the ET estimation methods. The Geostationary satellite Evapotranspiration and Drought (GET-D) product system was developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2016 to generate daily ET and drought maps operationally. The primary inputs of the current GET-D system are the thermal infrared (TIR) observations from NOAA GOES satellite series. Because of the cloud contamination to the TIR observations, the spatial coverage of the daily GET-D ET product has been severely impacted. Based on the most recent advances, we have tested a machine learning algorithm to estimate all-weather land surface temperature (LST) from TIR and microwave (MW) combined satellite observations. With the regression tree machine learning approach, we can combine the high accuracy and high spatial resolution of GOES TIR data with the better spatial coverage of passive microwave observations and LST simulations from a land surface model (LSM). The regression tree model combines the three LST data sources for both clear and cloudy days, which enables the GET-D system to derive an all-weather ET product. This paper reports how the all-weather LST and ET are generated in the upgraded GET-D system and provides an evaluation of these LST and ET estimates with ground measurements. The results demonstrate that the regression tree machine learning method is feasible and effective for generating daily ET under all weather conditions with satisfactory accuracy from the big volume of satellite observations.","Frontiers","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Assessing the Potential Impact of River Chemistry on Arctic Coastal Production","Gibson, Georgina A.; Elliot, Scott M.; Clement Kinney, Jaclyn; Piliouras, Anastasia; Jeffery, Nicole","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; earth sciences; Arctic ecosystem; production; river nutrients; permafrost; earth system model; coastal; marine ecosystem; Arctic Ocean","The Arctic coastal margin receives a disproportionately large fraction of the global river discharge. The bio-geochemistry of the river water as it empties into the marine environment reflects inputs and processes that occur as the water travels from its headwaters. Climate-induced changes to Arctic vegetation and permafrost melt may impact river chemistry. Understanding the impact of river nutrients on coastal marine production, and how this may change in the future, are important for resource managers and community members who monitor and rely on coastal food resources. Using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model we explore the impact of timing and river nutrient concentrations on primary production in each coastal Arctic region and then assess how this influences secondary production and particle fluxes supporting the benthic food web. Our results indicate that while the concentration of Arctic river nitrogen can have a significant impact on annual average nitrogen and primary production in the coastal Arctic, with production increases of up to 20% in the river influenced interior Seas, the timing of the river nutrient inputs into the marine environment appears less important. Bloom timing and partitioning between small and large phytoplankton were minimally impacted by both river nutrient concentration and timing, suggesting that in general, coastal Arctic ecosystem dynamics will continue to be primarily driven by light availability, rather than nutrients. Under a doubling river nutrient scenario, the percentage increase in the POC flux to the benthos on river influenced Arctic coastal shelves was 2-4 times the percentage increase in primary production, suggesting changes to the river nutrient concentration has the potential to modify the Arctic food web structure and dynamics. Generally, the nutrient-induced changes to primary production were smaller than changes previously simulated in response to ice reduction and temperature increase. However, in the Laptev Sea, the production increase resulting from a doubling of river nutrients exceeded the production increase simulated with an atmospheric warming scenario. Dissolved organic carbon is presently poorly represented in the model so its impact on production is hard to simulate. Applying established relationships between modeled DOC, total DOC, and light absorption we illustrate that DOC could play a very important role in modulating production. Our findings highlight the importance of developing more realistic river nutrient and discharge forcing for Earth System Models such that their impact on the critical Arctic coastal domain can be more adequately resolved.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Modeling Monthly Nitrate Concentration in a Karst Spring with and without Discrete Conduit Flow","Gao, Yuan; Xu, Zexuan; Li, Shen; Yu, Wenjie","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; karst aquifer; conduit flow process; nitrate; spring","Understanding the coupled continuum pipe-flow framework for modeling contaminant transport in karst systems is critical for protecting water resources therein. This study simulated point and non-point source nitrate concentration in a karst spring and investigated the results generated from the flow and transport model with and without discrete conduit flow. CFPv2 and CMT3D models were integrated to address the changes in nitrate concentration at a monthly scale in a karst spring, and the results were compared with that from an equivalent porous media (EPM) model with high-hydraulic conductivity (K) zones set in the main karstified area to represent conduits. The results show that the CFPv2+CMT3D model is able to describe well the recession of nitrate concentration in spring discharge, and the relatively larger deviation (slower nitrate recession) from the observed trend for the EPM model is probably a result of the limitation of utilizing high hydraulic conductivity cells to represent conduit. Moreover, simulated hydraulic heads in poorly karstified areas from the two models both show slight differences from the observations (the head RMSE values of calibration/validation for CFPv2 and MODFLOW models are 0.16 m/0.25 m and 0.26 m/0.17 m, respectively), indicating the inclusion of conduits may not affect the simulation considerably, and the lower the proportion of karstic area, the slight effects brought from the inclusion of conduits in the model. For highly karstified areas, the CFPv2+CMT3D model could provide more accurate results (head RMSE of calibration/validation for CFPv2 and MODFLOW are 0.22 m/0.06 and 0.52 m/0.47 m, respectively), showing the coupled continuum pipe-flow framework may be more appropriate for applying to highly and maturely karstified areas where the variations in the behavior of flow and contaminant transport are more affected by turbulent flow regime.","MDPI","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Additionally, INP emissions respond to changes in the Earth System and climate, e.g., desertification, agricultural practices, and fires, and therefore may introduce climate feedbacks that are still poorly understood. A better understanding of INP sources, their atmospheric variability, and cloud responses to INPs is required to improve Earth System predictability. As knowl-edge of the nature and origins of INPs has advanced, regional and global weather, climate, and Earth system models have increasingly begun to link cloud ice processes to model-simulated aerosol abundance and types. While these recent advances in nu-merical modeling of INPs are exciting, coupling cloud processes to simulated aerosol also makes cloud physics simulations increasingly susceptible to errors and uncertain-ties in simulation of INPs that are poorly constrained. Advancing INP predictability will require an increased focus on research that bridges the measurement and modeling communities. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge and identifies critical knowledge gaps from both observational and modeling perspectives. In partic-ular, we emphasize the need for research that advances our understanding and capa-bilities in two key areas: (1) observational closure between aerosol and INP quantities and (2) skillful simulation of INPs within existing weather and climate models. We discuss the state of knowledge on various INP particle types as it relates to both of these goals, and briefly discuss the challenges faced in understanding cloud impacts of INPs with present-day models. Finally, we identify priority research directions for both observations and models to improve understanding of INPs and their interactions with the Earth System.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

On average, ~60 fuel-based emission factors per engine were measured using a novel combination of exhaust plume capture combined with GPS location and speed data that can be more readily deployed than common portable emissions measurement systems. Here, BC and NO<sub>x</sub> emission factors (g kg<sup>-1</sup>) were lowest and least variable during fast cruising and highest during maneuvering and docked operation. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reduced NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by ~80% when functional. However, elevated NO<sub>x</sub> emissions that exceeded corresponding exhaust standards were measured on most Tier 3 and Tier 4 engines sampled, which can be attributed to inactive SCR during frequent low engine load operation. In contrast, BC emissions exceeded the PM emission standard for only one engine, and SCR systems employed as a NO<sub>x</sub> reduction technology also reduced emitted BC. Using these measured emission factors to compare commuting options, we show that the CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions per passenger-kilometer are comparable when commuting by car and ferry, but BC and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions can be several to more than ten times larger when commuting by ferry.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Parameterizing Convective Organization Effects With a Moisture-PDF Approach in Climate Models: Concept and a Regional Case Simulation","Yang, Ben; Wang, Minghuai; Zhang, Guang J.; Guo, Zhun; Wang, Yong; Xu, Xin; Dai, Guoqing; Huang, Anning; Zhang, Yaocun; Qian, Yun","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We propose a parameterization scheme of convective organization effects based on a moisture-distribution approach, which can reflect aggregation of convective cells within a model grid as well as the interaction between convection and spatial heterogeneity in free-troposphere moisture. With this concept, convective cells in an aggregated state are surrounded by air that is moister than the grid-mean condition, which provides a “shielding” effect favorable for deeper convective updrafts. Such effects are represented quantitatively via utilizing a schematic diagram about the geometric interpretation of convective cluster, dry area, and their contact area, in which both the convective cluster size and dry area fraction increase during the development of convection. Our sensitivity analyses indicate that the new scheme performs well in capturing the mean precipitation features. Excluding the convective organization effects in the model leads to a considerable reduction in the simulated precipitation magnitude. Notably, there exists an inverse relationship between background mean moisture condition and sub-grid moisture variability for a given rain rate, suggesting that with a high spatial heterogeneity in free-troposphere moisture, convection can still develop and maintain its strength under relatively dry background conditions, consistent with the convection-permitting model simulation. Overall, our new parameterization of convective organization effects can successfully reproduce the relationship between precipitation and sub-grid moisture variability, which is a missing element in traditional convection parameterization schemes but important for the simulations of precipitation variability at various scales in climate models.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Impacts of Lake Surface Temperature on the Summer Climate Over the Great Lakes Region","Wang, Jiali; Xue, Pengfei; Pringle, William; Yang, Zhao; Qian, Yun","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The surface of the Great Lakes interacts with the atmosphere, influencing the weather and climate over the Great Lakes Region (GLR). However, most climate models were not designed with sufficient emphasis on lake–atmosphere interactions, which could potentially cause model biases over the GLR. To understand how lake surface temperature (LST) affects the regional summer climate over the GLR, we conducted twin experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model at a spatial resolution of 4 km using two different LST data sets as the bottom boundary condition over the Great Lakes. In this work, our simulations include 10 ensemble members for the summer of 2018 and a single multiyear run for the summers of 2014–2020. Results show that variations in LST influence atmospheric temperature and moisture at a local scale—while affecting the convective environment and precipitation processes over a much larger spatial scale. In particular, an LST that is only 1°C–3°C warmer (depending on the lake) increases near-surface air temperature by 1.93°C and 0.97°C over Lake Superior and Lake Erie, respectively, and increases evaporation over the lakes by 0.23 and 1.1 mm day<sup>–1</sup>. The warmer LST reduces mesoscale convective precipitation upstream of the GLR; however, it increases isolated deep convective precipitation and nonconvective precipitation downstream of GLR due to increased local instability and enhancement of moisture transport. Our analyses confirm the robustness of these impacts, which is at least 2 times larger than the model internal variability and is seen across all simulated summer seasons.","American Geophysical Union","","Argonne National Lab.

The future projected climate characteristics of E3SMv1.0 at the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) designed in the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) and the SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gas (GHG) only forcing experiment are analyzed with a focus on regional responses of atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land. Due to its high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS of 5.3 K), E3SMv1.0 is one of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models with the largest surface warming by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario. The global mean precipitation change is highly correlated with the global temperature change, while the spatial pattern of the change in runoff is consistent with the precipitation changes. The oceanic mixed layer generally shoals throughout the global ocean. The annual mean Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is overly weak with a slower change from ~11 to ~6 Sv (Sverdrup) relative to other CMIP6 models. The sea ice, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, decreases rapidly with large seasonal variability. We detect a significant polar amplification in E3SMv1.0 from the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice. Comparing the SSP5-8.5 all-forcing experiment with the GHG-only experiment, we find that the unmasking of the aerosol effects due to the decline of the aerosol loading in the future projection period causes transient accelerated warming in the all-forcing experiment in the first half of the 21st century. While the oceanic climate response is mainly controlled by the GHG forcing, the land runoff response is impacted primarily by forcings other than GHG over certain regions, e.g., southern North America, southern Africa, central Africa, and eastern Asia. However, the importance of the GHG forcing on the land runoff changes grows in the future climate projection period compared to the historical period.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We use a set of five ESMs and one Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC) to explore the dynamics of the Earth's climate and carbon cycles under contrasting emissions trajectories beyond this century to the year 2300. The trajectories include a very-high-emissions, unmitigated fossil-fuel-driven scenario, as well as a mitigation scenario that diverges from the first scenario after 2040 and features an “overshoot”, followed by a decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations by means of large net negative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In both scenarios and for all models considered here, the terrestrial system switches from being a net sink to either a neutral state or a net source of carbon, though for different reasons and centered in different geographic regions, depending on both the model and the scenario. The ocean carbon system remains a sink, albeit weakened by carbon cycle feedbacks, in all models under the high-emissions scenario and switches from sink to source in the overshoot scenario. The global mean temperature anomaly is generally proportional to cumulative carbon emissions, with a deviation from proportionality in the overshoot scenario that is governed by the zero emissions commitment. Additionally, 23rd century warming continues after the cessation of carbon emissions in several models in the high-emissions scenario and in one model in the overshoot scenario. While ocean carbon cycle responses qualitatively agree in both globally integrated and zonal mean dynamics in both scenarios, the land models qualitatively disagree in zonal mean dynamics, in the relative roles of vegetation and soil in driving C fluxes, in the response of the sink to CO<sub>2</sub>, and in the timing of the sink–source transition, particularly in the high-emissions scenario. The lack of agreement among land models on the mechanisms and geographic patterns of carbon cycle feedbacks, alongside the potential for lagged physical climate dynamics to cause warming long after CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have stabilized, points to the possibility of surprises in the climate system beyond the 21st century time horizon, even under relatively mitigated global warming scenarios, which should be taken into consideration when setting global climate policy.","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Dissipation and Bathymetric Sensitivities in an Unstructured Mesh Global Tidal Model","Blakely, Coleman P.; Ling, Guoming; Pringle, William J.; Contreras, María Teresa; Wirasaet, Damrongsak; Westerink, Joannes J.; Moghimi, Saeed; Seroka, Greg; Shi, Lei; Myers, Edward; Owensby, Margaret; Massey, Chris","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The mechanisms and geographic distribution of global tidal dissipation in barotropic tidal models are examined using a high resolution unstructured mesh finite element model. Mesh resolution varies between 2 and 25 km and is especially focused on inner shelves and steep bathymetric gradients. Tidal response sensitivities to bathymetric changes are examined to put into context response sensitivities to frictional processes. We confirm that the Ronne Ice Shelf dramatically affects Atlantic tides but also find that bathymetry in the Hudson Bay system is a critical control. We follow a sequential frictional parameter optimization process and use TPXO9 data-assimilated tidal elevations as a reference solution. From simulated velocities and depths, dissipation within the global model is estimated and allows us to pinpoint dissipation at high resolution. Boundary layer dissipation is extremely focused with 1.4% of the ocean accounting for 90% of the total. Internal tide friction is much more distributed with 16.7% of the ocean accounting for 90% of the total. Often highly regional dissipation can impact basin-scale and even ocean wide tides. Optimized boundary layer friction parameters correlate very well with the physical characteristics of the locality with high friction factors associated with energetic tidal regions, deep ocean island chains, and ice covered areas. Global complex M<sub>2</sub> tide errors are 1.94 cm in deep waters. Total global boundary layer and internal tide dissipation are estimated, respectively, at 1.83 and 1.49 TW. This continues the trend in the literature toward attributing more dissipation to internal tides.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the quasi-stable loops that exist in nearly all coastal networks have not yet been explained. We present a model for self-organizing networks inspired by vascular biophysics to show that loops emerge when the relative forcings between rivers and tides are comparable, resulting in interplay between hydrodynamic forcings at short time scales relative to network evolution. Using field data and satellite imaging, we confirm this control on 21 field networks.

"Towards mapping biodiversity from above: Can fusing lidar and hyperspectral remote sensing predict taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic tree diversity in temperate forests?","Kamoske, Aaron G.; Dahlin, Kyla M.; Read, Quentin D.; Record, Sydne; Stark, Scott C.; Serbin, Shawn P.; Zarnetske, Phoebe L.; Dornelas, Maria","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; forest diversity; hyperspectral imagery; airborne lidar; forest canopies; landscape ecology; biodiversity; remote sensing","Aim Rapid global change is impacting the diversity of tree species and essential ecosystem functions and services of forests. It is therefore critical to understand and predict how the diversity of tree species is spatially distributed within and among forest biomes. Satellite remote sensing platforms have been used for decades to map forest structure and function but are limited in their capacity to monitor change by their relatively coarse spatial resolution and the complexity of scales at which different dimensions of biodiversity are observed in the field. Recently, airborne remote sensing platforms making use of passive high spectral resolution (i.e., hyperspectral) and active lidar data have been operationalized, providing an opportunity to disentangle how biodiversity patterns vary across space and time from field observations to larger scales. Most studies to date have focused on single sites and/or one sensor type; here we ask how multiple sensor types from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) perform across multiple sites in a single biome at the NEON field plot scale (i.e., 40 m x 40 m). With a fusion of hyperspectral and lidar data from the NEON AOP, we assess the ability of high resolution remotely sensed metrics to measure biodiversity variation across eastern US temperate forests. We examine how taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic measures of alpha diversity vary spatially and assess to what degree remotely sensed metrics correlate with in situ biodiversity metrics. Models using estimates of forest function, canopy structure, and topographic diversity performed better than models containing each category alone. Our results show that canopy structural diversity, and not just spectral reflectance, is critical to predicting biodiversity. We found that an approach that jointly leverages spectral properties related to leaf and canopy functional traits and forest health, lidar derived estimates of forest structure, fine-resolution topographic diversity, and careful consideration of biogeographical differences within and among biomes is needed to accurately map biodiversity variation from above.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"The Two-Energies Turbulence Scheme Coupled to the Assumed PDF Method","Bašták Ďurán, Ivan; Sakradzija, Mirjana; Schmidli, Juerg","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","An update of the two-energy turbulence scheme is presented, the 2TE + APDF scheme. The original version of the two-energy scheme is able to successfully model shallow convection without the need of an additional parameterization for non-local fluxes. However, the performance of the two-energy scheme is worse in stratocumulus cases, where it tends to overestimate the erosion of the stable layers. We have identified the causes: the non-local stability parameter does not consider local stratification, the scheme lacks an internal parameter that could distinguish between a shallow convection regime and a stratocumulus regime, and it uses an inflexible turbulence length scale formulation. To alleviate this problem, we propose several modifications: an update of the stability parameter, a modified computation of the turbulence length scale, and the introduction of the entropy potential temperature to distinguish between a shallow convection and a stratocumulus regime. In addition, the two-energy scheme is coupled to a simplified assumed probability density function method in order to achieve a more universal representation of the cloudy regimes. The updated turbulence scheme is evaluated for several idealized cases and one selected real case in the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework. The results show that the updated scheme corrects the overmixing problem in the stratocumulus cases. The performance of the updated scheme is comparable to the operational setup, and can be thus used instead of the operational turbulence and shallow convection scheme in ICON. Additionally, the updated scheme improves the coupling with dynamics, which is beneficial for the modeling of coherent flow structures in the atmospheric boundary layer.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, large and poorly characterized uncertainties in both fluxes, and in their difference, make it challenging to evaluate spatiotemporal variations of water balance and its dependence on ET or P. Here, we show that satellite observations of the HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio of water vapor are sensitive to spatiotemporal variations of ET-P over the Amazon. When calibrated by basin-scale and mass-balance estimates of ET-P derived from terrestrial water storage and river discharge measurements, the isotopic data demonstrate that rainfall controls wet Amazon water balance variability, but ET becomes important in regulating water balance and its variability in the dry Amazon. Changes in the drivers of ET, such as above ground biomass, could therefore have a larger impact on soil moisture and humidity in the dry (southern and eastern) Amazon relative to the wet Amazon.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Cloud Morphology Evolution in Arctic Cold‐Air Outbreak: Two Cases During COMBLE Period","Wu, Peng; Ovchinnikov, Mikhail","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Cloud feedbacks play an important role in Arctic warming. Cloud morphology, for example, cloud size and spatial distributions, is among key factors that directly impact their radiative effects. In this work, we use two cases observed during the Cold-air Outbreak (CAO) in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) to study the evolution of cloud size distributions as an air mass is advected from the Arctic over a comparatively warm ocean and cloud mesoscale organization changes from rolls to cells. Cloud objects are identified from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance images through an object segmentation procedure and roll breakup is identified by homogeneities in cloud water path (CWP). Roll breakup is found to be accompanied by a local minimum in wind shear and local maxima in cloud size and marine cold air outbreak index. The mean cloud horizontal aspect ratio has weak fetch dependency and is around 2 in roll, transition, and cell regimes. Regardless of distance from the ice edge, smaller clouds (<10 km2) dominate the population number but not cloud cover. Cloud size distributions show bimodality in transition and cell regimes. For clouds with comparable sizes, mean nearest neighbor distances normalized by equivalent cloud radius converge to a single value for all regimes and for all but the smallest clouds, suggesting that clouds of comparable sizes in CAOs are separated by distance proportional to their sizes.

"The uncertain role of rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on global plant transpiration","Vicente-Serrano, Sergio M.; Miralles, Diego G.; McDowell, Nate; Brodribb, Tim; Domínguez-Castro, Fernando; Leung, Ruby; Koppa, Akash","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; transpiration; CO2; Atmospheric water demand; Earth system models; Climate change; Projections","As CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere rises, there is a need for improved physical understanding of its impact on global plant transpiration. This knowledge gap poses a major hurdle in robustly projecting changes in the global hydrologic cycle. For this reason, here we review the different processes by which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration affects plant transpiration, the several uncertainties related to the complex physiological and radiative processes involved, and the knowledge gaps which need to be filled in order to improve predictions of plant transpiration. Additionally, although there is a high degree of certainty that rising CO<sub>2</sub> will impact plant transpiration, the exact nature of this impact remains unclear due to complex interactions between CO<sub>2</sub> and climate, and key aspects of plant morphology and physiology. The interplay between these factors has substantial consequences not only for future climate and global vegetation, but also for water availability needed for sustaining the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Future changes in global plant transpiration in response to enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> are expected to be driven by water availability, atmospheric evaporative demand, plant physiological processes, emergent plant disturbances related to increasing temperatures, and the modification of plant physiology and coverage. Considering the universal sensitivity of natural and agricultural systems to terrestrial water availability we argue that reliable future projections of transpiration is an issue of the highest priority, which can only be achieved by integrating monitoring and modeling efforts to improve the representation of CO<sub>2</sub> effects on plant transpiration in the next generation of earth system models.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"High Free-Tropospheric Aitken-Mode Aerosol Concentrations Buffer Cloud Droplet Concentrations in Large-Eddy Simulations of Precipitating Stratocumulus","Wyant, Matthew C.; Bretherton, Christopher S.; Wood, Robert; Blossey, Peter N.; McCoy, Isabel L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","A new Aitken mode aerosol microphysics scheme is developed for a large eddy simulation model in order to better investigate cloud-aerosol interactions in the marine boundary layer and to study the Aitken buffering hypothesis of McCoy et al. (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jd033529. This scheme extends the single-mode two-moment prognostic aerosol scheme of Berner et al. (2013), https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-12549-2013. Seven prognostic variables represent accumulation and Aitken log-normal aerosol modes in air and droplets as well as 3 gas species. Scavenging of interstitial and other unactivated aerosol by cloud and rain drops are treated using the scheme described in Berner et al. (2013), https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-12549-2013. The scheme includes coagulation of unactivated aerosol and a simple chemistry model with gas phase H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and DMS as prognostic variables to capture basic influences of sulfur chemistry on the model aerosols. Nucleation of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> aerosol particles from gas-phase H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is neglected. A deep, precipitating stratocumulus case (VAMOS Ocean Cloud Atmosphere Land Study RF06) is used to test the new scheme. The presence of the Aitken mode aerosol increases the cloud droplet concentration through activation of the larger Aitken particles and delays the creation of an ultraclean, strongly precipitating cumulus state. Scavenging of unactivated accumulation and Aitken particles by cloud and precipitation droplets accelerates the collapse. Increasing either the above-inversion Aitken concentration or the surface Aitken flux increases the Aitken population in the boundary layer and prevents the transition to an ultraclean state.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The Amazon-scale averaged ET has strong correlations with these factors at the annual and multi-year periodicities. The patterns of WPDs have south-north and west-east divides due to the significant variation in climatic conditions. The results demonstrate that ET is mainly affected by water and energy availability while vegetation regulates both processes. The deep soil moisture/groundwater can provide strong subsidies to ET during the meteorological dry season in the water-limited area of Amazon. The WPD can well reflect the responses of ET to the variations of P, TWSA, DSR, and LAI, and the process of vegetation sustaining ET in the dry years in the water-limited area of the Amazon.","American Geophysical Union","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-5 reanalysis data are employed to systematically study the ACI over the monsoon region in Pakistan. Based on the monsoon occurrence and rainfall intensity, the whole region is divided into three sub-regions labeled as highly intensive (R1), moderately intensive (R2) and weak (R3) monsoon region. The results indicate that the monthly mean Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) peaks in the summer monsoon months (Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep). Here, the well-known Twomey effect whereby the Cloud Droplet Radius (CDR) decreases with increasing AOD holds only over R3; the opposite effects (Anti-Twomey effect) are found over R1 and R2, all passing the test of statistical significance (p<0.05). The multi-year AOD is found to be positively correlated with Cloud Liquid Water Path (CLWP) and Cloud Optical Depth (COD) over R1 and R2, suggesting that thicker clouds containing more water droplets are formed in polluted atmosphere. Over R3, decreases in CLWP and COD are found with increasing AOD only when AOD is less than~0.325. The analysis of ACI over R1 and R2 during the winter months shows similar but stronger responses of CDR, CLWP and COD to the variation in AOD. The weaker responses during the summer monsoon season may attributed to the occurrence of high level cloud and unstable atmospheric condition. Further investigation of the influences of Relative Humidity and pressure vertical velocity on the CDR-AOD relationships shows that although the magnitude of the CDR-AOD correlations change with meteorological conditions, the sign of correlations remain unchanged with meteorological conditions.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Their presence alters the partitioning of solar radiation: decreasing reflection, increasing absorption and transmission to the ice and ocean, and enhancing melt. The spatiotemporal properties of melt ponds thus modify ice albedo feedbacks and the mass balance of Arctic sea ice. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition presented a valuable opportunity to investigate the seasonal evolution of melt ponds through a rich array of atmosphere-ice-ocean measurements across spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we characterize the seasonal behavior and variability in the snow, surface scattering layer, and melt ponds from spring melt to autumn freeze-up using in situ surveys and auxiliary observations. We compare the results to satellite retrievals and output from two models: the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) and the Marginal Ice Zone Modeling and Assimilation System (MIZMAS). During the melt season, the maximum pond coverage and depth were 21% and 22 ± 13 cm, respectively, with distribution and depth corresponding to surface roughness and ice thickness. Compared to observations, both models overestimate melt pond coverage in summer, with maximum values of approximately 41% (MIZMAS) and 51% (CESM2). This overestimation has important implications for accurately simulating albedo feedbacks. During the observed freeze-up, weather events, including rain on snow, caused high-frequency variability in snow depth, while pond coverage and depth remained relatively constant until continuous freezing ensued. Both models accurately simulate the abrupt cessation of melt ponds during freeze-up, but the dates of freeze-up differ. MIZMAS accurately simulates the observed date of freeze-up, while CESM2 simulates freeze-up one-to-two weeks earlier. This work demonstrates areas that warrant future observation-model synthesis for improving the representation of sea-ice processes and properties, which can aid accurate simulations of albedo feedbacks in a warming climate.","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The sorbent lifetime is a key uncertainty in the deployment of these materials in such applications, as they oxidize under conditions relevant to candidate DAC process cycles. Here, in this study, we utilize thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry/FTIR spectroscopy to characterize the nature, rate, and quantity of volatile species formed from the oxidation of PEI when supported on mesoporous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. We show that NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O are primary volatile species formed from PEI oxidation and that their production rate matches the overall oxidation rate as measured via heat flow from a differential scanning calorimeter. We show that the total quantity of NH<sub>3</sub> evolved is consistent with terminal primary amines being cleaved from the polymer chain and that approximately one hydrogen atom per PEI repeat unit reacts to form H<sub>2</sub>O during the reaction. Finally, metadynamics and quantum chemical simulations performed on a simplified system are used to highlight the likely importance of radicals in the elementary reactions that comprise the oxidation reaction set. The findings here represent the first characterization of the volatile products from the oxidation of PEI in CO<sub>2</sub> sorbents and lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms behind the oxidative degradation of these materials.","American Chemical Society","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Contrasting Stratospheric Smoke Mass and Lifetime From 2017 Canadian and 2019/2020 Australian Megafires: Global Simulations and Satellite Observations","D’Angelo, Gennaro; Guimond, Steve; Reisner, Jon Michael; Peterson, David A.; Dubey, Manvendra Krishna","58 GEOSCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Stratospheric injections of carbonaceous aerosols and combustion gases by extreme wildfires have become increasingly common. Recent “megafires,” particularly large and intense fires, delivered particulate burdens to the lower stratosphere comparable to those of moderate volcanic eruptions. The 2017 Canadian megafire generated four large Pyrocumulonimbi (pyroCbs), injecting up to ≈0.3 Tg of smoke in the lower stratosphere. Even more extreme, the 2019/2020 Australian event produced a pyroCb activity resulting in stratospheric smoke intrusions of ≈1 Tg. To understand their contrasting behavior, we present global climate simulations of the atmospheric response to these events, applying smoke burdens informed by remote observations. Model outcomes, compared to satellite data of smoke transport, reproduce reasonably well the initial plume rise, at 0.2–0.3 km/day, attaining heights of ≈20 km in Canada and above 30 km in Australia. Global dispersal of the plume occurs within about 3 weeks in both cases, consistent with observations. Smoke removal timescales, ≈5 months for the Canadian megafire, agree with remote measurements. During the Australian megafire, observations indicate stratospheric injections three times as large, and models predict comparatively longer smoke lifetimes, ≈16 months. After the latter event, atmospheric optical depths and radiative cooling achieved values close to those measured following the Pinatubo eruption. Sensitivity tests of model assumptions indicate, in accord with prior studies, that smoke burden, injection heights, and black carbon content can determine plume evolution and possible climate impacts. An empirical relation between peak heights of stratospheric plumes and lifetimes is derived that can help assess megafire impacts on the stratosphere, climate and the Earth system","American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here, nanospray desorption electrospray ionization with high-resolution mass spectrometry (nano-DESI-HRMS) is used to interrogate the molecular composition of organic aerosols collected at the Southern Great Plains, located in an agricultural region of Oklahoma. Identified molecular formulae featured carbon, hydrogen, oxygen (CHO), nitrogen (CHNO), and/or sulfur (CHOS, CHNOS), with higher organosulfate proportions during daytime (41%) compared to nighttime (30%). In this work, nighttime aerosols featured increases in CHO, CHNO, and extremely low volatility organic carbon (ELVOC) species. However, due to high relative humidity, the nighttime aerosols phase state was found to be more liquid-like than daytime aerosols using parametrized glass transition temperatures. Aerosol molecular composition from an anthropogenically influenced plume (southerly winds) showed significant increases in CHOS and ELVOC species. By comparison with chamber studies, CHOS species are suspected to be of mixed biogenic and anthropogenic origin, whereas CHNOS species (not identified in the southerly winds) are suggested to predominately be of biogenic origin. Overall, this study provides key insight into organosulfates above agricultural fields, demonstrating dependence upon day/night cycles and episodic anthropogenic emissions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Meandering rivers can entrain particulate OC from permafrost many meters below the depth of annual thaw, potentially enabling the production of greenhouse gases. However, the amount and fate of permafrost OC that is mobilized by river erosion is uncertain. To constrain OC fluxes due to riverbank erosion and deposition, we collected riverbank and floodplain sediment samples along the Koyukuk River, which meanders through discontinuous permafrost in the Yukon River watershed, Alaska, USA, with an average migration rate of 0.52 m yr<sup>-1</sup>. We measured sediment total OC (TOC) content, radiocarbon activity, water content, bulk density, grain size, and floodplain stratigraphy. Radiocarbon activity and TOC content were higher in samples dominated by silt as compared to sand, which we used to map OC content onto floodplain stratigraphy and estimate carbon fluxes due to river meandering. Results showed that the Koyukuk River erodes and re-deposits a substantial flux of OC each year due to its depth and high migration rate, generating a combined OC flux of a similar magnitude to the floodplain net ecological productivity. However, sediment being eroded from cutbanks and deposited as point bars had similar OC stocks (mean ± 1 SD of 125.3±13.1 kg OC m<sup>-2</sup> in cutbanks versus 114.0±15.7 kg OC m<sup>-2</sup> in point bars) whether or not the banks contained permafrost. We also observed radiocarbon-depleted biospheric OC in both cutbanks and permafrost-free point bars. These results indicate that a substantial fraction of aged biospheric OC that is liberated from floodplains by bank erosion is subsequently re-deposited in point bars rather than being oxidized. The process of aging, erosion, and re-deposition of floodplain organic material may be intrinsic to river–floodplain dynamics, regardless of permafrost content.","Copernicus GmbH","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Tidal frequencies and quasiperiodic subsurface water level variations dominate redox dynamics in a salt marsh system","Grande, Emilio; Arora, Bhavna; Visser, Ate; Montalvo, Maya; Braswell, Anna; Seybold, Erin; Tatariw, Corianne; Beheshti, Kathryn; Zimmer, Margaret","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; salt marsh hydrology; wavelet analysis; coastal hydrology; hydro-biogeochemistry; coastal hydrology, hydro-biogeochemistry, salt marsh hydrology, wavelet analysis","Salt marshes are hotspots of nutrient processing en route to sensitive coastal environments. Whilst our understanding of these systems has improved over the years, we still have limited knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of critical biogeochemical drivers within salt marshes. Sea-level rise will continue to force change on salt marsh functioning, highlighting the urgency of filling this knowledge gap. Our study was conducted in a central California estuary experiencing extensive marsh drowning and relative sea-level rise, making it a model system for such an investigation. Here we instrumented three marsh positions subjected to different degrees of tidal inundation (6.7%, 8.9%, and 11.2% of the time for the upper, middle, and lower marsh positions, respectively), providing locations with varied biogeochemical characteristics and hydrological interactions at the site. We continuously monitored redox potential (Eh) at depths of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 m, subsurface water levels (WL), and temperature at 0.7 m depth at each marsh position. To understand how drivers of subsurface biogeochemical processes fluctuate across tidal cycles, we used wavelet analyses to explain the interactions between Eh and WL. We found that tidal forcing significantly affects key drivers of biogeochemical processes by imparting controls on Eh variability, likely driving subsurface hydro-biogeochemistry of the salt marsh. Wavelet coherence showed that the Eh-WL relationship is nonlinear, and their lead–lag relationship is variable. We found that precipitation events perturb Eh at depth over timescales of hours, even though WL shows relatively minimal change during events. This work highlights the importance of high frequency in situ measurements, such as Eh, to help explain factors that govern subsurface biogeochemistry and hydrological processes in salt marshes.","Wiley","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Impact of Rainfall on Tropical Cyclone-Induced Sea Surface Cooling","Balaguru, Karthik; Foltz, Gregory R.; Leung, L. Ruby; Hagos, Samson M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; tropical cyclones; ocean; mixing; climate","Tropical cyclones (TCs) are often accompanied by strong winds and torrential rains. While the winds associated with TCs tend to enhance mixing in the upper-ocean, the freshwater input from rain can stratify the water column and limit mixing. However, the extent to which the stabilizing effect of rainfall can compete with wind-induced mixing, and to what degree it modulates TC-induced sea surface cooling, remains unknown. Here we show, using a suite of observations, that heavy rains under weak TCs can significantly reduce the magnitude of cold wakes induced by them. Additionally, when compared to storms with low rain rates, the ocean surface under TCs with high rain rates freshens significantly and cools less. High-resolution climate model simulations and idealized experiments with an ocean mixed layer model support these results and reveal that oceanic mixing processes are primarily responsible for the reduced cooling under TCs, with a lesser role for surface fluxes.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

With fluctuating redox conditions, trace metals can mobilize or sequester in response to changes in iron and sulfur speciation and the concentrations and lability of organic carbon. This study examined the effect of redox fluctuations on trace metal mobility in samples collected from two different natural aquatic systems: riparian wetlands and a stream. The wetland soils contained low sulfur and total Fe contents as compared to stream sediments. The mineral composition at both sites was dominated by quartz. We incubated water-saturated soils under three cycles of anoxic-oxic conditions (τanoxic:τoxic = 3) spanning 24 days and monitored the change in dissolved and bioavailable metal concentrations. For both natural systems, reduction of iron oxides under anoxic conditions caused Co and Zn release. In contrast, oxidation of sulfides mobilized Cu under oxic conditions in both sites. In wetland soils, dissolution of Fe (hydr)oxides increased Ni solubility; however, in stream sediments, Ni release occurred when sulfides or organic matter were oxidized. For stream sediments, each subsequent redox cycle increased the bioavailability of trace metals. Redox fluctuations in wetland soils increased bioavailable Zn and Cu and decreased bioavailable Ni and Co. This study illustrates that different trace metals display distinct bioavailability patterns during redox fluctuations in natural environments. The biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in systems with redox fluctuations may be influenced by these trace metal availability patterns in addition to the availability of electron donors and acceptors.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Earth and Space Chemistry; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1331-1344","","","SC0019422","Journal ID: ISSN 2472-3452","10.1021/acsearthspacechem.2c00031","","2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","1868046","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1868046","","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","5","6"

The most recent survey prioritized a visible to shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer and a multi-spectral thermal infrared imager to meet a range of needs for studying Surface Biology and Geology (SBG). SBG will be the premier integrated observatory for observing the emerging impacts of climate change by characterizing the diversity of plant life and resolving chemical and physiological signatures. It will address wildfire risk, behavior and recovery as well as responses to hazards such as oil spills, toxic minerals in minelands, harmful algal blooms, landslides, and other geological hazards. The SBG team analyzed needed instrument characteristics (spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions, measurement uncertainty) and assessed the cost, mass, power, volume, and risk of different architectures. We present an overview of the Research and Applications trade-study analysis of algorithms, calibration and validation needs, and societal applications with specifics of sub-studies detailed in other articles in this special collection. We provide a value framework to converge from hundreds down to three candidate architectures recommended for development. The analysis identified valuable opportunities for international collaboration to increase the revisit frequency, adding value for all partners, leading to a clear measurement strategy for an observing system architecture.","American Geophysical Union","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this study, we use a global integrated assessment model [the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)] to explore the differences in estimates of LUC CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for two crops (corn and switchgrass) used to produce ethanol in the United States under alternative assumptions about natural lands protection. Varying the latter assumptions for corn ethanol results in net LUC CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between 7 and 41 gCO<sub>2</sub> per MJ of ethanol, whereas varying the same assumptions for switchgrass ethanol results in net emissions between -26 and 14 gCO<sub>2</sub> per MJ of ethanol. The low-end estimate for each occurs when natural lands are assumed to be fully protected everywhere, which leads to significant cropland intensification. The high-end estimate for each occurs when natural lands are assumed to be unprotected everywhere, leading to greater cropland expansion and associated conversion of unmanaged forest and pasture. Results from this study could be used to inform scenarios of future energy system change or life cycle assessment of biofuels for which LUC emissions would be an input.","World Scientific","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we have conducted economic and sustainability analyses of pathways for producing bioblendstocks optimized for improved combustion for mixing-controlled compression ignition (MCCI) engines. We assessed 25 pathways for the production of target fuels from renewable feedstocks and conducted technoeconomic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) to determine which bioblendstock candidates are likely to be viable given a slate of 19 metrics evaluating technology readiness, economic viability, and environmental impacts ranking each metric as either favorable, neutral, unfavorable, or unknown across a range of screening criteria. Among the results, we found that the economic metrics were largely favorable for most of the bioblendstocks. Of the near-term baseline cases, eight pathways offered the potential of a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of less than 5 dollars per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE). In comparison, under future target case scenarios, there is potential for seven pathways to reduce their fuel selling price to less than 4 dollars per GGE. Biochemically-based pathways struggled to achieve favorable target case MFSP under the processing approach taken here, but further economic improvements could be achieved when lignin valorization is included. Most of the conversion technologies were determined to be robust in that they would be minimally affected by the feedstock specifications and variations. However, given the early stage of development for most of the pathways, blending behavior and testing for regulatory limits are key data gaps as knowledge of how many of these bioblendstocks will perform when blended with existing fuels and how much can be added while still meeting fuel property specifications is still being assessed. Twelve pathways showed significant reductions in life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions greater than 60%, and 15 showed favorable fossil energy use reductions compared to conventional diesel fuel. Energy-intensive processes and the use of GHG-intensive chemicals such as sodium hydroxide contribute significantly to GHG emissions. Results from these analyses enable researchers and industry to assess the potential viability of MCCI bioblendstocks.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The plant physiological and radiative impacts of CO$_2$ on rainfall patterns over tropical forest regions are examined in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1.1 (E3SMv1.1-BGC) biogeochemistry experiments. Composite analysis reveals a dampening of the diurnal cycle of rainfall over the Amazon, Congo, and Maritime Continent in response to rising CO$_2$ levels, regardless of the sign of total rainfall change. A full factorial model experiment confirms that the CO$_2$ radiative and CO$_2$ plant physiological effects can individually or jointly reduce the magnitude of the rainfall diurnal cycle, though the physical pathway giving rise to the reduction differs between the two effects. For the physiological response, stomatal closure reduces evapotranspiration, which dries the boundary layer and raises the lifting condensation level. These effects combine to reduce deep convective rainfall during its peak occurrence in the late daytime to early nighttime period. For the radiative response, a relative reduction in daytime CAPE (consistent with a reduction in the diurnal temperature range) leads to less frequent triggering of deep convection and a reduction of rainfall diurnal amplitude. These diurnal rainfall changes are structurally similar across seasons, and show little sensitivity to representation of nutrient coupling for the land biogeochemistry. In agreement with previous findings, the physiological response has only minor impact on extreme rainfall relative to the radiative response.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Load‐Balancing Intense Physics Calculations to Embed Regionalized High‐Resolution Cloud Resolving Models in the E3SM and CESM Climate Models","Peng, Liran; Pritchard, Michael; Hannah, Walter M.; Blossey, Peter N.; Worley, Patrick H.; Bretherton, Christopher S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We design a new strategy to load-balance high-intensity sub-grid atmospheric physics calculations restricted to a small fraction of a global climate simulation's domain. We show why the current parallel load balancing infrastructure of Community Earth System Model (CESM) and Energy Exascale Earth Model (E3SM) cannot efficiently handle this scenario at large core counts. As an example, we study an unusual configuration of the E3SM Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) that embeds a binary mixture of two separate cloud-resolving model grid structures that is attractive for low cloud feedback studies. Less than a third of the planet uses high-resolution (MMF-HR; sub-km horizontal grid spacing) relative to standard low-resolution (MMF-LR) cloud superparameterization elsewhere. To enable MMF runs with Multi-Domain cloud resolving models (CRMs), our load balancing theory predicts the most efficient computational scale as a function of the high-intensity work's relative overhead and its fractional coverage. The scheme successfully maximizes model throughput and minimizes model cost relative to precursor infrastructure, effectively by devoting the vast majority of the processor pool to operate on the few high-intensity (and rate-limiting) high-resolution (HR) grid columns. Two examples prove the concept, showing that minor artifacts can be introduced near the HR/low-resolution CRM grid transition boundary on idealized aquaplanets, but are minimal in operationally relevant real-geography settings. As intended, within the high (low) resolution area, our Multi-Domain CRM simulations exhibit cloud fraction and shortwave reflection convergent to standard baseline tests that use globally homogenous MMF-LR and MMF-HR.

"The effects of spatial and temporal resolution of gridded meteorological forcing on watershed hydrological responses","Shuai, Pin (ORCID:0000000325119828); Chen, Xingyuan (ORCID:0000000319285555); Mital, Utkarsh (ORCID:000000019794382X); Coon, Ethan T.

With the advancement of high-performance computing and the development of integrated watershed models, simulating the watershed hydrological cycle at high temporal (hourly to daily) and spatial resolution (tens of meters) has become efficient and computationally affordable. These hyperresolution watershed models require high resolution of meteorological forcing as model input to ensure the fidelity and accuracy of simulated responses. In this study, we utilized the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), an integrated watershed model, to simulate surface and subsurface flow and land surface processes using unstructured meshes at the Coal Creek Watershed near Crested Butte (Colorado). We compared simulated watershed hydrologic responses including streamflow and distributed variables such as evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent (SWE), and groundwater table driven by three publicly available, gridded meteorological forcings (GMFs) – Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries (Daymet), the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). By comparing various spatial resolutions (ranging from 400 m to 4 km) of PRISM, the simulated streamflow only becomes marginally worse when spatial resolution of meteorological forcing is coarsened to 4 km (or 30% of the watershed area). However, the 4 km-resolution has much worse performance than finer resolution in spatially distributed variables such as SWE. Using the temporally disaggregated PRISM, we compared models forced by different temporal resolutions (hourly to daily), and sub-daily resolution preserves the dynamic watershed responses (e.g., diurnal fluctuation of streamflow) that are absent in results forced by daily resolution. Conversely, the simulated streamflow shows better performance using daily resolution compared to that using sub-daily resolution. Our findings suggest that the choice of GMF and its spatiotemporal resolution depends on the quantity of interest and its spatial and temporal scale, which may have important implications for model calibration and watershed management decisions.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here, we present an analysis of the potential for carbon dioxide from point sources and via direct air capture to be utilized in electrochemical reduction under different market scenarios. We show that developing a network for production of these products at scale requires capture and utilization of significant portions of the carbon dioxide that is currently emitted from large stationary point sources. Because carbon dioxide point sources are spatially and compositionally variable, their use for carbon dioxide reduction depends on electricity prices, capture cost, and location. If the power sector in the United States is decarbonized, carbon dioxide supply decreases significantly, increasing the importance of utilizing other carbon dioxide streams, and increasing the likelihood that direct air capture plays a role in supplying carbon dioxide feedstocks.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Understanding and reducing the uncertainties of land surface energy flux partitioning within CMIP6 land models","Yuan, Kunxiaojia; Zhu, Qing (ORCID:000000032441944X); Riley, William J.; Li, Fa (ORCID:0000000206255587); Wu, Huayi","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; energy fluxes; CMIP6; uncertainty reduction; machine learning; causal inference","Land surfaces dissipate energy through latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes that modulate atmospheric temperature and humidity, which in return affect land surface vegetation and soil processes. Within this two-way land-atmosphere coupling, surface energy partitioning (LE versus H) plays a central role in connecting the land and atmosphere states and fluxes. However, considerably large uncertainties still exist in earth system land models, i.e. the phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Further, the underlying controls from climate and biological factors on surface energy partitioning over different biome types are not well understood. In this study, we combined machine learning (ML) and causal inference models to investigate and reduce the uncertainties (i.e., parametric, structural, and forcing uncertainties) of CMIP6 simulated evaporative fraction (defined as LE / (LE + H)) across 64 FLUXNET sites that cover five major biomes. We found that CMIP6 model ensembles overestimated evaporative fraction with considerable spread at deciduous broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, and savanna sites. Accounting for the biases from all related surface climate and biological driving variables, the CMIP6 model simulated EF could be largely improved (e.g., R between model and observed EF improved from 0.47 to 0.66), with leaf area index, vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation dominated the model improvement. Furthermore, ML-based parameterization generally showed a promising opportunity to further reduce model biases (e.g., R improved from 0.66 to 0.80) in spite of the limited improvement at evergreen broadleaf forest sites where model bias may be dominated by structural imperfection. This study provided an effective framework to understand and reduce model uncertainties in simulating land surface energy flux partitioning and, more importantly, highlighted the need of effective model structure improvement for the next generation earth system land model development.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We develop a novel convective cell tracking database for the entire field campaign using C-band polarimetric radar observations. The cell tracking database includes timing, location, area, depth, merge/split information, microphysical properties, collocated satellite-retrieved cloud properties, and sounding-derived environmental conditions. Results show that the SDC exerts a strong control on convection initiation (CI) and growth. CI preferentially occurs east of the SDC ridge during the afternoon, and cells often undergo upscale growth through the evening as they travel eastward toward the plains. Larger and more intense cells tend to occur in more unstable and humid low-level environments, and surface-based cells are stronger than elevated cells. Midtropospheric relative humidity and vertical wind shear also jointly affect the size and depth of the cells. Rapid cell area growth rates exhibit dependence on both large environmental wind shear and low-level moisture. Evolution of convective cell macro- and microphysical properties are strongly influenced by convective available potential energy and low-level humidity, as well as the presence of other cells in their vicinity. This cell tracking database demonstrates a framework that ties measurements from various platforms centering around convective life cycles to facilitate process understanding of factors that control convective evolution.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Here, we conduct an intercomparison between statistically and dynamically downscaled GCMs simulations using the hybrid delta (HD) and the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) Model, respectively, over the Midwest and Great Lakes region to 1) validate their performance in reproducing extreme daily precipitation (P) and daily maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) for summer and winter and 2) evaluate projections of extremes in the future. Our results show the HD statistical downscaling approach, which includes large-scale bias correction of GCM inputs, can reproduce observed extreme P and T<sub>max</sub> reasonably well for both summer and winter. However, raw historical WRF simulations show significant bias in both extreme P and T<sub>max</sub> for both seasons. Interestingly, the convection-permitting WRF simulation at 4-km grid spacing does not produce better results for seasonal extremes than the WRF simulation at 12 km using a parameterized convection scheme. Despite a broad similarity for winter extreme P projections, the projected changes in the future summer storms are quite different between downscaling methods; WRF simulations show substantial increases in summer extreme precipitation, while the changes projected by the HD approach exhibit moderate decreases overall. The WRF simulations at 4 km also show a pronounced decoupling effect between seasonal totals and extreme daily P for summer, which suggests that there could be more intense summer extremes at two different time scales, with more severe individual convective storms combined with longer summer droughts at the end of the twenty-first century.","American Meteorological Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Previous studies have demonstrated significant correlations between urine biomarker concentrations and chemical levels in wristbands. We build upon those studies and use a novel combination of descriptive statistics and supervised statistical learning to evaluate the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in silicone wristbands and hydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH) concentrations in urine. In New York City, 109 participants in a longitudinal birth cohort wore one wristband for 48 hours and provided a spot urine sample at the end of the 48-hour period during their third trimester of pregnancy. We compared four PAHs with the corresponding seven OH-PAH using descriptive statistics, a linear regression model, and a linear discriminant analysis model. Five of the seven PAH and OH-PAH pairs had significant correlations (Pearson’s r=0.35-0.64, p≤0.003) and significant chi-square tests of independence for exposure categories (p≤0.009). For these five comparisons, the observed PAH or OH-PAH concentration could predict the other concentration within a factor of 1.47 for 50%-80% of the measurements (depending on the pair), and prediction accuracies for high exposure categories were at least 1.5 times higher compared to accuracies based on random chance. These results demonstrate that wristbands and urine provide similar PAH exposure assessment information, which is critical for environmental health researchers looking for the flexibility to switch between biological sample and wristband collection.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Current and future federal and state sampling guidance for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental matrices","Kidd, Justin; Fabricatore, Emily; Jackson, Dennis","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of emerging contaminants composed of an estimated 5000 to 10,000 human-made, fluorinated, organic chemicals. Due to the complexity of PFAS, the need for multiple environmental matrix considerations and the absence of a promulgated federal standard for environmental sampling and analysis, U.S. states have begun developing health-based regulatory and/or guidance values for a limited number of PFAS in environmental matrices. As there is a growing body of science to inform PFAS sampling guidance standard development, it is important to understand which U.S. states are implementing sampling guidelines and how they plan to handle emerging PFAS. This critical review discusses the current and impending federal and state sampling guidelines for PFAS in environmental matrices, the data gaps surrounding PFAS sampling guidance in U.S. states, and the future impacts of impending guidance documents and regulations. Ten federal guidance documents are available for PFAS sampling guidance and analysis. The maximum number of PFAS covered in these guidance documents is 25 analytes spanning across 8 unique media. While the EPA has developed several different sampling and analytical guidelines for PFAS, there is no formal regulation of PFAS or requirements of states to enforce these guidelines. Consequently, only 31 states have informally adopted sampling guidelines, while the other 19 states have no guidance documentation in place for PFAS. The introduction of new PFAS sampling guidelines by the EPA, as well as updated analytical guidelines that target more PFAS or total organofluoride, is expected to continuously shift the landscape of federal and state guidance for PFAS sampling moving forward.","Elsevier","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

Ice of sufficient thickness with an SSL has an observed persistent broadband albedo of ~0.65, resulting in a strong influence on the regional solar partitioning. Experiments during the MOSAiC expedition showed that the SSL re-forms in approximately one day following manual removal. Coincident spectral albedo measurements provide insight into the SSL evolution, where albedo increased on sunny days with higher solar insolation. Comparison with experiments in radiative transfer and global climate models show that the sea ice albedo is greatly impacted by the SSL thickness. The presence of SSL is a significant component of the ice-albedo feedback, with an albedo impact of the same order as melt ponds. Changes in SSL and implications for Arctic sea ice within a warming climate are uncertain.","American Geophysical Union","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

The degree of selection during sward establishment has not been reported using modern genetic methods. Pooled leaf samples were sequenced from replicated swards of 46 half-sib families from two breeding groups (lowland and hybrid) before and through 3 years of stand establishment. Pooled allele frequencies were then assessed using fixation indices (Fst) and an independent data set was used to predict the polygenic impact of establishment selection on two traits (heading date and winter survivorship). Last, the DNA pools were assigned survival rankings to predict the sward survival genomically estimated breeding values within the training data set. Strong and parallel selection occured in both breeding groups. Five genomic regions exceeded the significant threshold of 99.9% in >10 families, indicating consistent selection across families and breeding groups. Polygenic trait predictions determined that establishment selection was partially associated with winter survivorship but resulted in variable heading date alterations. The genomewide variation is consistent with selection for a small number of related parental lines. This study observed strong selection for a small number of hybrid and coastal ecotype individuals which are promising germplasm sources for improved sward survival. This confirms prior reports of sward selection during grassland establishment and highlights the strength of pooled DNA sequencing for survival traits.","Wiley","","Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-04-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Grassland Research; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 31-42","","","SC0018409","Journal ID: ISSN 2097-051X","10.1002/glr2.12007","","2022-09-07T00:00:00Z","1876210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1876210","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1876210","Grassland Research","1","1"

Despite the ubiquity of the CAO cloud regime over high-latitude oceans, we have a rather poor understanding of its properties, its role in energy and water cycles, and its treatment in weather and climate models. The Cold-air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) was conducted to better understand this regime and its representation in models. COMBLE aimed to examine the relations between surface fluxes, boundary-layer structure, aerosol, cloud and precipitation properties, and mesoscale circulations in marine CAOs. Processes affecting these properties largely fall in a range of scales where boundary-layer processes, convection, and precipitation are tightly coupled, which makes accurate representation of the CAO cloud regime in numerical weather prediction and global climate models most challenging. COMBLE deployed an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility at a coastal site in northern Scandinavia (69°N), with additional instruments on Bear Island (75°N), from December 2019 to May 2020. CAO conditions were experienced 19% (21%) of the time at the main site (on Bear Island). A comprehensive suite of continuous in situ and remote sensing observations of atmospheric conditions, clouds, precipitation, and aerosol were collected. Because of the clouds’ well-defined origin, their shallow depth, and the broad range of observed temperature and aerosol concentrations, the COMBLE dataset provides a powerful modeling test bed for improving the representation of mixed-phase cloud processes in large-eddy simulations and large-scale models.","American Meteorological Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"A Multi-Model Framework for Assessing Long- and Short-Term Climate Influences on the Electric Grid","Cohen, Stuart M.; Dyreson, Ana; Turner, Sean; Tidwell, Vince; Voisin, Nathalie; Miara, Ariel","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; climate change; drought; electricity; electricity planning; grid operations; hydrology","Climate change influences many aspects of the electric grid, but prior work and industry practices often ignore the potential effects of changing climate, or they only consider a single effect or individual effects in isolation. Challenges vary with each grid and include adapting to long-term trends such as changing temperature and precipitation or shorter-term events such as drought or storms that could increase in frequency or intensity. Here we present a multi-model framework designed to analyze the effects of long and short-term climate impacts in combination. This framework couples capacity expansion and production cost models with hydrologic models and future climate scenario data to analyze alternative climate and energy futures at high spatial, temporal, and process resolutions. We constructed and evaluated the results of a suite of simulated scenarios exploring climate impacts on capacity investment and stress-tested the resulting future infrastructures using hourly dispatch modeling under alternative drought and load conditions. We demonstrate the approach through a case study of the U.S. Western Interconnection, where climate impacts depend on interactions between temperature-induced load, water availability for hydropower, technology competitiveness, and demand flexibility. Changes in 2038 generating capacity range from -8.5-16.6 GW, and changes in 2038 transmission capacity range from -1-2 GW. Capacity increases are driven by higher load from higher temperatures, while capacity reductions can be achieved in scenarios with higher future hydropower availability and increased demand flexibility. Scenarios requiring additional capacity cost an additional $5-$17 billion (discounted) from 2018 to 2038; however, scenarios with capacity reductions cost $1-$18 billion less. Stress tests on four 2038 infrastructures demonstrated that the identified systems were able to serve at least 99.999% of load and 99.96% of reserves. However, drought and unexpected high-load conditions can result in reduced capacity to respond to contingency events we did not model. Although these results are system and scenario specific, they highlight the importance of considering multiple climate change impacts simultaneously in long-term planning efforts and demonstrate a multi-model, multiscale approach that can be flexibly applied to any system and set of climate change concerns.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Characterizing Drought Behavior in the Colorado River Basin Using Unsupervised Machine Learning","Talsma, Carl J.; Bennett, Katrina E.; Vesselinov, Velimir V.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Colorado River Basin; drought; extreme events; climate change; machine learning; unsupervised; 58 GEOSCIENCES","Drought is a pressing issue for the Colorado River Basin (CRB) due to the social and economic value of water resources in the region and the significant uncertainty of future drought under climate change. Here, we use climate simulations from various Earth System Models (ESMs) to force the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model and project multiple drought indicators for the sub-watersheds within the CRB. We apply an unsupervised machine learning (ML) based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization using K-means clustering (NMFk) to synthesize the simulated historical, future, and change in drought indicators. The unsupervised ML approach can identify sub-watersheds where key changes to drought indicator behavior occur, including shifts in snowpack, snowmelt timing, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. While changes in future precipitation vary across ESMs, the results indicate that the Upper CRB will experience increasing evaporative demand and surface-water scarcity, with some locations experiencing a shift from a radiation-limited to a water-limited evaporation regime in the summer. Large shifts in peak runoff are observed in snowmelt-dominant sub-watersheds, with complete disappearance of the snowmelt signal for some sub-watersheds. The work demonstrates the utility of the NMFk algorithm to efficiently identify behavioral changes of drought indicators across space and time and to quickly analyze and interpret hydro climate model results.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Densities of internally mixed organic-inorganic particles from mobility diameter measurements of aerodynamically classified aerosols","Vokes, Elinor T.; Lewis, Ernie R.; Johnson, Andrew L.; Cotterell, Michael I.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Accurate knowledge of particle density is essential for many aspects of aerosol science. Yet, density is often characterized poorly and incompletely for internally mixed particles, particularly for dry particles, with previous studies focused primarily on deliquescent (aqueous) drop- lets. Instead, densities for dry internally mixed particles are often inferred from mass composition measurements in combination with predictive models assuming ideal mixing, with the accuracy of such models not estimated. We determined particle densities from mobility diameter measurements (using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, SMPS) for dried particles classified by their aerodynamic size (using an Aerosol Aerodynamic Classifier, AAC) for a range of two-component organic-inorganic particles containing known proportions of organic and inorganic species. We examined all permutations of mixing between four different organic (water soluble nigrosin dye, citric acid, polyethylene glycol-400, and ascorbic acid) and three different inorganic (sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and sodium nitrate) species. The accuracy and precision in our measured particle densities were ~5% and ~1%, respectively, for nonvolatile particles. Substantial deviations in particle density from ideal mixing (up to 20%) were observed. We tested descriptions of the non-ideal mixing for our systems by representing the volume change of mixing using Redlich-Kister (RK) polynomials in terms of mass fraction or in terms of mole fraction, with both approaches performing similarly.","Informa UK Limited","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Heat has been widely used as a tracer to infer steady-state flow velocities using analytical solutions of heat transport defined by the diurnal temperature signals. Under sub-daily dynamic flow conditions, however, such analytical solutions are not applicable due to the violation of fundamental assumptions. In this study, we developed a data assimilation–based approach to estimate the sub-daily flux under highly dynamic flow conditions using multi-depth temperature observations in high temporal resolution. If the hydraulic gradient is measured, Darcy’s law was used to calculate the flux with permeability estimated from temperature responses below the riverbed using data assimilation method. Otherwise, flux was estimated directly by assimilating multi-depth temperature data at hourly time interval on the basis of one-directional flow and heat transport governing equation. Overall, our synthetic analysis showed that both schemes have robust performance in estimating fluxes under highly dynamic flow conditions. Data assimilation-based flux estimation method was able to capture the vertical sub-daily fluxes with sufficient accuracy using multi-depth high-resolution temperature data alone, even in the presence of multi-dimensional flow. This approach has been successfully applied to real field temperature data collected at the Hanford site that experiences highly dynamic HEFs. Our study shows the promise of adopting distributed 1-D temperature monitoring to capture spatial and temporal exchange dynamics in river corridors at a watershed scale or beyond.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluating Basin-Scale Forest Adaptation Scenarios: Wildfire, Streamflow, Biomass, and Economic Recovery Synergies and Trade-Offs","Povak, Nicholas A.; Furniss, Tucker J.; Hessburg, Paul F.; Salter, R. Brion; Wigmosta, Mark; Duan, Zhuoran; LeFevre, Miles","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Active forest management is applied in many parts of the western United States to reduce wildfire severity, mitigate vulnerability to drought and bark beetle mortality, and more recently, to increase snow retention and late-season streamflow. A rapidly warming climate accelerates the need for these restorative treatments, but the treatment priority among forest patches varies considerably. We simulated four treatment scenarios across the 3,450 km<sup>2</sup> Wenatchee River basin in eastern Washington, United States. We used a decision support tool (DST) to assess trade-offs and synergies within and among treatments on wildfire risk and smoke emissions, water yield and snow retention, biomass production, and economic return. Treatment scenarios emphasized prescribed burning (BurnOnly), biomass production (MaxBiomass), gap-based thinning to optimize water yield (IdealWater), and a principle-based restoration scenario (RA1). Fire hazard, smoke emissions, and biomass production metrics were evaluated across scenarios using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and water yields were modeled using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model. Simulations were summarized to both patch- (10<sup>1</sup>–10<sup>2</sup> ha) and subwatershed- (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> ha) scales, and treatment effects were evaluated against an untreated baseline landscape. We used logic models to rank effect sizes by scenario across metrics along a continuum between -1 (no or weak effect) to +1 (large effect). All treatments produced benefits across one or more ecosystem services and led to synergistic benefits to water yield and wildfire hazard reduction. Tradeoffs among resource benefits were clear in wilderness where reliance on prescribed burning without mechanical treatment increased costs and eliminated the potential for biomass recovery. The BurnOnly scenario improved fire risk metrics and streamflow, but effect sizes were lower compared to other treatments. IdealWater showed the strongest benefits overall, demonstrating the ability to capture multiple resource benefits through spatially explicit thinning. Our study provides a framework for integrating strategic and tactical models that evaluate tradeoffs and synergies gained through varied management approaches. We demonstrate the utility of decision support modeling to enhance management synergies across large landscapes.","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We demonstrate this importance through an in-depth examination of a ten-year eddy covariance dataset from a corn–corn–soybean crop rotation grown in the Midwest United States. Ten-year average annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) showed a net C sink of –0.39 Mg C ha<sup>–1</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>. However, NEE in 2014 and 2015 from the corn ecosystem was 3.58 and 2.56 Mg C ha<sup>–1</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>, respectively. Most C loss occurred during the growing season, when photosynthesis should dominate and C fluxes should reflect a net ecosystem gain. Partitioning NEE into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) showed this C 'burp' was driven by higher ER, with a 51% (2014) and 57% (2015) increase from the ten-year average (15.84 Mg C ha<sup>–1</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>). GPP was also higher than average (16.24 Mg C ha<sup>–1</sup> yr<sup>–1</sup>) by 25% (2014) and 37% (2015), but this was not enough to offset the C emitted from ER. This increased ER was likely driven by enhanced soil microbial respiration associated with ideal growing season climate, substrate availability, nutrient additions, and a potential legacy effect from drought.","IOP Publishing","","Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-04-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research Letters; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 054029","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 1748-9326","10.1088/1748-9326/ac661a","","2022-07-07T00:00:00Z","1865174","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865174","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865174","Environmental Research Letters","5","17"
"The effects of bias, drift, and trends in calculating anomalies for evaluating skill of seasonal-to-decadal initialized climate predictions","Meehl, Gerald A.; Teng, Haiyan; Smith, Doug; Yeager, Stephen; Merryfield, William; Doblas-Reyes, Francisco; Glanville, Anne A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Decadal prediction; Anomaly calculation; Prediction skill; Model error","In initialized seasonal to decadal (S2D) predictions, model hindcasts rapidly drift away from the initial observed state and converge toward a preferred state characterized by systematic error, or bias. Bias and drift are among the greatest challenges facing initialized prediction today. Differences in trends between initial states and drifted states, combined with bias and drift, introduce complexities in calculating anomalies to assess skill of initialized predictions. We examine several methods of calculating anomalies using the Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE) using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) initialized hindcasts and focus on Pacific and Atlantic SSTs to illustrate issues with anomaly calculations. Three methods of computing anomalies, one as differences from a long term model climatology, another as bias-adjusted differences from the previous 15 year average from observations, and a third as differences from the previous 15 year average from the model, are contrasted and each is shown to have limitations. For the first, trends in bias and drift introduce higher skill estimates earlier and later in the hindcast period due to the trends that contribute to skill. For the second, higher skill can be introduced in situations where low frequency variability in the observations is large compared to the hindcasts on timescales greater than 15 years, while lower skill can result if the predicted signal is small and the bias-correction itself produces a transition of SST anomalies to the opposite sign of those that are observed. The third method has somewhat lower skill compared to each of the others, but has less difficulties with not only the long term trends in the model climatology, but also with the unrealistic situational skill from using observations as a reference. However, the first 15 years of the hindcast period cannot be evaluated due to having to wait to accumulate the previous 15 year model climatology before the method can be applied. Here, the IPO transition in the 2014–2016 time frame from negative to positive (predicted by Meehl et al. in in Nat Commun, 10.1038/NCOMMS11718, 2016) did indeed verify using all three methods, though each provides somewhat different skill values as a result of the respective limitations. There is no clear best method, as all are roughly comparable, and each has its own set of limitations and caveats. However, all three methods show generally higher overall skill in the AMO region compared to the IPO region.","Springer-Verlag","","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-04-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Climate Dynamics; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 11-12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3373-3389","","","SC0022070","Journal ID: ISSN 0930-7575","10.1007/s00382-022-06272-7","","2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","1891517","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1891517","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1891517","Climate Dynamics","11-12","59"

Aerosol hygroscopic growth plays an important role in atmospheric particle chemistry and the effects of aerosol on radiation and hence climate. The hygroscopic growth is often characterized by a growth factor probability density function (GF-PDF), where the growth factor is defined as the ratio of the particle size at a specified relative humidity to its dry size. Parametric, least-squares methods are the most widely used algorithms for inverting the GF-PDF from measurements of the humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) and have been recently applied to the GF-PDF inversion from measurements of the humidity-controlled fast integrated mobility spectrometer (HFIMS). However, these least-squares methods suffer from noise amplification due to the lack of regularization in solving the ill-posed problem, resulting in significant fluctuations in the retrieved GF-PDF and even occasional failures of convergence. In this study, we introduce nonparametric, regularized methods to invert the aerosol GF-PDF and apply them to HFIMS measurements. Based on the HFIMS kernel function, the forward convolution is transformed into a matrix-based form, which facilitates the application of the nonparametric inversion methods with regularizations, including Tikhonov regularization and Twomey's iterative regularization. Inversions of the GF-PDF using the nonparameteric methods with regularization are demonstrated using HFIMS measurements simulated from representative GF-PDFs of ambient aerosols. The characteristics of reconstructed GF-PDFs resulting from different inversion methods, including previously developed least-squares methods, are quantitatively compared. The result shows that Twomey's method generally outperforms other inversion methods. The capabilities of Twomey's method in reconstructing the pre-defined GF-PDFs and recovering the mode parameters are validated.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Specifically, we assess the relationship between printed local newspapers and water quality violations in communities as well as the influence of social, political, and economic factors on the coverage of drinking water quality issues. Results suggest that the volume and/or frequency of local drinking water violations is not directly reflected in local news coverage. Additionally, news coverage varied across sociodemographic features, with a negative relationship between Hispanic populations and news coverage of Lead and Copper Rule, and a positive relationship among non-Hispanic white populations.

"Classification of Wetland Vegetation Based on NDVI Time Series from the HLS Dataset","Ju, Yang; Bohrer, Gil (ORCID:0000000292099540)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; HLS data; Lake Erie; NDVI; vegetation classification","<p>Natural wetlands are intrinsically heterogeneous and typically composed of a mosaic of ecosystem patches with different vegetation types. Hydrological and biogeochemical processes in wetlands vary strongly among these ecosystem patches. To date, most remote sensing classification approaches for wetland vegetation either rely on coarse images that cannot capture the spatial variability of wetland vegetation or rely on very-high-resolution multi-spectral images that are detailed but very sporadic in time (less than once per year). This study aimed to use NDVI time series, generated from NASA’s HLS dataset, to classify vegetation patches. We demonstrate our approach at a temperate, coastal lake, estuarine marsh. To classify vegetation patches, a standard time series library of the four land-cover patch types was built from referencing specific locations that were identified as “pure” pixels. These were identified using a single-time high-resolution image. We calculated the distance between the HLS-NDVI time series at each pixel and the “pure”-pixel standards for each land-cover type. The resulting true-positive classified rate was >73% for all patch types other than water lily. The classification accuracy was higher in pixels of a more uniform composition. A set of vegetation maps was created for the years 2016 to 2020 at our research site to identify the vegetation changes at the site as it is affected by rapid water elevation increases in Lake Erie. Our results reveal how changes in water elevation have changed the patch distribution in significant ways, leading to the local extinction of cattail by 2019 and a continuous increase in the area cover of water lily patches.</p>","MDPI AG","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","Switzerland","2022-04-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Remote Sensing Journal Volume: 14 Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 2107","","","SC0022191, DE-SC0021067; SC0021067; SC0022191","Journal ID: ISSN 2072-4292; PII: rs14092107","10.3390/rs14092107","","2022-04-29T00:00:00Z","1865491","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865491","","Remote Sensing","9","14"

Laboratory studies of pure cultures have highlighted that the availability of Cu, required for the multicopper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase, can limit N2O reduction. However, in natural aquatic systems, such as wetlands and hyporheic zones in stream beds, the role of Cu in controlling denitrification remains incompletely understood. In this study, we collected soils and sediments from three natural environments -- riparian wetlands, marsh wetlands, and a stream -- to investigate their nitrogen species transformation activity at background Cu levels and different supplemented Cu loadings. All of the systems contained solid-phase associated Cu below or around geological levels (40 - 280 nmol g-1) and exhibited low dissolved Cu (3-50 nM), which made them appropriate sites for evaluating the effect of limited Cu availability on denitrification. In laboratory incubation experiments, high concentrations of N2O accumulated in all microcosms lacking Cu amendment except for one stream sediment sample. With Cu added to provide dissolved concentrations at trace levels (10-300 nM), reduction rate of N2O to N<sub>2</sub> in the wetland soils and stream sediments was enhanced. A kinetic model could account for the trends in nitrogen species by combining the reactions for microbial reduction of NO<sub>3</sub>- to NO<sub>2</sub>-/N<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub> and abiotic reduction of NO<sub>2</sub>- to N<sub>2</sub>. The model revealed that the rate of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> conversion increased significantly in the presence of Cu.

"Using Machine Learning Algorithm to Detect Blowing Snow and Fog in Antarctica Based on Ceilometer and Surface Meteorology Systems","Ye, Jin; Liu, Lei; Wu, Yi; Yang, Wanying; Ren, Hong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; blowing snow; fog; ceilometer; surface meteorology systems","Blowing snow is a common weather phenomenon in Antarctica and plays an important role in the water vapor cycle and ice sheet mass balance. Although it has a significant impact on the climate of Antarctica, people do not know much about this process. Fog events are difficult to distinguish from blowing snow events using existing detection algorithms by a ceilometer. In this study, based on ceilometer, the meteorological parameters observed by surface meteorology systems are further combined to detect blowing snow and fog using the AdaBoost algorithm. The weather phenomena recorded by human observers are ‘true’. The dataset is collected from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 at the AWARE site. Among them, three-quarters of the data are used as the training set and the rest of the data as the testing set. The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm for the testing set is about 94%. Compared with the Loeb method, the proposed algorithm can detect 89.12% of blowing snow events and 76.10% of fog events, while the Loeb method can only identify 64.29% of blowing snow events and 31.87% of fog events.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Dust and bioparticles are two important sources of INPs that have markedly different atmospheric loadings and ice nucleating efficiencies. In situ identification of the sources of INPs in clouds has been accomplished using single particle mass spectrometry (SPMS). However, external mixtures of dust and bioparticles present a unique challenge as they have overlapping mass spectral ion signatures, complicating their unambiguous identification. This study presents a detailed discussion of dust and bioparticle SPMS signatures, uniting data from a broad array of studies. As emphasized, the ion signals from both dust and bioparticles are highly sensitive to ionization conditions. To understand the observed variations, we characterize the mass spectral dependence of distinct dust and bioparticle samples using total positive ion intensity (TPII) as an indicator of the laser pulse energy each particle encountered. Through this analysis, a broad range of characteristic biogenic low intensity ion peaks that may be useful to distinguish bioparticles from dust became apparent and are highlighted. Insights informed by this analysis were utilized to identify bioparticles in ambient SPMS data. Ambient particles exhibiting both dust and characteristic biogenic spectral fingerprints were excluded from the bioparticle classification. Although bioparticles only made up 0.2% of all sampled particles, their abundance was moderately correlated with INP concentrations measured at 15 °C.","American Association for Aerosol Research","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Though radioactive decay and triboelectrification can induce charging, it is typically assumed that the aerosols in a radioactive plume will not carry significant charge at steady state since atmospheric particles can have their charge neutralized through the capture of adjacent counter-ions (i.e., diffusion charging). Here to assess this assumption, we directly measured the surface charge and charge density of various triboelectrically charged aerosols including radioactive uranium oxide (<1 μm), urban dust, Arizona desert dust, hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica nanoparticles, and graphene oxide powders using an electric field-assisted particle levitator in air. Of these particles, uranium oxide aerosols exhibited the highest surface charge density. Charge balance equations were employed to predict the average charge gained from radioactive decay as a function of time and to evaluate the effects of diffusion charging on triboelectrically charged radioactive and non-radioactive particles in the atmosphere. Simulation results show that particles, initially charged through triboelectrification, can be quickly discharged by diffusion charging in the absence of radioactive decay. Nevertheless, simulation results also indicate that particles can be strongly charged when they carry radionuclides. These experimental and simulation results suggest that radioactive decay can induce strong particle charging that may potentially affect atmospheric transport of airborne radionuclides.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Hypothesized environmental conditions are thought to be related to small warm cloud residence time and warm rain growth suppression, which lead to high cloud liquid water contents in the mixed-phase zone, contributing to positive charging of graupel and anomalous charge structure storms. Data from radiosondes, a cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) ground-based instrument and reanalysis were used to characterize the proximity inflow air of storms with anomalous and normal charge structures. Consistent with the initial hypothesis, anomalous storms had small warm cloud depth caused by dry low-level humidity and low 0°C height. Anomalous storms were associated with lower CCN concentrations than normal storms, an opposite result to the initial expectation. High CAPE is not an important condition for the development of anomalous storms in Argentina, as no clear pattern could be found among the different parameters calculated for updraft proxy that would be consistent with the initial hypothesis.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Formation of atmospheric ice plays a crucial role in the microphysical evolution of mixed-phase and cirrus clouds and thus climate. How aerosol particles impact ice crystal formation by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is a subject of intense research activities. To improve understanding of atmospheric INPs, we examined daytime and nighttime particles collected during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) field campaign conducted in summer 2017. Collected particles, representative of a remote marine environment, were investigated for their propensity to serve as INPs in the immersion freezing (IMF) and deposition ice nucleation (DIN) modes. The particle population was characterized by chemical imaging techniques such as computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (CCSEM/EDX) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy with near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (STXM/NEXAFS). Four major particle-type classes were identified where internally mixed inorganic–organic particles make up the majority of the analyzed particles. Following ice nucleation experiments, individual INPs were identified and characterized by SEM/EDX. The identified INP types belong to the major particle-type classes consisting of fresh sea salt with organics or processed sea salt containing dust and sulfur with organics. Ice nucleation experiments show IMF events at temperatures as low as 231 K, including the subsaturated regime. DIN events were observed at lower temperatures of 210 to 231 K. IMF and DIN observations were analyzed with regard to activated INP fraction, ice-nucleation active site (INAS) densities, and a water activity-based immersion freezing model (ABIFM) yielding heterogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficients. Observed IMF and DIN events of ice formation and corresponding derived freezing rates demonstrate that the marine boundary layer aerosol particles can serve as INPs under typical mixed-phase and cirrus cloud conditions. The derived IMF and DIN parameterizations allow for implementation in cloud and climate models to evaluate predictive effects of atmospheric ice crystal formation.","Copernicus GmbH","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States); Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States); Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we first present a new entrainment–mixing parameterization that uses the grid mean relative humidity without requiring the relative humidity of the entrained air. Then, the parameterization is implemented in a microphysics scheme in a large eddy simulation model, and sensitivity experiments are conducted to compare the new parameterization with the default homogeneous entrainment–mixing parameterization. The results indicate that the new entrainment–mixing parameterization has a larger impact on the number concentration, volume mean radius, and cloud optical depth in the stratocumulus case than in the cumulus case. This is because inhomogeneous and homogeneous mixing mechanisms dominate in the stratocumulus and cumulus cases, respectively, which is mainly due to the larger turbulence dissipation rate in the cumulus case. Because stratocumulus clouds break up during the dissipation stage to form cumulus clouds, the effects of this new entrainment–mixing parameterization during the stratocumulus dissipation stage are between those during the stratocumulus mature stage and the cumulus case. A large aerosol concentration can enhance the effects of this new entrainment–mixing parameterization by decreasing the cloud droplet size and evaporation timescale. The results of this new entrainment–mixing parameterization with grid mean relative humidity are validated by the use of a different entrainment–mixing parameterization that uses parameterized entrained air properties. This study sheds new light on the improvement of entrainment–mixing parameterizations in models.","Copernicus GmbH","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Emergence of a nocturnal low-level jet from a broad baroclinic zone","Shapiro, Alan; Gebauer, Joshua G.; Parsons, David B.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","An analytical model is presented for the generation of a Blackadar-like nocturnal low-level jet in a broad baroclinic zone. The flow is forced from below (flat ground) by a surface buoyancy gradient and from above (free atmosphere) by a constant pressure gradient force. Diurnally-varying mixing coefficients are specified to increase abruptly at sunrise and decrease abruptly at sunset. With attention restricted to a surface buoyancy that varies linearly with a horizontal coordinate, the Boussinesq-approximated equations of motion, thermal energy, and mass conservation reduce to a system of one-dimensional equations that can be solved analytically. Sensitivity tests with southerly jets suggest that (i) stronger jets are associated with larger decreases of the eddy viscosity at sunset (as in Blackadar theory), (ii) the nighttime surface buoyancy gradient has little impact on jet strength, and (iii) for pure baroclinic forcing (no free-atmosphere geostrophic wind), the nighttime eddy diffusivity has little impact on jet strength, but the daytime eddy diffusivity is very important and has a larger impact than the daytime eddy viscosity. The model was applied to a jet that developed in fair weather conditions over the Great Plains from southern Texas to northern South Dakota on 1 May 2020. The ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) for the afternoon prior to jet formation showed that a broad north-south-oriented baroclinic zone covered much of the region. The peak model-predicted winds were in good agreement with ERA5 winds and lidar data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) central facility in north-central Oklahoma.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Water quality can be affected by multiple stressors including population growth, land use change, global warming, and extreme events, with repercussions on human and ecosystem health. A scientific understanding of factors affecting riverine water quality and predictions at local to regional scales, and at sub-daily to decadal timescales are needed for optimal management of watersheds and river basins. Here, we discuss how machine learning (ML) can enable development of more accurate, computationally tractable, and scalable models for analysis and predictions of river water quality. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of ML for water quality models and discuss opportunities to improve the use of ML with emerging computational and mathematical methods for model selection, hyperparameter optimization, incorporating process knowledge into ML models, improving explainablity, uncertainty quantification, and model-data integration. We then present considerations for using ML to address water quality problems given their scale and complexity, available data and computational resources, and stakeholder needs. When combined with decades of process understanding, interdisciplinary advances in knowledge-guided ML, information theory, data integration, and analytics can help address fundamental science questions and enable decision-relevant predictions of riverine water quality.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

During the study, episodes of significant DO variations (~+/- 4 mg/l) were observed, with minor variation in other parameters (e.g., <~+/-0.15 mg/l NO <sub>3</sub> ). DO concentrations were related to hydraulic head gradients, showing both hysteretic and non-hysteretic relationships with abrupt (hours) transitions between the two types of relationships. The observed relationships provide a number of hypotheses related to the integrated hydrology and biogeochemistry of dynamic hyporheic zones. We suggest that preliminary high-frequency monitoring is advantageous in guiding the design of long term monitoring campaigns.

There is proof-of-concept for leaf hyperspectral reflectance as a rapid method to model photosynthetic traits. However, the crucial step of demonstrating that hyperspectral approaches can be used to advance understanding of the genetic architecture of photosynthetic traits is untested. To address this challenge, we used full-range (500–2,400 nm) leaf reflectance spectroscopy to build partial least squares regression models to estimate leaf traits, including the rate-limiting processes of photosynthesis, maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate, and maximum electron transport. In total, 11 models were produced from a diverse population of soybean sampled over multiple field seasons to estimate photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll content, leaf carbon and leaf nitrogen percentage, and specific leaf area (with R<sup>2</sup> from 0.56 to 0.96 and root mean square error approximately &lt;10% of the range of calibration data). We explore the utility of these models by applying them to the soybean nested association mapping population, which showed variability in photosynthetic and leaf traits. Genetic mapping provided insights into the underlying genetic architecture of photosynthetic traits and potential improvement in soybean. Notably, the maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate mapped to a region of chromosome 19 containing genes encoding multiple small subunits of Rubisco. We also mapped the maximum electron transport rate to a region of chromosome 10 containing a fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase gene, encoding an important enzyme in the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and the sucrose biosynthetic pathway. The estimated rate-limiting steps of photosynthesis were low or negatively correlated with yield suggesting that these traits are not influenced by the same genetic mechanisms and are not limiting yield in the soybean NAM population. Leaf carbon percentage, leaf nitrogen percentage, and specific leaf area showed strong correlations with yield and may be of interest in breeding programs as a proxy for yield. This work is among the first to use hyperspectral reflectance to model and map the genetic architecture of the rate-limiting steps of photosynthesis.","Oxford University Press; Genetics Society of America","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Assessment of the sea surface temperature diurnal cycle in CNRM-CM6-1 based on its 1D coupled configuration","Voldoire, Aurore; Roehrig, Romain; Giordani, Hervé; Waldman, Robin; Zhang, Yunyan; Xie, Shaocheng; Bouin, Marie-Nöelle","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","A single-column version of the CNRM-CM6-1 global climate model has been developed to ease development and validation of the boundary layer physics and air–sea coupling in a simplified environment. This framework is then used to assess the ability of the coupled model to represent the sea surface temperature (SST) diurnal cycle. To this aim, the atmospheric–ocean single-column model (AOSCM), called CNRM-CM6-1D, is implemented in a case study derived from the CINDY2011/DYNAMO campaign over the Indian Ocean, where large diurnal SST variabilities have been well documented. Comparing the AOSCM and its uncoupled components (atmospheric SCM and oceanic SCM, called OSCM) highlights the fact that the impact of coupling in the atmosphere results from both the possibility to take into account the diurnal variability of SST, which is not usually available in forcing products, and the change in mean state SST as simulated by the OSCM, with the ocean mean state not being heavily impacted by the coupling. This suggests that coupling feedbacks in the 3D model do not arise from the coupling of ocean and atmosphere vertical column physics but are more due to the large-scale dynamics resolved by the 3D model. Additionally, a sub-daily coupling frequency is needed to represent the SST diurnal variability, but the choice of the coupling time step between 15 min and 3 h does not impact the diurnal temperature range simulated much. The main drawback of a 3 h coupling is delaying the SST diurnal cycle by 5 h in asynchronous coupled models. Overall, the diurnal SST variability is reasonably well represented in CNRM-CM6-1 with a 1 h coupling time step and the upper-ocean model resolution of 1 m. This framework is shown to be a very valuable tool to develop and validate the boundary layer physics and the coupling interface. It highlights the interest to develop other atmosphere–ocean coupling case studies.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

REE concentrations are typically low, but manufactured devices include only the desired REE, avoiding the “REE balance problem” that besets natural ores. Fewer REEs need to be separated, as compared to separation of the entire lanthanide series. Co-recovery of precious (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt) or base metals (e.g., Cu, Sn, Zn) from e-wastes can offset recycling costs.

The ability to monitor, understand, and predict the dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle requires the capacity to robustly and coherently synthesize multiple streams of information that each provide partial information about different pools and fluxes. In this study, we introduce a new terrestrial carbon cycle data assimilation system, built on the PEcAn model–data eco-informatics system, and its application for the development of a proof-of-concept carbon “reanalysis” product that harmonizes carbon pools (leaf, wood, soil) and fluxes (GPP, Ra, Rh, NEE) across the contiguous United States from 1986–2019. We first calibrated this system against plant trait and flux tower net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using a novel emulated hierarchical Bayesian approach. Next, we extended the Tobit–Wishart ensemble filter (TWEnF) state data assimilation (SDA) framework, a generalization of the common ensemble Kalman filter which accounts for censored data and provides a fully Bayesian estimate of model process error, to a regional-scale system with a calibrated localization. Combined with additional workflows for propagating parameter, initial condition, and driver uncertainty, this represents the most complete and robust uncertainty accounting available for terrestrial carbon models. Our initial reanalysis was run on an irregular grid of ∼ 500 points selected using a stratified sampling method to efficiently capture environmental heterogeneity. Remotely sensed observations of aboveground biomass (Landsat LandTrendr) and leaf area index (LAI) (MODIS MOD15) were sequentially assimilated into the SIPNET model. Reanalysis soil carbon, which was indirectly constrained based on modeled covariances, showed general agreement with SoilGrids, an independent soil carbon data product. Reanalysis NEE, which was constrained based on posterior ensemble weights, also showed good agreement with eddy flux tower NEE and reduced root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the calibrated forecast. Ultimately, PEcAn's new open-source regional data assimilation framework provides a scalable workflow for harmonizing multiple data constraints and providing a uniform synthetic platform for carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) as well as accelerating terrestrial carbon cycle research.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols in E3SMv1: historical changes, causality, decomposition, and parameterization sensitivities","Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Wentao; Wan, Hui; Rasch, Philip J.; Ghan, Steven J.; Easter, Richard C.; Shi, Xiangjun; Wang, Yong; Wang, Hailong; Ma, Po-Lun; Zhang, Shixuan; Sun, Jian; Burrows, Susannah; Shrivastava, Manish; Singh, Balwinder; Qian, Yun; Liu, Xiaohong; Golaz, Jean-Christophe; Tang, Qi; Zheng, Xue; Xie, Shaocheng; Lin, Wuyin; Feng, Yan; Wang, Minghuai; Yoon, Jin-Ho; Leung, Ruby L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols (ERF<sub>aer</sub>) is an important measure of the anthropogenic aerosol effects simulated by a global climate model. Here we analyze ERF<sub>aer</sub> simulated by the E3SMv1 atmosphere model using both century-long free-running atmosphere-land simulations and short nudged simulations. We relate the simulated ERF<sub>aer </sub>to characteristics of the aerosol composition and optical properties, and evaluate the relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties. In terms of historical changes from the year 1870 to 2014, our results show that the global mean anthropogenic aerosol burden and optical depth increase during the simulation period as expected, but the regional averages show large differences in the temporal evolution. The largest regional differences are found in the emission-induced evolution of the burden and optical depth of the sulfate aerosol: a strong decreasing trend is seen in the Northern Hemisphere high-latitude region after around 1970, while a continued increase is simulated in the tropics. Consequently, although the global mean anthropogenic aerosol burden and optical depth increase from 1870 to 2014, the ERF<sub>aer</sub> magnitude does not increase after around year 1970. The relationships between key aerosol and cloud properties (relative changes between preindustrial and present-day conditions) also show evident changes after 1970, diverging from the linear relationships exhibited for the period from 1870 to 2014. The ERF<sub>aer</sub> in E3SMv1 is relatively large compared to the recently published multi-model estimates; the primary reason is the large indirect aerosol effect (i.e., through aerosol-cloud interactions). Compared to other models, E3SMv1 features a stronger sensitivity of the cloud droplet effective radius to changes in the cloud droplet number concentration. Large sensitivity is also seen in the liquid cloud optical depth, which is determined by changes in both the effective radius and liquid water path. Aerosol-induced changes in liquid and ice cloud properties in E3SMv1 are found to have a strong correlation, as the evolution of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols affects both the liquid cloud formation and the homogeneous ice nucleation in cirrus clouds. The ERF<sub>aer</sub> estimates in E3SMv1 for the shortwave and longwave components are sensitive to the parameterization changes in both liquid and ice cloud processes. When the parameterization of ice cloud processes is modified, the top-of-atmosphere forcing changes in the shortwave and longwave components largely offset each other, so the net effect is negligible. This suggests that, to reduce the magnitude of the net ERF<sub>aer</sub>, it would be more effective to reduce the anthropogenic aerosol effect through liquid or mixed-phase clouds.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Using an Explainable Machine Learning Approach to Characterize Earth System Model Errors: Application of SHAP Analysis to Modeling Lightning Flash Occurrence","Silva, Sam J.; Keller, Christoph A.; Hardin, Joseph","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Computational models of the Earth System are critical tools for modern scientific inquiry. Efforts toward evaluating and improving errors in representations of physical and chemical processes in these large computational systems are commonly stymied by highly nonlinear and complex error behavior. Recent work has shown that these errors can be effectively predicted using modern Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) techniques. In this work, we go beyond these previous studies to apply an interpretable A.I. technique to not only predict model errors but also move toward understanding the underlying reasons for successful error prediction. We use XGBoost classification trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to explore the errors in the prediction of lightning occurrence in the NASA GEOS model, a widely used Earth System Model. This interpretable error prediction system can effectively predict the model error and indicates that the errors are strongly related to convective processes and the characteristics of the land surface.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, whether and to what extent does ALAN affect plant phenology, a critical factor influencing the timing of terrestrial ecosystem processes, remains unexplored due to limited ALAN observation. Here, we used the Black Marble ALAN product and phenology observations from USA National Phenology Network to investigate the impact of ALAN on deciduous woody plants phenology in the conterminous United States. We found that (1) ALAN significantly advanced the date of breaking leaf buds by 8.9 ± 6.9 days (mean ± SD) and delayed the coloring of leaves by 6.0 ± 11.9 days on average; (2) the magnitude of phenological changes was significantly correlated with the intensity of ALAN (P &lt; 0.001); and (3) there was an interaction between ALAN and temperature on the coloring of leaves, but not on breaking leaf buds. We further showed that under future climate warming scenarios, ALAN will accelerate the advance in breaking leaf buds but exert a more complex effect on the coloring of leaves. This study suggests intensified ALAN may have far-reaching but underappreciated consequences in disrupting key ecosystem functions and services, which requires an interdisciplinary approach to investigate. Developing lighting strategies that minimize the impact of ALAN on ecosystems, especially those embedded and surrounding major cities, is challenging but must be pursued.","Oxford University Press","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this work, a feature tracking algorithm is used to identify precipitation from mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), isolated deep convection (IDC), and non-convective systems (NC). Overall, urbanization suppresses all three types of precipitation in the MAR by reducing water vapor content and convective available potential energy, while irrigation enhances IDC and NC precipitation but suppresses MCS precipitation. Examination of the MCS and IDC initiation locations indicates that irrigation suppresses MAR precipitation that is produced by MCSs initiated in the Great Plains and Midwest (GP) but enhances MAR precipitation from MCSs initiated locally within the region. Irrigation induces a mid-level cyclonic circulation anomaly centering in the Southeast, hindering the eastward propagation and development of MCSs from the GP.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We specifically focus on the difference between the models that directly resolve convection and those using convection parameterization. The 40-day hindcast experiments of the DYnamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non-hydrostatic Domain (DYAMOND) intercomparison project are evaluated against the high-resolution satellite rainfall products. The hindcast of the Central Weather Bureau Global Forecast System (CWBGFS) under the DYAMOND protocol is also included. The results indicate that most models simulate insufficient numbers of large precipitation system [object-based precipitation system (OPS), > 370 km in scale], indicating weaker convection organization. The observation indicates that the maximum precipitation within the OPS intensifies with increasing object size. All of the models capture this positive relationship, but most of them overestimate the sensitivity. Most of the models overestimate both the frequency and intensity of small OPS (< 160 km), except for the models with convection parameterization [i.e., CWBGFS, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS)-9 km]. Although most of the models can reproduce the observed peak time of diurnal precipitation over the land area in the Maritime Continent, the simulated fractional contribution of different sizes of OPS to the total precipitation varies from model to model, and their peak times do not follow the observed ones with delayed peak times as the size of OPS increases from small, mid-size, to large categories. Most of the models reasonably capture the mean diurnal cycle peak time, but only the models with convection parameterization and Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) can represent the diurnal evolution of fractional contribution from different OPSs. The implications of the current results to the upscale processes of the tropical convection systems in the global models are also discussed.","Meteorological Society of Japan","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"High temporal resolution estimates of Arctic snowfall rates emphasizing gauge and radar-based retrievals from the MOSAiC expedition","Matrosov, Sergey Y.; Shupe, Matthew D.; Uttal, Taneil","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; MOSAiC; cloud radar; snowfall","This article presents the results of snowfall rate and accumulation estimates from a vertically pointing 35-GHz radar and other sensors deployed during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. The radar-based retrievals are the most consistent in terms of data availability and are largely immune to blowing snow. The total liquid-equivalent accumulation during the snow accumulation season is around 110 mm, with more abundant precipitation during spring months. About half of the total accumulation came from weak snowfall with rates less than approximately 0.2 mmh–1. The total snowfall estimates from a Vaisala optical sensor aboard the icebreaker are similar to those from radar retrievals, though their daily and monthly accumulations and instantaneous rates varied significantly. Compared to radar retrievals and the icebreaker optical sensor data, measurements from an identical optical sensor at an ice camp are biased high. Blowing snow effects, in part, explain differences. Weighing gauge measurements significantly overestimate snowfall during February–April 2020 as compared to other sensors and are not well suited for estimating instantaneous snowfall rates. The icebreaker optical disdrometer estimates of snowfall rates are, on average, relatively little biased compared to radar retrievals when raw particle counts are available and appropriate snowflake mass-size relations are used. These counts, however, are not available during periods that produced more than a third of the total snowfall. While there are uncertainties in the radar-based retrievals due to the choice of reflectivity-snowfall rate relations, the major error contributor is the uncertainty in the radar absolute calibration. The MOSAiC radar calibration is evaluated using comparisons with other radars and liquid water cloud–drizzle processes observed during summer. Overall, this study describes a consistent, radar-based snowfall rate product for MOSAiC that provides significant insight into Central Arctic snowfall and can be used for many other purposes.","University of California Press","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Laboratory Heat Flux Estimates of Seawater Foam for Low Wind Speeds","Chickadel, C. Chris; Branch, Ruth; Asher, William E.; Jessup, Andrew T.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; seafoam; heat flux; enthalpy; skin temperature; wind","Laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the heat flux from seafoam continuously generated in natural seawater. Using a control volume technique, heat flux was calculated from foam and foam-free surfaces as a function of ambient humidity (ranged from 40% to 78%), air–water temperature difference (ranged from -9 °C to 0 °C), and wind speed (variable up to 3 m s-1). Water-surface skin temperature was imaged with a calibrated thermal infrared camera, and near-surface temperature profiles in the air, water, and foam were recorded. Net heat flux from foam surfaces increased with increasing wind speed and was shown to be up to four times greater than a foam-free surface. The fraction of the total heat flux due to the latent heat flux was observed for foam to be 0.75, with this value being relatively constant with wind speed. In contrast, for a foam-free surface the fraction of the total heat flux due to the latent heat flux decreased at higher wind speeds. Temperature profiles through foam are linear and have larger gradients, which increased with wind speed, while foam free surfaces show the expected logarithmic profile and show no variation with temperature. The radiometric surface temperatures show that foam is cooler and more variable than a foam-free surface, and bubble-resolving thermal images show that radiometrically transparent bubble caps and burst bubbles reveal warm foam below the cool surface layer, contributing to the enhanced variability.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Reconstruction of past fire activity offers paleoenvironmental context for modern and future burning. Pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been increasingly used as a molecular biomarker for fire occurrence in the paleorecord and offer opportunity for nuanced reconstructions of fire characteristics. A suite of PAHs are produced during combustion, and the emission amount and assemblage is influenced by many variables including fuel type, fire temperature, and oxygen availability. Despite recent advances in understanding the controls and taphonomy of these biomass burning markers, the spatial scale of this proxy is unknown. In this paper, measurements of PAH fluxes preserved in a lake sediment archive from the Sierra Nevada, California were compared with a historical geographic information system dataset of area burned up to 150 km distance from the lake to determine the spatial scales for which these biomarkers are reliable proxies of burning. Comparisons of PAH fluxes with charcoal accumulation rates in the same sediments suggest that pyrogenic particulate transport modulates low to mid-molecular weight PAHs via adsorption. Overall, the results indicate that PAH records integrate a combination of spatial signals of area burned and measurement of individual PAHs may enable cross-scale paleofire reconstructions.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the specific mechanisms by which diatoms acclimate to Zn deficiency are poorly understood. Using global proteomic analysis, we identified two proteins (ZCRP-A/B, Zn/Co Responsive Protein A/B) among four diatom species that became abundant under Zn/Co limitation. Characterization using reverse genetic techniques and homology data suggests putative Zn/Co chaperone and membrane-bound transport complex component roles for ZCRP-A (a COG0523 domain protein) and ZCRP-B, respectively. Metaproteomic detection of ZCRPs along a Pacific Ocean transect revealed increased abundances at the surface (<200 m) where dZn and dCo were scarcest, implying Zn nutritional stress in marine algae is more prevalent than previously recognized. These results demonstrate multiple adaptive responses to Zn scarcity in marine diatoms that are deployed in low Zn regions of the Pacific Ocean.","Nature Publishing Group","","J.

For renewable energy sources, including bioenergy, penetrating energy markets depends on lowering prices to compete with the price of fossil sources, but the tools used in decision making, such as supply curves, exclude non-market benefits from ecosystem services. Here, we extend the economic concept of an economic supply curve to account for ecosystem services co-produced with perennial biomass. We developed three new types of supply curves to visualize the increased supply of biomass (‘sustainable supply’) with sufficient water-quality benefits to offset biomass production costs. Using these tools, we show that the value of water-quality improvements could significantly reduce the break-even price of perennial feedstocks if it were available to farmers. In the most optimistic case, nearly half of potential biomass supply in a large tributary of the Mississippi river basin carried water purification value exceeding the cost of biomass production. Furthermore, adding the value to swimmers and waders offset production cost for over 90% of potential supply. Simulated benefits were context specific. For example, total value for water drinkers peaked at an intermediate level of fertilizer application. Geographically, benefits were highest in the eastern portion of the river basin. This research shows where the sustainable supply is needed and can generate value; the next step is to match this supply with credit buyers. Efforts to internalize the values of ecosystem services into biomass prices could help to meet Biden administration targets to meet 100% of sustainable aviation fuels.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Lead chalcogenides are among the most prominent thermoelectric materials, whose performance decreases with an increase in chalcogen amounts (e.g., PbTe>PbSe>PbS). Herein, we demonstrate the simultaneous optimization of the electrical and thermal transport properties of PbS-based compounds by alloying with GeS.

In particular, early-stage CCU technologies must prove their economic viability and environmental reduction potential compared to already-deployed technologies. These comparisons can be misleading, as emerging technologies typically experience a drastic increase in performance and decrease in cost and greenhouse gas emissions as they develop from research to mass-market deployment due to various forms of learning. These changes complicate the interpretation of early techno-economic assessments (TEAs) and life cycle assessments (LCAs) of emerging CCU technologies. The effects of learning over time or cumulative production themselves can be quantitatively described using technology learning curves (TLCs). While learning curve approaches have been developed for various technologies, a harmonized methodology for using TLCs in TEA and LCA for CCU in particular is required. To address this, we describe a methodology that incorporates TLCs into TEA and LCA to forecast the environmental and economic performance of emerging CCU technologies. This methodology is based on both an evaluation of the state of the art of learning curve assessment and a literature review of TLC approaches developed in various manufacturing and energy generation sectors. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement this methodology using a case study on a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mineralization pathway.

We measured stream discharge following sustained cutting of riparian trees (2010–2020) in a native tallgrass prairie (northeastern Kansas, USA). Discharge has declined at this site since the 1980’s despite a concurrent increase in precipitation. This decline has been previously attributed to increased transpiration of stream water by riparian vegetation. We used water stable isotopes (δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H) to determine whether riparian grasses, shrubs, and trees primarily used stream/groundwater or soil water. Additionally, we quantified the increase in riparian and non-riparian woody cover (1978–2020) and combined it with sap-flux data to estimate changes in transpirative water loss. Sustained cutting of riparian trees did not result in increased discharge. Rather than stream/groundwater, the largest proportion of water used by riparian trees (Quercus spp.) was deep soil water. Cornus drummondii (clonal woody shrub) used a higher proportion of stream water and had greater overall variability in water-use. Riparian shrub cover increased about 57% from 1978 to 2020. Over the same time period, shrub cover increased about 20% in areas outside the riparian zone, resulting in an estimated 25% increase in daily transpirative water loss. Although stream water use was less than 50% for all riparian zone species, the total increase in shrub cover on this watershed, coupled with higher transpiration rates of shrubs, suggests that these woody species—within and outside the riparian zone—are key contributors to observed declines in stream flow in this system.","Springer","","Kansas State Univ., Manhattan, KS (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-04-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ecosystems; Journal Volume: 26","","Medium: ED","","","SC0019037","Journal ID: ISSN 1432-9840; NSF 1440484; NSF 1911967; NSF 2024388; DE-SC0019037","10.1007/s10021-022-00756-7","","2023-04-13T00:00:00Z","1865276","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865276","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865276","Ecosystems","","26"

The oilseed Brassica carinata (known as Ethiopian mustard or simply carinata) is a promising SAF feedstock that can be grown as a supplemental cash crop over the winter fallow season of various annual crop rotations in the Southeast US, avoiding land use changes and potentially achieving some of the soil carbon sequestration and ecosystem service benefits of winter cover crops. However, carinata may require more intensive management than traditional cover crops, potentially leading to additional soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased carbon losses from soil tillage and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions from nitrogen fertilizer application. In this work, the 2017 version of the process-based DayCent ecosystem model was used to establish initial expectations for the total regional SAF production potential and associated soil GHG emissions when carinata is integrated as a winter crop into the existing crop rotations across its current suitability range in southern Alabama, southern Georgia, and northern Florida. Using data from academic and industry carinata field trials in the region, DayCent was calibrated to reproduce carinata yield, nitrogen response, harvest index, and biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. The resulting model was then used to simulate the integration of carinata every third winter across all 2.1 Mha of actively cultivated cropland in the study area. The model predicted regional average yields of 2.9–3.0 Mg carinata seed per hectare depending on crop management assumptions. That results in the production of more than two million Mg of carinata seed annually across the study area, enough to supply approximately one billion liters of SAF. Conventional management of carinata led to only modest increases in soil carbon storage that were largely offset by additional N2O emissions. Climate-smart management via adopting no-till carinata establishment or using poultry litter as a nitrogen source resulted in a substantial net soil GHG sink (0.23–0.31 Mg CO<sub>2</sub>e ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, or 0.24–0.32 Mg CO2e per Mg of seed produced) at the farms where carinata is cultivated.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera measurements of over 55,000 solid hydrometeors—obtained during a two-year period from August 2016 to August 2018 at Oliktok Point, Alaska—are analyzed and compared to similar measurements from an earlier experiment at Alta, Utah. In general, distributions of hydrometeor fall speed, fall orientation, aspect ratio, flatness, and complexity (i.e., riming degree) were observed to be very similar between the two locations, except that Arctic hydrometeors tended to be smaller. In total, the slope parameter defining a negative exponential of the size distribution was approximately 50% steeper in the Arctic as at Alta. Sixty-six percent of particles were observed to be rimed or moderately rimed with some suggestion that riming is favored by weak boundary layer stability.

"An evaluation of the E3SMv1 Arctic ocean and sea-ice regionally refined model","Veneziani, Milena; Maslowski, Wieslaw; Lee, Younjoo J.; D'Angelo, Gennaro; Osinski, Robert; Petersen, Mark Roger; Weijer, Wilbert; Craig, Anthony P.; Wolfe, Jonathan David; Comeau, Darin Scott; Turner, Adrian Keith","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is a state-of-the-science Earth system model (ESM) with the ability to focus horizontal resolution of its multiple components in specific areas. Regionally refined global ESMs are motivated by the need to explicitly resolve, rather than parameterize, relevant physics within the regions of refined resolution, while offering significant computational cost savings relative to the respective cost of configurations with high-resolution (HR) everywhere on the globe. In this paper, we document results from the first Arctic regionally refined E3SM configuration for the ocean and sea-ice components (E3SM-Arctic-OSI), while employing data-based atmosphere, land, and hydrology components. Our aim is an improved representation of the Arctic coupled ocean and sea-ice state, its variability and trends, and the exchanges of mass and property fluxes between the Arctic and the sub-Arctic. We find that E3SM-Arctic-OSI increases the realism of simulated Arctic ocean and sea-ice conditions compared to a similar low-resolution E3SM simulation without the Arctic regional refinement in ocean and sea-ice components (E3SM-LR-OSI). In particular, exchanges through the main Arctic gateways are greatly improved with respect to E3SM-LR-OSI. Other aspects, such as the Arctic freshwater content variability and sea-ice trends, are also satisfactorily simulated. Yet, other features, such as the upper-ocean stratification and the sea-ice thickness distribution, need further improvements, involving either more advanced parameterizations, model tuning, or additional grid refinements. Overall, E3SM-Arctic-OSI offers an improved representation of the Arctic system relative to E3SM-LR-OSI, at a fraction (15 %) of the computational cost of comparable global high-resolution configurations, while permitting exchanges with the lower-latitude oceans that cannot be directly accounted for in Arctic regional models.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here we develop methods for assessing trade-offs and synergies between intensification and carbon-sequestering conservation measures in annual crop production landscapes using the DayCent ecosystem model and the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) life-cycle assessment (LCA) model. We compiled county-scaled crop yields, fertilizer application rates, and tillage intensity for a corn-soybean farming case study landscape in the US state of Iowa. Using DayCent, we estimated a baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual rate of 0.29 Mg C ha- 1 y-1 driven by historical increases in crop productivity and reductions in tillage intensity. We then simulated the effects of management interventions targeted toward intensification (stover removal) and SOC sequestration (tillage intensity reduction and winter cover crop addition) individually and in combination. We propose a new multi-product landscape-LCA approach that analyzes marginal changes in corn grain, corn stover, and soybean production from the landscape in terms of their value for biofuel production (corn ethanol, soy biodiesel, and cellulosic ethanol from stover) and associated net displacement of conventional fossil-derived fuel use. This enables us to evaluate both intensification and sequestration effects in common CO2-equivalent mitigation units. We also used DayCentsimulated yields under the different land management scenarios to estimate farm-level costs and revenues. Our results show that intensification via collecting 30% of corn stover for biofuel production would increase the total greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of this landscape by 0.93 Mg CO2e ha- 1 y-1 and provide $49 ha- 1 y-1 of additional net revenue from biomass sales, but would reduce the baseline SOC accumulation rate by approximately 40%. In contrast, integrated approaches that include co-adoption of winter cover cropping and/or tillage intensity reduction would result in increased rates of SOC accumulation above the baseline, achieving simultaneous improvements in both farm profits and the overall GHG mitigation potential of the landscape.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This becomes more challenging for incomplete genomes, and even more so for metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), where misbinning of scaffolds and other losses can occur. Genomic islands (GIs), which integrate into the host chromosome, are a major component of the mobilome. Our GI-detection software TIGER, unique in its precise mapping of GI termini, was applied to 74,561 genomes from 2,473 microbial species, each species containing at least one MAG and one isolate genome. A species-normalized deficit of ~1.6 GIs/genome was measured for MAGs relative to isolates. To test whether this undercount was due to the higher fragmentation of MAG genomes, TIGER was updated to enable detection of split GIs whose termini are on separate scaffolds or that wrap around the origin of a circular replicon. This doubled GI yields, and the new split GIs matched the quality of single-scaffold GIs, except that highly fragmented GIs may lack central portions. Cross-scaffold search is an important upgrade to GI detection as fragmented genomes increasingly dominate public databases. TIGER2 better captures MAG microdiversity, recovering niche-defining GIs and supporting microbiome research aims such as virus-host linking and ecological assessment.","Frontiers Media SA","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Lower functional redundancy in “narrow” than “broad” functions in global soil metagenomics","Chen, Huaihai; Ma, Kayan; Huang, Yu; Fu, Qi; Qiu, Yingbo; Lin, Jiajiang; Schadt, Christopher Warren; Chen, Hao","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Understanding the relationship between soil microbial taxonomic compositions and functional profiles is essential for predicting ecosystem functions under various environmental disturbances. However, even though microbial communities are sensitive to disturbance, ecosystem functions remain relatively stable, as soil microbes are likely to be functionally redundant. Microbial functional redundancy may be more associated with “broad” functions carried out by a wide range of microbes than with “narrow” functions in which specific microorganisms specialize. Thus, a comprehensive study to evaluate how microbial taxonomic compositions correlate with broad and narrow functional profiles is necessary. Here, we evaluated soil metagenomes worldwide to assess whether functional and taxonomic diversities differ significantly between the five broad and the five narrow functions that we chose. Our results revealed that, compared with the five broad functions, soil microbes capable of performing the five narrow functions were more taxonomically diverse, and thus their functional diversity was more dependent on taxonomic diversity, implying lower levels of functional redundancy in narrow functions. Co-occurrence networks indicated that microorganisms conducting broad functions were positively related, but microbes specializing in narrow functions were interacting mostly negatively. Our study provides strong evidence to support our hypothesis that functional redundancy is significantly different between broad and narrow functions in soil microbes, as the association of functional diversity with taxonomy was greater in the five narrow than in the five broad functions.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As the climate continues to warm, reliable future precipitation projections are needed to provide the best possible information to decision makers. However, future changes in the magnitude of extreme precipitation are uncertain, as current state-of-the-art global climate models are typically run at relatively coarse horizontal resolutions that require the use of convective parameterization and have difficulty simulating observed extreme rainfall rates. Here, we performed ensembles of convection-permitting regional climate model simulations to investigate how five historically impactful extreme precipitation events over the San Francisco Bay Area could change if similar events occurred in future climates. We found that changes in storm-total precipitation depend strongly on storm type. Precipitation associated with an atmospheric river (AR) accompanied by an extratropical cyclone (ETC) is projected to increase at a rate exceeding (by up to 1.5 times) the theoretical Clausius Clapeyron scaling of 6–7% per °C warming. On the other hand, future precipitation changes are weak or negative for events characterized by an AR only, despite increases in precipitable water and integrated vapor transport that are similar to those of the co-occurring AR and ETC events. The differences in the sign of future precipitation change between AR-only events and co-occurring AR and ETC events is instead linked with changes in mid-tropospheric vertical velocity. Given that the majority of observed ARs are associated with an ETC, this research has important implications for future precipitation impacts over the Bay Area, as it indicates that storm-total precipitation associated with the most common type of storm event may increase by up to 26–37% in 2100 relative to historical.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Moreover, they have the potential to enable impressive rejections of small neutral solutes from water based on their known ability to separate small organic molecules. CMS has been extensively examined for gas and organic solvent separations, but the transport of organic and aqueous mixtures through CMS microstructures is poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the sorption, diffusion, and permeation behavior of organic compounds and water in poly(vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF)-derived CMS (PVDF-CMS). Experimental observations of diffusion, sorption, and permeation shows how the properties of penetrants such as polarity and molecular size affect the transport rates and selectivity. These basic transport and sorption parameters are utilized in sorption-diffusion models to permeation rates of water-organic mixtures in CMS membranes. The transport of water and p-xylene in CMS was experimentally confirmed to follow the sorption-diffusion mechanism. The sorption-diffusion model ideal permselectivity indicates that the CMS is p-xylene selective over water. Water/p-xylene mixture permeation experiments revealed an increased selectivity of p-xylene over water, thus providing tentative evidence for a competitive sorption-selective separation mechanism. Furthermore, this work suggests that CMS membranes exhibit organic-permeable separation properties in water/organic separations. The results presented here highlight the potential for the removal of dilute organics in water via CMS pervaporation membranes.","Elsevier","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2022-04-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Membrane Science; Journal Volume: 654","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 120495","","","SC0019182","Journal ID: ISSN 0376-7388","10.1016/j.memsci.2022.120495","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1864714","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1864714","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1864714","Journal of Membrane Science","","654"

A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; radar; convection; satellite; remote sensing; doppler","Convective motions and hydrometeors microphysical properties are highly sought-after parameters for evaluating atmospheric numerical models. With most of the Earth's surface covered by water, space-borne Doppler radars are ideal for acquiring such measurements at a global scale. While these systems have proven to be useful tools for retrieving cloud microphysical and dynamical properties from the ground, their adequacy, and specific requirements for spaceborne operation still need to be evaluated. Comprehensive forward simulations enable us to assess the advantages and drawbacks of six different Doppler radar architectures currently planned or under consideration by space agencies for the study of cloud dynamics. Radar performance is examined against state-of-the-art numerical model simulations of well-characterized shallow and deep, continental, and oceanic convective cases. Mean Doppler velocity (MDV) measurements collected at multiple frequencies (13, 35 and 94 GHz) provide complementary information in deep convective cloud systems. The high penetration capability of the 13-GHz radar enables to obtain a complete, albeit horizontally under-sampled, view of deep convective storms. The smaller instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the 35-GHz radar captures more precise information about the location and size of convective updrafts above 5-8 km height of most systems which was determined is the portion of storms where the mass flux peak is typically located. Finally, the lower mean Doppler velocity uncertainty of displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) radars makes them an ideal system for studying microphysics in shallow convection and frontal systems, as well as ice and mixed-phase clouds. It is demonstrated that a 94-GHz DCPA system can achieve retrieval errors as low as 0.05-0.15 mm for raindrop volume-weighted mean diameter and 25% for rime fraction (for a -10 dBZ echo).","Frontiers Media S.A.","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Effects of physical, chemical, and biological ageing on the mineralization of pine wood biochar by a Streptomyces isolate","Zeba, Nayela; Berry, Timothy D.; Panke-Buisse, Kevin (ORCID:0000000185551255); Whitman, Thea (ORCID:0000000322695598); Rahmani, ed., Omeid","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","<p> If biochar is to be used for carbon (C) management, we must understand how weathering or ageing affects biochar C mineralization. Here, we incubated aged and unaged eastern white pine wood biochar produced at 350 and 550°C with a <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolate, a putative biochar-decomposing microbe. Ageing was accelerated via three different processes, namely, (a) physical ageing–subjecting biochar to alternating freeze-thaw and wet-dry cycles, (b) chemical ageing–treating biochar with concentrated hydrogen peroxide and (c) biological ageing–incubating biochar in the presence of nutrients and microorganisms. Elemental composition and surface chemistry (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) of biochar samples were compared before and after ageing. Biochar C mineralization between ageing treatments was significantly different in the case of 350°C biochar ( <italic>p</italic> value = 0.03). Among the 350°C biochars, physical ageing resulted in the greatest increase (by 103%) in biochar C mineralization ( <italic>p</italic> value = 0.05). However, in the case of 550°C biochar, ageing did not result in a significant change in biochar C mineralization ( <italic>p</italic> value = 0.40). Biochar C mineralization was positively correlated with an increase in O/C ratio post-ageing ( <italic>r</italic> <sub> <italic>s</italic> </sub> = 0.86, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.01). In the case of 350°C biochar, surface oxidation during ageing enhanced biochar degradation by the isolate. For 550°C biochar, however, ageing did not significantly increase biochar C mineralization, likely due to high condensed aromatic C content and lower surface oxidation during ageing. The results from our study suggest that low temperature aged biochar is more susceptible to biological degradation by soil microbes. These findings have implications for the use of biochar for long term C storage in soils. </p>","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","","Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2022-04-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PLoS ONE Journal Volume: 17 Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. e0265663","","","SC0020351; SC0016365","Journal ID: ISSN 1932-6203; 10.1371/journal.pone.0265663","10.1371/journal.pone.0265663","","2022-04-11T00:00:00Z","1861940","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1861940","","PLoS ONE","4","17"
"Brown Carbon Fuel and Emission Source Attributions to Global Snow Darkening Effect","Brown, Hunter; Wang, Hailong; Flanner, Mark; Liu, Xiaohong; Singh, Balwinder; Zhang, Rudong; Yang, Yang; Wu, Mingxuan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Snow and ice albedo reduction due to deposition of absorbing particles (i.e., snow darkening effect (SDE)) warms the Earth system and is largely attributed to black carbon (BC) and dust. Absorbing organic aerosol (BrC) also contributes to SDE but has received less attention due to uncertainty and challenges in model representation. This work incorporates the SDE of absorbing organic aerosol (BrC) from biomass burning and biofuel sources into the Snow Ice and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model within a variant of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Additionally, 12 different emission regions of BrC and BC from biomass burning and biofuel sources are tagged to quantify the relative contribution to global and regional SDE. BrC global SDE (0.021–0.056 Wm<sup>-2</sup>) is larger than other model estimates, corresponding to 37%–98% of the SDE from BC. When compared to observations, BrC simulations have a range in median bias (-2.5% to +21%), with better agreement in the simulations that include BrC photochemical bleaching. The largest relative contributions to global BrC SDE are traced to Northern Asia (23%–31%), Southeast Asia (16%–21%), and South Africa (13%–17%). Transport from Southeast Asia contributes nearly half of the regional BrC SDE in Antarctica (0.084–0.3 Wm<sup>-2</sup>), which is the largest regional input to global BrC SDE. Lower latitude BrC SDE is correlated with snowmelt, in-snow BrC concentrations, and snow cover fraction, while polar BrC SDE is correlated with surface insolation and snowmelt. This indicates the importance of in-snow processes and snow feedbacks on modeled BrC SDE.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Deficiencies in models' process representations, propagation of errors from one process to another, and associated compensating errors can often confound the interpretation and improvement of model simulations. These errors and biases can also lead to unrealistic climate projections and incorrect attribution of the physical mechanisms governing past and future climate change. Here we show that a significantly improved global atmospheric simulation can be achieved by focusing on the realism of process assumptions in cloud calibration and subgrid effects using the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1). The calibration of clouds and subgrid effects informed by our understanding of physical mechanisms leads to significant improvements in clouds and precipitation climatology, reducing common and long-standing biases across cloud regimes in the model. The improved cloud fidelity in turn reduces biases in other aspects of the system. Furthermore, even though the recalibration does not change the global mean aerosol and total anthropogenic effective radiative forcings (ERFs), the sensitivity of clouds, precipitation, and surface temperature to aerosol perturbations is significantly reduced. This suggests that it is possible to achieve improvements to the historical evolution of surface temperature over EAMv1 and that precise knowledge of global mean ERFs is not enough to constrain historical or future climate change. Cloud feedbacks are also significantly reduced in the recalibrated model, suggesting that there would be a lower climate sensitivity when it is run as part of the fully coupled E3SM. This study also compares results from incremental changes to cloud microphysics, turbulent mixing, deep convection, and subgrid effects to understand how assumptions in the representation of these processes affect different aspects of the simulated atmosphere as well as its response to forcings. We conclude that the spectral composition and geographical distribution of the ERFs and cloud feedback, as well as the fidelity of the simulated base climate state, are important for constraining the climate in the past and future.","Copernicus GmbH","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However, little is known how and to what extent Hg reduction, uptake, and species transformations are mediated by algal cells and their exudates, algal organic matter (AOM), under either sunlit or dark conditions. In this study, using Chlorella vulgaris (CV) as one of the most prevalent freshwater model algal species, we show that solar irradiation could enhance the reduction of mercuric Hg(II) to elemental Hg(0) by both CV cells and AOM. AOM reduced more Hg(II) than algal cells themselves due to cell surface adsorption and uptake of Hg(II) inside the cells under solar irradiation. Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (SR-XANES) analyses indicate that sunlight facilitated the transformation of Hg to less bioavailable species, such as β-HgS and Hg-phytochelatins, compared to Hg(Cysteine)<sub>2</sub>-like species formed in algal cells in the dark. These findings highlight important functional roles and potential mechanisms of algae in Hg reduction and immobilization under varying lighting conditions and how these processes may modulate Hg cycling and bioavailability in the aquatic environment.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Evaluation of a quasi-steady-state approximation of the cloud droplet growth equation (QDGE) scheme for aerosol activation in global models using multiple aircraft data over both continental and marine environments","Wang, Hengqi; Peng, Yiran; von Salzen, Knut; Yang, Yan; Zhou, Wei; Zhao, Delong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","This research introduces a numerically efficient aerosol activation scheme and evaluates it by using stratus and stratocumulus cloud data sampled during multiple aircraft campaigns in Canada, Chile, Brazil, and China. The scheme employs a quasi-steady-state approximation of the cloud droplet growth equation (QDGE) to efficiently simulate aerosol activation, the vertical profile of supersaturation, and the activated cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) near the cloud base. The calculated maximum supersaturation values using the QDGE scheme were compared with multiple parcel model simulations under various aerosol and environmental conditions. The differences are all below 0.18 %, indicating good performance and accuracy of the QDGE scheme. We evaluated the QDGE scheme by specifying observed environmental thermodynamic variables and aerosol information from 31 cloud cases as input and comparing the simulated CDNC with cloud observations. The average of mean relative error ($\overline{MRE}$) of the simulated CDNC for cloud cases in each campaign ranges from 17.30 % in Brazil to 25.90 % in China, indicating that the QDGE scheme successfully reproduces observed variations in CDNC over a wide range of different meteorological conditions and aerosol regimes. Additionally, we carried out an error analysis by calculating the maximum information coefficient (MIC) between the MRE and input variables for the individual campaigns and all cloud cases. MIC values were then sorted by aerosol properties, pollution level, environmental humidity, and dynamic condition according to their relative importance to MRE. Based on the error analysis, we found that the magnitude of MRE is more relevant to the specification of input aerosol pollution level in marine regions and aerosol hygroscopicity in continental regions than to other variables in the simulation.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study analyses at least 1 year of asynchronous particle number size distributions from six different locations in India. We also analyze the frequency of NPF and its contribution to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. We found that the NPF frequency has a considerable seasonal variability. At the measurement sites analyzed in this study, NPF frequently occurs in March–May (pre-monsoon, about 21% of the days) and is the least common in October–November (post-monsoon, about 7% of the days). Considering the NPF events in all locations, the particle formation rate (J<sub>SDS</sub>) varied by more than 2 orders of magnitude (0.001–0.6 cm<sup>–3</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>) and the growth rate between the smallest detectable size and 25nm (GR<sub>SDS-25nm</sub>) by about 3 orders of magnitude (0.2–17.2nm h<sup>–1</sup>). We found that J<sub>SDS</sub> was higher by nearly 1 order of magnitude during NPF events in urban areas than mountain sites. GR<sub>SDS</sub> did not show a systematic difference. Our results showed that NPF events could significantly modulate the shape of particle number size distributions and CCN concentrations in India. The contribution of a given NPF event to CCN concentrations was the highest in urban locations (4.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>–3</sup> per event and 1.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>–3</sup> per event for 50 and 100nm, respectively) as compared to mountain background sites (2.7 × 10<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>–3</sup> per event and 1.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>cm<sup>–3</sup> per event, respectively). We emphasize that the physical and chemical pathways responsible for NPF and factors that control its contribution to CCN production require in situ field observations using recent advances in aerosol and its precursor gaseous measurement techniques.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Downwind dispersion of CO<sub>2</sub> from a major subsea blowout in shallow offshore waters","Oldenburg, Curtis M.; Zhang, Yingqi","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; CO2 well blowout; offshore well blowout; atmospheric dispersion; dense gas dispersion; CO2 leakage risk assessment; reduced order models","Growing interest in offshore geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) motivates risk assessment of large-scale subsea CO<sub>2</sub> well blowouts or pipeline ruptures. For major leaks of CO<sub>2</sub> from wells or pipelines, significant fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> may occur from the sea surface depending on water depth. In the context of risk assessment of human health and safety, we have used previously simulated coupled well-reservoir and water column model results as a source term for dense gas dispersion of CO<sub>2</sub> above the sea surface. The models are linked together by one-way coupling, that is, output of one model is used as input to the next model. These first-of-their-kind coupled flow results are applicable to assessing the hazard of CO<sub>2</sub> to people at and downwind of the sea surface location of emission. Hazard is quantified by plotting the downwind dispersion length (DDL), which we define in the study as the distances from the emission source to the point at which the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> has been diluted to 5% and 1.5% in air by volume. Here results suggest that large-scale blowouts in shallow water (10 m) may cause hazardous CO<sub>2</sub> plumes extending on the order of several hundred meters downwind. Details of the modeling show DDL has a maximum for windspeed (at an elevation of 10 m) of approximately 5 m/s, with smaller DDL for both weaker and stronger winds. This is explained by the fact that wind favors transport but also causes dispersion; therefore there is a certain wind speed that maximizes DDL.","Society of Chemical Industry, Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To date, estimating N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from cropland remains a challenging task because the related microbial processes (e.g., nitrification and denitrification) are controlled by complex interactions among climate, soil, plant and human activities. Existing approaches such as process-based (PB) models have well-known limitations due to insufficient representations of the processes or uncertainties of model parameters, and due to leverage recent advances in machine learning (ML) a new method is needed to unlock the “black box” to overcome its limitations such as low interpretability, out-of-sample failure and massive data demand. In this study, we developed a first-of-its-kind knowledge-guided machine learning model for agroecosystems (KGML-ag) by incorporating biogeophysical and chemical domain knowledge from an advanced PB model, ecosys, and tested it by comparing simulating daily N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes with real observed data from mesocosm experiments. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) was used as the basis to build the model structure. To optimize the model performance, we have investigated a range of ideas, including (1) using initial values of intermediate variables (IMVs) instead of time series as model input to reduce data demand; (2) building hierarchical structures to explicitly estimate IMVs for further N<sub>2</sub>O prediction; (3) using multi-task learning to balance the simultaneous training on multiple variables; and (4) pre-training with millions of synthetic data generated from ecosys and fine-tuning with mesocosm observations. Six other pure ML models were developed using the same mesocosm data to serve as the benchmark for the KGML-ag model. Results show that KGML-ag did an excellent job in reproducing the mesocosm N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes (overall r<sup>2</sup>=0.81, and RMSE=3.6 mgNm<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> from cross validation). Importantly, KGML-ag always outperforms the PB model and ML models in predicting N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes, especially for complex temporal dynamics and emission peaks. Besides, KGML-ag goes beyond the pure ML models by providing more interpretable predictions as well as pinpointing desired new knowledge and data to further empower the current KGML-ag.

"How Does Land Cover and Its Heterogeneity Length Scales Affect the Formation of Summertime Shallow Cumulus Clouds in Observations From the US Southern Great Plains?","Tian, Jingjing; Zhang, Yunyan; Klein, Stephen A.; Öktem, Rusen; Wang, Likun","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES","This study investigates the effects of heterogeneous land covers on shallow cumulus (ShCu) clouds at the US Southern Great Plains using high-resolution satellite and land cover data. During late summer, ShCu occurs over cities the most frequently and over open waters the least frequently, and more often over forest than over grassland. The preferential occurrence of ShCu over forest relative to grassland is consistent with surface measurements showing larger heat fluxes over forests. This preferential occurrence also varies with the length scales of land patches with the largest cloud occurrence difference shifting from smaller length scales (<9 km) during midday to larger scales (>9 km) in the early afternoon. Consistent with theory, these signals are more pronounced under low wind conditions. The preferential length scale shift with time suggests the existence of secondary circulations that strengthen and promote convergence over larger spatial scales as the differential land surface heating intensifies.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

We show that boehmite nanoplatelets projected along the [010] direction exhibit uniform dissolution with a strong dependence on the electron dose rate. For nanoplatelets that have undergone oriented aggregation, we show that the dissolution occurs preferentially at the particles at the ends of the stacks that are more accessible to bulk solution than at the others inside the aggregate. In addition, at higher dose rates, electrostatic repulsion and knock-on damage from the electron beam causes delamination of the stacks and dissolution at the interfaces between particles in the aggregate, indicating that there is a threshold dose rate for electron-beam enhancement of dissolution of boehmite aggregates.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, few of these studies have investigated the importance of previous year uptake to growth. We tested the relationship between wood biomass increment (WBI) and different temporal periods of carbon uptake from the current and previous years to investigate the potential lagged allocation of fixed carbon to growth among six mature, temperate forests. We found WBI was strongly correlated to carbon uptake across space (i.e., long-term averages at the different sites) but on annual timescales, WBI was much less related to carbon uptake, suggesting a temporal mismatch between C fixation and allocation to biomass. We detected lags in allocation of the previous year's carbon uptake to WBI at three of the six sites. Sites with higher annual WBI had overall stronger correlations to carbon uptake, with the strongest correlations to carbon uptake from the previous year. Only one site had WBI with strong positive relationships to current year uptake and not the previous year. Forests with low rates of WBI demonstrated weak correlations to carbon uptake from the previous year and stronger relationships to current year climate conditions. Our work shows an important, but not universal, role of lagged allocation of the previous year's carbon uptake to growth in temperate forests.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Urbanization and aridity mediate distinct salinity response to floods in rivers and streams across the contiguous United States","Ombadi, Mohammed (ORCID:0000000177939137); Varadharajan, Charuleka (ORCID:0000000241423224)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; salinity; floods; urbanization; aridity; machine learning; random Forest","Salinity is an important water quality parameter that affects ecosystem health and the use of freshwaters for industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial purposes. Although a number of studies have investigated the variability and trends of salinity in rivers and streams, the effects of floods on salinity across a wide range of watersheds have not been determined. Here, we examine this question by utilizing long-term observational records of daily streamflow and specific conductance (SC; a proxy for salinity) in addition to catchment characteristics for 259 United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring sites in the contiguous United States spanning a wide range of climatic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. We used a combination of statistical methods, random forest machine learning models, and information-theoretic causal inference algorithms to determine the response of SC to floods and the factors that impact salinity changes within sites (intra-site variability) and across sites (inter-site variability). Our results show that changes to SC during flood events exhibited substantial variability ranging from a 100% decrease to 34% increase relative to the long-term mean. We found that dilution is the prevailing mechanism that decreases SC levels during floods for most sites, but other mechanisms caused an increase of SC for 6.1% (n = 5521) of flood events. Our analysis revealed that antecedent conditions of SC in the few days preceding the flood are the most important factor in explaining intra-site variability. The response of salinity to floods also varied considerably across sites with different characteristics, with a notable effect of urbanization in temperate climates resulting in increased dilution of SC, and mining in arid climates, which adversely increases SC levels. Overall, we find that the combined effect of aridity and anthropogenic factors is of primary importance in determining how salinity responds to floods, and it bears strongly on water quality conditions in a future world — one in which floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity, concurrent with shifting aridity patterns and increasing urbanization.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics in subsurface hydrological flows over a long time window usually employs a network of monitoring wells. However, such observations are often spatially sparse with potential temporal gaps due to poor quality or instrument failure. In this study, we explore the ability of recurrent neural networks to fill gaps in a spatially distributed time-series dataset. We use a well network that monitors the dynamic and heterogeneous hydrologic exchanges between the Columbia River and its adjacent groundwater aquifer at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford site. This 10-year-long dataset contains hourly temperature, specific conductance, and groundwater table elevation measurements from 42 wells with gaps of various lengths. We employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to capture the temporal variations in the observed system behaviors needed for gap filling. The performance of the LSTM-based gap-filling method was evaluated against a traditional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method in terms of error statistics and accuracy in capturing the temporal patterns of river corridor wells with various dynamics signatures. Our study demonstrates that the ARIMA models yield better average error statistics, although they tend to have larger errors during time windows with abrupt changes or high-frequency (daily and subdaily) variations. The LSTM-based models excel in capturing both high-frequency and low-frequency (monthly and seasonal) dynamics. However, the inclusion of high-frequency fluctuations may also lead to overly dynamic predictions in time windows that lack such fluctuations. The LSTM can take advantage of the spatial information from neighboring wells to improve the gap-filling accuracy, especially for long gaps in system states that vary at subdaily scales. While LSTM models require substantial training data and have limited extrapolation power beyond the conditions represented in the training data, they afford great flexibility to account for the spatial correlations, temporal correlations, and nonlinearity in data without a priori assumptions. Thus, LSTMs provide effective alternatives to fill in data gaps in spatially distributed time-series observations characterized by multiple dominant frequencies of variability, which are essential for advancing our understanding of dynamic complex systems.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization","Pandey, Bhartendu; Brelsford, Christa; Seto, Karen C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; urban inequality; developing countries; urbanization; sustainability; spatial scale","Urbanization can challenge sustainable development if it produces unequal outcomes. Infrastructure is an important urbanization dimension, providing services to support diverse urban activities. However, it can lock in unequal outcomes due to its durable nature. This paper studies inequalities in infrastructure distributions to derive insights into the structure and characteristics of unequal outcomes associated with urbanization. We analyzed infrastructure inequalities in two emerging economies in the Global South: India and South Africa. We developed and applied an inequality measure to understand the structure of inequality in infrastructure provisioning (based on census data) and infrastructure availability (based on satellite nighttime lights [NTLs] data). Consistent with differences in economic inequality, results show greater inequalities in South Africa than in India and greater urban inequalities than rural inequalities. Nevertheless, inequalities in urban infrastructure provisioning and infrastructure availability increase from finer to coarser spatial scales. NTL-based inequality measurements additionally show that inequalities are more concentrated at coarse spatial scales in India than in South Africa. Finally, results show that urban inequalities in infrastructure provisioning covary with urbanization levels conceptualized as a multidimensional phenomenon, including demographic, economic, and infrastructural dimensions. Similarly, inequalities in urban infrastructure availability increase monotonically with infrastructure development levels and urban population size. Together, these findings underscore infrastructure inequalities as a feature of urbanization and suggest that understanding urban inequalities requires applying an inequality lens to urbanization.","National Academy of Sciences","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Climate-Driven Legacies in Simulated Microbial Communities Alter Litter Decomposition Rates","Wang, Bin; Allison, Steven D.","59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; microbiome; composition; decomposition; trait; tradeoff; climate; litter; legacy","The mechanisms underlying diversity-functioning relationships have been a consistent area of inquiry in biogeochemistry since the 1950s. Though these mechanisms remain unresolved in soil microbiomes, many approaches at varying scales have pointed to the same notion—composition matters. Confronting the methodological challenge arising from the complexity of microbiomes, this study used the model DEMENTpy, a trait-based modeling framework, to explore trait-based drivers of microbiome-dependent litter decomposition. We parameterized DEMENTpy for five sites along a climate gradient in Southern California, United States, and conducted reciprocal transplant simulations analogous to a prior empirical study. The simulations demonstrated climate-dependent legacy effects of microbial communities on plant litter decomposition across the gradient. This result is consistent with the previous empirical study across the same gradient. An analysis of community-level traits further suggests that a 3-way tradeoff among resource acquisition, stress tolerance, and yield strategies influences community assembly. Simulated litter decomposition was predictable with two community traits (indicative of two of the three strategies) plus local environment, regardless of the system state (transient vs. equilibrium). Although more empirical confirmation is still needed, community traits plus local environmental factors (e.g., environment and litter chemistry) may robustly predict litter decomposition across spatial-temporal scales. In conclusion, this study offers a potential trait-based explanation for climate-dependent community effects on litter decomposition with implications for improved understanding of whole-ecosystem functioning across scales.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For snow-dominated regions, such simplification could result in substantial errors in estimating extreme events and infrastructure design risk. To address this long-standing problem, we applied the Next Generation IDF (NG-IDF) technique to estimate design basis extreme events for different durations and return periods in the conterminous United States (CONUS) to distinctly represent the contribution of rain, snowmelt, and ROS events to the amount of water reaching the land surface. A suite of datasets were developed to characterize the magnitude, trend, seasonality, and dominant mechanism of extreme events for over 200,000 locations. Infrastructure design risk associated with the use of PREC-IDF was estimated. Accuracy of the model simulations used in the analyses was confirmed by long-term snow data at over 200 Snowpack Telemetry stations. The presented spatially continuous datasets are readily usable and instrumental for supporting site-specific infrastructure design.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Large Divergence in Tropical Hydrological Projections Caused by Model Spread in Vegetation Responses to Elevated CO<sub>2</sub>","Zhou, Sha; Keenan, Trevor F.; Williams, A. Park; Lintner, Benjamin R.; Zhang, Yao; Gentine, Pierre","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and associated global warming are expected to alter the global hydrological cycle, thereby posing widespread threats to freshwater availability. However, future hydrological projections differ greatly between models, particularly over the tropical regions. The large difference between model projections directly limits policy planning efforts, and the responsible modeling processes remain unclear. Here, we identify the primary processes accounting for model differences in tropical hydrological changes using multiple CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity experiments in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. We show that differences in projected changes to tropical evapotranspiration, precipitation, and surface water availability mainly arise from model representations of vegetation cover and stomatal conductance responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and associated changes in atmospheric moisture and circulation. Atmospheric responses to sea surface warming contribute additionally to the divergence in hydrological projections. Given the importance of vegetation responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and associated atmosphere feedbacks, our results underscore the need to improve representations of the vegetation physiological response to rising CO<sub>2</sub> and its coupling to the atmosphere, to provide reliable tropical hydrological projections.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Assessing free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium for different GCM resolutions using a cloud-resolving model simulation of tropical convection","Wang, Xu; Zhang, Guang J.

The simulated dynamic and thermodynamic fields within the model domain are averaged over subdomains of different sizes equivalent to different GCM resolutions. These coarse-grained fields are then used to compute CAPE and its change with time, and their relationships with simulated convection. Results show that CAPE change with time is controlled predominantly by variations of thermodynamic properties in the planetary boundary layer for all subdomain sizes ranging from 64 to 4 km. Lag correlation analysis shows that CAPE generation by the free-tropospheric dynamical advection (dCAPE <sub>ls</sub> ) leads convective precipitation but is in phase with convective mass flux at 600 mb and 500 mb vertical velocity for all subdomain sizes. However, the correlation coefficients and regression slopes decrease as the subdomain size decreases for subdomain sizes smaller than 16 km. This is probably due to increased randomness of convection and more scale-dependence of the relationships when the subdomain size reaches the grey zone. By examining the sensitivity of the relationships of convection with dCAPE <sub>ls</sub> to temporal scales in different subdomain size, it shows that the quasi-equilibrium between dCAPE <sub>ls</sub> and convection holds well for timescales of 30 min or longer at all subdomain sizes. These results suggest that the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium assumption may still be useable even for GCM resolutions in the grey zone. </p>","Springer Science + Business Media","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Science Foundation (NSF); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Office of China Postdoctoral Council (OCPC)","","United States","2022-04-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Climate Dynamics Journal Volume: 59 Journal Issue: 9-10","","Medium: X; Size: p. 3035-3050","","","SC0022064; AGS-2054697; 41805069; 20190003","Journal ID: ISSN 0930-7575; PII: 6232","10.1007/s00382-022-06232-1","","2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","1861001","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1861001","","Climate Dynamics","9-10","59"
"The Behaviors of Intraseasonal Cloud Organization During DYNAMO/AMIE","Sakaeda, Naoko; Torri, Giuseppe","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES","This study investigates the organization of tropical convection associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) during the Dynamics of the MJO/Atmospheric Radiation Measurement MJO Investigation Experiment field campaign. While it is known that tropical clouds can organize and impact the large-scale environment, how this occurs, and its underlying mechanism are not fully understood. Application of several existing cloud organization indices showed inconsistent evolutions in the measured degree of organization with the MJO. The inconsistency arises from the varying definitions and assumptions of cloud organization behaviors that are applied to each index. While these indices often combine different properties of clouds, such as their number density, size, and distance between them, the analysis of these properties separately provided further understanding of how clouds organize with the MJO. Using the rainfall clusters identified from the S-Polka radar, we find that deep convective rainfall clusters begin to increase their number density before the arrival of MJO enhanced convective center, which is accompanied by increased proximity (shorter distance to each other) and followed by growth in their size. However, the nonrandomness in the spatial distribution of rainfall clusters maximizes as MJO convection decays. Deep convective clusters become the least randomly distributed as the clusters decay because of the suppression and decay of isolated deep convective cells, while clustered deep convective cells exist longer. Furthermore, this evolution of cloud organization is analogous to mesoscale convective systems, indicating that the duration and frequency of their organization stages are altered by the large-scale environmental perturbations associated with the MJO.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Range shifts in a foundation sedge potentially induce large Arctic ecosystem carbon losses and gains","Curasi, Salvatore R.; Fetcher, Ned; Hewitt, Rebecca E.; Lafleur, Peter M.; Loranty, Michael M.; Mack, Michelle C.; May, Jeremy L.; Myers-Smith, Isla H.; Natali, Susan M.; Oberbauer, Steven F.; Parker, Thomas C.; Sonnentag, Oliver; Vargas Zesati, Sergio A.; Wullschleger, Stan D.; Rocha, Adrian V.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Foundation species have disproportionately large impacts on ecosystem structure and function. As a result, future changes to their distribution may be important determinants of ecosystem carbon (C) cycling in a warmer world. We assessed the role of a foundation tussock sedge (Eriophorum vaginatum) as a climatically vulnerable C stock using field data, a machine learning ecological niche model, and an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). Field data indicated that tussock density has decreased by ~0.97 tussocks per m2 over the past ~38 years on Alaska's North Slope from ~1981 to 2019. This declining trend is concerning because tussocks are a large Arctic C stock, which enhances soil organic layer C stocks by 6.9% on average and represents 745 Tg C across our study area. By 2100, we project that changes in tussock density may decrease the tussock C stock by 41% in regions where tussocks are currently abundant (e.g. -0.8 tussocks per m2 and -85 Tg C on the North Slope) and may increase the tussock C stock by 46% in regions where tussocks are currently scarce (e.g. +0.9 tussocks per m2 and +81 Tg C on Victoria Island). These climate-induced changes to the tussock C stock were comparable to, but sometimes opposite in sign, to vegetation C stock changes predicted by an ensemble of TBMs. Our results illustrate the important role of tussocks as a foundation species in determining future Arctic C stocks and highlight the need for better representation of this species in TBMs..","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Estimation of pollen productivity and dispersal: How pollen assemblages in small lakes represent vegetation","Liu, Yao; Ogle, Kiona; Lichstein, Jeremy W.; Jackson, Stephen T.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Bayesian statistical model; pollen dispersal; pollen productivity; pollen-based vegetation reconstruction; pollen–vegetation relationship","Quantitative understanding of vegetation dynamics over timespans beyond a century remains limited. In this regard, the pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation enables unique research opportunities by quantifying changes in plant community compositions during hundreds to thousands of years. Critically, the methodological basis for most reconstruction approaches rests upon estimates of pollen productivity and dispersal. Previous studies, however, have reached contrasting conclusions concerning these estimates, which may be perceived to challenge the applicability and reliability of pollen-based reconstruction. Here we show that conflicting estimates of pollen production and dispersal are, at least in part, artifacts of fixed assumptions of pollen dispersal and insufficient spatial resolution of vegetation data surrounding the pollen-collecting lake. We implemented a Bayesian statistical model that related pollen assemblages in surface sediments of 33 small lakes (<2 ha) in the northeastern United States, with surrounding vegetation ranging from 10<sup>1</sup> to >10<sup>5</sup> m from the lake margin. Our analysis revealed three key insights. First, pollen productivity is largely conserved within taxa and across forest types. Second, when local (within a 1-km radius) vegetation abundances are not considered, pollen-source areas may be overestimated for some common taxa (Cupressaceae, Pinus, Quercus, and Tsuga). Third, pollen dispersal mechanisms may differ between local and regional scales; this is missed by pollen-dispersal models used in previous studies. These findings highlight the complex interactions between vegetation heterogeneity on the landscape and pollen dispersal. We suggest that, when estimating pollen productivity and dispersal, both detailed local and extended regional vegetation must be taken into account. Also, both deductive (mechanistic models) and inductive (statistical models) approaches are needed to better understand the emergent properties of pollen dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, systematic evaluations of both optimality-based and alternative empirical formulations for coupling carbon and water fluxes are lacking. Here, we embed 12 empirical and optimisation approaches within a LSM framework. We use theoretical model experiments to explore parameter identifiability and understand how model behaviours differ in response to abiotic changes. We also evaluate the models against leaf-level observations of gas-exchange and hydraulic variables, from xeric to wet forest/woody species spanning a mean annual precipitation range of 361-3286 mm yr<sup>-1</sup>. We find that models differ in how easily parameterised they are, due to: (i) poorly constrained optimality criteria (i.e., resulting in multiple solutions), (ii) low influence parameters, (iii) sensitivities to environmental drivers. In both the idealised experiments and compared to observations, sensitivities to variability in environmental drivers do not agree among models. Marked differences arise in sensitivities to soil moisture (soil water potential) and vapour pressure deficit. For example, stomatal closure rates at high vapour pressure deficit range between -45% and +70% of those observed. Although over half the new generation of stomatal schemes perform to a similar standard compared to observations of leaf-gas exchange, two models do so through large biases in simulated leaf water potential (up to 11 MPa). Our results provide guidance for LSM development, by highlighting key areas in need for additional experimentation and theory, and by constraining currently viable stomatal hypotheses.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Maritime Aerosol and CCN Profiles Derived From Ship₋Based Measurements Over Eastern North Pacific During MAGIC","Brendecke, Jordann; Dong, Xiquan; Xi, Baike; Zheng, Xiaojian","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Atmospheric aerosols are widely recognized to give rise to a substantial radiative forcing to the climate by scattering and absorbing radiation and by modifying the microphysical, lifetime, and radiative properties of clouds. During the Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) over the Eastern North Pacific (ENP), the ship-based measured cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration at 0.2% supersaturation (N<sub>CCN,0.2</sub>) and condensation nuclei concentration (N<sub>CN</sub>) had mean values of 116.7 and 219.4 cm<sup>⁻3</sup>, with the highest concentrations found closest to LA due to an increase in aerosol sources. Moving westward, both N<sub>CCN,0.2</sub> and N<sub>CN</sub> gradually decreased until stabilizing near 100 cm<sup>⁻3</sup> and 200 cm<sup>⁻3</sup>, respectively. Using the methods proposed by Ghan and Collins (2004), https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426(2004)021<0387:uoisdt>2.0.co;2 and Ghan et al. (2006), https://doi.org/10.1029/2004jd005752, N<sub>CCN,0.2</sub> profiles are retrieved using the surface measured N<sub>CCN,0.2</sub> as a constraint. For coupled conditions, correlations between the retrieved N<sub>CCN,0.2</sub> profiles and cloud-droplet number concentration (N<sub>C</sub>) increase from 0.26 at the surface to 0.38 near cloud base, particularly true for non-drizzling clouds. Although the correlations are lower than expected, the percentage increase (46.2%) is encouraging. Finally, the relationships between cloud breakup (CB) and the stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT) with environmental conditions and associated aerosols are also studied. The decreased N<sub>CN</sub> trend east of CB is mainly caused by precipitation scavenging, while the increased N<sub>CN</sub> trend west of CB is strongly associated with the increased surface wind speed and fewer drizzle events. A further study is needed using high-resolution models to simulate these events.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The ICON-A and ECHAM6.3 host models use different dynamical cores, parameterizations of vertical mixing due to sub-grid scale turbulence, and parameter settings for radiation balance tuning. Here, we study the role of the different host models for simulated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and evaluate impacts of using HAM2.3 and the ECHAM6-HAM2.3 two-moment cloud microphysics scheme on several meteorological variables. Sensitivity runs show that a positive AOT bias over the subtropical oceans is remedied in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because of a different default setting of a parameter in the moist convection parameterization of the host models. The global mean AOT is biased low compared to MODIS satellite instrument retrievals in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, but the bias is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because negative AOT biases over the Amazon, the African rain forest, and the northern Indian Ocean are no longer compensated by high biases over the sub-tropical oceans. ICON-A-HAM2.3 shows a moderate improvement with respect to AOT observations at AERONET sites. A multivariable bias score combining biases of several meteorological variables into a single number is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 compared to standard ICON-A and standard ECHAM6.3. In the tropics, this multivariable bias is of similar magnitude in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and in ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3. In the extra-tropics, a smaller multivariable bias is found for ICON-A-HAM2.3 than for ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Examining the behavioral and physical determinants","Msangi, Siwa (ORCID:0000000254086909); Hejazi, Mohamad","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; groundwater; resource use externalities; dynamic games; common-pool resources","In this paper we explore the economic value of groundwater in irrigation - both in terms of the way in which it stabilizes water supply for those facing uncertain surface water flows - as well as in the way it augments water supply to farming enterprises beyond what would be available from precipitation or surface water flows alone. These respective components of groundwater’s economic value - its ‘stabilization’ and ‘augmentation’ value - have been discussed in the literature before, but we point out some important ways in which they could be diminished if sub-optimal groundwater abstraction is allowed to persist. Groundwater ‘mining’ tends to diminish the augmentation value of groundwater, while leaving the stabilization value unaffected - as long as the resource extraction only manifests itself in terms of increased pumping costs. We illustrate, however, a situation in which even the stabilization value can be attenuated - which arises when constraints to the user’s ability to abstract groundwater become binding and prevent her from realizing the stabilizing value that is embodied in the immediate exploitation of the resource. We demonstrate these losses in groundwater’s economic value in irrigation through simulating increasingly sub-optimal, non-cooperative and strategic groundwater pumping behavior in a way that has not been done explicitly in the literature, and use a well-studied example from California to give an empirical illustration of our points.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These models are increasingly adopting vegetation demographic approaches that explicitly represent tree growth, mortality, and recruitment, enabling advances in the projection of forest vulnerability and resilience, as well as evaluation with field data. To date, simulation of regeneration processes has received far less attention than simulation of processes that affect growth and mortality, in spite of their critical role maintaining forest structure, facilitating turnover in forest composition over space and time, enabling recovery from disturbance, and regulating climate-driven range shifts. Here, our critical review of regeneration process representations within current Earth system vegetation demographic models reveals the need to improve parameter values and algorithms for reproductive allocation, dispersal, seed survival and germination, environmental filtering in the seedling layer, and tree regeneration strategies adapted to wind, fire, and anthropogenic disturbance regimes. These improvements require synthesis of existing data, specific field data-collection protocols, and novel model algorithms compatible with global-scale simulations. Vegetation demographic models offer the opportunity to more fully integrate ecological understanding into Earth system prediction; regeneration processes need to be a critical part of the effort.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

A nonlinear dependence on two scalars - water vapor and temperature - leads to different behavior than single scalars in turbulent convection. For modeling such multiscalar processes at subgrid scales (SGS) in large-eddy simulations (LES) or convection-permitting models, a new SGS scheme is implemented in CM1 that solves equations for SGS water vapor and temperature fluctuations and their covariance. The SGS model is evaluated using benchmark direct-numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent Rayleigh–Bénard convection with water vapor as in the Michigan Tech Pi Cloud Chamber. This idealized setup allows thorough evaluation of the SGS model without complications from other atmospheric processes. DNS results compare favorably with measurements from the chamber. Results from LES using the new SGS model compare well with DNS, including profiles of water vapor and temperature variances, their covariance, and supersaturation variance. SGS supersaturation fluctuations scale appropriately with changes to the LES grid spacing, with the magnitude of SGS fluctuations decreasing relative to those at the resolved scale as the grid spacing is decreased. Sensitivities of covariance and supersaturation statistics to changes in water vapor flux relative to thermal flux are also investigated by modifying the sidewall conditions. Relative changes in water vapor flux substantially decrease the covariance and increase supersaturation fluctuations even away from boundaries.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Its dominant fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP), and respiration (in particular soil respiration, R<sub>S</sub>), are typically estimated from independent satellite-driven models and upscaled in situ measurements, respectively. We combine carbon-cycle flux estimates and partitioning coefficients to show that historical estimates of global GPP and R<sub>S</sub> are irreconcilable. When we estimate GPP based on R<sub>S</sub> measurements and some assumptions about R<sub>S</sub>:GPP ratios, we found the resulted global GPP values (bootstrap mean 149$^{+29}_{-23}$ Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>) are significantly higher than most GPP estimates reported in the literature (113$^{+18}_{-18}$ Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>). Similarly, historical GPP estimates imply a soil respiration flux (Rs<sub>GPP</sub>, bootstrap mean of 68$^{+10}_{-8}$ Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>) statistically inconsistent with most published R<sub>S</sub> values (87$^{+9}_{-8}$ Pg C yr<sup>-1</sup>), although recent, higher, GPP estimates are narrowing this gap. Furthermore, global R<sub>S</sub>:GPP ratios are inconsistent with spatial averages of this ratio calculated from individual sites as well as CMIP6 model results. This discrepancy has implications for our understanding of carbon turnover times and the terrestrial sensitivity to climate change. Future efforts should reconcile the discrepancies associated with calculations for GPP and Rs to improve estimates of the global carbon budget.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The new algorithm is compared with the current operational formulation used by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF). Both algorithms use near-surface temperature and dewpoint temperature along with total column water vapor from the latest European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis ERA5 and satellite cloud information from the Meteosat Second Generation. The algorithms are trained and validated using both ECMWF-ERA5 and DLR acquired from 23 ground stations as part of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. Results show that the MARS algorithm generally improves DLR estimation in comparison with other model estimates, particularly when trained with observations. When considering all the validation data, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 18.76, 23.55, and 22.08 W·m<sup>–2</sup> are obtained for MARS, operational LSA-SAF, and ERA5, respectively. The added value of using the satellite cloud information is accessed by comparing with estimates driven by ERA5 total cloud cover, showing an increase of 17% of the RMSE. The consistency of MARS estimate is also tested against an independent dataset of 52 ground stations (from FLUXNET2015), further supporting the good performance of the proposed model.","MDPI","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As a first step towards this goal, the center developed a one-of-a-kind observatory tailored to the study of highly heterogeneous urban environments. This article describes the features of the mobile observatory that enable its rapid deployment either on or off the power grid, as well as its instrument payload. Beyond its unique design, the observatory optimizes data collection within the obstacle-laden urban environment using a new smart sampling paradigm. This setup facilitated the collection of previously poorly documented environmental properties including wind profiles throughout the atmospheric column. The mobile observatory captured unique observations during its first few intensive observation periods (IOPs).. Vertical air motion and infrared temperature measurements collected along the faces of the supertall One Vanderbilt skyscraper in Manhattan, NY reveal how solar and anthropogenic heating affect wind flow and thus the venting of heat, pollution, and contaminants in urban street canyons. Also, air temperature measurements collected during travel along a 150-km transect between Upton and Manhattan, NY offer a high-resolution view of the urban heat island and reveal that temperature disparities also exist within the city across different neighborhoods. Ultimately, the datasets collected by CMAS are poised to help guide equitable urban planning by highlighting existing disparities and characterizing the impact of urban features on the urban microclimate with the goal of improving human comfort.","American Meteorological Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Upon seawater exposure, soil salinity increased and allocation to hydraulic function declined, resulting in a dramatic reduction in water supply to the crown, increased crown-level water stress, and subsequent crown foliage loss. Simultaneously, leaf-level photosynthetic capacity declined steeply with increasing salinity. The combined loss of crown foliage area and photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area promoted carbon starvation, while no evidence of hydraulic failure was observed.

"The Response of the Polar Vortex to Tropospheric Temperature Eddies in an Idealized General Circulation Model","Ehrmann, Thomas S.; Colucci, Stephen J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; stationary waves; stratospheric circulation; general circulation models; idealized models","<title>Abstract</title> <p>A dry-core idealized general circulation model with a stratospheric polar vortex in the Northern Hemisphere is run with a combination of simplified topography and imposed tropospheric temperature perturbations, each located in the Northern Hemisphere with a zonal wavenumber of 1. The phase difference between the imposed temperature wave and the topography is varied to understand what effect this has on the occurrence of polar vortex displacements. Geometric moments are used to identify the centroid of the polar vortex for the purposes of classifying whether or not the polar vortex is displaced. Displacements of the polar vortex are a response to increased tropospheric wave activity. Compared to a model run with only topography, the likelihood of the polar vortex being displaced increases when the warm region is located west of the topography peak, and decreases when the cold region is west of the topography peak. This response from the polar vortex is due to the modulation of vertically propagating wave activity by the temperature forcing. When the southerly winds on the western side of the topographically forced anticyclone are collocated with warm- or cold-temperature forcing, the vertical wave activity flux in the troposphere becomes more positive or negative, respectively. This is in line with recent reanalysis studies that showed that anomalous warming west of the surface pressure high, in the climatological standing wave, precedes polar vortex disturbances.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A highly disruptive process, freeze-thaw can deform soil pores and alter the architecture of the soil pore network with varied impacts to water transport and retention, redox conditions, and microbial activity. Our objective was to investigate how freeze-thaw cycles impacted the pore network of newly thawed permafrost aggregates to improve understanding of what type of transformations can be expected from warming Arctic landscapes. We measured the impact of freeze-thaw on pore morphology, pore throat size distribution, and pore connectivity with X-ray computed tomography (XCT) using six permafrost aggregates with sizes of 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup> from mineral soil (28-50 cm depths) in Toolik, Alaska. Freeze-thaw cycles were performed using a laboratory incubation consisting of five freeze-thaw cycles (-10°C to 20°C) over five weeks. Our findings indicated decreasing connectedness of individual pores across all aggregates with higher frequencies of singly connected pores following freeze-thaw. Water-filled pores that were connected to the larger pore network decreased in volume while the overall connected pore volume was not affected. Shifts in the pore throat size distribution were mostly observed in pore throats ranges of 100 microns or less with no corresponding changes to the pore shape factor of pore throats. Responses of the pore network to freeze-thaw varied with aggregate, suggesting that initial pore morphology may determine freeze-thaw response. Our research suggests that freeze-thaw alters the microenvironment of permafrost aggregates during the incipient stage of deformation following permafrost thaw, impacting soil properties and function in Arctic landscapes undergoing transition.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Subfield maize yield prediction improves when in-season crop water deficit is included in remote sensing imagery-based models","Shuai, Guanyuan; Basso, Bruno","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Water stress; SALUS; Yield forecast; Stability maps; Yield maps; Vegetation indices","In-season prediction of crop yield is a topic of research studied by several scientists using different methods. Seasonal forecasts provide critical insights to different stakeholders who use the information for strategic and tactical decisions. In this study, we propose a novel scalable method to forecast in season subfield crop yield through a machine learning model based on remotely sensed imagery and data from a process-based crop model on a cumulative crop drought index (CDI) designed to capture the impact of in-season crop water deficit on crops. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we used 352 growers' fields of different sizes across the states of Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois, with 2520 respective yield maps generated by combine harvesters equipped with precise high-resolution yield monitor sensor, over multiple years (from 2006 up to 2019). We obtained high resolution digital elevation model, climate, and soil data to execute the SALUS model, a process-based crop model, to calculate the CDI for each field used in the study. We used Landsat Analysis Ready Dataset (ARD) products generated by USGS as image source to calculate the green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI). We found that the inclusion of the CDI in remote sensing-based random forest models substantially improved in-season subfield corn yield prediction. The addition of the CDI in the yield prediction model showed that the greatest improvements in predictions were observed in the driest year (2012) in our case study. The proposed approach also showed that the subfield spatial variations of corn yield are better captured with the inclusion of CDI for most fields. The earliest prediction in the growing season with GCVI and CDI together outperformed the latest prediction with GCVI alone, highlighting the potential of CDI for predicting spatial variability of maize yield around grain filling period, which is on average close to two months before typical crop harvest in the US Midwest.","Elsevier","","Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC), Madison, WI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Remote Sensing of Environment Journal Volume: 272 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 112938","","","FC02-07ER64494; SC0018409","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-4257; S0034425722000529; 112938; PII: S0034425722000529","10.1016/j.rse.2022.112938","","2022-02-16T00:00:00Z","1844267","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1844267","","Remote Sensing of Environment","C","272"

The river research community has developed a substantial body of observations and process-specific interpretations, but we are still lacking a comprehensive model to distill this knowledge into fundamental transferable concepts. We confront the challenge of how a discipline classically organized around the deductive model of systematically collecting of site-, scale-, and mechanism-specific observations begins the process of synthesis. Machine learning is particularly well-suited to inductive generation of hypotheses. In this study, we prototype an inductive approach to holistic synthesis of river corridor observations, using support vector machine regression to identify potential couplings or feedbacks that would not necessarily arise from classical approaches. This approach generated 672 relationships linking a suite of 157 variables each measured at 62 locations in a fifth order river network. Eighty four percent of these relationships have not been previously investigated, and representing potential (hypothetical) process connections. We document relationships consistent with current understanding including hydrologic exchange processes, microbial ecology, and the River Continuum Concept, supporting that the approach can identify meaningful relationships in the data. Moreover, we highlight examples of two novel research questions that stem from interpretation of inductively-generated relationships. This study demonstrates the implementation of machine learning to sieve complex data sets and identify a small set of candidate relationships that warrant further study, including data types not commonly measured together. This structured approach complements traditional modes of inquiry, which are often limited by disciplinary perspectives and favour the careful pursuit of parsimony. Finally, we emphasize that this approach should be viewed as a complement to, rather than in place of, more traditional, deductive approaches to scientific discovery.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The mechanisms underlying such mortality, however, are debated owing to interactions between multiple drivers and mechanisms. In this work, we synthesize knowledge of drought-related tree mortality under a warming and drying atmosphere with rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Drought-associated mortality results from the depletion of pools of water and carbon within a plant and declines in their fluxes relative to demand by living tissues. These pools and fluxes are interdependent and underlay plant defenses against biotic agents. Death via failure to maintain a positive water balance is particularly dependent on soil-to-root conductance, capacitance, vulnerability to hydraulic failure, cuticular water losses, and dehydration tolerance, all of which could be exacerbated by reduced carbon supply rates to support cellular survival e.g. the carbon starvation process. The depletion of plant water and carbon pools accelerates under rising vapor pressure deficit; however, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> can mitigate these impacts. Advancing knowledge and reducing predictive uncertainties requires studies that integrate carbon, water, and defensive processes, and utilize a range of experimental and modeling approaches.","Springer Nature","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Mesoscale Convective Systems Simulated by a High–Resolution Global Nonhydrostatic Model Over the United States and China","Na, Ying; Fu, Qiang; Leung, L. Ruby; Kodama, Chihiro; Lu, Riyu","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) contribute a large fraction of warm-season precipitation and generate hazardous weather with substantial socio-economic impacts. Uncertainties in convection parameterizations in climate models limit our understanding of MCS characteristics and reliability of future projection. We examine the MCS simulation from the global 14-km Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) without cumulus parameterization against satellite observation from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) during 2001-2008. We focus on MCSs over the central U.S. and eastern China where MCSs prevail from March to August. A process-oriented tracking method incorporating both cloud and precipitation criteria is used to identify and track MCSs. About 140/100 MCSs initiate in the central U.S./eastern China per warm season and most of them initiate east of high mountains and in coastal regions. The frequency distribution of MCS lifetime is well captured in NICAM. But the simulated MCSs have stronger precipitation, smaller precipitation area, and larger cold cloud system than observed in both regions, which may be caused by weak entrainment as it is not well resolved at 14 km resolution. Here, the simulated MCS number is also underestimated in summer. By examining the climatological and MCS large-scale environments, the significant underestimation of MCS number in summer over the central U.S. may be attributed to the large climatological dry bias in the atmosphere. For China, mean moisture in summer is well simulated but deficiency in capturing the dynamic condition related to the coastal topography for triggering convection may have contributed to underestimation of MCS even in a sufficiently moist environment.","American Geophysical Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The Application of a Genetic Algorithm to the Optimization of a Mesoscale Model for Emergency Response","Werth, David; Buckley, Robert","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Besides solving the equations of momentum, heat, and moisture transport on the model grid, mesoscale weather models must account for subgrid-scale processes that affect the resolved model variables. These are simulated with model parameterizations, which often rely on values preset by the user. Such “free” model parameters, along with others set to initialize the model, are often poorly constrained, requiring that a user select each from a range of plausible values. Finding the values to optimize any forecasting tool can be accomplished with a search algorithm, and one such process—the genetic algorithm (GA)—has become especially popular. As applied to modeling, GAs represent a Darwinian process: an ensemble of simulations is run with a different set of parameter values for each member, and the members subsequently judged to be most accurate are selected as “parents” who pass their parameters onto a new generation. At the U.S. Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site in South Carolina, we are applying a GA to the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) mesoscale weather model, which supplies input to a model to simulate the dispersion of an airborne contaminant as part of the site’s emergency response preparations. An ensemble of forecasts is run each day, weather data are used to “score” the individual members of the ensemble, and the parameters from the best members are used for the next day’s forecasts. As meteorological conditions change, the parameters change as well, maintaining a model configuration that is best adapted to atmospheric conditions. Significance Statement We wanted to develop a forecasting system by which a weather model is run over the Savannah River Site each day and repeatedly adjusted according to how well it performed the previous day. To run the model, a series of values (parameters) must be set to control how the model will calculate winds, temperatures, and other desired variables. Each day the model was run several times using different combinations of these parameters and later compared with observed meteorological conditions. Parameters that produced the most accurate forecasts were preferentially reused to create the forecasts for the next day. The process was tested for the summer of 2020 and exhibited lower errors than forecasts produced by the model using default values of the parameters.","American Meteorological Society","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Environmental Management (EM)","","United States","2022-03-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 329-343","","SRNS-STI-2021-00255","89303321CEM000080","Journal ID: ISSN 1558-8424; TRN: US2305190","10.1175/jamc-d-21-0107.1","","2023-04-06T00:00:00Z","1860314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1860314","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1860314","Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology","4","61"
"The FastEddy® Resident-GPU Accelerated Large-Eddy Simulation Framework: Moist Dynamics Extension, Validation and Sensitivities of Modeling Non-Precipitating Shallow Cumulus Clouds","Muñoz‐Esparza, Domingo; Sauer, Jeremy A.; Jensen, Anders A.; Xue, Lulin; Grabowski, Wojciech W.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Herein we describe the moist dynamics formulation implemented within the graphics processing unit-resident large-eddy simulation FastEddy® model, which includes a simple saturation adjustment scheme for condensation and evaporation processes. Two LES model intercomparison exercises for non-precipitating shallow cumulus clouds are simulated in order to validate this model extension, including a static forcing and a time-dependent forcing case. Overall, we find our dynamical, thermodynamical and microphysical quantities, along with turbulence variability and fluxes, to be commensurate with the corresponding model intercomparison results. In addition, sensitivities to specific model settings are investigated. Among these settings, it is shown that boundary layer and cloud layer structure and characteristics are sensitive to use of higher-order advection schemes impacting the vertical distribution of cloud content and associated turbulence statistics. Increasing the timescale of the saturation scheme leads to enhanced liquid water presence and decreases vertical velocity variance within the cloud deck. In some cases, these sensitivities agree with the model-to-model variability reported in the intercomparison exercises, highlighting the important role of specific model implementation choices in the context of shallow cumulus convection simulations. These analyses and findings also provide the basis for future extensions and applications of FastEddy® for modeling moist convection and precipitation scenarios.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Particle phase is dependent on atmospheric conditions (relative humidity and temperature) and chemical composition and, importantly, solid particles can inhibit the uptake of water and other trace gases, even under humid conditions. Particles composed primarily of ammonium sulfate are presumed to be liquid at the relative humidities (67 to 98%) and temperatures (–2 to 4 °C) of the summertime Arctic. Under these atmospheric conditions, we report the observation of solid organic-coated ammonium sulfate particles representing 30% of particles, by number, in a key size range (<0.2 µm) for cloud activation within marine air masses from the Arctic Ocean at Utqiagvik, AK. The composition and size of the observed particles are consistent with recent Arctic modeling and observational results showing new particle formation and growth from dimethylsulfide oxidation to form sulfuric acid, reaction with ammonia, and condensation of marine biogenic sulfate and highly oxygenated organic molecules. Aqueous sulfate particles typically undergo efflorescence and solidify at relative humidities of less than 34%. Therefore, the observed solid phase is hypothesized to occur from contact efflorescence during collision of a newly formed Aitken mode sulfate particle with an organic-coated ammonium sulfate particle. With declining sea ice in the warming Arctic, this particle source is expected to increase with increasing open water and marine biogenic emissions.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

A.; Wehner, M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; atmospheric river; reanalysis intercomparison; MERRA-2; ERA5; JRA-55","Atmospheric rivers, or long but narrow regions of enhanced water vapor transport, are an important component of the hydrologic cycle as they are responsible for much of the poleward transport of water vapor and result in precipitation, sometimes extreme in intensity. Despite their importance, much uncertainty remains in the detection of atmospheric rivers in large datasets such as reanalyses and century scale climate simulations. To understand this uncertainty, the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) developed tiered experiments, including the Tier 2 Reanalysis Intercomparison that is presented here. Eleven detection algorithms submitted hourly tags--binary fields indicating the presence or absence of atmospheric rivers--of detected atmospheric rivers in the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5) as well as six-hourly tags in the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). Due to a higher climatological mean for integrated water vapor transport in MERRA-2, atmospheric rivers were detected more frequently relative to the other two reanalyses, particularly in algorithms that use a fixed threshold for water vapor transport. The finer horizontal resolution of ERA5 resulted in narrower atmospheric rivers and an ability to detect atmospheric rivers along resolved coastlines. We found that the fraction of hemispheric area covered by ARs varies throughout the year in all three reanalyses, with different atmospheric river detection tools having different seasonal cycles.","American Geophysical Union","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Baroclinic Control of Southern Ocean Eddy Upwelling Near Topography","Barthel, Alice; Hogg, Andrew M.; Waterman, Stephanie; Keating, Shane","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In the Southern Ocean, mesoscale eddies contribute to the upwelling of deep waters along sloping isopycnals, helping to close the upper branch of the meridional overturning circulation. Eddy energy (EE) is not uniformly distributed along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Instead, “hotspots” of EE that are associated with enhanced eddy-induced upwelling exist downstream of topographic features. This study shows that, in idealized eddy-resolved simulations, a topographic feature in the ACC path can enhance and localize eddy-induced upwelling. However, the upwelling systematically occurs in regions where eddies grow through baroclinic instability, rather than in regions where EE is large. Across a range of parameters, along-stream eddy growth rate is a more reliable indicator of eddy upwelling than traditional parameterizations such as eddy kinetic energy, eddy potential energy, or isopycnal slope. Ocean eddy parameterizations should consider metrics specific to the growth of baroclinic instability to accurately model eddy upwelling near topography.","American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"The Atlantic Jet Response to Stratospheric Events: A Regime Perspective","Goss, Michael; Lindgren, Erik A.; Sheshadri, Aditi; Diffenbaugh, Noah S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","The tropospheric response to Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) is associated with an equatorward shift in the midlatitude jet and associated storm tracks, while Strong Polar Vortex (SPV) events elicit a contrasting response. Recent analyses of the North Atlantic jet using probability density functions of a jet latitude index have identified three preferred jet latitudes, raising the question of whether the tropospheric response to SSWs and SPVs results from a change in relative frequencies of these preferred jet regimes rather than a systematic jet shift. We explore this question using atmospheric reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018 (26 SSWs and 33 SPVs), and a 202-years integration of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (92 SSWs and 68 SPVs). Following SSWs, the northern jet regime becomes less common and the central and southern regimes become more common. These changes occur almost immediately following “split” vortex events, but are more delayed following “displacement” events. In contrast, the northern regime becomes more frequent and the southern regime less frequent following SPV events. Following SSWs, composites of 500-hPa geopotential heights, surface air temperatures, and precipitation most closely resemble composites of the southern jet regime, and are generally opposite in sign to the composites of the northern jet regime. These comparisons are reversed following SPVs. Thus, one possible interpretation is that the two southernmost regimes appear to be favored following SSWs, while the southernmost regime becomes less common following SPVs.","American Geophysical Union","","Stanford Univ., CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2022-03-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres; Journal Volume: 126; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. e2020JD033358","","","SC0016162","Journal ID: ISSN 2169-897X","10.1029/2020jd033358","","2023-03-27T00:00:00Z","1852108","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1852108","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1852108","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","7","126"

However, the fate of CA precipitation in the future remains highly uncertain, for example, the state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projected –3% to +42% and –27% to +63% precipitation changes in northern and central-southern CA, respectively, under the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario (SSP585). In this work, we applied the Pareto optimality concept and used observed teleconnection patterns (causal relationships between ocean regions and CA precipitation) to mechanistically constrain CMIP6 projected CA precipitations. We estimated that precipitation will robustly increase by 0.4–1.3 mm d<sup>–1</sup> (10–34%) over northern CA and increase by 0.1–0.5 mm d<sup>–1</sup> (7–32%) over central-southern CA by the end of the 21st century compared with present-day. Up to 71% of ESM projection uncertainties were reduced mainly due to the strong and consistent causal relationship between North American west coast sea level pressure and CA precipitation in both observations and CMIP6 models. Our results suggest that teleconnection patterns are powerful mechanistic constraints that can help explain and reduce uncertainties in ESM projections.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We have demonstrated that our method can: assign cell types based on cells that were labelled using published methods; project cell types identified by trajectory analysis from one data set to other data sets; and assign cell types based on internal GFP markers. Using SPmarker, we have identified hundreds of new marker genes that were not identified before. As compared to known marker genes, the new marker genes have more orthologous genes identifiable in the corresponding rice single-cell clusters. The new root hair marker genes also include 172 genes with orthologs expressed in root hair cells in five non-Arabidopsis species, which expands the number of marker genes for this cell type by 35–154%.

"Global distribution, formation and fate of mineral‐associated soil organic matter under a changing climate: A trait‐based perspective","Sokol, Noah W.; Whalen, Emily D.; Jilling, Andrea; Kallenbach, Cynthia; Pett‐Ridge, Jennifer; Georgiou, Katerina","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; carbon cycle; climate change; global synthesis; microbial traits; mineral-associated organic matter; plant traits; soil carbon; trait framework","Soil organic matter (SOM) is the largest actively cycling reservoir of terrestrial carbon (C), and the majority of SOM in Earth's mineral soils (~65%) is mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Thus, the formation and fate of MAOM can exert substantial influence on the global C cycle. To predict future changes to Earth's climate, it is critical to mechanistically understand the processes by which MAOM is formed and decomposed, and to accurately represent this process-based understanding in biogeochemical and Earth system models. In this review, we use a trait-based framework to synthesize the interacting roles of plants, soil micro-organisms, and the mineral matrix in regulating MAOM formation and decomposition. Our proposed framework differentiates between plant and microbial traits that influence total OM inputs to the soil (‘feedstock traits’) versus traits that influence the proportion of OM inputs that are ultimately incorporated into MAOM (‘MAOM formation traits’). We discuss how these feedstock and MAOM formation traits may be altered by warming, altered precipitation and elevated carbon dioxide. At a planetary scale, these feedstock and MAOM formation traits help shape the distribution of MAOM across Earth's biomes, and modulate biome-specific responses of MAOM to climate change. We leverage a global synthesis of MAOM measurements to provide estimates of the total amount of MAOM-C globally (~840–1540 Pg C; 34%–51% of total terrestrial organic C), and its distribution across Earth's biomes. We show that MAOM-C concentration is highest in temperate forests and grasslands, and lowest in shrublands and savannas. Grasslands and croplands have the highest proportion of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the MAOM fraction (i.e. the MAOM-C:SOC ratio), while boreal forests and tundra have the lowest MAOM-C:SOC ratio. Drawing on our trait framework, we then review experimental data and posit the effects of climate change on MAOM pools in different biomes. We conclude by discussing how MAOM is integrated into soil C models, and how feedstock and MAOM formation traits may be included in these models.

The warm PBL has a distinct diurnal cycle including daytime convective mixing layer (ML) and nighttime residual layer developments. Thus, for PBL characterization and process study, simultaneous determinations of PBL height (PBLH) and ML height (MLH) are necessary. Here, new approaches are developed to provide reliable PBLH and MLH to characterize warm PBL evolution. The approaches use Raman lidar (RL) water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) and Doppler lidar (DL) vertical velocity measurements at the Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory, which was established by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. Compared with widely used lidar aerosol measurements for PBLH, WVMR is a better trace for PBL vertical mixing. For PBLH, the approach classifies PBL water vapor structures into a few general patterns, then uses a slope method and dynamic threshold method to determine PBLH. For MLH, wavelet analysis is used to re-construct 2-D variance from DL vertical wind velocity measurements according to the turbulence eddy size to minimize the impacts of gravity wave and eddy size on variance calculations; then, a dynamic threshold method is used to determine MLH. Remotely-sensed PBLHs and MLHs are compared with radiosonde measurements based on the Richardson number method. Good agreements between them confirm that the proposed new algorithms are reliable for PBLH and MLH characterization. Here, the algorithms are applied to warm seasons' RL and ML measurements at the SGP site for five years to study warm season PBL structure and processes. The weekly composited diurnal evolutions of PBLHs and MLHs in warm climate were provided to illustrate diurnal and seasonal PBL evolutions. This reliable PBLH and MLH dataset will be valuable for PBL process study, model evolution, and PBL parameterization improvement.","Optical Society of America","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Accurate Ts predictions at different spatial and temporal scales can inform water management decisions that account for the effects of changing climate and extreme events. In particular, widespread predictions of T<sub>s</sub> in unmonitored stream reaches can enable decision makers to be responsive to changes caused by unforeseen disturbances. In this study, we demonstrate the use of classical machine learning (ML) models, support vector regression and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost), for monthly T<sub>s</sub> predictions in 78 pristine and human-impacted catchments of the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest hydrologic regions spanning different geologies, climate, and land use. The ML models were trained using long-term monitoring data from 1980–2020 for three scenarios: (1) temporal predictions at a single site, (2) temporal predictions for multiple sites within a region, and (3) spatiotemporal predictions in unmonitored basins (PUB). In the first two scenarios, the ML models predicted Ts with median root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.69–0.84 °C and 0.92–1.02 °C across different model types for the temporal predictions at single and multiple sites respectively. For the PUB scenario, we used a bootstrap aggregation approach using models trained with different subsets of data, for which an ensemble XGBoost implementation outperformed all other modeling configurations (median RMSE 0.62 °C).The ML models improved median monthly T<sub>s</sub> estimates compared to baseline statistical multi-linear regression models by 15–48% depending on the site and scenario. Air temperature was found to be the primary driver of monthly T<sub>s</sub> for all sites, with secondary influence of month of the year (seasonality) and solar radiation, while discharge was a significant predictor at only 10 sites. The predictive performance of the ML models was robust to configuration changes in model setup and inputs, but was influenced by the distance to the nearest dam with RMSE <1 °C at sites situated greater than 16 and 44 km from a dam for the temporal single site and regional scenarios, and over 1.4 km from a dam for the PUB scenario. Our results show that classical ML models with solely meteorological inputs can be used for spatial and temporal predictions of monthly T<sub>s</sub> in pristine and managed basins with reasonable (<1 °C) accuracy for most locations.","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Here, we investigate paired soil and tree water extraction dynamics in an old-growth upland forest in central Amazonia during the 2018 dry season. Tree water use was assessed via radial patterns of sap flow in eight dominant canopy trees, each a different species with a range in diameter, height, and wood density. Paired multi-sensor soil moisture probes used to quantify volumetric water content dynamics and soil water extraction within the upper 100 cm were installed adjacent to six of those trees. To link depth-specific water extraction patterns to root distribution, fine root biomass was assessed through the soil profile to 235 cm. To scale tree water use to the plot level (stand transpiration), basal area was measured for all trees within a 5 m radius around each soil moisture probe. The sensitivity of tree transpiration to reduced precipitation varied by tree, with some increasing and some decreasing in water use during the dry period. Tree-level water use scaled with sapwood area, from 11 to 190 L per day. Stand level water use, based on multiple plots encompassing sap flow and adjacent trees, varied from ~1.7 to 3.3 mm per day, increasing linearly with plot basal area. Soil water extraction was dependent on root biomass, which was dense at the surface (i.e., 45% in the upper 5 cm) and declined dramatically with depth. As the dry season progressed and the upper soil dried, soil water extraction shifted to deeper levels and model projections suggest that much of the water used during the month-long dry-down could be extracted from the upper 2-3 m. Results indicate variation in rates of soil water extraction across the research area and, temporally, through the soil profile. These results provide key information on whole-tree contributions to transpiration by canopy trees as water availability changes. In addition, information on simultaneous stand level dynamics of soil water extraction that can inform mechanistic models that project tropical forest response to drought.","Frontiers Media SA","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model 4.0 was run over the month-long period of the Joint Urban 2003 field campaign conducted in Oklahoma City. We compare three different simulations in their ability to reproduce the observations, each using a different boundary-layer parametrization. Specifically, we examine the Mellor–Yamada–Janjic (MYJ), Yonsei University (YSU), and Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino (MYNN) boundary-layer parametrizations. All three predict the wind speed well during the day but overpredict it at night. The MYNN parametrization is better than MYJ at predicting the daytime turbulence in the surface layer, but both underpredict the nocturnal turbulence. Additionally, the MYJ parametrization is best at predicting the reciprocal Obukhov length, while MYNN and YSU both significantly overpredict thermal stability. Reconstructing the reciprocal Obukhov length from other simulated parameters produces more accurate values for both parametrizations. All three models overpredict the boundary-layer height, particularly under convective conditions. The MYJ parametrization overestimates boundary-layer height the most, while YSU and MYNN have comparable performance with MYNN having an advantage in predicting the stable boundary-layer height. Several days were found where the WRF simulations predict significant deviations from the prevailing diurnal pattern in wind direction, which are not found in the observations.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

How well the relationships and responses of surface radiative and turbulent heat fluxes determined from these investigations hold for more heterogeneous surfaces in other climate regimes, however, is uncertain. In this study, detailed observations of the surface energy budget and daytime boundary layer properties are analyzed using measurements from the Chequamegon Heterogenous Ecosystem Energy-Balance Study Enabled by a High-Density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 (CHEESEHEAD19) field campaign, July-October 2019, across a heterogeneous forested landscape of northern Wisconsin. A cloud regime framework is employed to classify consecutive periods of clear skies from lower atmosphere stratiform and cumulus clouds. A seasonal transition from low cumulus to low stratiform periods occurred, together with a diurnal pattern in cloudy or clear sky period dominance. Radiative forcing was highly dependent on sky conditions, leading to changes in the redistribution efficiency of radiative energy by the surface turbulent heat fluxes. During CHEESEHEAD19, small Bowen ratios dominated with daytime latent heat fluxes three times as large as sensible heat fluxes for all sky conditions studied; the forested region, therefore, falls within an energy-limited regime. The depth of the daytime mixed layer depended upon the sky condition and thermodynamic setting; deeper mixed layers occurred during periods of low cumulus and not clear skies. Profiles of vertical velocity were found to have enhanced variance under low cumulus compared to clear sky periods, suggesting potential for cloud feedbacks on boundary layer structure and surface energy fluxes.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

During the twenty-first century, the observation-constrained ensemble indicates a weaker increase in global fire carbon emissions but higher increase in global wildfire exposure in population, gross domestic production, and agricultural area, compared with the default ensemble. Such elevated socioeconomic risks are primarily caused by the compound regional enhancement of future wildfire activity and socioeconomic development in the western and central African countries, necessitating an emergent strategic preparedness to wildfires in these countries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Therefore, the effects of data assimilation (DA) to improve forecasts in the polar region were investigated for September 2017 using PWRF and the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) DA method. The experiments without DA and those with DA assimilating only conventional observations and both conventional observations and satellite radiance data were performed. The forecasts from all experiments both without and with DA underestimated (overestimated) the downward longwave (shortwave) radiation flux due to the underestimation of the amount of Arctic clouds. When satellite radiance data (i.e., the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS)) were assimilated in addition to conventional observations in the PWRF, the distribution and amount of water vapor became closer to observations, which improves cloud liquid water forecasts. Therefore, when both conventional observations and radiance data were assimilated, the 25–30 h forecast errors of the downward longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes and sensible and latent heat fluxes decreased by 12.7%, 8.1%, 3.2%, and 7.8% with the WSM5 scheme and by 17.1%, 4.7%, 2.5%, and 3.1% with the 2-moment Morrison scheme, respectively, compared to those in the experiments without DA. The forecast errors of the 10 m wind and 2 m temperature with DA were smaller than those without DA at most observation stations. Therefore, the uncertainties of the Arctic forecasts in the PWRF decreased when using DA. To further improve Arctic forecasts, the assimilation of various additional satellite data is necessary.","Elsevier","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

This positive feedback may be moderated by the response of peatland vegetation to rising atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub>] or to increased soil nutrient availability. We asked whether a gradient of whole-ecosystem warming (from + 0 °C to + 9 °C) would increase plant-available nitrogen and phosphorus in an ombrotrophic bog in northern Minnesota, USA, and whether elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] would modify the nutrient response. We tracked changes in plant-available nutrients across space and through time and in comparison with other nutrient pools, and assessed whether nutrient warming responses were captured by a point version of the land-surface model, ELM-SPRUCE. We found that warming exponentially increased plant-available ammonium and phosphate, but that nutrient dynamics were unaffected by elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>]. The warming response increased by an order of magnitude between the first and fourth year of the experimental manipulation, perhaps because of dramatic mortality of Sphagnum mosses in the surface peat of the warmest treatments. However, neither the magnitude nor the temporal dynamics of the responses were captured by ELM-SPRUCE. Here, relative increases in plant-available ammonium and phosphate with warming were similar, but the response varied across raised hummocks and depressed hollows and with peat depth. Plant-available nutrient dynamics were only loosely correlated with inorganic and organic porewater nutrients, likely representing different processes. Future predictions of peatland nutrient availability under climate change scenarios must account for dynamic changes in nutrient acquisition by plants and microbes, as well as microtopography and peat depth.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we explored structure-function relationships across a variety of degradation levels in the southern Brazilian Amazon by 1) investigating how forest structural properties vary as a function of degradation history using airborne lidar data; 2) assessing the effects of degradation on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) seasonality using TROPOMI data; and 3) quantifying the contribution of structural variables to SIF using multiple regression models with stepwise selection of lidar metrics. Forest degradation history was obtained through Landsat time-series classification. We found that fire, logging, and time since disturbance were major determinants of forest structure, and that forests affected by fires experienced larger variability in leaf area index (LAI), canopy height and vertical structure relative to logged and intact forests. Moreover, only recently burned forests showed significantly depressed SIF during the dry season compared to intact forests. Canopy height and the vertical distribution of foliage were the best predictors of SIF. Unexpectedly, we found that wet-season SIF was higher in active regenerating forests (~ 4 years after fires or logging) compared with intact forests, despite lower LAI. Furthermore, our findings help to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in anthropogenically disturbed tropical forests and indicate that they can capture large amounts of carbon while recovering.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We show that AR statistics from a given ARDT in CMIP5/6 historical simulations compare remarkably well with reanalysis. In CMIP5/6 future simulations, most ARDTs project a global increase in AR frequency, counts, and sizes, especially along the western coast lines of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. We nd that the choice of ARDT is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty in projected AR frequency when compared with model choice. These results imply that new projects investigating future changes in ARs should explicitly consider ARDT uncertainty as a core part of the experimental design.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Continental United States may lose 1.8 petagrams of soil organic carbon under climate change by 2100","Gautam, Sagar; Mishra, Umakant; Scown, Corinne D.; Wills, Skye A.; Adhikari, Kabindra; Drewniak, Beth A.; Waring, Bonnie G.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; climate; earth system model; environmental factor; future projection; machine learning; soil organic carbon","Aims: High-resolution information on soils’ vulnerability to climate-induced soil organic carbon (SOC) loss can enable environmental scientists, land managers, and policy makers to develop targeted mitigation strategies. This study aims to estimate baseline and decadal changes in continental US surface SOC stocks under future emission scenarios. Location: Continental United States. Time period: 2014–2100. Methods: We used recent SOC field observations (n = 6,213 sites), environmental factors (n = 32), and an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach to estimate baseline SOC stocks in surface soils across the continental United States at 100-m spatial resolution, and decadal changes under the projected climate scenarios of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase Six (CMIP6) earth system models (ESMs). Results: Baseline SOC projections from ML approaches captured more than 50% of variability in SOC observations, whereas ESMs represented only 6–16% of observed SOC variability. ML estimates showed a mean total loss of 1.8 Pg C from US surface soils under the high-emission scenario by 2100, whereas ESMs showed no significant change in SOC stocks with wide variation among ESMs. Both ML and ESM predictions agree on the direction of SOC change (net emissions or sequestration) across 46–51% of continental US land area. These differences are attributable to the high-resolution site-specific data used in the ML models compared to the relatively coarse grid represented in CMIP6 ESMs. Main conclusions: Our high-resolution estimates of baseline SOC stocks, identification of key environmental controllers, and projection of SOC changes from US land cover types under future climate scenarios suggest the need for high-resolution simulations of SOC in ESMs to represent the heterogeneity of SOC. We found that the SOC change is sensitive to key soil related factors (e.g. soil drainage and soil order) that have not been historically considered as input parameters in ESMs, because currently more than 95% variability in the SOC of CMIP6 ESMs is controlled by net primary productivity, temperature, and precipitation. Using additional environmental factors to estimate the baseline SOC stocks and predict the future trajectory of SOC change can provide more accurate results.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Sandia National Lab.

The scarcity of observations in the Arctic has limited our understanding of the impact of covarying environmental drivers on the carbon balance of tundra ecosystems. In this study, we address some of these uncertainties through a novel record of 119 site-years of summer data from eddy covariance towers representing dominant tundra vegetation types located on continuous permafrost in the Arctic. Here we found that earlier snowmelt was associated with more tundra net CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and higher gross primary productivity (GPP) only in June and July, but with lower net carbon sequestration and lower GPP in August. Although higher evapotranspiration (ET) can result in soil drying with the progression of the summer, we did not find significantly lower soil moisture with earlier snowmelt, nor evidence that water stress affected GPP in the late growing season. Our results suggest that the expected increased CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration arising from Arctic warming and the associated increase in growing season length may not materialize if tundra ecosystems are not able to continue sequestering CO<sub>2</sub> later in the season.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

To help mitigate this problem, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) has supported research since the late 1980s to improve our fundamental knowledge of processes that could be used to help clean up challenging subsurface problems. Problems of interest have included subsurface radioactive waste, heavy metals, and metalloids (e.g. uranium, mercury, arsenic). Research efforts have provided insights into detailed groundwater biogeochemical process coupling and the resulting geochemical exports of metals and nutrients to surrounding environments. Recently, an increased focus has been placed on constraining the exchanges and fates of carbon and nitrogen within and across bedrock to canopy compartments of a watershed and in river–floodplain settings, because of their important role in driving biogeochemical interactions with contaminants and the potential of increased fluxes under changing precipitation regimes, including extreme events. While reviewing the extensive research that has been conducted at DOE's representative sites and testbeds (such as the Oyster Site in Virginia, Savannah River Site in South Carolina, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, Hanford in Washington, Nevada National Security Site in Nevada, Riverton in Wyoming, and Rifle and East River in Colorado), this review paper explores the nature and distribution of contaminants in the surface and shallow subsurface (i.e. the critical zone) and their interactions with carbon and nitrogen dynamics. We also describe state-of-the-art, scale-aware characterization approaches and models developed to predict contaminant fate and transport. The models take advantage of DOE leadership-class high-performance computers and are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence approaches to tackle the extreme diversity of hydro-biogeochemical processes and measurements. Recognizing that the insights and capability developments are potentially transferable to many other sites, we also explore the scientific implications of these advances and recommend future research directions.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Several global TC metrics have decreased during this period, with significant decreases in hurricane numbers and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). Most of this decrease has been driven by significant downward trends in the western North Pacific. Globally, short-lived named storms, 24-hr intensification events of ≥50 kt day<sup>–1</sup>, and TC-related damage have increased significantly. The increase in short-lived named storms is likely due to technological improvements, while rapidly intensifying TC increases may be fueled by higher potential intensity. Damage increases are largely due to increased coastal assets. The significant decrease in hurricane numbers and global ACE are likely due to the trend toward a more La Niña-like base state from 1990 to 2021, favoring North Atlantic TC activity and suppressing North and South Pacific TC activity.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States); Mississippi State Univ., Starkville, MS (United States); North Carolina State Univ., Asheville, NC (United States); Aon, Chicago, IL (United States); Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

In this work, we first compile a detailed country-level global crude-oil transportation network in 2018 and estimate that the direct and well-to-hull GHG emissions related to crude transportation were 97 and 109 million metric tons, respectively. Combining with the country-specific crude recovery GHG intensities, the consumption-based well-to-country-gate crude-oil GHG intensities are derived for individual countries, ranging from 2.99 to 27.32 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ, with a global crude-volume-weighted average of 8.67 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ. We then project the global crude transportation emissions at the regional level in 2050 under a static (no change) scenario (based on current ship energy efficiency) and a sustainable-development (SD) scenario (based on the International Energy Agency's projections of ship energy efficiency and penetration of alternative marine fuels). Results show that the global well-to-hull GHG emissions related to crude transportation would be 82 and 59 million metric tons in 2050 in the static and SD scenarios, respectively. To further evaluate the impact of potential fuel-switching on decarbonizing the crude oil transportation sector, we estimate the GHG emissions for 20 fuel/production options in 2050. We find that, in comparison to the static scenario, ~50% reduction in global well-to-hull GHG emissions from crude transportation could be achieved under the SD scenario if green ammonia further replaces conventional ammonia. The methodology developed here can be applied to other commodities to estimate the emissions associated with their global marine transportation and to evaluate the potential emission mitigation options.","Wiley - Yale University","","Argonne National Lab.

"Towards physics-inspired data-driven weather forecasting: integrating data assimilation with a deep spatial-transformer-based U-NET in a case study with ERA5","Chattopadhyay, Ashesh; Mustafa, Mustafa; Hassanzadeh, Pedram (ORCID:0000000194258085); Bach, Eviatar (ORCID:0000000297250203); Kashinath, Karthik","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. There is growing interest in data-driven weather prediction (DDWP), e.g., using convolutional neural networks such as U-NET that are trained on data from models or reanalysis. Here, we propose three components, inspired by physics, to integrate with commonly used DDWP models in order to improve their forecast accuracy. These components are (1) a deep spatial transformer added to the latent space of U-NET to capture rotation and scaling transformation in the latent space for spatiotemporal data, (2) a data-assimilation (DA) algorithm to ingest noisy observations and improve the initial conditions for next forecasts, and (3) a multi-time-step algorithm, which combines forecasts from DDWP models with different time steps through DA, improving the accuracy of forecasts at short intervals. To show the benefit and feasibility of each component, we use geopotential height at 500 hPa (Z500) from ERA5 reanalysis and examine the short-term forecast accuracy of specific setups of the DDWP framework. Results show that the spatial-transformer-based U-NET (U-STN) clearly outperforms the U-NET, e.g., improving the forecast skill by 45 %. Using a sigma-point ensemble Kalman (SPEnKF) algorithm for DA and U-STN as the forward model, we show that stable, accurate DA cycles are achieved even with high observation noise. This DDWP+DA framework substantially benefits from large (O(1000)) ensembles that are inexpensively generated with the data-driven forward model in each DA cycle. The multi-time-step DDWP+DA framework also shows promise; for example, it reduces the average error by factors of 2–3. These results show the benefits and feasibility of these three components, which are flexible and can be used in a variety of DDWP setups. Furthermore, while here we focus on weather forecasting, the three components can be readily adopted for other parts of the Earth system, such as ocean and land, for which there is a rapid growth of data and need for forecast and assimilation.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

We examine how the boundary layer depth and distribution of variability across scales are affected by LES grid spacing, domain size, inhomogeneity of surface properties, and external forcing. Two different setups of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are analyzed. A semi-idealized configuration uses a periodic domain, flat surface, prescribed homogeneous surface heat fluxes, and horizontally uniform profiles of large-scale advective tendencies. A nested LES setup employs a larger domain and realistic initial and boundary conditions, including an interactive land surface model with representative topography and vegetation and soil types. Subdomains of identical size are analyzed for all simulations. Characteristic structure sizes are quantified using the variability scales <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>95</jats:sub>, defined such that features smaller than that contain 50% and 95% of the total variance, respectively. Progressive increase in <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub> from vertical velocity to temperature and moisture structures is systematically reproduced in all simulation configurations. This dependence of <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>50</jats:sub> on the considered variable complicates the development of scale-aware parameterizations for models with grid spacing in the “terra incognita”. In simulations using a larger domain with heterogeneous surface properties, the development of internal mesoscale patterns significantly affects variance distributions inside analyzed subdomains. Sizes of boundary layer structures also strongly depend on the LES grid spacing and, in case of heterogeneous surface and topography, on location of the subdomain inside a larger computational domain.","American Meteorological Society","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Insights on sources and formation mechanisms of liquid-bearing clouds over MOSAiC examined from a Lagrangian framework","Silber, Israel; Shupe, Matthew D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Arctic clouds; Supercooled clouds; Cloud formation mechanisms; MOSAiC; ERA5; Lagrangian analysis","<jats:p>Understanding Arctic stratiform liquid-bearing cloud life cycles and properly representing these life cycles in models is crucial for evaluations of cloud feedbacks as well as the faithfulness of climate projections for this rapidly warming region. Examination of cloud life cycles typically requires analyses of cloud evolution and origins on short time scales, on the order of hours to several days. Measurements from the recent Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition provide a unique view of the current state of the central Arctic over an annual cycle. Here, we use the MOSAiC radiosonde measurements to detect liquid-bearing cloud layers over full atmospheric columns and to examine the cloud-generating air masses’ properties. We perform 5-day (120 h) back-trajectory calculations for every detected cloud and cluster them using a unique set of variables extracted from these trajectories informed by ERA5 reanalysis data. This clustering method enables us to separate between the air mass source regions such as ice-covered Arctic and midlatitude open water. We find that moisture intrusions into the central Arctic typically result in multilayer liquid-bearing cloud structures and that more than half of multilayer profiles include overlying liquid-bearing clouds originating in different types of air masses. Finally, we conclude that Arctic cloud formation via prolonged radiative cooling of elevated stable subsaturated air masses circulating over the Arctic can occur frequently (up to 20% of detected clouds in the sounding data set) and may lead to a significant impact of ensuing clouds on the surface energy budget, including net surface warming in some cases.</jats:p>","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Rain Drop Size Distributions Estimated from NOAA Snow-Level Radar Data","Johnston, Paul E.; Williams, Christopher R.; White, Allen B.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; drop size distribution; profilers; precipitation; radar observations; algorithms; atmospheric; radars","Using NOAA’s S-band High-Power Snow-Level Radar (HPSLR), a technique for estimating the rain drop size distribution (DSD) above the radar is presented. This technique assumes the DSD can be described by a four parameter, generalized gamma distribution (GGD). Using the radar’s measured average Doppler velocity spectrum and a value (assumed, measured, or estimated) of the vertical air motion w, an estimate of the GGD is obtained. Four different methods can be used to obtain w. One method that estimates a mean mass-weighted raindrop diameter D<sub>m</sub> from the measured reflectivity Z produces realistic DSDs compared to prior literature examples. These estimated DSDs provide evidence that the radar can retrieve the smaller drop sizes constituting the “drizzle” mode part of the DSD.

"Geochemical Modeling of Celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>) Precipitation and Reactive Transport in Shales","Esteves, Barbara F.; Spielman-Sun, Eleanor; Li, Qingyun; Jew, Adam D.; Bargar, John R.; Druhan, Jennifer L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; celestite precipitation; sulfate mineral scaling; reactive transport; geochemical modeling; hydraulic fracturing fluids","Celestite (SrSO<sub>4</sub>) precipitation is a prevalent example of secondary sulfate mineral scaling issues in hydraulic fracturing systems, particularly in basins where large concentrations of naturally occurring strontium are present. Herein, we present a validated and flexible geochemical model capable of predicting celestite formation under such unconventional environments. Simulations were built using CrunchFlow and guided by experimental data derived from batch reactors. These data allowed the constraint of key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for celestite precipitation under relevant synthetic hydraulic fracturing fluid conditions. Effects of ionic strength, saturation index, and the presence of additives were considered in the combined experimental and modeling construction. This geochemical model was then expanded into a more complex system where interactions between hydraulic fracturing fluids and shale rocks were allowed to occur subject to diffusive transport. We find that the carbonate content of a given shale and the presence of persulfate breaker in the system strongly impact the location and extent of celestite formation. The results of this study provide a novel multicomponent reactive transport model that may be used to guide future experimental design in the pursuit of celestite and other sulfate mineral scale mitigation under extreme conditions typical of hydraulic fracturing in shale formations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); University of Arizona (ALEC), Tucson, AZ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2022-03-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 4336-4344","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; DE-AC02-76SF00515; TRN: US2307268","10.1021/acs.est.1c07717","","2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","1875843","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1875843","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1875843","Environmental Science and Technology","7","56"

Here, the molecular composition and light-absorbing properties of BrC chromophores were unraveled by application of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a photodiode array (PDA) detector and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The chromophores were classified into five major types, that is, (1) phenolic/lignin-derived compounds, (2) flavonoids, (3) nitroaromatics, (4) oxygenated aromatics, and (5) other chromophores. Identified chromophores account for ~23–64% of the total light absorption measured by the PDA detector in the wavelength range of 300–370 nm. In the representative samples from urban and remote areas, oxygenated aromatics and nitroaromatics dominate the absorption in the wavelengths below and above 320 nm, respectively. The highly polluted urban sample shows the most complex HPLC-PDA chromatogram, and more other chromophores contribute to the bulk absorption. Phenolic/ lignin-derived compounds are the most light-absorbing species in the soil-influenced sample. Chromophores in two remote samples exhibit ultraviolet–visible features distinct from other samples, which are attributed to flavonoids. Identification of individual chromophores and quantitative analysis of their optical properties are helpful for elucidating the roles of BrC in snow radiative balance and photochemistry.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States); Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The results show: (1) The liquid fraction in Arctic stratiform clouds decreased from 1 to 0.6 between 0 °C and -30 °C and was lower in spring because of the higher dust occurrence in Barrow, Alaska; (2) In wintertime orographic clouds, the liquid fraction was greater than 0.8; (3) Phase partitioning in convective clouds varied significantly with life stages. In the developing stage, it decreased from 1 to 0.3 between -5 °C and -15 °C, indicating rapid ice generation, while at the mature and dissipating stages, the liquid fractions were lower; (4) The stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems were dominated by ice, with liquid fractions lower than 0.2; and (5) The variability of phase partitioning varied for different cloud types. In stratiform clouds, liquid dominated at warm temperatures. As the temperature decreased, an ice-dominated region was more frequently observed, while the occurrence of the mixed-phase region remained low. For convective clouds, the variability of phase partitioning was controlled by continuous glaciation with decreasing temperature and life cycle.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Trends in Downwelling Longwave Radiance Over the Southern Great Plains","Liu, Lei; Huang, Yi; Gyakum, John R.; Turner, David D.; Gero, P. Jonathan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Downwelling longwave radiation is an important part of the surface energy budget. Spectral trends in the downwelling longwave radiance (DLR) provide insight into the radiative drivers of climate change. In this research, we process and analyze a 23-year DLR record measured by the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) at the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. Two AERIs were deployed at SGP with an overlapping observation period of about 10 years, which allows us to examine the consistency and accuracy of the measurements and to account for discrepancies between them due to errors associated with the instruments themselves. We then analyzed the all-sky radiance trends in DLR, which are associated with the surface warming trend at SGP during this same period and also the complex changes in meteorological conditions. For instance, the observed radiance in the CO2 absorption band follows closely the near-surface air temperature variations. The significant positive radiance trends in weak absorption channels, such as in the wings of the CO<sub>2</sub> band and in the weak absorption channels in the H<sub>2</sub>O vibration-rotational band, show earlier detectability of climate change. The magnitude of the radiance trend uncertainty in the DLR record mainly results from internal climate variability rather than from measurement error, which highlights the importance of continuing the DLR spectral measurements to unambiguously detect and attribute climate change.","American Geophysical Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Variable Inhibition of Nitrous Oxide Reduction in Denitrifying Bacteria by Different Forms of Methanobactin","Chang, Jin; Peng, Peng; DiSpirito, Alan A.; Semrau, Jeremy D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; copper; denitrifier; methane; methanobactin; methanotrophy; nitrous oxide","Aerobic methanotrophic activity is highly dependent on copper availability, and methanotrophs have developed multiple strategies to collect copper. Specifically, when copper is limiting (ambient concentrations < 1 μM), some methanotrophs produce and secret a small modified peptide (< 1,300 Da) termed methanobactin (MB) that binds copper with high affinity. As MB is secreted into the environment, other microbes that require copper for their metabolism may be inhibited as MB may make copper unavailable; e.g., inhibition of denitrifiers as complete conversion nitrate to dinitrogen involves multiple enzymes, some of which are copper-dependent. Of key concern is inhibition of the copper-dependent nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ), the only known enzyme capable of converting nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) to dinitrogen. Herein, we show that different forms of MB differentially affect copper uptake and N2O reduction by Pseudomonas stutzeri strain DCP-Ps1 (that expresses clade I NosZ) and Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB (that expresses clade II NosZ). Specifically, in the presence of MB from Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 (SB2-MB), copper uptake and nosZ expression were more significantly reduced than in the presence of MB from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (OB3b-MB). Further, N2O accumulation increased more significantly for both P. stutzeri strain DCP-Ps1 and D. aromatica strain RCB in the presence of SB2-MB versus OB3b-MB. These data illustrate that copper competition between methanotrophs and denitrifying bacteria can be significant and that the extent of such competition is dependent on the form of MB that methanotrophs produce.","American Society for Microbiology","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2022-03-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied and Environmental Microbiology; Journal Volume: 88; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 02346-21","","","SC0020174","Journal ID: ISSN 0099-2240","10.1128/aem.02346-21","","2023-03-14T00:00:00Z","1865104","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1865104","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1865104","Applied and Environmental Microbiology","7","88"
"Seamless Projections of Global Storm Surge and Ocean Waves Under a Warming Climate","Shimura, T.; Pringle, W. J.; Mori, N.; Miyashita, T.; Yoshida, K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","For coastal adaptation purposes, it is important to estimate the climate related changes in extreme sea levels due to storm surges and ocean waves, in addition to mean sea level rise. In this study, we provide the first consistent and continuous estimation of projected changes in global storm surges and ocean waves from the past to the warmer future, based on an extremely high resolution global climate model. The spatial pattern in the trend of annual maximum sea surface heights and wave heights is predominantly driven by changes in tropical cyclone (TC) frequency. In the western North Pacific, future TC frequencies are projected to decrease, and the annual maximum sea surface heights and wave heights show decreasing trends (-20 cm/century and -200 cm/century). Although highly intense tropical cyclones are enhanced in the warmer climate, highly extreme storm surges and wave heights do not necessarily increase due to the large natural variability.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, oxic and laboratory-reduced soils from the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory and Long-Term Ecological Research site in Puerto Rico were characterized by variable 57Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy to gain insights into reduction-induced sequential Fe-SRO mineralogical changes. Mössbauer spectra generated at multiple temperatures (room temperature, 225 K, 77 K and 8 K) suggest: i) SRO minerals of oxic soil is primarily a mixture of Al-goethites of varying Al-content (83% of the total Fe) with minor contributions from ferrihydrite (~4%) and Fe(III)-organic phases (~13%); ii) Fe/Al-SRO undergoes significant rapid changes in mineralogy within 30 minutes, likely due to incongruent removal of Al and Fe from SRO (based on 225 K and 77 K spectra); and iii) relatively Al-poor Fe-SRO is remarkably stable towards further mineralogical changes. More importantly, Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements unambiguously suggest rapid increase in crystallinity of Fe-SRO with reduction given the inverse relationship between Al-content and crystallinity. In contrast, incongruent removal of Fe and Al from the soils was not evident from ammonium-oxalate (AO) and citrate-dithionite (CD) extractions employed to quantify amorphous and crystalline Fe-oxide contents, respectively. Adsorption of biogenic Al to residual SRO’s appeared to be responsible for such an inconsistency. Pyrophosphate (PP) extractions employed to estimate sorbed OM contents mimicked AO data suggesting likely association of C with AO soluble Fe/Al-oxide phase. Lack of correlation between Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements and selective chemical extraction results suggest soil SRO transformation mechanisms are complex and cautions overemphasis of operationally defined selective chemical extraction data to interpret mineralogical changes. Additionally, coupled Mössbauer spectroscopy and selective chemical extraction data measurements clearly hinted association of reactive Fe with C.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is expected to provide substantial improvement for mapping temporal changes in evergreen gross primary production (GPP) over greenness-based remote sensing indices. The utility of SIF to monitor seasonal changes in the phenology of conifer photosynthesis depends on the degree to which GPP and SIF respond in synchrony to key environmental drivers. However, to what extent SIF and GPP become decoupled by responding differently to the combined effects of light and other environmental conditions remains unknown. The goal of this study was to characterize the responses of GPP and SIFred to a suite of environmental drivers at the half-hour time scale and determine how these relationships change across seasons. We analyzed one year of tower-based SIFred and eddy covariance-derived GPP data from a conifer forest at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. We compared the light responses of GPP and SIFred across the year, finding that SIFred increased in response to light earlier in the year than did GPP. The light response of GPP had a positive temperature dependence in spring, and this dependency reversed in summer due to increased evaporative demand, while the light response of SIFred was less temperature dependent. Using artificial neural network ensemble analysis, we found that from spring to summer, SIFred did not exhibit a parallel response to the seasonally dynamic temperature and moisture controls on GPP. In summer SIFred was not correlated with canopy conductance, suggesting that SIF is less sensitive to stomatal control than GPP. Furthermore, our results suggest that, in conifers, photosystems begin to activate in spring prior to when water becomes available for photosynthesis, presenting a challenge for the use of SIF as a phenological indicator in conifer forests.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-03-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Agricultural and Forest Meteorology; Journal Volume: 317","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 108904","","","AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 0168-1923; 7542010","10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108904","","2023-03-29T00:00:00Z","1957816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1957816","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1957816","Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","","317"

Here, we show that the emissions associated with reducing air humidity (i.e., removing water vapor from air) are larger than emissions associated with reducing air temperature (i.e., cooling air). We calculate these emissions for today and 2050 and show how dramatically humidity-related emissions will increase with rising cooling demand around the world.

"Heterogeneous climate change impacts on electricity demand in world cities circa mid-century","Romitti, Yasmin; Wing, Ian Sue","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; Climate-change impacts; Energy supply and demand","Rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will increase urban populations’ exposures to extreme heat. During hot hours, a key protective adaptation is increased air conditioning and associated consumption of electricity for cooling. But during cold hours, milder temperatures have the offsetting effect of reducing consumption of electricity and other fuels for heating. We elucidate the net consequences of these opposing effects in 36 cities in different world regions. We couple reduced-form statistical models of cities’ hourly responses of electric load to temperature with temporally downscaled projections of temperatures simulated by 21 global climate models (GCMs), projecting the effects of warming on the demand for electricity circa 2050. Cities' responses, temperature exposures and impacts are heterogeneous, with changes in total annual consumption ranging from –2.7 to 5.7%, and peak power demand increasing by as much as 9.5% at the multi-GCM median. The largest increases are concentrated in more economically developed mid-latitude cities, with less developed urban areas in the tropics exhibiting relatively small changes. The results highlight the important role of the structure of electricity demand: large temperature increases in tropical cities are offset by their inelastic responses, which can be attributed to lower air-conditioning penetration.","Nature Publishing Group","","Boston Univ., MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-03-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientific Reports; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Related Information: Paper is open access but URL wasn't accepted by the form.","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 4280","","","SC0016162","Journal ID: ISSN 2045-2322; DGE 1735087","10.1038/s41598-022-07922-w","","2022-06-07T00:00:00Z","1856781","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1856781","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1856781","Scientific Reports","1","12"

A significant portion of the Arctic coastal plain is classified as polygonal tundra and plays a vital role in soil carbon cycling. Recent research suggests that lateral transport of dissolved carbon could exceed vertical carbon releases to the atmosphere. However, the details of lateral subsurface flow in polygonal tundra have not been well studied. We incorporated a subsurface transport process into an existing state-of-the-art hydrothermal model. The model captures the physical effects of freeze–thaw cycles on lateral flow in polygonal tundra. The new modeling capability enables non-reactive tracer movement within subsurface. We utilized this new capability to investigate the impact of freeze–thaw cycles on lateral flow in the polygonal tundra. Our study indicates the important role of freeze–thaw cycles and the freeze-up effect in lateral tracer transport, suggesting that dissolved species could be transported from the middle of the polygon to the sides within a couple of thaw seasons. Introducing lateral carbon transport into the climate models could substantially reduce the uncertainty associated with the impact of thawing permafrost.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Buffering the impacts of extreme climate variability in the highly engineered Tigris Euphrates river system","Abdelmohsen, Karem; Sultan, Mohamed; Save, Himanshu; Abotalib, Abotalib Z.; Yan, Eugene; Zahran, Khaled H.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; hydrology; natural hazards","More extreme and prolonged floods and droughts, commonly attributed to global warming, are affecting the livelihood of major sectors of the world’s population in many basins worldwide. While these events could introduce devastating socioeconomic impacts, highly engineered systems are better prepared for modulating these extreme climatic variabilities. Herein, we provide methodologies to assess the effectiveness of reservoirs in managing extreme floods and droughts and modulating their impacts in data-scarce river basins. Our analysis of multiple satellite missions and global land surface models over the Tigris-Euphrates Watershed (TEW; 30 dams; storage capacity: 250 km<sup>3</sup>), showed a prolonged (2007–2018) and intense drought (Average Annual Precipitation [AAP]: < 400 km<sup>3</sup>) with no parallels in the past 100 years (AAP during 1920–2020: 538 km<sup>3</sup>) followed by 1-in-100-year extensive precipitation event (726 km<sup>3</sup>) and an impressive recovery (113 ± 11 km<sup>3</sup>) in 2019 amounting to 50% of losses endured during drought years. Dam reservoirs captured water equivalent to 40% of those losses in that year. Additional studies are required to investigate whether similar highly engineered watersheds with multi-year, high storage capacity can potentially modulate the impact of projected global warming-related increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall and drought events in the twenty-first century.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

California’s Tulare Basin is no exception, experiencing about a meter of subsidence between 2015 and 2020. However, understanding the relationship between changes in groundwater volumes and ground deformation has proven difficult. We employ surface displacement measurements from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and gravimetric estimates of terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair to characterize the hydrological dynamics within the Tulare basin. The removal of the long-term aquifer compaction from the InSAR time series reveals coherent short-term variations that correlate with hydrological features. For example, in the winter of 2018–2019 uplift is observed at the confluence of several rivers and streams that drain into the southeastern edge of the basin. These observations, combined with estimates of mass changes obtained from the orbiting GRACE satellites, form the basis for imaging the monthly spatial variations in water volumes. This approach facilitates the quick and effective synthesis of InSAR and gravimetric datasets and will aid efforts to improve our understanding and management of groundwater resources around the world.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

This is particularly true for the so-called Arctic haze season (January through April). In summer (June through September), when atmospheric transport patterns change, and precipitation is more frequent, local Arctic sources, i.e., natural sources of aerosols and precursors, play an important role. Over the last few decades, significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions have taken place. At the same time a large body of literature shows evidence that the Arctic is undergoing fundamental environmental changes due to climate forcing, leading to enhanced emissions by natural processes that may impact aerosol properties. In this study, we analyze 9 aerosol chemical species and 4 particle optical properties from 10 Arctic observatories (Alert, Kevo, Pallas, Summit, Thule, Tiksi, Barrow/Utgiavik, Villum, and Gruvebadet and Zeppelin Observatory – both at Ny-Ålesund Research Station) to understand changes in anthropogenic and natural aerosol contributions. Variables include equivalent black carbon, particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, methanesulfonic acid, sodium, iron, calcium and potassium, as well as scattering and absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo and scattering Ångström exponent. First, annual cycles are investigated, which despite anthropogenic emission reductions still show the Arctic haze phenomenon. Second, long-term trends are studied using the Mann–Kendall Theil–Sen slope method. We find in total 41 significant trends over full station records, i.e., spanning more than a decade, compared to 26 significant decadal trends. The majority of significantly declining trends is from anthropogenic tracers and occurred during the haze period, driven by emission changes between 1990 and 2000. For the summer period, no uniform picture of trends has emerged. Twenty-six percent of trends, i.e., 19 out of 73, are significant, and of those 5 are positive and 14 are negative. Negative trends include not only anthropogenic tracers such as equivalent black carbon at Kevo, but also natural indicators such as methanesulfonic acid and non-sea-salt calcium at Alert. Positive trends are observed for sulfate at Gruvebadet. No clear evidence of a significant change in the natural aerosol contribution can be observed yet. However, testing the sensitivity of the Mann–Kendall Theil–Sen method, we find that monotonic changes of around 5 % yr<sup>–1</sup> in an aerosol property are needed to detect a significant trend within one decade. This highlights that long-term efforts well beyond a decade are needed to capture smaller changes. It is particularly important to understand the ongoing natural changes in the Arctic, where interannual variability can be high, such as with forest fire emissions and their influence on the aerosol population. To investigate the climate-change-induced influence on the aerosol population and the resulting climate feedback, long-term observations of tracers more specific to natural sources are needed, as well as of particle microphysical properties such as size distributions, which can be used to identify changes in particle populations which are not well captured by mass-oriented methods such as bulk chemical composition.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

While they have growing public and private support, the realizable benefits and unintended consequences of NbCS are not well understood. At regional scales where policy decisions are often made, NbCS benefits are estimated from soil and tree survey data that can miss important carbon sources and sinks within an ecosystem, and do not reveal the biophysical impacts of NbCS for local water and energy cycles. The only direct observations of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes, for example, by eddy covariance flux towers, have not yet been systematically assessed for what they can tell us about NbCS potentials, and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and land-surface models are not yet being widely used to inform NbCS policymaking or implementation. As a result, there is a critical mismatch between the point- and tree-scale data most often used to assess NbCS benefits and impacts, the ecosystem and landscape scales where NbCS projects are implemented, and the regional to continental scales most relevant to policymaking. Here, we propose a research agenda to confront these gaps using data and tools that have long been used to understand the mechanisms driving ecosystem carbon and energy cycling, but have not yet been widely applied to NbCS. Furthermore, we outline steps for creating robust NbCS assessments at both local to regional scales that are informed by ecosystem-scale observations, and which consider concurrent biophysical impacts, future climate feedbacks, and the need for equitable and inclusive NbCS implementation strategies. We contend that these research goals can largely be accomplished by shifting the scales at which pre-existing tools are applied and blended together, although we also highlight some opportunities for more radical shifts in approach.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To improve dynamical seasonal forecasts, it is crucial to set up forecast benchmarks, and clarify forecast limitations posed by model initialization errors, formulation deficiencies, and internal climate variability. With huge costs in generating large forecast ensembles, and limited observations for forecast verification, the seasonal forecast benchmarking and diagnosing task proves challenging. Here, we develop a probabilistic deep learning-based statistical forecast methodology, drawing on a wealth of climate simulations to enhance seasonal forecast capability and forecast diagnosis. By explicitly modeling the internal climate variability and GCM formulation differences, the proposed Conditional Generative Forecasting (CGF) methodology enables bypassing crucial barriers in dynamical forecast, and offers a top-down viewpoint to examine how complicated GCMs encode the seasonal predictability information. We apply the CGF methodology for global seasonal forecast of precipitation and 2 m air temperature, based on a unique data set consisting 52,201 years of climate simulation. Results show that the CGF methodology can faithfully represent the seasonal predictability information encoded in GCMs. We successfully apply this learned relationship in real-world seasonal forecast, achieving competitive performance compared to dynamical forecasts. Using this CGF as benchmark, we reveal the impact of insufficient forecast spread sampling that limits the skill of the considered dynamical forecast system. Finally, we introduce different strategies for composing ensembles using the CGF methodology, highlighting the potential for leveraging the strengths of multiple GCMs to achieve advantgeous seasonal forecast.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Orographic enhancement of rainfall over the Congo Basin","Raghavendra, Ajay; Xia, Geng; Zhou, Liming; Jiang, Yan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Congo rainforest; orographic forcing; tropical convection; WRF model","The Congo rainforest located in central equatorial Africa is an important, yet understudied part of the globe surrounded by complex orographic features. A primitive understanding of precipitation processes such as mesoscale convective dynamics magnifies uncertainties in the future climate projections of the hydrological cycle over the Congo. Furthermore, the effects of orography, which is an important forcing for convection and precipitation, are poorly resolved by climate models, and ill-conceptualized over the Congo. To address this knowledge gap, perturbed orographic forcing experiments are conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale numerical model in a high-resolution convection-permitting model setup. The model simulated selected dates in November 2014. The thunderstorms and rainfall simulated in the control run for the case study analyzed in this article compared reasonably well to satellite-derived brightness temperature and rainfall data. The results from this case study show that the dynamical impact of increasing the height of the East African Highlands is the blocking of the lower-tropospheric tropical easterlies. This weakening of the lower-tropospheric zonal winds increases the windshear over the Congo Basin resulting in slower propagating, more intense mesoscale convective systems with enhanced rainfall.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, as the rain rate increases, there are combinations of rain rate and rain path length that produce sufficient attenuation to prevent the radar from detecting raindrops all the way through rain shafts. This study explores the question: Which rain rate and path length combinations completely extinguish radar return signals for VPRs operating between 3 and 200 GHz? An important step in these simulations is converting attenuated radar reflectivity factor into radar received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in order to determine the range where the SNR drops below the receiver detection threshold. Configuring the simulations to mimic a U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Mission (ARM) W-band (95 GHz) radar deployed in Brazil, the simulation results indicate that a W-band radar could observe raindrops above 3.5 km only when the rain rate was less than approximately 4 mm h<sup>-1</sup>. The deployed W-band radar measurements confirm the simulation results with maximum observed heights ranging between 3 and 4.5 km when a surface disdrometer measured 4 mm h<sup>-1</sup> rain rate (based on 25-to-75 percentiles from over 25,000 W-band radar profiles). In summary, this study contributes to our understanding of how rain and atmospheric gas attenuation impacts the performance of millimeter-wave VPRs and will help with the design and configuration of multi-frequency VPRs deployed in future field campaigns.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Westward-Propagating Moisture Mode Over the Tropical Western Hemisphere","Mayta, Víctor C.; Adames, Ángel F.; Ahmed, Fiaz","54 Environmental Sciences","A westward-propagating Rossby-like wave signal is found to explain a large fraction of the intraseasonal variance in cloud brightness over the Western Hemisphere. A series of diagnostic criteria suggest that this wave is a moisture mode: its moisture anomalies dominate the distribution of moist static energy (MSE) and are in phase with the precipitation anomalies; and the thermodynamic equation obeys the weak temperature gradient approximation. Further, the wave propagates westward due to zonal moisture advection by the mean flow and is maintained by radiative heating and meridional moisture advection. These properties compare favorably with the westward propagating Rossby mode in an equatorial beta-plane model with prognostic moisture, mean meridional moisture gradient, and mean zonal wind. These results underscore the importance of water vapor in the dynamics of slowly evolving tropical systems, and the limitations of dry shallow water theory that rely on a “reduced equivalent depth” to represent moist dynamics.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

In this study, we performed simulations of selected cases from the deployment using a 5-km configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to see if simulated hub height speeds could produce closer agreement with the observations than existing reanalysis products. For each case we performed two additional simulations: one in which marine surface roughness height was one-way coupled to forecast wave parameters from a standalone WaveWatch III (WW3) simulation, and another in which WRF and WW3 were two-way coupled using the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment-Transport (COAWST) framework. It was found that all the 5-km WRF simulations improved 90-m wind speed statistics for the tropical cyclone case of 08 May 2015 and the cold frontal case of 25 Mar 2016, but not the nor-easter of 18 Jan 2016. The impact of wave coupling on buoy-level (4 m) wind speed was modest and case dependent, but when present, the impact was typically seen at 90 m as well, being as large as 10% in stable conditions. One-way wave coupling consistently reduced wind speeds, improving biases for 25 Mar 2016 but worsening them for 08 May 2015. Two-way wave coupling mitigated these negative biases, improved wave field representation and statistics, and mostly improved 4-m wind field correlation coefficients, at least at the VA buoy, largely due to greater self-consistency between wind and wave fields.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Accurate prediction of CAP dynamics presents a challenge for mesoscale forecast models, in part because CAPs occur in regions of complex terrain, where traditional turbulence parameterizations may not be appropriate. This study examines the effects of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme and horizontal diffusion treatment on CAP prediction in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Model runs with a one-dimensional (1D) PBL scheme and Smagorinsky-like horizontal diffusion are compared to runs that use a new three-dimensional (3D) PBL scheme to calculate turbulent fluxes. Simulations are completed in a nested configuration with 3 km/750 m horizontal grid spacing over a 10-day case study in the Columbia River basin, and results are compared to observations from the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project. Using event-averaged error metrics, potential temperature and wind speed errors are shown to decrease both with increased horizontal grid resolution, and with improved treatment of horizontal diffusion over steep terrain. The 3D PBL scheme further reduces errors relative to a standard 1D PBL approach. Error reduction is accentuated during CAP erosion, when turbulent mixing plays a more dominant role in the dynamics. Lastly, the 3D PBL scheme is shown to reduce near-surface overestimates of turbulence kinetic energy during the CAP event. The sensitivity of turbulence predictions to the master length scale formulation in the 3D PBL parameterization is also explored.","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Warming temperatures may increase wetland plant productivity and organic matter accumulation, but temperature-modulated feedbacks between productivity and decomposition make it difficult to assess how wetlands and their thick, organic rich soils will respond to climate warming. Here, we actively increased aboveground plant-surface and below-ground soil temperatures in two marsh plant communities, and found that a moderate amount of warming (1.7°C above ambient temperatures) consistently maximized root growth, marsh elevation gain, and below-ground carbon accumulation. Marsh elevation loss observed at higher temperatures was associated with increased carbon mineralization and increased microtopographic heterogeneity, a potential early warning signal of marsh drowning. Here, maximized elevation and below-ground carbon accumulation for moderate warming scenarios uniquely suggest linkages between metabolic theory of individuals and landscape-scale ecosystem resilience and function, but our work indicates nonpermanent benefits as global temperatures continue to rise.","Wiley","","Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Edgewater, MD (United States); Smithsonian Institute, Washington, DC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

However, existing studies are limited in individual sites, and large-scale mapping of coastal wetland degradation patterns over a long period is rare. Our study developed a new framework to detect spatial and temporal patterns of coastal wetland degradation by analyzing fine-scale, long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Then, this framework was tested to track the degradation of coastal wetlands at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) in North Carolina, United States, during the period from 1995 to 2019. We identified six types of coastal wetland degradation in the study area. Most of the detected degradation was located within 2 km from the shoreline and occurred in the past five years. Further, we used a state-of-the-art coastal hydrologic model, PIHM-Wetland, to investigate key hydrologic processes/variables that control the coastal wetland degradation. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated coastal flooding and saltwater intrusion confirmed the location and timing of wetland degradation detected by remote sensing. The combined method also quantified the possible critical thresholds of water tables for wetland degradation. The remote sensing–hydrologic model integrated scheme proposed in this study provides a new tool for detecting and understanding coastal wetland degradation mechanisms. Our study approach can also be extended to other coastal wetland regions to understand how climate change and sea-level rise impact wetland transformations.","MDPI","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Here we assess the drivers of surface weather in the weeks following the SSW through initial condition “scrambling” experiments using the real-time CESM2(WACCM6) Earth system prediction framework.

"Relative importance of high-latitude local and long-range-transported dust for Arctic ice-nucleating particles and impacts on Arctic mixed-phase clouds","Shi, Yang; Liu, Xiaohong; Wu, Mingxuan; Zhao, Xi; Ke, Ziming; Brown, Hunter","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Dust particles, serving as ice nucleating particles (INPs), may impact the Arctic surface energy budget and regional climate by modulating the mixed-phase cloud properties and lifetime.In addition to long-range transport from low latitude deserts, dust particles in the Arctic can originate from local sources. However, the importance of high latitude dust (HLD) as a source of Arctic INPs (compared to low latitude dust (LLD)) and its effects on Arctic mixed-phase clouds are overlooked. In this study, we evaluate the contribution to Arctic dust loading and INP population from HLD and six LLD source regions by implementing a source-tagging technique for dust aerosols in version 1 of the US Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). Our results show that HLD is responsible for 30.7% of the total dust burden in the Arctic, whereas LLD from Asia and North Africa contribute 44.2% and 24.2%, respectively. Due to its limited vertical transport as a result of stable boundary layers, HLD contributes more in the lower troposphere, especially in boreal summer and autumn when the HLD emissions are stronger. LLD from North Africa and East Asia dominates the dust loading in the upper troposphere with peak contributions in boreal spring and winter. The modeled INP concentrations show a better agreement with both ground and aircraft INP measurements in the Arctic when including HLD INPs. The HLD INPs are found to induce a net cooling effect (-0.24 W m-2 above 60°N) on the Arctic surface downwelling radiative flux by changing the cloud phase of the Arctic mixed-phase clouds. The magnitude of this cooling is larger than those induced by North African and East Asian dust (0.08 and -0.06 W m-2, respectively), mainly due to different seasonalities of HLD and LLD. Uncertainties of this study are discussed, which highlights the importance of further constraining the HLD emissions.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Measuring soil and snow temperature with high vertical and lateral resolution is critical for advancing the predictive understanding of thermal and hydro-biogeochemical processes that govern the behavior of environmental systems. Vertically resolved soil temperature measurements enable the estimation of soil thermal regimes, frozen-/thawed-layer thickness, thermal parameters, and heat and/or water fluxes. Similarly, they can be used to capture the snow depth and the snowpack thermal parameters and fluxes. However, these measurements are challenging to acquire using conventional approaches due to their total cost, their limited vertical resolution, and their large installation footprint. This study presents the development and validation of a novel distributed temperature profiling (DTP) system that addresses these challenges. The system leverages digital temperature sensors to provide unprecedented, finely resolved depth profiles of temperature measurements with flexibility in system geometry and vertical resolution. The integrated miniaturized logger enables automated data acquisition, management, and wireless transfer. A novel calibration approach adapted to the DTP system confirms the factory-assured sensor accuracy of ±0.1 ∘C and enables improving it to ±0.015 ∘C. Numerical experiments indicate that, under normal environmental conditions, an additional error of 0.01 % in amplitude and 70 s time delay in amplitude for a diurnal period can be expected, owing to the DTP housing. We demonstrate the DTP systems capability at two field sites, one focused on understanding how snow dynamics influence mountainous water resources and the other focused on understanding how soil properties influence carbon cycling. Results indicate that the DTP system reliably captures the dynamics in snow depth and soil freezing and thawing depth, enabling advances in understanding the intensity and timing in surface processes and their impact on subsurface thermohydrological regimes. Overall, the DTP system fulfills the needs for data accuracy, minimal power consumption, and low total cost, enabling advances in the multiscale understanding of various cryospheric and hydro-biogeochemical processes.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; energy flux; life history; meta-community; organismal movement; social information; spatial processes","Fluxes of matter, energy and information over space and time contribute to ecosystems' functioning and stability. The meta-ecosystem framework addresses the dynamics of ecosystems linked by these fluxes but, to date, has focused solely on energy and matter. Here, we synthesize existing knowledge of information's effects on local and connected ecosystems and demonstrate how new hypotheses emerge from the integration of ecological information into meta-ecosystem theory. First, we begin by defining information and reviewing how it flows among ecosystems to affect connectivity, local ecosystem function and meta-ecosystem dynamics. We focus on the role of semiotic information: that which can reduce an individual's – or a group's – uncertainty about the state of the world. Semiotic information elicits behavioral, developmental and life history responses from organisms, potentially leading to fitness consequences. Organisms' responses to information can ripple through trophic interactions to influence ecosystem processes, their local and regional dynamics, and the spatiotemporal flows of energy and matter, therefore information should affect meta-ecosystem dynamics such as stability and productivity. While specific subdisciplines of ecology currently consider different types of information (e.g. social and cultural information, natural and artificial light or sound, body condition, genotype and phenotype), many ecological models currently account for neither the spatio–temporal distribution of information nor its perception by organisms. We identify the empirical, theoretical and philosophical challenges in developing a robust information meta-ecology and offer ways to overcome them. Finally, we present new hypotheses for how accounting for realistic information perception and responses by organisms could impact processes such as home range formation and spatial insurance, and thus our understanding of ecological dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. Accounting for information will be essential to understanding how dynamics such as fitness, organismal movement and trophic interactions influence meta-ecosystem functioning, and predicting how ecosystem processes are affected by anthropogenic pressures.","Nordic Ecological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Detailed spectromicroscopy characterizations of PM2.5 samples from the San Joaquin Valley, CA identified major Febearing components and estimated their relative proportions. Iron in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> was present in spatially and temporally variable mixtures, mostly as Fe(III) oxides and phyllosilicates, but with significant fractions of metallic iron (Fe(0)), Fe(II,III) oxide, and Fe(III) bonded to organic carbon. Fe(0) was present as aggregated, nm-sized particles that comprised up to ~30% of the Fe spectral fraction. Mixtures reflect anthropogenic and geogenic particles subjected to environmental weathering, but reduced Fe in PM originates from anthropogenic sources, likely as abrasion products. Possible mechanistic pathways involving Fe(0) particles and mixtures of Fe(II) and Fe(III) surface species may generate hydrogen peroxide and oxygen-centered radical species (hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, or superoxide) in Fenton-type reactions. From a health perspective, PM mixtures with reduced and oxidized Fe will have a disproportionate effect in cellular response after inhalation because of their tendency to shuttle electrons and produce oxidants and electrophiles that induce inflammation and oxidative stress.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of California, Merced, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Institutes of Health (NIH)","","United States","2022-03-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 56 Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: p. 7006-7016","","","AC02-05CH11231; AC02-76SF00515; ES023864","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.1c06962","","2023-04-28T00:00:00Z","1871356","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1871356","","Environmental Science and Technology","11","56"

This review discusses requirements and regulations for similar structures and how lighting design choices can be made to meet these requirements while minimizing environmental consequences. More practical guidance on implementing lighting for marine energy is needed, as well as updated guidelines to reflect technological and research advances. Known responses of wildlife to light are introduced in addition to how the responses of individuals may lead to ecosystem-level changes. The impact of light associated with marine energy installations can be reduced by following basic guidance provided herein, such as removing excess lighting, using lights with high directionality, and employing controls to reduce light levels. Continued research on animal responses to light, such as findings on minimum light levels for animal responses, alongside the development of highly-sensitivity spectral characterization capabilities can further inform lighting guidelines for deploying future open ocean marine energy devices.</p>","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model applied to airborne LiDAR data: A case study on mapping forest degradation associated with fragmentation and fire in the Amazon region","Valle, Denis; Silva, Carlos Alberto; Longo, Marcos; Brando, Paulo","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Amazon; fire; forest fragmentation; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; LiDAR; tropical forests","1. LiDAR data are being increasingly used to provide a detailed characterization of the vertical profile of forests. This characterization enables the generation of new insights on the influence of environmental drivers and anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure as well as on how forest structure influences important ecosystem functions and services. Unfortunately, extracting information from LiDAR data in a way that enables the spatial visualization of forest structure, as well as its temporal changes, is challenging due to the high dimensionality of these data. </p>2. In this study, we show how the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model applied to LiDAR data (LidarLDA) can be used to identify forest structural types and how the relative abundance of these forest types changes throughout the landscape. The code to fit this model is made available through the open-source r package LidarLDA in github. We illustrate the use of LidarLDA both with simulated data and data from a large-scale fire experiment in the Brazilian Amazon region. </p>3. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that LidarLDA accurately identifies the number of forest types as well as their spatial distribution and absorptance probabilities. For the empirical data, we found that LidarLDA detects both landscape-level patterns in forest structure as well as the strong interacting effect of fire and forest fragmentation on forest structure based on the experimental fire plots. More specifically, LidarLDA reveals that proximity to forest edge exacerbates the impact of fires, and that burned forests remain structurally different from unburned areas for at least 7 years, even when burned only once. Importantly, LidarLDA generates insights on the 3D structure of forest that cannot be obtained using more standard approaches that just focus on top-of-the-canopy information (e.g. canopy height models based on LiDAR data). </p>4. By enabling the mapping of forest structure and its temporal changes, we believe that LidarLDA will be of broad utility to the ecological research community.","British Ecological Society","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Comparison of scattering ratio profiles retrieved from ALADIN/Aeolus and CALIOP/CALIPSO observations and preliminary estimates of cloud fraction profiles","Feofilov, Artem G.; Chepfer, Hélène; Noel, Vincent; Guzman, Rodrigo; Gindre, Cyprien; Ma, Po-Lun; Chiriaco, Marjolaine","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","The space-borne active sounders have been contributing invaluable vertically resolved information of atmospheric optical properties since the launch of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) in 2006. To build long-term records from space-borne lidars useful for climate studies, one has to understand the differences between successive space lidars operating at different wavelengths, flying on different orbits, and using different viewing geometries, receiving paths, and detectors. In this article, we compare the results of Atmospheric Laser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidars for the period from 28 June to 31 December 2019. First, we build a dataset of ALADIN–CALIOP collocated profiles (Δdist<1°; Δtime<6 h). Then we convert ALADIN's 355 nm particulate backscatter and extinction profiles into the scattering ratio vertical profiles SR(z) at 532 nm using molecular density profiles from Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System, version 5 (GEOS-5 DAS). And finally, we build the CALIOP and ALADIN globally gridded cloud fraction profiles CF(z) by applying the same cloud detection threshold to the SR(z) profiles of both lidars at the same spatial resolution. Before comparing the SR(z) and CF(z) profiles retrieved from the two analyzed lidar missions, we performed a numerical experiment to estimate the best achievable cloud detection agreement CDA<sub>norm</sub>(z) considering the differences between the instruments. We define CDA<sub>norm</sub>(z) in each latitude–altitude bin as the occurrence frequency of cloud layers detected by both lidars, divided by a cloud fraction value for the same latitude–altitude bin. We simulated the SR(z) and CF(z) profiles that would be observed by these two lidars if they were flying over the same atmosphere predicted by a global model. By analyzing these simulations, we show that the theoretical limit for CDA$_{norm}^{theor}$(z) for a combination of ALADIN and CALIOP instruments is equal to 0.81±0.07 at all altitudes. In other words, 19 % of the clouds cannot be detected simultaneously by two instruments due to said differences. The analyses of the actual observed CALIOP–ALADIN collocated dataset containing ~78 000 pairs of nighttime SR(z) profiles revealed the following points: (a) the values of SR(z) agree well up to ~3 km height. (b) The CF(z) profiles show agreement below ~3 km, where ~80 % of the clouds detected by CALIOP are detected by ALADIN as expected from the numerical experiment. (c) Above this height, the CDA$_{norm}^{obs}$(z) reduces to ~50 %. (d) On average, better sensitivity to lower clouds skews ALADIN's cloud peak height in pairs of ALADIN–CALIOP profiles by ~0.5±0.6 km downwards, but this effect does not alter the heights of polar stratospheric clouds and high tropical clouds thanks to their strong backscatter signals. (e) The temporal evolution of the observed CDA$_{norm}^{obs}$(z) does not reveal any statistically significant change during the considered period. This indicates that the instrument-related issues in ALADIN L0/L1 have been mitigated, at least down to the uncertainties of the following CDA$_{norm}^{obs}$(z) values: 68±12 %, 55±14 %, 34±14 %, 39±13 %, and 42±14 % estimated at 0.75, 2.25, 6.75, 8.75, and 10.25 km, respectively.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Size-Dependent Characteristics of Surface-Rooted Three-Dimensional Convective Objects in Continental Shallow Cumulus Simulations","Griewank, Philipp J.; Heus, Thijs; Neggers, Roel A. J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES","A segmentation algorithm is applied to high resolution simulations of shallow continental convection to identify individual convective 3D objects within the convective boundary layer, in order to investigate which properties of the objects vary with the object width. The study analyses the geometry of the objects, along with their profiles of vertical velocity and total water, to assess various assumptions often used in spectral mass-flux convection schemes. The methodology of this paper is unique in that we use (a) a novel application of the watershed algorithm to detect individual objects in the constantly evolving continental boundary layer efficiently, and (b) an unprecedentedly large number of simulations being analyzed. In total, 26 days of LASSO simulations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site are analyzed, yielding roughly one million objects. Plume-like surface-rooted objects are found to be omnipresent, the vertical extent of which is strongly dependent on the object width. The vertical velocity and moisture anomaly profiles of the widest objects are roughly consistent with the classic buoyancy-driven rising plume model. The kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the objects vary with object width. This width dependence is strongest above cloud base, but much weaker below. Finally the impact of neglecting the contribution of covariances to the vertical moisture flux, which is commonly used in mass-flux parameterizations, is investigated. The average effect of neglecting covariances increases linearly with object width, leading to a 20% flux underestimation for 2 km wide objects. Implications of the results for spectral convection scheme development are briefly discussed.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain due to aerosol measurement limitations, modulation of the effect by meteorological conditions, and difficulties untangling meteorological and aerosol effects on DCCs. The Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) campaign in 2018–19 produced concentrated aerosol and cloud observations in a location with frequent DCCs, providing an opportunity to examine the proposed aerosol indirect effect on DCC depth in a rigorous and robust manner. For periods throughout the campaign with well-mixed boundary layers, we analyze relationships that exist between aerosol variables (condensation nuclei concentration > 10 nm, 0.4% cloud condensation nuclei concentration, 55–1000-nm aerosol concentration, and aerosol optical depth) and meteorological variables [level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), convective available potential energy, midlevel relative humidity, and deep-layer vertical wind shear] with the maximum radar-echo-top height and cloud-top temperature (CTT) of DCCs. Meteorological variables such as LNB and deep-layer shear are strongly correlated with DCC depth. LNB is also highly correlated with three of the aerosol variables. After accounting for meteorological correlations, increasing values of the aerosol variables [with the exception of one formulation of aerosol optical depth (AOD)] are generally correlated at a statistically significant level with a warmer CTT of DCCs. Furthermore, for the study region and period considered, increasing aerosol concentration is mostly associated with a decrease in DCC depth.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Under future warmer conditions predicted for higher latitudes, however, that balance may shift towards higher rates of heterotrophic respiration leading to the release of previously stored C as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. The Spruce and Peatlands Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment is designed to test the response of peatlands to climate forcing using a series of warmed enclosures in combination with peat below-ground heating from 0 to +9°C above ambient conditions. This experimental design allowed a test of chemical changes occurring within peatland soils following five years of warming. We analyzed samples in the uppermost 2m of peat using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to quantify the relative abundance of carbohydrate and aromatic compounds in the peat. The peat soils were subjected to deep peat heating (DPH) beginning in June of 2014 followed by whole ecosystem warming (WEW) in August of 2015. We found that the relative amounts of labile and recalcitrant chemical compound groups across the full peat depth interval did not significantly change after five years of exposure to warming. This appears the case even though previous studies have shown that net C losses and loss of bulk peat mass to be instability over that time period. Results suggest that the current store of carbon in peatlands are largely compositionally stable leading to no changes the in the ratio of chemical moieties on the initial four-year timescale of this experiment.","Public Library of Science","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this work, the response of LWP to moisture convergence and the response of albedo to LWP anti-correlate across GCMs. This is because GCMs that simulate a larger response of LWP to moisture convergence tend to have higher mean-state LWPs, which reduces the impact of additional LWP on albedo.

EDMF produces an ensemble of subgrid-scale convective plumes that evolve in response to the boundary layer meteorological conditions and can develop into shallow clouds. The objective of this study is to determine how different treatments of shallow cumulus clouds (i.e., with and without EDMF) impact the total cloud population and precipitation across the Amazonian rain forest, with emphasis on impacts on the likelihood of shallow-to-deep convection transitions. Results indicate that the large-scale synoptic conditions in the EDMF and control simulations are nearly identical; however, on the local scale their rainfall patterns diverge drastically and the biases decrease in EDMF. The EDMF scheme significantly increases the frequency of shallow clouds, but the frequencies of deep clouds are similar between the simulations. Deep convective clouds are tracked using a cloud-tracking algorithm to examine the impact of shallow cumulus on the surrounding ambient environment where deep convective clouds initiate. Results suggest that a rapid increase of low-level cloudiness acts to cool and moisten the low to midtroposphere during the day, favoring the transition to deep convection.","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This combination of scanning lidars was operated for the first time during the Land-Atmosphere Feedback Experiment at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Southern Great Plain site, Oklahoma, USA, in August 2017, and provided simultaneous surface layer profiles of horizontal wind, humidity and temperature. The horizontal wind profiles were determined using the dual-Doppler method with two DLs. The scans were performed above four towers providing atmospheric variables and fluxes. These combined lidar data allowed for the estimation of the friction velocity as well as the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes. For this purpose, profiles calculated with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory were fitted with the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares curve-fitting method to the measured surface-layer lidar profiles. We present case studies of three 50-min periods to illustrate the new method. The measurements resulted in friction velocities of 0.31, 0.29, and 0.38 ms<sup>–1</sup>, sensible surface heat fluxes of 312.1, 234.1, and 183.3 Wm<sup>–2</sup> and latent surface heat fluxes of 251.8, 227.3, and 274.4 Wm<sup>–2</sup>. These values were compared with the in-situ measurements of the towers. Considering the sampling differences and the error analyses, the results agree within 25.1%, 42.5%, and 28.8%, respectively, demonstrating that this synergy of scanning active remote sensing systems can be used to derive surface fluxes with reasonable accuracy.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Increased temperatures will make the extensive northern permafrost carbon stock vulnerable to decomposition and translocation. Production, cycling, and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are crucial processes for high-latitude ecosystem carbon loss that result in considerable export off the Arctic landscape. To identify where and under what conditions permafrost DOC is mobilized in an Arctic headwater catchment, we measured radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) of DOC and assessed DOC composition with ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) of surface waters and shallow and deep subsurface porewaters from 17 drainages in the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Alaska. Samples were collected in July and September 2013 to assess changes in age and chemistry of DOC over time. DOC age was highly variable ranging from modern (19‰ Δ<sup>14</sup>C) to approximately 7000 BP (-583‰ Δ<sup>14</sup>C). DOC age increased with depth, over the summer as the active layer deepened, and with increasing drainage size. DOC quality indicators reflected a DOC source rich in high molecular-weight and aromatic compounds, characteristics consistent with vegetation-derived organic matter that had undergone little microbial processing, throughout the summer and a weak relationship with DOC age. In deep porewaters, DOC age was also correlated with several biogeochemical indicators (including dissolved methane concentration, δ<sup>13</sup>C, and the apparent fractionation factor), suggesting a coupling between carbon and redox biogeochemistry influencing methane production. In the drained thawed lake basins included in this study, DOC concentrations and contributions of vegetation-derived organic matter declined with increasing basin age. The weak relationship between DOC age and chemistry and consistency in DOC chemical indicators over the summer suggest a high lability of old DOC released by thawing permafrost.","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The five nodes that comprise the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) profiling network, spaced 50–80 km apart, are used to obtain measurements of these parameters over a finite region. To demonstrate the applicability of this technique at this location, it is first applied to gridded model output from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction model, using profiles from the locations of ARM network sites, so that values calculated from this method can be directly compared to finite difference calculations. Good agreement is found between both approaches as well as between the model and values calculated from the observations. Uncertainties for the observations are obtained via a Monte Carlo process in which the profiles are randomly perturbed in accordance with their known error characteristics. The existing size of the ARM network is well suited to capturing these parameters, with strong correlations to model values and smaller uncertainties than a more closely spaced network, yet it is small enough that it avoids the tendency for advection to go to zero over a large area.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Deforestation triggering irreversible transition in Amazon hydrological cycle","Xu, Xiyan; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Riley, William J.; Xue, Ying; Nobre, Carlos A.; Lovejoy, Thomas E.; Jia, Gensuo","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Amazon forest; decoupling; deforestation; drying; moisture","The Amazon is hypothesized to reach an irreversible ‘tipping point’ when deforestation slows the hydrological cycle sufficiently that tropical forest ecosystems cannot be sustained. However, inception of such a tipping point has not been supported by observations and the relevant links between deforestation and atmospheric moisture recycling are poorly understood. Here we show that reduction in evapotranspiration from 20 years of deforestation dried the atmosphere persistently and caused moisture decoupling, i.e. an opposite sign of moisture change between the lower and middle troposphere. Increased deforestation exacerbated the lower troposphere drying and caused it to penetrate deeper into the middle troposphere in the dry and transition seasons over monsoon forests and savannas. Deforestation induced warming-enhanced buoyant updrafts, elevated hot and dry air and thereby reduced downward mixing of water supplies from the tropical Atlantic that normally moisten the Amazon forests. The severe atmospheric desiccation in the southern and eastern Amazon cannot be compensated by enhanced water supplies from the Atlantic Ocean, demonstrating an irreversible transition in Amazon hydrological cycle exacerbated by rapid deforestation. The more recent drying through the seasons over rainforests and during the wet season over the transition zones from rainforests to monsoon forests and savannas, however, suggests a window of opportunity for preventing ecosystem collapse with forest conservation.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Automated high-resolution satellite-derived coastal bathymetry mapping","McCarthy, Matthew J.; Otis, Daniel B.; Hughes, David; Muller-Karger, Frank E.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; WorldView; Chlorophyll; Turbidity; High-performance computing","Accurate and up-to-date maps of coastal bathymetry are fundamental for coastal resource management, commercial and military navigation, and aquaculture, among many applications. Existing methods for bathymetry mapping require intensive and costly field surveys or targeted aerial captures, neither of which are easily or affordably replicated for repeat mapping and change monitoring. Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), however, offers the potential to map shallow water bodies repeatedly and efficiently with high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., daily-weekly at 5 m or better). One challenge to large-scale implementation of SDB lies in the automated derivation of inherent water column properties such that they may be accurately compensated for across a variety of depth and substrate conditions. Here we present an algorithm that leverages WorldView (Maxar/Digital GlobeTM) satellite imagery to map the entire 3700 km<sup>2</sup> Florida Keys (USA) island chain at 2-meter resolution without the need for any in-situ data collections. Preprocessing included radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, automated deglinting, and automated detection of optically deep water, which was then used to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration assuming that the study area is primarily comprised of Case-I water (i.e., those where the optical signal is dominated by water, Chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton, and properties that vary in proportion to Chlorophyll-a concentration). Estimating Chlorophyll-a concentration allowed us to calculate the appropriate tuning coefficients used in a spectral band ratio equation for estimating bathymetry. The entire process was fully automated from ingestion of Level-1B image to bathymetry raster output. Mapping the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West required 34 WorldView images and was completed in approximately 27 min for an average processing time of 47 s per image using a single GPU core (i.e., supercomputing resources were not needed). After combining the products (mosaicking) in ArcMap, the wall-to-wall bathymetry map was validated against a LiDAR-derived bathymetry model with over 600,000 points; results show an RMSE of 1.95 m over depths from 0 to 15 m.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Presently, marine low clouds are poorly represented in global climate models, and the response of marine low clouds to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and aerosols remains the major source of uncertainty in climate simulations. The Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) is a region of persistent but diverse subtropical marine boundary layer clouds, whose albedo and precipitation are highly susceptible to perturbations in aerosol properties. In addition, the ENA is periodically impacted by continental aerosols, making it an excellent location to study the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) budget in a remote marine region periodically perturbed by anthropogenic emissions, and to investigate the impacts of long-range transport of aerosols on remote marine clouds. The Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) campaign was motivated by the need of comprehensive in-situ measurements for improving the understanding of marine boundary layer CCN budget, cloud and drizzle microphysics, and the impact of aerosol on marine low cloud and precipitation. The airborne deployments took place from June 21 to July 20, 2017 and January 15 to February 18, 2018 in the Azores. The flights were designed to maximize the synergy between in-situ airborne measurements and ongoing long-term observations at a ground site. Here we present measurements, observation strategy, meteorological conditions during the campaign, and preliminary findings. Lastly, we discuss future analyses and modeling studies that improve the understanding and representation of marine boundary layer aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and the interactions among them.","American Meteorological Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Primary and secondary ice production: interactions and their relative importance","Zhao, Xi; Liu, Xiaohong","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","A discrepancy of up to 5 orders of magnitude between ice crystal and ice nucleating particle (INP) number concentrations was found in the measurements, indicating the potentially important role of secondary ice production (SIP) in the clouds. However, the interactions between primary and SIP processes and their relative importance remain unexplored. In this study, we implemented five different ice nucleation schemes as well as physical representations of SIP processes (i.e., droplet shattering during rain freezing, ice-ice collisional break-up, and rime splintering) in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). We ran CESM2 in the single column mode for model comparisons with the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) observations. We found that the model experiments with aerosol-aware ice nucleation schemes and SIP processes yield the best simulation results for the M-PACE single-layer mixed-phase clouds. We further investigated the relative importance of ice nucleation and SIP to ice number and cloud phase as well as interactions between ice nucleation and SIP in the M-PACE single-layer mixed-phase clouds. Our results show that SIP contributes 80 % to the total ice formation and transforms ~30 % of pure liquid-phase clouds simulated in the model experiments without considering SIP into mixed-phase clouds. The SIP is not only a result of ice crystals produced from ice nucleation, but also competes with the ice nucleation by reducing the number concentrations of cloud droplets and cloud-borne dust INPs. Conversely, strong ice nucleation also suppresses SIP by glaciating mixed-phase clouds and thereby reducing the amount of precipitation particles (rain and graupel).","Copernicus Publications, EGU","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Nevertheless, the sensitivity of renewable energy to climatic conditions means that the energy system’s vulnerability to climate change can also become larger. In this research, we used two integrated assessment models and data from four climate models to analyse climate change impacts on primary energy use at a global and regional scale under a low-level (RCP2.6) and a medium-level (RCP6.0) climate change scenario. The impacts are analysed on the energy system focusing on four renewable sources (wind, solar, hydropower, and biomass). Globally, small climate impacts on renewable primary energy use are found in both models (5% for RCP2.6 and 6% for RCP6.0). These impacts lead to a decrease in the use of fossil sources for most regions, especially for North America and Europe under the RCP60 scenario. Overall, IMAGE and GCAM provide a similar signal impact response for most regions. E.g. in Asia (excluding China and India), climate change induces an increase in wind and hydropower use under the RCP6.0 scenarios; however, for India, a decrease in solar energy use can be expected under both scenarios and models.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Bed-material sediment particle size data, particularly the median sediment particle size (D50), are critical for understanding and modeling riverine sediment transport. However, sediment particle size observations are primarily available at individual sites. Large-scale modeling and assessment of riverine sediment transport are limited by the lack of continuous regional maps of bed-material sediment particle size. We hence present a map of D50 over the contiguous US in a vector format that corresponds to approximately 2.7 million river segments (i.e., flowlines) in the National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus) dataset. We develop the map in four steps: (1) collect and process the observed D50 data from 2577 U.S. Geological Survey stations or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sampling locations; (2) collocate these data with the NHDPlus flowlines based on their geographic locations, resulting in 1691 flowlines with collocated D50 values; (3) develop a predictive model using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning method based on the observed D50 data and the corresponding climate, hydrology, geology, and other attributes retrieved from the NHDPlus dataset; and (4) estimate the D50 values for flowlines without observations using the XGBoost predictive model. We expect this map to be useful for various purposes, such as research in large-scale river sediment transport using model- and data-driven approaches, teaching environmental and earth system sciences, planning and managing floodplain zones, etc. The map is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4921987 (Li et al., 2021a).</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Surface precipitation was observed 44% ± 4% of the time between April 2016 and March 2017. Precipitation composed primarily of small particles (diameter <1 mm) occurred about 36% ± 2% of the time, constituting 10% of total accumulation. Remaining precipitation contained enough large particles such that the disdrometer could be used to identify the precipitation type as rain, ice, snow or wet snow. Seasonal and annual statistics on frequency of occurrence and accumulation for each precipitation type observed during MICRE are presented. Most ice and mixed phase precipitation was shallow, originating at a height of 3 km or lower, and occurred most often when Macquarie Island was to the northwest of the nearest cyclonic low-pressure center. In contrast, rain was more often deep and occurred most frequently when the island was to the southeast of cyclonic lows. A weak diurnal cycle in frequency and mean rate was present with a minimum between 12:00 and 14:00 local time and maximum between 03:00 and 06:00 local time. The CloudSat 2C-Precip-Column product missed the lightest precipitation (because the near-surface reflectivity is <-15 dBZ) and overestimated total liquid precipitation and occurrence of mixed phase precipitation, but captured reasonably well the distribution of rain rates for rates >0.5 mm/hr.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

During the September 2020 wildfire events, large concentrations of smoke particulates were emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, smoke was responsible for ∼10%–30% reduction in solar power production during peak hours as recorded by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) sites. In this study, we focus on a 9 d period in September when wildfire smoke had a profound impact on solar energy production. During the smoke episodes, hour-ahead forecasts utilized by CAISO did not include the effects of smoke and therefore overestimated the expected power production by ∼10%–50%. Here we use multiple observational networks and a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to show that the wildfire events of 2020 had a significantly detrimental influence on solar energy production due to high aerosol loading. We find that including the contribution of biomass burning particles greatly improves the day-ahead solar energy bias forecast of both global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance by nearly ∼50%. Our results suggest that a more comprehensive treatment of aerosols, including biomass burning aerosols, in NWP models may be an important consideration for energy grid balancing, in addition to solar resource assessment, as solar power reliance increases. </p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Water Availability for Biorefineries in the Contiguous United States and the Implications for Bioenergy Production Distribution","Yang, Pan; Piao, Ximin; Cai, Ximing","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; cellulosic biofuel; biorefinery; water availability; water use; renewable fuel standard; biorefineries; biomass; biodiesel; biofuels; crops","Renewable biofuel production depends on many factors, including feedstock availability, refinery and shipment infrastructure, and in particular, water availability. This study assesses water requirement and availability for mainstream biorefinery technologies in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The assessment is conducted in newly defined spatial units, namely, biorefinery planning boundaries, considering feedstock availability, transportation cost, and refinery capacity requirement for cost-effectiveness. The results suggest that the total biorefinery water use in the CONUS by 2030 will be low compared to the total water availability. However, biorefinery water requirements can aggravate the water stress situation in many regions, including the Great Plains, California Central Valley, and the upper Columbia-Snake River basin in Washington. Bioenergy productions in these regions can be largely constrained by water. Here, it is projected that biofuel production will concentrate in Northern Plains, Lake States, and Corn Belt regions, which contribute 94.4% of the conventional, 86.1% of biodiesel, and 54.8% of cellulosic biofuel production mandated by the renewable fuel standard. If biorefineries are constrained to use less than 10% of the locally available water, up to 7% of planned cellulosic biofuel production will be affected. Findings from this study can aid the sustainable planning of national bioenergy production.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), Urbana, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-02-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3748-3757","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.1c07747","","2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","1854824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1854824","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1854824","Environmental Science and Technology","6","56"

Sphagnum spp. host diverse microbial communities capable of nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy) and methane oxidation (methanotrophy), thereby potentially supporting plant growth under severely nutrient-limited conditions. Moreover, diazotrophic methanotrophs represent a possible “missing link” between the carbon and nitrogen cycles, but the functional contributions of the Sphagnum-associated microbiome remain in question. A combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and dual-isotope incorporation assays was applied to investigate Sphagnum microbiome community composition across the North American continent and provide empirical evidence for diazotrophic methanotrophy in Sphagnum-dominated ecosystems. Remarkably consistent prokaryotic communities were detected in over 250 Sphagnum SSU rRNA libraries from peatlands across the United States (5 states, 17 bog/fen sites, 18 Sphagnum species), with 12 genera of the core microbiome comprising 60% of the relative microbial abundance. Additionally, nitrogenase (nifH) and SSU rRNA gene amplicon analysis revealed that nitrogen-fixing populations made up nearly 15% of the prokaryotic communities, predominated by Nostocales cyanobacteria and Rhizobiales methanotrophs. While cyanobacteria comprised the vast majority (>95%) of diazotrophs detected in amplicon and metagenome analyses, obligate methanotrophs of the genus Methyloferula (order Rhizobiales) accounted for one-quarter of transcribed nifH genes. Furthermore, in dual-isotope tracer experiments, members of the Rhizobiales showed substantial incorporation of <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> and <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> isotopes into their rRNA. Our study characterizes the core Sphagnum microbiome across large spatial scales and indicates that diazotrophic methanotrophs, here defined as obligate methanotrophs of the rare biosphere (Methyloferula spp. of the Rhizobiales) that also carry out diazotrophy, play a keystone role in coupling of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in nutrient-poor peatlands.","American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In this study, different impacts of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm/cold phases on summertime tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> over China are examined based on model simulations, ground measurements, and reanalysis data. Summertime surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China show a positive correlation with ENSO index during years 1990–2019, with the largest increases by 20% over southern China in El Niño (warm phase) relative to La Niña (cold phase) years. The ENSO modulation extends to the middle and even upper troposphere. Our analysis indicates that O<sub>3</sub> flux convergence associated with weakened southerlies is the primary reason for the increase in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> over southern China. In addition, the O<sub>3</sub> increase during El Niño years is mainly from domestic emissions in China. This study highlights the potential significance of ENSO in modulating tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in China, with great implications for O<sub>3</sub> pollution mitigation.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Minnie","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; synoptic regime; sea-breeze convection; TRACER; sea-breeze circulation; self-organizing map; cloud and precipitation","This report classifies meteorological regimes in the southeastern Texas region to identify environmental conditions that favor sea-breeze induced convection. The classification is accomplished using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) approach. We applied SOM to 10 years of 700-hPa geopotential height anomalies during the summer months from reanalysis data to distinguish three dominant synoptic regimes, with a continuum of transitional states between those. The primary regimes include: (a) a pre-trough regime associated with a synoptic trough, (b) a post-trough regime with upper-level northerly flow, and (c) an anticyclonic regime within the westward extent of the Bermuda High. We project the data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and the Next Generation Weather Radar system onto each SOM node to investigate the characteristics of cloud and precipitation properties in different regimes. When southeastern Texas is positioned to the southwest quadrant of a maritime high pressure system, an increased cloud frequency is observed over the region during the afternoon hours due to significant moisture advection. A confluence of synoptic southerly flow and sea-breeze circulation commonly occurs in this regime. When a high pressure system is over southeastern Texas, the area is dominated by large-scale subsidence with weak pressure gradients and moderate precipitable water vapor. This weak synoptic forcing is favorable for the formation of a sea-breeze circulation. This is confirmed by an enhanced onshore flow and a decreased temperature at the surface in the early afternoon, as well as a sharp increase in radar echo top height.","American Geophysical Union","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Adaptation choices can be represented by economic investment models in which the often large upfront cost of adaptation is offset by the future benefits of avoiding losses due to future natural hazards. In this context, we investigate the role that expectations of future natural hazards have on adaptation in the Colorado River basin of the USA. We apply an innovative approach that quantifies the impacts of changes in concurrent climate extremes, with a focus on flooding events. By including the expectation of future natural hazards in adaptation models, we examine how public policies can focus on this component to support local community adaptation efforts. Findings indicate that considering the concurrent distribution of several variables makes quantification and prediction of extremes easier, more realistic, and consequently improves our capability to model human systems adaptation. Hazard expectation is a leading force in adaptation. Even without assuming increases in exposure, the Colorado River basin is expected to face harsh increases in damage from flooding events unless local communities are able to incorporate climate change and expected increases in extremes in their adaptation planning and decision making.</p>","MDPI AG","","Los Alamos National Lab.

This study investigates differences in HR and groundwater use among common canopy species in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill., Pinaceae) woodlands and explores environmental factors influencing HR. HR was estimated by sap flux of lateral roots and main stems of three mature canopy species (P. palustris, Quercus laevis Walter., Fagaceae and Quercus margarettae Ashe., Fagaceae). We used δ18O and δD of xylem water, soil water, and groundwater to determine water source. Finally, we related HR to environmental factors (Temperature, VWC, VPD) to better understand controls of HR dynamics. Pinus palustris had higher water use than either Quercus species, and also redistributed significantly more water as a nocturnal subsidy. HR fluxes were inversely related with mean nightly temperature and independent of shallow soil moisture. Stable isotope mixing models, based on δ<sup>18</sup>O and δD, indicated that all species have access to groundwater, but utilized shallow soil water in differing amounts when available. In systems with strong water potential gradients among soil strata, any species with access to a groundwater source is likely capable of HR; however, the magnitude of HR varies significantly by species, even among closely related taxa.","Springer Nature","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States).

"Observed Relationships Between Cloud Droplet Effective Radius and Biogenic Gas Concentrations in Summertime Marine Stratocumulus Over the Eastern North Atlantic","Miller, Mark A.; Mages, Zackary; Zheng, Qiuxuan; Trabachino, Lynne; Russell, Lynn M.; Shilling, John E.; Zawadowicz, Maria A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; marine boundary layer; biogenic gases; cloud microphysics; dimethyl sulfide; methane sulfonic acid; ACE-ENA","Biogenic gases are a prominent component of the summertime marine boundary layer (MBL) over the Eastern North Atlantic. One of these gases, dimethyl sulfide (DMS), can produce sulfate cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that, in theory, can brighten clouds through photolysis, which produces a reaction product, methane sulfonic acid (MSA). It is also possible that DMS could interact with sea-salt or other marine aerosols changing their CCN activation spectrum, which could also modify cloud microphysical structure. Data collected aboard the G1 aircraft during the Aerosol Cloud Experiment Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA) in well-mixed and decoupled marine boundary layers (MBLs) were used to examine relationships between the cloud droplet effective radii, r<sub>e</sub>, and the concentrations of DMS and MSA in constant cloud liquid water content (LWC) bins. A weak but statistically significant negative correlation was observed between CCN concentration and urn:x-wiley:23335084:media:ess21028:ess21028-math-0002 in most LWC bins, regardless of the source of the CCN, while a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between r<sub>e</sub> and DMS was observed. No correlation between the cloud droplet number concentration and DMS was found. The presence of MSA indicated that DMS-to-sulfate photolysis was likely occurring, but data sparsity prevented a statistically significant conclusion regarding the relationship between MSA and r<sub>e</sub>. Data sparsity in decoupled conditions prevented statistically significant conclusions. To properly address biogenic gas impacts on cloud microphysics, it is recommended that aircraft data be supplemented by long-term biogenic gas measurements at the surface in marine locations with appropriate remote and in-situ cloud sensing capabilities, and the analysis limited to well-mixed MBL’s.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The extreme summer rainfall occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in China in early 2020 and spread rapidly across the globe. By disrupting human activities, substantial reductions in anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols might have affected regional precipitation in many ways. Here, we investigate such connections and show that the abrupt emissions reductions during the pandemic strengthened the summer atmospheric convection over eastern China, resulting in a positive sea level pressure anomaly over northwestern Pacific Ocean. The latter enhanced moisture convergence to eastern China and further intensified rainfall in that region. Modeling experiments show that the reduction in aerosols had a stronger impact on precipitation than the decrease of greenhouse gases did. We conclude that through abrupt emissions reductions, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed importantly to the 2020 extreme summer rainfall in eastern China.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this work, we simulate flow over two parallel ridges with a wind turbine on one of the ridges, focusing on conditions observed during the Perdigão field campaign in 2017. Two case studies are selected to be representative of typical flow conditions at the site, including the effects of atmospheric stability: a stable case where a mountain wave occurs (as in ~50% of the nights observed) and a convective case where a recirculation zone forms in the lee of the ridge with the turbine (as occurred over 50% of the time with upstream winds normal to the ridgeline). We use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), dynamically downscaled from the mesoscale (6.75 km resolution) to microscale large-eddy simulation (LES) at 10 m resolution, where a generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine parameterization is used to simulate turbine wakes. We compare the WRF–LES–GAD model results to data from meteorological towers, lidars, and a tethered lifting system, showing good qualitative and quantitative agreement for both case studies. Significantly, the wind turbine wake shows different amounts of vertical deflection from the terrain and persistence downstream in the two stability regimes. In the stable case, the wake follows the terrain along with the mountain wave and deflects downwards by nearly 100 m below hub height at four rotor diameters downstream. In the convective case, the wake deflects above the recirculation zone over 40 m above hub height at the same downstream distance. Overall, the WRF–LES–GAD model is able to capture the observed behavior of the wind turbine wakes, demonstrating the model's ability to represent wakes over complex terrain for two distinct and representative atmospheric stability classes, and, potentially, to improve wind turbine siting and operation in hilly landscapes.","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Amazonian Moisture Recycling Revisited Using WRF With Water Vapor Tracers","Dominguez, F.; Eiras‐Barca, J.; Yang, Z.; Bock, D.; Nieto, R.; Gimeno, L.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Previous studies have estimated that 25%–35% of Amazonian precipitation comes from evapotranspiration (ET) within the basin. However, due to simplifying assumptions of traditional models, these studies primarily focus on large spatial and temporal scales. This study is the first to analyze the moisture of Amazonian origin at the annual to daily timescale in four different subregions of the Amazon. We analyze the sources, sinks and stores of moisture that originates as Amazonian ET. To do this, we use the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) regional meteorological model with the added capability of water vapor tracers to track this moisture. Moisture of Amazonian origin shows strong annual and semi-annual signals, with contrasting behavior between the northern and southern parts of the basin. The tracers reveal a strong diurnal cycle of Amazonian water vapor which had not been previously reported. This signal is related to the diurnal cycle of ET, convective precipitation and advected moisture. ET's contribution to atmospheric moisture increases from early morning into the afternoon. Some of this moisture is rained out through convective storms in the early evening. Later in the night and following morning, strong winds associated with the South American Low Level Jet advect moisture downwind. Overall, the beating pattern becomes apparent when visualizing the Amazonian water vapor as an animation.","American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Arctic tundra biome, one of the largest inaccessible terrestrial biomes on Earth, requires remote sensing across multiple spatial and temporal scales, from towers to satellites, particularly those equipped for imaging spectroscopy (IS). We describe a rationale for using IS derived from advances in our understanding of Arctic tundra vegetation communities and their interaction with the environment. To best leverage ongoing and forthcoming IS resources, including NASA's Surface Biology and Geology mission, we identify a series of opportunities and challenges based on intrinsic spectral dimensionality analysis and a review of current data and literature that illustrates the unique attributes of the Arctic tundra biome. These opportunities and challenges include thematic vegetation mapping, complicated by low-stature plants and very fine-scale surface composition heterogeneity; development of scalable algorithms for retrieval of canopy and leaf traits; nuanced variation in vegetation growth and composition that complicates detection of long-term trends; and rapid phenological changes across brief growing seasons that may go undetected due to low revisit frequency or be obscured by snow cover and clouds.

"Aerosol iron speciation and seasonal variation of iron oxidation state over the western Antarctic Peninsula","Fan, Songyun; Gao, Yuan; Lai, Barry; Elzinga, Evert J.; Yu, Shun","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Aerosols; Antarctic Peninsula; Fe mineralogy; Fe oxidation states; XANES","The iron (Fe) speciation and oxidation state have been considered critical factors affecting Fe solubility in the atmosphere and bioavailability in the surface ocean. In this study, elemental composition and Fe speciation in aerosol samples collected at the Palmer Station in the West Antarctic Peninsula were determined using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The elemental composition of coarse-mode (>1 mu m) Fe-containing particles suggests that the region's crustal emission is the primary source of aerosol Fe. The Fe minerals in these aerosol particles were predominantly hematite and biotite, but minor fractions of pyrite and ilmenite were observed as well. The Fe oxidation state showed an evident seasonal variation. Further, the Fe(II) content accounted for 71% of the total Fe in the austral summer, while this fraction dropped to 60% in the austral winter. Multivariate linear models involving meteorological parameters suggested that the wind speed, relative humidity, and solar irradiance were the factors that significantly controlled the percentage of Fe(II) in the austral summer. On the contrary, no relationship was found between these factors and the Fe(II) percentage in the austral winter, suggesting that atmospheric photoreduction and regional dust emission were limited. Moreover, the snow depth was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the aerosol Fe concentration, confirming the limiting effect of snow/ice cover on the regional dust emission. Given that the Antarctic Peninsula has experienced rapid warming during recent decades, the ice-free areas in the Antarctic Peninsula may act as potential dust sources.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

When decomposing low-nutrient plant litter, microbes acquire nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the environment (i.e., nutrient immobilization), and this process is potentially sensitive to nutrient loading and changing climate. Nonetheless, environmental controls on immobilization are poorly understood because rates are also influenced by plant litter chemistry, which is coupled to the same environmental factors. Here we used a standardized, low-nutrient organic matter substrate (cotton strips) to quantify nutrient immobilization at 100 paired stream and riparian sites representing 11 biomes worldwide. Immobilization rates varied by three orders of magnitude, were greater in rivers than riparian zones, and were strongly correlated to decomposition rates. In rivers, P immobilization rates were controlled by surface water phosphate concentrations, but N immobilization rates were not related to inorganic N. The N:P of immobilized nutrients was tightly constrained to a molar ratio of 10:1 despite wide variation in surface water N:P. Immobilization rates were temperature-dependent in riparian zones but not related to temperature in rivers. However, in rivers nutrient supply ultimately controlled whether microbes could achieve the maximum expected decomposition rate at a given temperature. Collectively, we demonstrated that exogenous nutrient supply and immobilization are critical control points for decomposition of organic matter.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Process Interactions Can Change Process Ranking in a Coupled Complex System Under Process Model and Parametric Uncertainty","Yang, Jing; Ye, Ming; Chen, Xingyuan; Dai, Heng; Walker, Anthony P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; process-based modeling; process importance; process influence; process interactions; uncertainty reduction; process screening","For a complex hydrologic system with multiple processes and process interactions, global sensitivity analysis is often used to identify important or influential parameters for model development and improvement. The identification is complicated by process model uncertainty, when a system process can be represented by multiple process models. This study develops a new total-effect process sensitivity index to identify influential processes under model uncertainty. This is done by extending Sobol's total-effect parameter sensitivity index for one system model to total-effect process sensitivity index for multiple system models to account for uncertainty in process models and model parameters. The total-effect process sensitivity index includes not only the first-order process sensitivity index for measuring the importance of individual processes but also higher-order indices that account for process interactions. The total-effect process sensitivity index can identify an influential process that itself and its interactions with other processes influence a model output. Here, the total-effect process sensitivity index is applied to two numerical examples: (a) Sobol's G*-functions with analytical solutions of first-order and total-effect process sensitivity indices, and (b) groundwater flow models with interactions between recharge, geology, and snowmelt processes. The second evaluation shows that, due to second-order and higher-order process interactions, the first-order and total-effect process sensitivity indices give different process ranking. It is thus necessary to estimate both first-order and total-effect process sensitivity indices to appreciate the difference between the first-order impact of a process alone and the overall total-effect impact of the process itself and its interactions with other processes on a model output.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Observations Indicate That Clouds Amplify Mechanisms of Southern Ocean Heat Uptake","Morrison, Ariel L.; Singh, Hansi A.; Rasch, Philip J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Climate; ocean heat uptake; climate change; Southern Ocean; clouds ocean heat content","The Southern Ocean has absorbed most of the excess heat associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Since Southern Ocean observations are sparse in certain regions and seasons, much of our knowledge of ocean heat uptake is based on climate model simulations. However, climate models still inadequately represent some properties of Southern Ocean clouds, and they have not identified the mechanisms by which clouds may affect SOHU. Here we use the ERA5 and JRA-55 reanalyses to assess the influence of clouds and other atmospheric processes on SOHU over the past 42 years. We find that years with the highest SOHU between 45-65°S are dominated by ocean heat uptake anomalies during winter and spring, but not during summer or fall. Winter and spring cloud cover are up to 7% higher when SOHU is up to 5.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> higher than the seasonal mean, with the largest increases in the South Pacific Ocean. Clouds are also optically thicker. These changes in cloud properties increases downwelling longwave radiation, amplifying ocean heat uptake. Cloud changes also increase heat uptake by maintaining a stable lower atmosphere, which suppresses turbulent heat fluxes out of the surface. Overall, we find that SOHU is likely not mediated by enhanced surface shortwave absorption over the observational time period. A better understanding of how atmospheric processes impact ocean heat uptake may help improve our understanding of ocean heat uptake mechanisms in the current generation of climate models.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Qualitatively, where surface skin temperatures and lower tropospheric temperature and humidity are not uniform, the downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) will be determined not just by radiation from the atmosphere above a given location, but also by adjacent surface temperatures. We quantify this three-dimensional longwave radiative effect over the Upper Colorado River Basin in clear-sky conditions by calculating surface DLR with observed land-surface temperatures from ECOSTRESS. We find that this effect is due to terrain-subtended sky-view and represents ~22% of the surface longwave flux, rising to ~28% and ~24% in the East and Southeast of the Basin, respectively, and can be >50% in extreme cases. The common omission of this effect in atmospheric radiation models leads to an underestimation of DLR in complex terrain, especially at higher elevations, which has significant implications for mountainous ecohydrology simulations.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The results show that land cover changes from the original forest exhibited a net cooling effect, with contributions of annual GWI<sub>Δα</sub> varying by cover type and ecoregion. Seasonal and monthly variations of the GWI<sub>Δα</sub> showed unique trends over the 19-year period and contributed differently to the total GWI<sub>Δα</sub>. Cropland contributed most to cooling the local climate, with seasonal and monthly offsets of 18% and 83%, respectively, of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of maize fields in the same area. Urban areas exhibited both cooling and warming effects. Cropland and urban areas showed significantly different seasonal GWI<sub>Δα</sub> at some ecoregions.

However, current conceptualizations of hyporheic exchange, residence time distributions, and the associated biogeochemical cycling in streambed sediments do not always accurately explain the hydrological and biogeochemical complexity observed in streams and rivers. Specifically, existing conceptual models insufficiently represent the coupled transport and reactivity along groundwater and surface water flow paths, the role of autochthonous organic matter in streambed biogeochemical functioning, and the feedbacks between surface-subsurface ecological processes, both within and across spatial and temporal scales. While simplified approaches to these issues are justifiable and necessary for transferability, the exclusion of important hyporheic processes from our conceptualizations can lead to erroneous conclusions and inadequate understanding and management of interconnected surface water and groundwater environments. This is particularly true at the landscape scale, where the organizational principles of spatio-temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) and biogeochemical processes remain largely uncharacterized. This article seeks to identify the most important drivers and controls of HEF and biogeochemical cycling based on a comprehensive synthesis of findings from a wide range of river systems. We use these observations to test current paradigms and conceptual models, discussing the interactions of local-to-regional hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological controls of hyporheic zone functioning. This improved conceptualization of the landscape organizational principles of drivers of HEF and biogeochemical processes from reach to catchment scales will inform future river research directions and watershed management strategies.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The study provided county- and state-level biomass potential projections, with biomass feedstock production estimates and suitability assessment of lands acreage likely to transition to energy crops. For this analysis, we estimate biomass supply by year 2028, more specifically, lands acreage transition to switchgrass in the Midwest of the United States, across 50 counties in 3 states (Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado). We propose a multi-criteria site suitability framework, to determine the potential acreage and production for switchgrass, at the field level. Site selection criteria span agronomic and ecosystem services such as previous land cover, crop rotation, soil water holding capacity, crop productivity, field efficiency, topography, soil organic matter, soil leaching propensity, distance to surface water bodies, and soil erosivity. Efficient agricultural field selection for dedicated energy crops field allocation is critical to evaluate biomass resource availability, and it is our position that estimation at the field level would provide a more accurate and useful estimation to support an emerging bioeconomy. Using field suitability scores and county-level assessments, we model land allocation decision for energy crop in the future, estimating the spatial distribution of dynamics of energy crop adoption with priority to fields scoring the highest. Additionally, compared with POLYSYS results from the report mentioned above, our method shows good performance overall, with about 2% and 1.2% of difference in switchgrass acreage allocation and crop production, respectively.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We show that over the first 5-years post-fire, fast-growing bacterial heterotrophs colonize regions of the soil previously occupied by slower-growing saprotrophic fungi. The bacterial heterotrophs mineralize organic matter, releasing nutrients into the soil. This pathway outweighs new sources of nitrogen and facilitates the recovery of plant productivity.

Here we combine plant-level data with a global integrated assessment model to quantify changes in global stranded asset risks from coal-fired power plants across regions and over time. With new plant proposals, cancellations, and retirements over the past five years, global net committed emissions in 2030 from existing and planned coal plants declined by 3.3 GtCO<sub>2</sub> (25%). While these emissions are now roughly in line with initial Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement, they remain far off track from longer-term climate goals. Progress made in 2021 towards no new coal can potentially avoid a 24% (503 GW) increase in capacity and a 55% ($520 billion) increase in stranded assets under 1.5 °C.

"Single–Well Injection–Drift Test to Estimate Groundwater Velocity","Paradis, Charles; Van Ee, Nathan; Hoss, Kendyl; Meurer, Cullen; Tigar, Aaron; Reimus, Paul William; Johnson, Raymond","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","A simple algebraic equation is presented here to estimate the magnitude of groundwater velocity based on data from a single-well injection-drift test thereby eliminating the time-consuming and costly extraction phase. A volume of tracer-amended water was injected by forced-gradient into a single well followed by monitoring of the conservative solute tracers under natural-gradient conditions as their upgradient portions drifted back through the well. The breakthrough curve data from the single well during the drift phase was analyzed to determine the mean travel times of the tracers. The estimated mean upgradient travel distance back through the single well and the mean travel times of the tracers were used in a simple algebraic equation to estimate groundwater velocity. The groundwater velocity based on the single-well injection-drift test was estimated to be approximately 0.64 ft per day. Two transects of observation wells were used to monitor the natural-gradient tracer transport downgradient of the injection well. The one-dimensional, or dual-well, transport of the tracer from the injection well to the nearest downgradient observation well indicated that the groundwater velocity was 0.55 ft per day. The two-dimensional, or multi-well, transport of the center of mass of the tracers indicated that the groundwater velocity was 0.60 ft per day; the dual- and multi-well results were in excellent agreement with those from the single-well and validated the simple algebraic equation. In conclusion, the new single-well method presented here is relatively simple, rapid, and does not require an extraction phase.","Wiley - NGWA","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Driven by river flows, conventional hydropower is exposed to the vagaries of weather and climate, motivating drought and climate change hydropower impact studies at large spatial scales. Here we review methods of climate-driven hydropower simulation at large spatial scales, specifically multi-basin regions to global. We identify four types of approach based on complexity of tools and richness of data applied to the problem. Since the earliest attempts to model climate-driven hydropower at continental scale almost two decades ago, the field has transitioned from one of scientific curiosity to practical application, with studies increasingly motivated by the need to inform power grid expansion planning and operation. As the hydrological and water management models used in large-scale hydropower studies become more sophisticated, new opportunities will emerge to study the impacts of changing hydropower on power system reliability and performance at large power grid scale. To grasp these opportunities, the water resources community must continue to enhance data and models for representing river flows and anthropogenic water use and management at subcontinental to global scales.</p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"High-order multirate explicit time-stepping schemes for the baroclinic-barotropic split dynamics in primitive equations","Lan, Rihui; Ju, Lili; Wang, Zhu; Gunzburger, Max; Jones, Philip","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 58 GEOSCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Primitive equations; Baroclinic-barotropic splitting; Explicit time-stepping; Multirate; Strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta; SSH reconciliation","In order to treat the multiple time scales of ocean dynamics in an efficient manner, the baroclinic-barotropic splitting technique has been widely used for solving the primitive equations for ocean modeling. Based on the framework of strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta approach, we propose two high-order multirate explicit time-stepping schemes (SSPRK2-SE and SSPRK3-SE) for the resulting split system in this paper. The proposed schemes allow for a large time step to be used for the three-dimensional baroclinic (slow) mode and a small time step for the two-dimensional barotropic (fast) mode, in which each of the two mode solves just need to satisfy their respective CFL conditions for numerical stability. Specifically, at each time step, the baroclinic velocity is first computed by advancing the baroclinic mode and fluid thickness of the system with the large time-step and the assistance of some intermediate approximations of the barotropicmode obtained by substepping with the small time step; then the barotropic velocity is corrected by using the small time step to re-advance the barotropic mode un-der an improved barotropic forcing produced by interpolation of the forcing terms from the preceding baroclinic mode solves; lastly, the fluid thickness is updated by coupling the baroclinic and barotropic velocities. Additionally, numerical inconsistencies on the discretized sea surface height caused by the mode splitting are relieved via a reconciliation process with carefully calculated flux deficits. Here, two benchmark tests from the “MPAS-Ocean” platform are carried out to numerically demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability of the proposed SSPRK-SE schemes.","Elsevier","","Univ. of South Carolina, Columbia, SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Advanced ScientificComputing Research (ASCR).

It is also unclear whether stomatal conductance and leaf structure such as leaf mass per area (LMA) determine the variation in sensitivity to O<sub>3</sub> across species. In this study, we investigated leaf morphological, chemical, and photosynthetic responses of 22 genotypes of four C<sub>4</sub> bioenergy species (switchgrass, sorghum, maize, and miscanthus) to elevated O<sub>3</sub> in side-by-side field experiments using free-air O<sub>3</sub> concentration enrichment (FACE). The C<sub>4 </sub>species varied largely in leaf morphology, physiology, and nutrient composition. Elevated O<sub>3</sub> did not alter leaf morphology, nutrient content, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and respiration in most genotypes but reduced net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in maize and photosynthetic capacity in sorghum and maize. Species with lower LMA and higher stomatal conductance tended to show greater losses in photosynthetic rate and capacity in elevated O<sub>3</sub> compared with species with higher LMA and lower stomatal conductance. Stomatal conductance was the strongest determinant of leaf photosynthetic rate and capacity. The response of both area- and mass-based leaf photosynthetic rate and capacity to elevated O<sub>3</sub> were not affected by LMA directly but negatively influenced by LMA indirectly through stomatal conductance. These results demonstrate that there is significant variation in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity among C<sub>4</sub> species with maize and sorghum showing greater sensitivity of photosynthesis to O<sub>3</sub> than switchgrass and miscanthus. Interspecific variation in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity was determined by direct effects of stomatal conductance and indirect effects of LMA. This is the first study to provide a test of unifying theories explaining variation in O<sub>3</sub> sensitivity in C<sub>4</sub> bioenergy grasses. These findings advance understanding of O<sub>3</sub> tolerance in C<sub>4</sub> grasses and could aid in optimal placement of diverse C<sub>4</sub> bioenergy feedstock across a polluted landscape.","Wiley-Blackwell","","Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United Kingdom","2022-02-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Global Change Biology Journal Volume: 28 Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: p. 3379-3393","","","SC0018420","Journal ID: ISSN 1354-1013","10.1111/gcb.16108","","2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","1845061","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1845061","","Global Change Biology","10","28"

In this work, we argue for transforming infrastructure planning and design to effectively utilize safe-to-fail approaches by navigating the opportunities and trade-offs of SETS resilience capabilities. From a technological vantage point, traditional infrastructure planning approaches account for social and ecological domains as external design conditions rather than embedded system characteristics. Safe-to-fail approaches directly challenge the isolation of the technological domain by necessitating a recognition that SETS domains are interconnected and interdependent in infrastructure systems, as such risks and system capabilities for resilience must be managed cohesively.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Suspended sediment plays a vital role in the regional and global cycling of carbon and nutrients by carrying carbon and nutrients from headwaters into lowland rivers and the oceans. Sediment transport through river systems is often fundamentally modified by human activities such as reservoir management. However, a physically based representation of sediment transport is still missing in most existing Earth system models (ESMs), which are essential tools for modeling and predicting Earth system changes. Here, we introduce a multi-process river sediment module for ESMs, which includes (1) hillslope soil erosion and sediment discharge into streams, (2) sediment transport processes through river networks, (3) reservoir operation based on the inflows from upstream areas and water demand from downstream areas, and (4) sediment trapping by reservoirs. All model parameters are estimated a priori without calibration. We apply this new sediment modeling framework to the contiguous United States and validate it against historical observations of monthly streamflow and sediment discharges at 35 river gauges. The model reasonably well captures the long-term balance and seasonal variations of suspended sediment in large river systems. Furthermore, our model results show that suspended sediment discharge in managed rivers is affected more by reservoirs' direct trapping of sediment particles than by their flow regulation. This new sediment module enables future modeling of the transportation and transformation of carbon and nutrients carried by the fine sediment along the river–ocean continuum to close the global carbon and nutrient cycles.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Here we document the cryosphere configuration of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) v1.2. This includes simulating Antarctic ice-shelf basal melting, which has been implemented through simulating the ocean circulation within static Antarctic ice-shelf cavities, allowing for the ability to calculate ice- shelf basal melt rates from the associated heat and freshwater fluxes. In addition, we added the capability to prescribe forcing from iceberg melt, allowing for realistic representation of the other dominant mass loss process from the AIS. In standard resolution simulations (using a non-eddying ocean) under pre-industrial climate forcing, we find high sensitivity of modeled ocean/ice shelf interactions to the ocean state, which can result in a transition to a high basal melt regime under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS), presenting a significant challenge to representing the ocean/ice shelf system in a coupled ESM. We show that inclusion of a spatially dependent parameterization of eddy-induced transport reduces biases in water mass properties on the Antarctic continental shelf. With these improvements, E3SM produces realistic ice-shelf basal melt rates across the continent that are generally within the range inferred from observations. The accurate representation of ice-shelf basal melting within a coupled ESM is an important step towards reducing uncertainties in projections of the Antarctic response to climate change and Antarctica's contribution to global sea-level rise.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

David; Eddy-Dilek, Carol","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. Climate resilience is an emerging issue at contaminated sites and hazardous waste sites, since projected climate shifts (e.g., increased/decreased precipitation) and extreme events (e.g., flooding, drought) could affect ongoing remediation or closure strategies. In this study, we develop a reactive transport model (Amanzi) for radionuclides (uranium, tritium, and others) and evaluate how different scenarios under climate change will influence the contaminant plume conditions and groundwater well concentrations. We demonstrate our approach using a two-dimensional (2D) reactive transport model for the Savannah River Site F-Area, including mineral reaction and sorption processes. Different recharge scenarios are considered by perturbing the infiltration rate from the base case as well as considering cap-failure and climate projection scenarios. We also evaluate the uranium and nitrate concentration ratios between scenarios and the base case to isolate the sorption effects with changing recharge rates. The modeling results indicate that the competing effects of dilution and remobilization significantly influence pH, thus changing the sorption of uranium. At the maximum concentration on the breakthrough curve, higher aqueous uranium concentration implies that sorption is reduced with lower pH due to remobilization. To better evaluate the climate change impacts in the future, we develop the workflow to include the downscaled CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) climate projection data in the reactive transport model and evaluate how residual contamination evolves through 2100 under four climate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The integration of climate modeling data and hydrogeochemistry models enables us to quantify the climate change impacts, assess which impacts need to be planned for, and therefore assist climate resiliency efforts and help guide site management.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The distinct upper-troposphere dust belt over the northern hemisphere has seasonally varying base and top heights of 3.65 ± 2.84 and 8.35 ± 1.50 km above mean sea level and its column loading is strongest during spring (March-April-May). The out-of-phase annual cycles of mid-level dust concentration and westerly wind over source regions control the seasonal upper-tropospheric dust loading variations. African deserts contribute the most (46.3%) to the upper-troposphere dust belt in spring and the synoptic trough is the leading (49%) dust lifting mechanism.","Springer Nature","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Occurrence of Warm Freezing Rain: Observation and Modeling Study","Lu, Zhengqi; Han, Yongxiang; Liu, Yangang","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Freezing rain has been normally considered to be composed of supercooled raindrops when the 2 m air temperature (hereafter T<sub>as</sub>) is below freezing. However, according to a statistical survey of freezing rain observations in China from 2000 to 2019, we find that there were 656 events that occurred at T<sub>as</sub> greater than 0°C (hereafter warm freezing rain and denoted by WFR), which account for 7% of the total freezing rain observations. Additionally, nearly 3% (266 observations) of freezing rain events occurred when the near-surface wet-bulb temperature was greater than 0°C. The modeling and sensitivity experiments on the nonequilibrium raindrop temperature (hereafter T<sub>r</sub>) how that the temperature difference between raindrops and the atmosphere is the main cause of WFR. The magnitudes of the Δ T<sub>ar</sub> (difference between raindrop temperature T <sub>r</sub> and air temperature T<sub>a</sub>) and Δ T<sub>ur</sub> (difference between T<sub>r</sub> and wet-bulb temperature T <sub>w</sub>) are determined by the raindrop diameter D, temperature lapse rate $\Gamma$, and relative humidity RH. Increases of D and $\Gamma$, and a decrease of RH enhance Δ T<sub>ar</sub> and Δ T<sub>ur</sub> and thus the occurrence of WFR. Further simulations of 4 idealized and 370 real sounding profiles reveal that either the T<sub>a</sub> or the T<sub>w</sub> cannot properly distinguish the WFR events. When considering the temperature difference between raindrops and the atmosphere, the WFR can form by the “melting of solid hydrometeors” or “supercooled warm rain process.” This study can also deepen our understanding of the conditions of WFR and freezing rain formation at different altitudes.","American Geophysical Union","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Strong BrC chromophores in QOMS samples were identified as oxygenated aromatics and nitrophenol compounds, while organosulfate compounds were found in the WLG sample.

Recent studies have also showed that the persistence of various classes of SOM may depend on soil Fe mineralogy. Other laboratory studies with model mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) moieties, which were primarily focused on the short-range ordered (SRO) Fe-mineral, such as ferrihydrite, either coated or co-precipitated with natural organic matter (NOM) have suggested that the mineral phase transformation and adsorption/desorption of SOM is rather complex, but appears to be largely controlled by the C/Fe ratio of the MAOM moiety and geochemical conditions. It’s also clear from multiple recent studies that the nature or type of SOM (microbial vs. plant-derived) adsorbed on mineral surfaces, and the rate and extent of SOM bio-degradation depend on the type of mineral (e.g., ferrihydrite, Fe-containing phyllosilicate minerals, calcite), and/or metal ions (e.g., Al, Fe, and Ca), that are associated with the SOM.

The purpose of SMART Cables is to support climate and ocean observation, sea level monitoring, observations of Earth structure, and tsunami and earthquake early warning and disaster risk reduction, including hazard quantification. Recent advances include regional SMART pilot systems that are the first steps to trans-ocean and global implementation. Examples of pilots include: InSEA wet demonstration project off Sicily at the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatory Western Ionian Facility; New Caledonia and Vanuatu; French Polynesia Natitua South system connecting Tahiti to Tubaui to the south; Indonesia starting with short pilot systems working toward systems for the Sumatra-Java megathrust zone; and the CAM-2 ring system connecting Lisbon, Azores, and Madeira. This paper describes observing system simulations for these and other regions. Funding reflects a blend of government, development bank, philanthropic foundation, and commercial contributions. In addition to notable scientific and societal benefits, the telecommunications enterprise’s mission of global connectivity will benefit directly, as environmental awareness improves both the integrity of individual cable systems as well as the resilience of the overall global communications network.

Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10% of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of California, Irvine, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); European Union (EU); UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership; Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Research council of Norway; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); National Science Foundation (NSF); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Spanish Ramón y Cajal’ programme; German Research Foundation (DFG)","","United States","2022-02-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 727 (2022)","","","SC0019407; GA727862; NE/P006760/1; NE/R005125/1; NE/V005855/1; FKZ: 01LP2002A; GA727852; JPMXD0717935457; JPMXD1420318865; JPMEERF20192004; 42030602; 91837101","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 28283","10.1038/s41467-022-28283-y","","2023-01-31T00:00:00Z","1904333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1904333","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1904333","Nature Communications","1","13"

To support these needs, an annual cycle of observations of atmospheric properties, processes, and interactions were made while drifting with the sea ice across the central Arctic during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition from October 2019 to September 2020. An international team designed and implemented the comprehensive program to document and characterize all aspects of the Arctic atmospheric system in unprecedented detail, using a variety of approaches, and across multiple scales. These measurements were coordinated with other observational teams to explore cross-cutting and coupled interactions with the Arctic Ocean, sea ice, and ecosystem through a variety of physical and biogeochemical processes. This overview outlines the breadth and complexity of the atmospheric research program, which was organized into 4 subgroups: atmospheric state, clouds and precipitation, gases and aerosols, and energy budgets. Atmospheric variability over the annual cycle revealed important influences from a persistent large-scale winter circulation pattern, leading to some storms with pressure and winds that were outside the interquartile range of past conditions suggested by long-term reanalysis. Similarly, the MOSAiC location was warmer and wetter in summer than the reanalysis climatology, in part due to its close proximity to the sea ice edge. The comprehensiveness of the observational program for characterizing and analyzing atmospheric phenomena is demonstrated via a winter case study examining air mass transitions and a summer case study examining vertical atmospheric evolution. Overall, the MOSAiC atmospheric program successfully met its objectives and was the most comprehensive atmospheric measurement program to date conducted over the Arctic sea ice. The obtained data will support a broad range of coupled-system scientific research and provide an important foundation for advancing multiscale modeling capabilities in the Arctic.","University of California Press","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

This work was embedded into the interdisciplinary design of the 5 MOSAiC teams, studying the atmosphere, the sea ice, the ocean, the ecosystem, and biogeochemical processes. The overall aim of the snow and sea ice observations during MOSAiC was to characterize the physical properties of the snow and ice cover comprehensively in the central Arctic over an entire annual cycle. This objective was achieved by detailed observations of physical properties and of energy and mass balance of snow and ice. By studying snow and sea ice dynamics over nested spatial scales from centimeters to tens of kilometers, the variability across scales can be considered. On-ice observations of in situ and remote sensing properties of the different surface types over all seasons will help to improve numerical process and climate models and to establish and validate novel satellite remote sensing methods; the linkages to accompanying airborne measurements, satellite observations, and results of numerical models are discussed. We found large spatial variabilities of snow metamorphism and thermal regimes impacting sea ice growth. We conclude that the highly variable snow cover needs to be considered in more detail (in observations, remote sensing, and models) to better understand snow-related feedback processes. The ice pack revealed rapid transformations and motions along the drift in all seasons. The number of coupled ice–ocean interface processes observed in detail are expected to guide upcoming research with respect to the changing Arctic sea ice.</jats:p>","University of California Press","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Ruby; Hagos, Samson; Rasch, Philip J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 58 GEOSCIENCES; Madden-Julian oscillation; Earth system modeling; process-oriented diagnostics","The present study examines the characteristics of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) events represented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1), DOE’s new Earth system model. The coupled E3SMv1 realistically simulates the eastward propagation of precipitation and moist static energy (MSE) anomalies associated with the MJO. As in observations, horizontal moisture advection and longwave radiative feedback are found to be the dominant processes in E3SMv1 that lead to the eastward movement and maintenance of the MJO MSE anomalies, respectively. Modulation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the Maritime Continent region by the MJO is also well represented in the model despite systematic biases in the magnitude and phase of the precipitation diurnal cycle. On the MJO impact over the midlatitude, E3SMv1 reasonably captures the pattern of the MJO teleconnections across the North Pacific and North America, with improvement in the performance in a high-resolution version, despite the magnitude being a bit weaker than the observed. Regarding the interannual variability of the MJO, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulation of the zonal extent of MJO’s eastward propagation, as well as associated changes in the mean state moisture gradient in the tropical west Pacific, are well reproduced in the model. However, MJO in E3SMv1 exhibits no sensitivity to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), with the MJO propagation characteristics being almost identical between easterly QBO and westerly QBO years. Processes that have been suggested as critical to MJO simulation are also examined by utilizing recently developed process-oriented diagnostics.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Performance of Cloud 3D Solvers in Ice Cloud Shortwave Radiation Closure Over the Equatorial Western Pacific Ocean","Ren, Tong; Yang, Ping; Wei, Jian; Huang, Xianglei; Sang, Huiyan","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","For retrieving cloud optical properties from satellite images or computing these properties from climate model output, computationally efficient treatments of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity include the Monte Carlo Independent Column Approximation (McICA) and the Tripleclouds method. Computationally efficient treatment of cloud horizontal radiation exchanges includes the SPeedy Algorithm for Radiative TrAnsfer through CloUd Sides (SPARTACUS). As a test to derive properties from satellite images, we collocate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud retrievals with near-nadir Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) footprints in July 2008 over an equatorial western Pacific Ocean region to compare the performance of the McICA, Tripleclouds, and SPARTACUS solvers to the conventional plane-parallel homogeneous (PPH) treatment. PPH overestimates cloud albedo, and the three solvers effectively reduce overestimation with root mean square error of shortwave upwelling irradiance decreasing between 15.72 and 18.53 W m(-2), or about 22%-25%. Although cloud top variability does not get fed into the simulations, all three solvers also reduce the effect of cloud top variability on cloud albedo. Entrapment (energy reflected downward from clouds) and horizontal radiation transfer have opposite effects on the SPARTACUS cloud albedo simulation. The net effect depends on the cloud vertical extent, the unawareness of which limits the performance of the SPARTACUS solver.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems Journal Volume: 14 Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X","","","DE‐SC0019278; SC0019278","Journal ID: ISSN 1942-2466","10.1029/2021MS002754","","2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","1843892","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843892","","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","2","14"

We designate the use of the term wet carbon system to the interconnected wetlands, ocean, river and streams, lakes and ponds, and permafrost, which are carbon-dense and vital conduits for carbon throughout the terrestrial and aquatic sections of the carbon cycle. We reviewed wet carbon monitoring studies that utilize earth observation to improve our knowledge of data gaps, methods, and future research recommendations. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review collecting 1622 references and screening them with a combination of text matching and a panel of three experts. The search found 496 references, with an additional 78 references added by experts. Our study found considerable variability of the utilization of remote sensing and global wet carbon monitoring progress across the nine systems analyzed. The review highlighted that remote sensing is routinely used to globally map carbon in mangroves and oceans, whereas seagrass, terrestrial wetlands, tidal marshes, rivers, and permafrost would benefit from more accurate and comprehensive global maps of extent.

In this study we use multiple large ensemble simulations of the high-emissions scenario to show increased risk of compound droughts during the boreal summer over ten global regions. Relative to the late twentieth century, the probability of compound droughts increases by ~40% and ~60% by the middle and late twenty-first century, respectively, with a disproportionate increase in risk across North America and the Amazon. These changes contribute to an approximately ninefold increase in agricultural area and population exposure to severe compound droughts with continued fossil-fuel dependence. ENSO is the predominant large-scale driver of compound droughts with 68% of historical events occurring during El Niño or La Niña conditions. With ENSO teleconnections remaining largely stationary in the future, a ~22% increase in frequency of ENSO events combined with projected warming drives the elevated risk of compound droughts.","Nature Publishing Group","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We find evidence of highly oxidized organic molecules (HOM) in the gas phase and relatively low volatility SOA dominated by C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>10</sub> species. We then use computational methods to predict rate coefficients of likely autoxidation and bond scission reactions to develop the first stages of a Δ3 -carene photochemical oxidation mechanism and explain some of our measured compositions. We find that alkoxy bond scission of the cyclohexyl ring likely leads to efficient HOM formation, inline with previous studies. We also find a surprising role for the unimolecular alkoxy radical abstraction of primary hydrogens from methyl groups, which has been calculated to be rapid in the α-pinene system, and suggest more research is required to determine if this is more general to other systems and a feature of autoxidation. This work develops the most comprehensive view to-date of Δ3-carene photochemical oxidation products via measurements and lays out a suggested mechanism of oxidation via computationally derived rate coefficients.","American Chemical Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Late day measurement of excised branches results in uncertainty in the estimation of two stomatal parameters derived from response curves in Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L.","Davidson, Kenneth J.; Lamour, Julien; Rogers, Alistair; Serbin, Shawn P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Stomata; Stomatal Response; Stomatal Optimality; Photosynthesis; Climate Model; Stomatal Conductance","Many terrestrial biosphere models depend on an understanding of the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis. However, unlike the measurement of photosynthetic parameters, such as the maximum carboxylation capacity, where standard methods (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> response or ACi curves) are widely accepted, a consensus method for empirically measuring parameters representing stomatal response has not yet emerged. Most models of stomatal response to environment represent stomatal conductance as being bounded by a lower intercept parameter (g<sub>0</sub>), and linearly scaled based on a multivariate term described by the stomatal slope parameter (g<sub>1</sub>). Here we employ the widely used Unified Stomatal Optimization model, to test whether g<sub>1</sub> and g<sub>0</sub> parameters are impacted by the choice of measurement method, either on an intact branch, or a cut branch segment stored in water. We measured paired stomatal response curves on intact and excised branches of a hybrid poplar clone (Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L. OP367), measured twice over a diurnal period. We found that predawn branch excision did not significantly affect measured g<sub>0</sub> and g<sub>1</sub> when measured within 4 h of excision. Measurement in the afternoon resulted in significantly higher values of g<sub>1</sub> and lower values of g0, with values changing by 55% and 56% respectively. Excision combined with afternoon measurement resulted in a marked effect on parameter estimates, with g1 increasing 89% from morning to afternoon and a 25% lower g<sub>1</sub> for cut branches than those measured in situ. We also show that in hybrid poplar the differences in parameter estimates obtained from plants measured under different conditions can directly impact models of canopy function, reducing modeled transpiration by 18% over a simulated 12.5-hour period. While these findings are only for a single isohydric woody species, our findings suggest that stomatal optimality parameters may not remain constant throughout the day.","Oxford University Press","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Modeling the Economic and Environmental Impacts of Land Scarcity Under Deep Uncertainty","Dolan, Flannery; Lamontagne, Jonathan; Calvin, Katherine; Snyder, Abigail; Narayan, Kanishka B.; Di Vittorio, Alan V.; Vernon, Chris R.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; global change; land use change; bioenergy; land conservation","Land scarcity is increasing over time, driven by complex multi-sector dynamics. The future evolution of various sectors and even the dynamics of their interactions are deeply uncertain or poorly understood. The impacts of land scarcity on the economy and environment are multi-faceted and regional, so any action to convert land will contain inherent tradeoffs. Many different land-use pathways may mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, however, the impacts of these pathways are highly uncertain in the face of future changes. A need exists to provide multi-metric and multi-sector assessments that are robust to myriad uncertainties. Land conservation effectively limits the supply of productive land, while biofuel consumption increases the demand and competition for that land, and how these dynamics individually and jointly propagate to economic and environmental impacts is an important open question. To address this, we adopt the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) that has representations of various important sectors including the climate, land-use economy, energy systems, agriculture, and water resources. Various scenarios of increased land demand (from biofuels) and decreased land supply (from conservation) constrained scenarios under various socioeconomic scenarios drawn from the SSPs were simulated using GCAM. We find that while biofuel consumption and land conservation reduce carbon emissions, this comes at the cost of higher food prices, reduced crop production, and increased water withdrawals. Additionally, some regions experience these tradeoffs more severely than others and are more heavily impacted from the same biofuel mandate or by an additional percent of protected land. These and other findings highlight the importance of multi-sector modeling frameworks that capture many cross-sector linkages, and acknowledge the important uncertainties confronting the human-Earth system when making any analysis of the land scarcity impacts.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

P.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; tropical tropopause layer; DYAMOND; global storm-resolving models; convection; cirrus; microphysics","Pervasive cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere and tropical tropopause layer (TTL) influence the climate by altering the top-of-atmosphere radiation balance and stratospheric water vapor budget. These cirrus are often associated with deep convection, which global climate models must parameterize and struggle to accurately simulate. By comparing high-resolution global storm-resolving models from the Dynamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non-hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) intercomparison that explicitly simulate deep convection to satellite observations, we assess how well these models simulate deep convection, convectively generated cirrus, and deep convective injection of water into the TTL over representative tropical land and ocean regions. The DYAMOND models simulate deep convective precipitation, organization, and cloud structure fairly well over land and ocean regions, but with clear intermodel differences. All models produce frequent overshooting convection whose strongest updrafts humidify the TTL and are its main source of frozen water. Intermodel differences in cloud properties and convective injection exceed differences between land and ocean regions in each model. We argue that, with further improvements, global storm-resolving models can better represent tropical cirrus and deep convection in present and future climates than coarser-resolution climate models. To realize this potential, they must use available observations to perfect their ice microphysics and dynamical flow solvers.","Wiley, American Geophysical Union","ORNL","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Large changes in the Arctic carbon balance are expected as warming linked to climate change threatens to destabilize ancient permafrost carbon stocks. The eddy covariance (EC) method is an established technique to quantify net losses and gains of carbon between the biosphere and atmosphere at high spatiotemporal resolution. Over the past decades, a growing network of terrestrial EC tower sites has been established across the Arctic, but a comprehensive assessment of the network's representativeness within the heterogeneous Arctic region is still lacking. This creates additional uncertainties when integrating flux data across sites, for example when upscaling fluxes to constrain pan-Arctic carbon budgets and changes therein. This study provides an inventory of Arctic (here > = 60∘ N) EC sites, which has also been made available online (https://cosima.nceas.ucsb.edu/carbon-flux-sites/, last access: 25 January 2022). Our database currently comprises 120 EC sites, but only 83 are listed as active, and just 25 of these active sites remain operational throughout the winter. To map the representativeness of this EC network, we evaluated the similarity between environmental conditions observed at the tower locations and those within the larger Arctic study domain based on 18 bioclimatic and edaphic variables. This allows us to assess a general level of similarity between ecosystem conditions within the domain, while not necessarily reflecting changes in greenhouse gas flux rates directly. We define two metrics based on this representativeness score: one that measures whether a location is represented by an EC tower with similar characteristics (ER1) and a second for which we assess if a minimum level of representation for statistically rigorous extrapolation is met (ER4). We find that while half of the domain is represented by at least one tower, only a third has enough towers in similar locations to allow reliable extrapolation. When we consider methane measurements or year-round (including wintertime) measurements, the values drop to about 1/5 and 1/10 of the domain, respectively. With the majority of sites located in Fennoscandia and Alaska, these regions were assigned the highest level of network representativeness, while large parts of Siberia and patches of Canada were classified as underrepresented. Across the Arctic, mountainous regions were particularly poorly represented by the current EC observation network. We tested three different strategies to identify new site locations or upgrades of existing sites that optimally enhance the representativeness of the current EC network. While 15 new sites can improve the representativeness of the pan-Arctic network by 20 %, upgrading as few as 10 existing sites to capture methane fluxes or remain active during wintertime can improve their respective ER1 network coverage by 28 % to 33 %. This targeted network improvement could be shown to be clearly superior to an unguided selection of new sites, therefore leading to substantial improvements in network coverage based on relatively small investments.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Biofuels can offer a pathway to significantly reduce emissions from these sectors, as they can easily substitute for conventional liquid fuels in internal combustion engines. In this paper, we assess the potential of bioenergy to reduce transport GHG emissions through an analysis leveraging various integrated assessment models and scenarios, as part of the 33rd Energy Modeling Forum study (EMF-33). Furthermore, we find that bioenergy can contribute a significant, albeit not dominant, proportion of energy supply to the future transport sector: in scenarios aiming to keep the temperature increase below 2 °C by the end of the twenty-first century, models project that in 2100 bioenergy can provide on average 42 EJ/yr (ranging from 5 to 85 EJ/yr) for transport (compared to 3.7 EJ in 2018), mainly through lignocellulosic fuels. This makes up 9–62% of final transport energy use. Only a small amount of bioenergy is projected to be used in transport through electricity and hydrogen pathways, with a larger role for biofuels in road passenger transport than in freight. The association of carbon capture and storage (CCS) with bioenergy technologies (BECCS) is a key determinant in the role of biofuels in transport, because of the competition for biomass feedstock to provide other final energy carriers along with carbon removal. Among models that consider CCS in the biofuel conversion process the average market share of biofuels is 21% in 2100 (ranging from 2 to 44%), compared to 10% (0–30%) for models that do not. Cumulative direct emissions from the transport sector account for half of the emission budget (from 306 to 776 out of 1,000 GtCO<sub>2</sub>). However, the carbon intensity of transport decreases as much as other energy sectors in 2100 when accounting for process emissions, including carbon removal from BECCS. Lignocellulosic fuels become more attractive for transport decarbonization if BECCS is not feasible for any energy sectors. Since global transport service demand increases and biomass supply is limited, its allocation to and within the transport sector is uncertain and sensitive to assumptions about political as well as technological and socioeconomic factors.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dynamics of organic matter molecular composition under aerobic decomposition and their response to the nitrogen addition in grassland soils","Zhao, Qian; Thompson, Allison M.; Callister, Stephen J.; Tfaily, Malak M.; Bell, Sheryl L.; Hobbie, Sarah; Hofmockel, Kirsten S.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; soil organic matter persistence; mineral-organic matter association; microbial decomposition; respiration; molecular transformation; nitrogen fertilization","Grassland soils store a substantial proportion of the global soil carbon (C) stock. The transformation of C in grassland soils with respect to chemical composition and persistence strongly regulate the predicted terrestrial-atmosphere C flux in global C biogeochemical cycling models. In addition, increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition alters C chemistry in grassland soils. However, there remains controversy about the importance of mineralogical versus biochemical preservation of soil C, as well as uncertainty regarding how grassland soil C chemistry responds to elevated N. This study used grassland soils with diverse soil organic matter (SOM) chemistries in an 8-month aerobic incubation experiment to evaluate whether the chemical composition of SOM converged across sites over time, and how SOM persistence responded to the N addition. This study demonstrates that over the course of incubation, the richness of labile compounds decreased in soils with less ferrihydrite content, whereas labile compounds were more persistent in ferrihydrite rich soils. In contrast, we found that the richness of more complex compounds increased over the incubation in most sites, independent of soil mineralogy. Moreover, we demonstrate the extent to which the diverse chemical composition of SOM converged among sites in response to microbial decomposition. N fertilization decreased soil respiration and inhibited the convergence of molecular composition across ecosystems by altering N demand for microbial metabolism and chemical interactions between minerals and organic molecules. This study provides original evidence that the decomposition and metabolism of labile organic molecules were largely regulated by soil mineralogy (physicochemical preservation), while the metabolism of more complex organic molecules was controlled by substrate complexity (biochemical preservation) independent to mineral-organic interactions. This study advanced our understanding of the dynamic biogeochemical cycling of C by unveiling that N addition dampened C respiration and diminished the convergence of SOM chemistry across diverse grassland ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Its natural polymeric and aromatic structures make it suitable as a potential building block for biopolymer production. Due to the growing environmental and health concerns over conventional polyurethane (PU) manufacturing processes that utilize toxic isocyanates, there is a great interest to develop a non-isocyanate PU (NIPU) route. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy that uses highly pure lignin isolated from co-solvent enhanced lignocellulosic fractionation (CELF) pretreatment of poplar wood to produce biobased NIPUs. In this strategy, hardwood poplar is firstly fractionated via a CELF pretreatment to produce a clean lignin stream that is rich in phenolics. The CELF lignin was then aminated by a Mannich reaction, and the aminated CELF lignin was finally reacted with bicyclic carbonates to yield an advanced NIPU. In this work, the structure, mechanical, and thermal properties of these novel NIPUs were elucidated by FTIR, NMR, tensile test, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The mechanical properties of these lignin based NIPUs could be tuned from highly rigid to elastic polymers by simply modifying the lignin constituents of the polymer. The thermal stabilities of NIPUs were improved because of the addition of aminated lignin, and NIPU containing 55 and 23 wt% lignin showed the highest tensile strength (~1.2 MPa) and elongation at break (~140%), respectively. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the reaction of cyclic carbonate with aminated lignin represents an interesting pathway for the synthesizing of lignin based NIPU with a relative high lignin content.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Modelling physiological costs to assess impacts of climate change on amphibians in Yellowstone National Park, U.S.A","Bartelt, Paul E.; Thornton, Peter E.; Klaver, Robert W.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 59 BASIC BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; Physiological ecology; Mechanistic modelling; Movement costs","Amphibians are vital elements of ecosystems, serving as predator and prey. Their biphasic nature makes them dependent on aquatic and terrestrial habitats; as wet-skinned ectotherms, they are vulnerable to a range of environmental threats, including climate change. Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is becoming warmer and drier, and some wetlands important to amphibians have diminished. Continued climate change is predicted to reduce snowpack, soil moisture, and forest cover. We used data from models of future climate and vegetation cover to mechanistically model how climate change might affect the movements of Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) across the landscape of three test areas in YNP for the years 2050 and 2090, compared to 2000 as a baseline. Least-cost path analysis produced mixed results: for 2050 and 2090, physiological costs of movement increased in one test area and decreased in another; they were mixed in the third. These changes generally reflect the preference by toads for more open forests. Estimating costs for other species of YNP amphibians produced more negative results. For Columbia Spotted Frogs (Rana luteiventris) and Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) (both more aquatic and less adapted to terrestrial habitats), movement costs increased by about 2–15X. Reduced frequency or duration of rain events might limit the nocturnal movements of Western Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Climate change may not have negative impacts on all amphibians throughout YNP, but increased movement costs for terrestrial habitats will accentuate effects of drying wetlands in at least parts of YNP. Land management actions that preserve habitat structure of both forest and low shrub cover may help mitigate continued drying conditions of climate change.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Dimethyl sulfide (DMS), emitted from the ocean, is a dominant natural precursor of non-sea-salt sulfate in the PI and pristine present-day (PD) atmospheres. Here we revisit the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of DMS, particularly under pristine conditions, and its impact on aerosol IRF. Based on previous laboratory studies, we expand the simplified DMS oxidation scheme used in the Community Atmospheric Model version 6 with chemistry (CAM6-chem) to capture the OH-addition pathway and the H-abstraction pathway and the associated isomerization branch. These additional oxidation channels of DMS produce several stable intermediate compounds, e.g., methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and hydroperoxymethyl thioformate (HPMTF), delay the formation of sulfate, and, hence, alter the spatial distribution of sulfate aerosol and radiative impacts. The expanded scheme improves the agreement between modeled and observed concentrations of DMS, MSA, HPMTF, and sulfate over most marine regions, based on the NASA Atmospheric Tomography (ATom), the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic (ACE-ENA), and the Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS) Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) measurements. We find that the global HPMTF burden and the burden of sulfate produced from DMS oxidation are relatively insensitive to the assumed isomerization rate, but the burden of HPMTF is very sensitive to a potential additional cloud loss. We find that global sulfate burden under PI and PD emissions increase to 412 Gg S (+29 %) and 582 Gg S (+8.8 %), respectively, compared to the standard simplified DMS oxidation scheme. The resulting annual mean global PD direct radiative effect of DMS-derived sulfate alone is –0.11 W m<sup>–2</sup>. The enhanced PI sulfate produced via the gas-phase chemistry updates alone dampens the aerosol IRF as anticipated (–2.2 W m<sup>–2</sup> in standard versus –1.7 W m<sup>–2</sup>, with updated gas-phase chemistry). However, high clouds in the tropics and low clouds in the Southern Ocean appear particularly sensitive to the additional aqueous-phase pathways, counteracting this change (–2.3 W m<sup>–2</sup>). This study confirms the sensitivity of aerosol IRF to the PI aerosol loading and the need to better understand the processes controlling aerosol formation in the PI atmosphere and the cloud response to these changes.","Copernicus GmbH","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

PFAS are a diverse set of chemicals that accumulate and transport quite differently in the environment depending on the length of their fluoroalkyl chains and their functional groups. This diversity in PFAS chemical characteristics combined with varying environmental factors also impact the bioaccumulation of these compounds in different organisms. In this review, we evaluate environmental factors (such as organic carbon, proteins, lipids, and dissolved cations) as well as PFAS characteristics (head group, chain-length, and concentration) that contribute to the significant variation seen in the literature of bioaccumulation metrics reported for organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Of the factors evaluated, it was found that PFAS concentration, dissolved organic matter, sediment organic matter, and biotransformation of precursor PFAS tended to significantly impact reported bioaccumulation metrics the most. Based on this review, it is highly suggested that future studies provide sufficient details of important environmental factors, specific organism traits/ behavior, and PFAS concentrations/compounds when reporting on bioaccumulation metrics to further fill data gaps and improve our understanding of PFAS in aquatic ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Trends in surface equivalent potential temperature: A more comprehensive metric for global warming and weather extremes","Song, Fengfei; Zhang, Guang J.; Ramanathan, V.; Leung, L. Ruby","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; global warming; surface equivalent surface temperature; atmospheric convection; weather extremes","Trends in surface air temperature (SAT) are a common metric for global warming. Using observations and observationally driven models, we show that a more comprehensive metric for global warming and weather extremes is the trend in surface equivalent potential temperature (Thetae_sfc) since it also accounts for the increase in atmospheric humidity and latent energy. From 1980 to 2019, while SAT increased by 0.79°C, Thetae_sfc increased by 1.48°C globally and as much as 4°C in the tropics. The increase in water vapor is responsible for the factor of 2 difference between SAT and Thetae_sfc trends. Thetae_sfc increased more uniformly (than SAT) between the midlatitudes of the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere, revealing the global nature of the heating added by greenhouse gases (GHGs). Trends in heat extremes and extreme precipitation are correlated strongly with the global/tropical trends in Thetae_sfc. The tropical amplification of Thetae_sfc is as large as the arctic amplification of SAT, accounting for the observed global positive trends in deep convection and a 20% increase in heat extremes. With unchecked GHG emissions, while SAT warming can reach 4.8°C by 2100, the global mean Thetae_sfc can increase by as much as 12°C, with corresponding increases of 12°C (median) to 24°C (5% of grid points) in land surface temperature extremes, a 14- to 30-fold increase in frequency of heat extremes, a 40% increase in the energy available for tropical deep convection, and an up to 60% increase in extreme precipitation.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The risk to golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) is of particular concern due to their small population size and conservation status. Golden eagles subsidize their flight in part by soaring in orographic updrafts, which can place them in conflict with wind turbines utilizing the same low-altitude wind resource. Understanding the behavior of soaring raptors in varying atmospheric conditions can therefore be relevant to predicting and mitigating their risk of collision. We present a predictive movement model that simulates individual paths of golden eagles during directional flight (such as migration) that is subsidized by orographic updraft. We modeled eagles in a 50 km by 50 km study area in Wyoming containing three wind power plants with documented golden eagle collisions with turbines. The movement model is applicable to any region where ground elevation is known at turbine scale (50 m) and wind conditions are known at facility scale (3 km). For a given set of atmospheric conditions, the model simulates movements of thousands of orographic soaring eagles to produce a density map quantifying the relative probability of eagle presence. We validated the simulated tracks with GPS telemetry data showing four directional tracks made by golden eagles transiting through the area in 2019 and 2020. For each eagle track, validation was performed using the ratio of the model-simulated eagle presence likelihood with uniform eagle presence and the presence computed using directed random-walk movements. We found that the predictive performance of the model was significantly better (likelihood ratio 1) for low-altitude movements than high-altitude movements that can involve thermal-soaring. We employed the model to produce seasonal presence maps for migrating golden eagles. We found significant turbine-level variations in eagle presence between northerly and southerly migration routes through the study area. Overall, the proposed model offers a generalizable, probabilistic, and predictive tool to assist wind energy developers, ecologists, wildlife managers, and industry consultants in estimating the potential for conflict between soaring birds and wind turbines, thereby reducing the need for site-specific data on golden eagle movements.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

BASIN-3D enables users to adopt a standardized approach for data retrieval and avoid customizations for the data type or source. We demonstrate the value of BASIN-3D with two use cases that require integration of data from regional to watershed spatial scales. The first application uses the BASIN-3D Python library to integrate time-series hydrological and meteorological data to provide standardized inputs to analytical and machine learning codes in order to predict the impacts of hydrological disturbances on large river corridors of the United States. The second application uses the BASIN-3D Django framework to integrate diverse time-series data in a mountainous watershed in East River, Colorado, United States to enable scientific researchers to explore and download data through an interactive web portal. Thus, BASIN-3D can be used to support data integration for both web-based tools, as well as data analytics using Python scripting and extensions like Jupyter notebooks. The framework is expected to be transferable to and useful for many other field and modeling studies.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In this study, the authors search for the characteristics of radar-rainfall estimates that are most important for skillful streamflow predictions. They perform comprehensive hydrologic investigations of radar-rainfall characteristics, including spatiotemporal resolution, radar range visibility, statistical characterization of rainfall variability, all vis-a-vis basin characteristics such as size and river network topology. Since the true rainfall fields are unknown, the authors exploit a paradigm of using two independently constructed radar-rainfall products i.e., Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor and IFC-ZR used operationally by the Iowa Flood Center (IFC). Using the distributed hydrologic model called the Hillslope-Link Model for the domain of the state of Iowa, they evaluate streamflow prediction at 140 USGS gauge stations that monitor rivers in Iowa. Through spatial and temporal rainfall aggregation experiments, the authors show that the impact of spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall is significant typically for smaller basins while starts reducing significantly for basins larger than 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Other rainfall characteristics they explored do not reveal a strong signature in the relationship of rainfall differences between the two products and hydrograph errors. However, exploring the product similarities rather than differences reveals that the basin-wide rainfall volume has the most significant effect on streamflow prediction.

Our framework is based on a pollutant's characterization factor (CF) and three new metrics: Available Regulatory Capacity for Incremental Emissions (ARCIE), Source CF Ratio, and Activity Health Impact (AHI) Ratio. ARCIE can be used to assess whether a receptor location has capacity to accommodate additional source emissions while complying with regulatory limits. We present CF as a midpoint indicator of health impacts per unit mass of emitted pollutant. Source CF Ratio enables comparison of potential new-source locations based on human health impacts. The AHI Ratio estimates the health impacts of a pollutant in relation to the utilization of the source for each unit of product or service. These metrics can be applied to any pollutant, energy source sector (e.g., agriculture, electricity), source type (point, line, area), and spatial modeling domain (nation, state, city, region). We demonstrate these metrics through a case study of fine particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) emissions from U.S. corn stover harvesting and local processing at various scales, representing steps in the biofuel production process. We model PM<sub>2.5</sub> formation in the atmosphere using a novel reduced-complexity chemical transport model called the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP). Through this case study, we present the first area-source PM<sub>2.5</sub> CFs that address the recommendations of several LCIA studies to establish spatially explicit CFs specific to an energy source sector or type. Overall, the framework developed in this work provides multiple new ways to consider the potential impacts of air emissions through spatially differentiated metrics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, with a rapidly expanding array of in situ and satellite data, there is an opportunity to improve our mechanistic understanding of the carbon (C) cycle's response to land use and climate change. Uncertainty in temperature limitation on productivity poses a significant challenge to predicting the response of ecosystem carbon fluxes to a changing climate. Here we diagnose and quantitatively resolve environmental limitations on the growing-season onset of gross primary production (GPP) using nearly 2 decades of meteorological and C flux data (2000–2018) at a subalpine evergreen forest in Colorado, USA. We implement the CARbon DAta-MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) model–data fusion network to resolve the temperature sensitivity of spring GPP. To capture a GPP temperature limitation – a critical component of the integrated sensitivity of GPP to temperature – we introduced a cold-temperature scaling function in CARDAMOM to regulate photosynthetic productivity. We found that GPP was gradually inhibited at temperatures below 6.0°C (±2.6°C) and completely inhibited below -7.1°C (±1.1°C). The addition of this scaling factor improved the model's ability to replicate spring GPP at interannual and decadal timescales (r=0.88), relative to the nominal CARDAMOM configuration (r=0.47), and improved spring GPP model predictability outside of the data assimilation training period (r=0.88). While cold-temperature limitation has an important influence on spring GPP, it does not have a significant impact on integrated growing-season GPP, revealing that other environmental controls, such as precipitation, play a more important role in annual productivity. This study highlights growing-season onset temperature as a key limiting factor for spring growth in winter-dormant evergreen forests, which is critical in understanding future responses to climate change.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Representation of stomatal conductance (g<sub>sw</sub>) is therefore an essential component of models that seek to simulate water and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in plants and ecosystems. For given environmental conditions at the leaf surface (CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and vapor pressure deficit or relative humidity), models typically assume a linear relationship between g<sub>sw</sub> and photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation (A). However, measurement of leaf-level g<sub>sw</sub> response curves to changes in A are rare, particularly in the tropics, resulting in only limited data to evaluate this key assumption. Here, we measured the response of g<sub>sw</sub> and A to irradiance in six tropical species at different leaf phenological stages. We showed that the relationship between g<sub>sw</sub> and A was not linear, challenging the key assumption upon which optimality theory is based-that the marginal cost of water gain is constant. Our data showed that increasing A resulted in a small increase in g<sub>sw</sub> at low irradiance, but a much larger increase at high irradiance. We reformulated the popular Unified Stomatal Optimization (USO) model to account for this phenomenon and to enable consistent estimation of the key conductance parameters g<sub>0</sub> and g<sub>1</sub>. Our modification of the USO model improved the goodness-of-fit and reduced bias, enabling robust estimation of conductance parameters at any irradiance. In addition, our modification revealed previously undetectable relationships between the stomatal slope parameter g<sub>1</sub> and other leaf traits. We also observed nonlinear behavior between A and g<sub>sw</sub> in independent datasets that included data collected from attached and detached leaves, and from plants grown at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.

"Dimensionless parameters for cloudy Rayleigh-Bénard convection: Supersaturation, Damköhler, and Nusselt numbers","Thomas, Subin; Prabhakaran, Prasanth; Yang, Fan; Cantrell, Will H.; Shaw, Raymond A.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","In steady-state Rayleigh-Bénard convection, heat is transported by turbulent thermal convection from the bottom, hot surface to the top, cold surface, leading to a height-independent sensible heat flux. When water vapor is present and cloud formation occurs, there is also an additional latent heat flux. Heat transport in cloudy Rayleigh-Bénard convection depends on turbulent flow as well as the microphysical state of the clouds: specifically, whether substantial supersaturations exist and whether cloud liquid water is removed through sedimentation/precipitation. In this article we bridge between the Rayleigh-Bénard convection literature and the atmospheric literature. We express the governing equations for cloudy convection in dimensionless form, thereby explicitly identifying the governing parameters relevant to the cloudy case, including Schmidt, Damköhler, supersaturation, and sedimentation numbers. We further connect to the atmospheric literature by obtaining a Nusselt number (dimensionless heat flux) for a cloud-convection system, directly from the conservation equations for temperature and water vapor. This flux has the same form as that identified by Zhang et al. [L. Zhang, K. L. Chong, and K.-Q. Xia, J. Fluid Mech. 874, 1041 (2019)] for convection with water vapor, but is extended to the cloudy case. For equal thermal and water vapor diffusivities, the flux corresponds to the widely used atmospheric quantities equivalent temperature and moist static energy. Using large eddy simulation (LES) of an idealized cloudy Rayleigh-Bénard convection system with fixed boundary conditions, we find that the equivalent heat flux (Nusselt number) is only weakly dependent on the microphysical details of the system, such as liquid water mixing ratio and cloud droplet number concentration. Finally, from the results, we show the vertical profiles of sensible and latent heat fluxes depend on the liquid water content, whereas the equivalent heat flux remains a constant throughout the height of the chamber.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Methodology to determine the coupling of continental clouds with surface and boundary layer height under cloudy conditions from lidar and meteorological data","Su, Tianning (ORCID:0000000330562592); Zheng, Youtong (ORCID:0000000259617617); Li, Zhanqing (ORCID:000000016737382X)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","<p>Abstract. The states of coupling between clouds and surface or boundary layer have been investigated much more extensively for marine stratocumulus clouds than for continental low clouds, partly due to more complex thermodynamic structures over land. A manifestation is a lack of robust remote sensing methods to identify coupled and decoupled clouds over land. Following the idea for determining cloud coupling over the ocean, we have generalized the concept of coupling and decoupling to low clouds over land, based on potential temperature profiles. Furthermore, by using ample measurements from lidar and a suite of surface meteorological instruments at the U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's Southern Great Plains site from 1998 to 2019, we have developed a method to simultaneously retrieve the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height (PBLH) and coupled states under cloudy conditions during the daytime. The new lidar-based method relies on the PBLH, the lifted condensation level, and the cloud base to diagnose the cloud coupling. The coupled states derived from this method are highly consistent with those derived from radiosondes. Retrieving the PBLH under cloudy conditions, which has been a persistent problem in lidar remote sensing, is resolved in this study. Our method can lead to high-quality retrievals of the PBLH under cloudy conditions and the determination of cloud coupling states. With the new method, we find that coupled clouds are sensitive to changes in the PBL with a strong diurnal cycle, whereas decoupled clouds and the PBL are weakly related. Since coupled and decoupled clouds have distinct features, our new method offers an advanced tool to separately investigate them in climate systems.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"On the attribution of the impacts of extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change","Perkins-Kirkpatrick, S. E.; Stone, D. A.; Mitchell, D. M.; Rosier, S.; King, A. D.; Lo, Y. E.; Pastor-Paz, J.; Frame, D.; Wehner, M.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; impacts; attribution; climate and weather extremes; climate change","Investigations into the role of anthropogenic climate change in extreme weather events are now starting to extend into analysis of anthropogenic impacts on non-climate (e.g. socio-economic) systems. However, care needs to be taken when making this extension, because methodological choices regarding extreme weather attribution can become crucial when considering the events’ impacts. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) method, useful in extreme weather attribution research, has a very specific interpretation concerning a class of events, and there is potential to misinterpret results from weather event analyses as being applicable to specific events and their impact outcomes. Using two case studies of meteorological extremes and their impacts, we argue that FAR is not generally appropriate when estimating the magnitude of the anthropogenic signal behind a specific impact. Attribution assessments on impacts should always be carried out in addition to assessment of the associated meteorological event, since it cannot be assumed that the anthropogenic signal behind the weather is equivalent to the signal behind the impact because of lags and nonlinearities in the processes through which the impact system reacts to weather. Whilst there are situations where employing FAR to understand the climate change signal behind a class of impacts is useful (e.g. ‘system breaking’ events), more useful results will generally be produced if attribution questions on specific impacts are reframed to focus on changes in the impact return value and magnitude across large samples of factual and counterfactual climate model and impact simulations. We advocate for constant interdisciplinary collaboration as essential for effective and robust impact attribution assessments.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"A new method for inferring city emissions and lifetimes of nitrogen oxides from high-resolution nitrogen dioxide observations: a model study","Liu, Fei; Tao, Zhining; Beirle, Steffen; Joiner, Joanna; Yoshida, Yasuko; Smith, Steven J.; Knowland, K. Emma; Wagner, Thomas","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","We present a new method to infer emissions and lifetimes of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) based on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) observations together with reanalysis wind fields for cities located in polluted backgrounds. Since the accuracy of the method is difficult to assess due to lack of “true values” that can be used as a benchmark, we apply the method to synthetic NO<sub>2</sub> observations derived from the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model at a high horizontal spatial resolution of 4 km × 4 km for cities over the continental United States. We compare the inferred emissions and lifetimes with the values given by the NU-WRF model to evaluate the method. The method is applicable to 26 US cities. The derived results are generally in good agreement with the values given by the model, with the relative differences of 2 % ± 17 % (mean ± standard deviation) and 15 % ± 25 % for lifetimes and emissions, respectively. Our investigation suggests that the use of wind data prior to the satellite overpass time improves the performance of the method. The correlation coefficients between inferred and NU-WRF lifetimes increase from 0.56 to 0.79 and for emissions increase from 0.88 to 0.96 when comparing results based on wind fields sampled simultaneously with satellite observations and averaged over 9 h data prior to satellite observations, respectively. We estimate that uncertainties in NO<sub>x</sub> lifetime and emissions arising from the method are approximately 15 % and 20 %, respectively, for typical (US) cities. The total uncertainties reach up to 43% (lifetimes) and 45% (emissions) by considering the additional uncertainties associated with satellite NO<sub>2</sub> observations and wind data. We expect this new method to be applicable to NO<sub>2</sub> observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and geostationary satellites, such as Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) or the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution (TEMPO) instrument, to estimate urban NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and lifetimes globally.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, our knowledge of the biogeochemical drivers of MeHg production is limited in these soils. Using substrate addition (acetate and sulfate) and selective microbial inhibition approaches, we investigated the geochemical drivers and dominant microbial methylators in 60-day microcosm incubations with two tundra soils: a circumneutral fen soil and an acidic bog soil, collected near Nome, Alaska, United States. Results showed that increasing acetate concentration had negligible influences on MeHg production in both soils. However, inhibition of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) completely stalled MeHg production in the fen soil in the first 15 days, whereas addition of sulfate in the low-sulfate bog soil increased MeHg production by 5-fold, suggesting prominent roles of SRB in Hg(II) methylation. Without the addition of sulfate in the bog soil or when sulfate was depleted in the fen soil (after 15 days), both SRB and methanogens contributed to MeHg production. Analysis of microbial community composition confirmed the presence of several phyla known to harbor microorganisms associated with Hg(II) methylation in the soils. Lastly, the observations suggest that SRB and methanogens were mainly responsible for Hg(II) methylation in these tundra soils, although their relative contributions depended on the availability of sulfate and possibly syntrophic metabolisms between SRB and methanogens.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We develop a novel approach to model social vulnerability that couples individuals and their varying forms of protective capacity with the social fabric of the communities in which they reside. The backbone of our model is the Public-Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), a product of the U.S. Census Bureau that preserves a representative sample of completed responses to the American Community Survey (ACS). The PUMS enables us to understand the full range of individual protective capacities against a hazard in an exposed area, which we term individual vulnerability profiles (IVPs). In this case, we examine IVPs in the Coney Island-Brighton Beach section of New York City, which suffered severe impacts during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. To manage the large number of unique IVPs in Coney Island-Brighton Beach, we perform a segmentation analysis to generalize them into thematic cohort vulnerability profiles (CVPs) representing a typology of vulnerable people in Coney Island-Brighton Beach during Sandy. From synthetic populations of CVPs, we then estimate how individuals in varying housing types were coexposed to Sandy at the census tract level by classifying these areas into community social vulnerability profiles (SVPs). Our results provide a topology of social vulnerability that simultaneously links individual, community, and population-wide concerns, enabling a more holistic understanding of resources and interventions beneficial to human security during events like Sandy than is attainable with area-level metrics.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Our simulations feature the development of an ice-shelf ocean boundary layer through dynamic ice melting in a regime with low thermal driving, low ice-shelf basal slope, and strong shear driven by the geostrophic flow. We present a preliminary assessment of existing ice-shelf basal melt parameterizations adopted in single component or coupled ice-sheet and ocean models on the basis of a small parameter study.

Previous work showed that exports from fine-grained, organic-rich zones sustain reducing conditions in downstream coarse-grained aquifers beyond the influence of reduced aqueous products alone. Here, we show that sustained anaerobic activity can be attributed to the export of organic carbon, including live microorganisms, from fine-grained zones. We used a dual-domain column system with ferrihydritecoated sand and embedded reduced, fine-grained lenses from Slate River (Crested Butte, CO) and Wind River (Riverton, WY) floodplains. After 50 d of groundwater flow, 8.8 ± 0.7% and 14.8 ± 3.1% of the total organic carbon exported from the Slate and Wind River lenses, respectively, had accumulated in the sand downstream. Furthermore, higher concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and lower concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in the sand compared to total aqueous transport from the lenses suggest that Fe(II) was produced in situ by microbial oxidation of organic carbon coupled to iron reduction. This was further supported by an elevated abundance of 16S rRNA and iron-reducing (gltA) gene copies. These findings suggest that organic carbon transport across interfaces contributes to downstream biogeochemical reactions in natural alluvial aquifers.","American Chemical Society","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER)","","United States","2022-01-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology Journal Volume: 56 Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2738-2746","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.1c04664","","2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","1841643","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1841643","","Environmental Science and Technology","4","56"
"Marine Boundary Layer Decoupling and the Stable Isotopic Composition of Water Vapor","Galewsky, Joseph; Jensen, Michael P.; Delp, Jacqueline","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Decoupling of the subcloud layer in stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layers (STMBL) influences low-cloud cover by limiting the supply of water vapor from the surface. However, the relative importance of mixing between surface fluxes and other reservoirs of water vapor as a function of the degree of decoupling is poorly understood. Water vapor transport within the STMBL and its response to decoupling is explored using surface measurements of water vapor isotopic composition that were obtained from Graciosa Island, Azores, during the summer and fall of 2018. The data show an inverse relationship between the decoupling metric, Δq, and the degree of drying from an isotopically depleted water vapor source. The isotopic data require some degree of drying with an isotopically depleted source for coupled conditions, and likely require a small amount of mixing even for strongly decoupled conditions. The data are consistent with mixing between purely local reservoirs of water vapor, subjected to a small amount of condensation and fractionation, and do not require the invocation of large-scale transport of water vapor aloft or additional cloud-formation effects aloft.","American Geophysical Union","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Subgrid-scale horizontal and vertical variation of cloud water in stratocumulus clouds: a case study based on LES and comparisons with in situ observations","Covert, Justin A. (ORCID:0000000281705584); Mechem, David B.; Zhang, Zhibo (ORCID:0000000194911654)","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Stratocumulus clouds in the marine boundary layer cover a large fraction of ocean surface and play an important role in the radiative energy balance of the Earth system. Simulating these clouds in Earth system models (ESMs) has proven to be extremely challenging, in part because cloud microphysical processes such as the autoconversion of cloud water into precipitation occur at scales much smaller than typical ESM grid sizes. An accurate autoconversion parameterization needs to account for not only the local microphysical process (e.g., the dependence on cloud water content qc and cloud droplet number concentration N<sub>c</sub>) but also the subgrid-scale variability of the cloud properties that determine the process rate. Accounting for subgrid-scale variability is often achieved by the introduction of a so-called enhancement factor E. Previous studies of E for autoconversion have focused more on its dependence on cloud regime and ESM grid size, but they have largely overlooked the vertical dependence of E within the cloud. In this study, we use a large-eddy simulation (LES) model, initialized and constrained with in situ and surface-based measurements from a recent airborne field campaign, to characterize the vertical dependence of the horizontal variation of q<sub>c</sub> in stratocumulus clouds and the implications for E. Similar to our recent observational study (Zhang et al., 2021), we found that the inverse relative variance of q<sub>c</sub>, an index of horizontal homogeneity, generally increases from cloud base upward through the lower two-thirds of the cloud and then decreases in the uppermost one-third of the cloud. As a result, E decreases from cloud base upward and then increases towards the cloud top. We apply a decomposition analysis to the LES cloud water field to understand the relative roles of the mean and variances of <sub>q</sub>c in determining the vertical dependence of E. Our analysis reveals that the vertical dependence of the horizontal q<sub>c</sub> variability and enhancement factor E is a combined result of condensational growth throughout the lower portion of the cloud and entrainment mixing at cloud top.

"Bayesian characterization of uncertainties surrounding fluvial flood hazard estimates","Sharma, Sanjib; Ghimire, Ganesh Raj; Talchabhadel, Rocky; Panthi, Jeeban; Lee, Benjamin Seiyon; Sun, Fengyun; Baniya, Rupesh; Adhikari, Tirtha Raj","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; flood hazards; nonstationarity; uncertainty quantification; climate change; infrastructure design","Fluvial floods drive severe risk to riverine communities. There is strong evidence of increasing flood hazards in many regions around the world. The choice of methods and assumptions used in flood hazard estimates can impact the design of risk management strategies. In this study, we characterize the expected flood hazards conditioned on the uncertain model structures, model parameters, and prior distributions of the parameters. We construct a Bayesian framework for river stage return level estimation using a nonstationary statistical model that relies exclusively on the Indian Ocean Dipole Index. We show that ignoring uncertainties can lead to biased estimation of expected flood hazards. We find that the considered model parametric uncertainty is more influential than model structures and model priors. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty in extreme flood stage estimates, and are of practical use for informing water infrastructure designs in a changing climate.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Will Anthropogenic Warming Increase Evapotranspiration? Examining Irrigation Water Demand Implications of Climate Change in California","Vahmani, P.; Jones, A. D.; Li, D.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Climate modeling studies and observations do not fully agree on the implications of anthropogenic warming for evapotranspiration (ET), a major component of the water cycle and driver of irrigation water demand. Here, we use California as a testbed to assess the ET impacts of changing atmospheric conditions induced by climate change on irrigated systems. Our analysis of irrigated agricultural and urban regions shows that warmer atmospheric temperatures have minimal implications for ET rates and irrigation water demands—about one percent change per degree Celsius warming (~1°C<sup>-1</sup>). By explicitly modeling irrigation, we control for the confounding effect of climate-driven soil moisture changes and directly estimate water demand implications. Our attribution analysis of the drivers of ET response to global anthropogenic warming shows that as the atmospheric temperature and vapor pressure deficit depart from the ideal conditions for transpiration, regulation of stomata resistance by stressed vegetation almost completely offsets the expected increase in ET rates that would otherwise result from abiotic processes alone. We further show that anthropogenic warming of the atmosphere has minimal implications for mean relative humidity (<1.7%°C<sup>-1</sup>) and the surface available energy (<0.2%°C<sup>-1</sup>), which are critical drivers of ET. This study corroborates the growing evidence that plant physiological changes moderate the degree to which changes in potential ET are realized as actual ET.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Win-win transportation strategies for India: Linking air pollution and climate mitigation","Dharmala, Nikhilesh; Kholod, Nazar; Chaturvedi, Vaibhav; Ghosh, Probal Pratap; Mathur, Ritu; Bali, Shikha; Behera, Anshuman; Chamola, Sakshi; Clarke, Leon; Evans, Meredydd; Horowitz, Russell; Jain, Aakansha; Koti, Poonam Nagar; Paladugula, Anantha Lakshmi; Qamar, Sharif; Shekhar, Swapnil; Srinivasan, Shweta","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; India; transport; energy consumption; emissions; scenarios","Here, this article analyzes road transport in India to explore linkages between air pollution and climate change policies in the transportation sector. Five teams modeled five policy scenarios – fuel efficiency, electrification, alternative fuels, modal shifts, and moderation in transport demand – to explore which policy brings the largest synergetic effects in reducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) emissions. The teams also modeled the comprehensive scenario which included policy measures from individual scenarios. The paper concludes that all of the measures provide strong co-benefits in reducing air pollutant and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The modeling results show that increased energy efficiency of passenger and freight vehicles has the largest protentional for reducing both CO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions. It is possible to reach even a larger reduction of air pollutants and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by combining several policy measures in the comprehensive scenario.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Performance of reverse osmosis membrane with large feed pressure fluctuations from a wave-driven desalination system","Sitterley, Kurban A.; Cath, Tani J.; Jenne, Dale S.; Yu, Yi-Hsiang; Cath, Tzahi Y.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; desalination; hydrokinetic energy; reverse osmosis; wave energy","Wave-driven desalination systems are proposed water treatment systems that involve reverse osmosis of seawater powered directly by wave motion. Such a configuration would result in drastic feed pressure fluctuations. For a technology conventionally operated with a constant feed condition, the effect of these variable pressures on membrane integrity and performance is unknown. Here, experiments were conducted with spiral wound membranes coupled to a system capable of producing feed pressure fluctuations of more than 400 psi. Feed composition included 5, 20, and 35 g/L NaCl, and a synthetic seawater at normal and 1.5x concentration. The variable feed conditions included sine-like pressure waves swings of 200-500 and 500-900 psi with frequencies of 1.25, 7.5, and 12 waves/min, and a model-generated random waveform. Between each wave experiment we performed membrane integrity tests at 650 psi and 25 g/L NaCl feed, which showed a 7.4% drop in the membrane's water permeability coefficient, an 18.4% flux decline, and more than 99% salt rejection over 1770 h of cumulative experimental time. Analysis of permeate samples showed high salt rejection. In general, variable feed pressure had no significant deleterious effect on membrane integrity or performance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.
