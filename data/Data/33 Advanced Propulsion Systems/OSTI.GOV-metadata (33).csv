"Environmental impacts of first-mile-last-mile systems with shared autonomous electric vehicles and ridehailing","Grahn, Rick; Qian, Sean; Hendrickson, Chris","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; First-mile; Last-mile; VMT; Ridehailing; Fuel consumption; Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV)","Emerging mobility services, such as ridehailing and shared autonomous vehicles, provide the transportation sector with new tools to improve system efficiency and mitigate costs to the environment. However, recent history has shown that these same technologies can have reverse effects if they are not strategically deployed and intelligently managed. This study identifies one important component of the greater transportation system – first-mile last-mile (FMLM) services – where both ridehailing services and shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV) are thought to excel. Results indicated that while ridehailing services contributed to higher daily VMT, their daily fuel needs were 12%–45% less compared to on-demand transit shuttles. We also show that current prevailing SAEV technology is insufficient for widespread deployment in many real-world FMLM systems due to battery range limitations and travel speed constraints. However, improving battery range or travel speed beyond a threshold, 125 miles and 45 mph in the study, would outperform driver-based shuttle solutions.","Elsevier","","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Sustainable Transportation.

"Water Contamination Impacts on Biodiesel Antioxidants and Storage Stability","Christensen, Earl D.; McCormick, Robert L.","09 BIOMASS FUELS; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; biodiesel; fatty acids; fuel additives; fuel storage; stability; water treatment","Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) can oxidize in storage to form acids and gums that negatively impact engine performance and durability. Antioxidant additives are used to increase biodiesel storage stability, and previous studies that evaluated the effectiveness of antioxidants demonstrated that more polar antioxidants tend to be the most effective (provide the largest improvement in stability per unit of antioxidant added). However, polar antioxidants have significant water solubility, and diesel fuel storage tanks are commonly contaminated with water (forming a layer of water under the fuel). This study investigates whether nonpolar antioxidants, which are less effective in dry environments, might be more effective under wet conditions simulating real-world storage. Biodiesel blends treated with polar and nonpolar antioxidants were subjected to accelerated aging using the ASTM D4625 protocol (storage at 43 °C, open to air, for up to 24 weeks) both with and without added water. Fuels treated with polar/higher-effectiveness compounds and stored in contact with water (simulating water in a storage tank) or high humidity showed accelerated loss of stability compared to dry storage. The same fuel treated with a nonpolar antioxidant and stored in the same conditions did not exhibit accelerated stability loss and thus had higher storage stability over the long term despite treatment with an initially less effective additive. Analysis of the fuels during aging showed that this loss of stability was not due to oxidation but rather extraction of the polar antioxidant into the water layer. Antioxidant additives that are incompatible with wet or humid storage conditions were found to cause faster-than-anticipated loss of stability, which was preventable with use of nonpolar additives.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Numerical assessment of fuel physical properties on high-dilution diesel advanced compression ignition combustion","D．F． Chuahy, Flavio (ORCID:0000000298280201); Sluder, C. Scott; Curran, Scott J.; Kukkadapu, Goutham; Wagnon, Scott W.; Whitesides, Russell","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Diesel; ACI; Physical properties; EGR; Compression ignition","Using traditional lean air-fuel mixture aftertreatment technologies to reduce NO<sub>x</sub> at low exhaust temperatures is limited below 175°C. Recent low engine load NO<sub>x</sub> emission regulations encouraged researchers to explore the potential of fuel physical properties to enable low-temperature, low-NO<sub>x</sub> combustion under challenging conditions in which the selective catalytic reduction device might be unable to treat engine-out NO<sub>x</sub>. Three diesel range fuels were developed to explore how the distillation profile affects and may enable low-load diesel advanced-compression ignition. The least volatile fuel is a conventional, commercially available diesel #2 fuel with a cetane number of 45.3. The second-most volatile fuel is diesel #1 fuel, which can also be found commercially. The last fuel, which is the most volatile, is a new formulation designed to target a final boiling point approximately 50 K below diesel #1 fuel and was termed diesel #0 fuel. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed and validated against experimental data to investigate the underlying effects of each of the developed fuels in the combustion process. Finally, each fuel physical property (e.g., density, viscosity, etc.) was changed independently to assess its effect under the same operating conditions and identify potential directions for fuel formulation that may enable improved NOx emissions and reduce the reliance on aftertreatment systems for NO<sub>x</sub> control. The results showed that although changes in the fuel distillation curve and other physical properties affect the air-fuel mixtures substantially, changes were not sufficient to result in a large impact to low-load NO<sub>x</sub> formation. The maximum predicted NO<sub>x</sub> reduction was 11% uncorrected by combustion phasing. The results suggest that further research efforts should focus on changing the chemical properties of the fuel, like the cetane number, to allow higher EGR dilution and stable combustion.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Increasing the cell operating voltage is one of the realistic strategies to extend the energy density, but it is inevitably accompanied by irreversible structural changes and mechanical failure of the electrode materials and continuous parasitic reactions within the electrode–electrolyte interface resulting in capacity fading and subsequent battery failure along with safety issues. Herein, we report deprotonation of layered-type materials at high voltages (>4.5 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) as a newly identified cause of electrode degradation, which has not been addressed previously. Electrochemical analysis and diagnostics combined with advanced characterization studies and computational simulations were employed to understand deprotonation mechanisms and investigate the effect of the deprotonation process on the electrode during high voltage operation. We demonstrated that protons act as charge carriers in lithium (Li)-free materials through the deprotonation process during the initial charging. In addition, this study shows that the deprotonation process is dependent upon transition metals and accordingly deteriorates the electrode by changing its structure and electrochemical properties.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cradle-to-Grave Lifecycle Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Light-Duty Passenger Vehicles in China: Towards a Carbon-Neutral Future","Gan, Yu (ORCID:0000000178217400); Lu, Zifeng (ORCID:0000000173315861); He, Xin; Wang, Michael; Amer, Amer Ahmad","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; lifecycle analysis; cradle-to-grave; decarbonization; electric vehicle; life cycle analysis","Vehicle electrification is considered a pathway for on-road transportation decarbonization in China. Different from the conventional gasoline vehicles whose emissions are mainly released from vehicle tailpipes, emissions of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are from the upstream processes of electricity generation and vehicle manufacturing, thus a comprehensive lifecycle analysis and comparison of BEVs with gasoline vehicles is required to quantify the emission mitigation benefit of vehicle electrification and determine the path to a carbon-neutral future. In the study, we compare the cradle-to-grave (C2G) lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of gasoline and electric vehicles in China and analyze the greenhouse gas emission reduction of vehicle electrification in different provinces. Results show that under the current technologies, the national average C2G GHG emissions for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) of 100 miles (i.e., 160 km) and 300 miles (i.e., 480 km) all-electric range (AER) are 231 and 279 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km, respectively, 22% and 5% lower than those for gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Improving vehicle fuel efficiency by hybridizing gasoline ICEVs can effectively reduce C2G emissions to 212 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km. At the provincial level, C2G GHG emissions of BEVs vary according to the provincial electricity mix. In eight provinces, C2G GHG emissions of BEVs with 300 miles AER (BEV300s) are higher than those of gasoline ICEVs due to the GHG-intensive coal-based electricity mix. In the future scenario, with low carbon fuels (such as high-level bioethanol blending gasoline) and electricity decarbonization, the national average C2G emissions of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and BEV300s can be reduced to 55 and 73 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km, respectively. Further decrease of C2G GHG emissions relies on reducing vehicle-cycle emissions from material processing and vehicle component manufacturing.","MDPI AG","","Argonne National Lab.

"Linking transportation agent-based model ($\mathrm{ABM}$) outputs with micro-urban social types ($\mathrm{MUSTs}$) via typology transfer for improved community relevance","Wilson, Alana M.; Romero-Lankao, Patricia; Zimny-Schmitt, Daniel; Sperling, Joshua; Young, Stanley","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; agent-based model; mobility energy productivity; MEP; metric; socio-spatial analysis; spatial transferrability","The human relationship with transportation is shaped by social, economic, demographic, and urban form variables, or socio-spatial factors. The spatial dynamics of these are key to generating and interpreting outputs of transportation models that are most relevant for a community and the diverse mobility needs of its members. Here we present a typology transfer framework, grounded in socio-spatial dynamics shaping people's mobility, to take transportation-themed regional mobility model outcomes, in this case from two agent-based models (ABMs), and extrapolate them to other cities, with less time and resource intensity than new ABM development. The typology transfer process first identifies micro-urban social types (MUSTs) using socio-spatial factors, then defines city types based on spatial patterns of MUSTs to assess across which cities transfer results are likely to best hold. Lastly, a typology transfer multiplier matrix extrapolates a given variable, in our case the Mobility Energy Productivity (MEP) metric, to another city. The full process demonstration uses ABM results from Chicago (POLARIS model) and San Francisco (BEAM model), applying them to New York City. We discuss how MEP or other outputs can be appropriately estimated and used for integrated, human-centered mobility analysis. Key findings include that this MUST framework of user-defined dependent and independent variables allows tailoring ABM results and interpretations to specific community needs and data availability. Findings clarify that positive outcomes can be targeted towards user groups, based on sociospatial characteristics, using a typology approach, such as inclusive access to mobility choices, transportation affordability, and greater efficiency in resource use.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

CTwin is an end-to-end web-based platform that incorporates various aspects of the decision-making process for optimizing urban transportation systems in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to reduce traffic congestion, incidents, and vehicle fuel consumption. The platform serves as a cyberinfrastructure to collect and integrate multi-domain urban mobility data from various online repositories and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, covering multiple urban aspects (e.g., traffic, natural hazards, weather, and safety) that are relevant to urban mobility management. The platform enables advanced capabilities for: (a) real-time situational awareness on traffic and infrastructure conditions on highways and urban roads, (b) cyber-physical control for optimizing traffic signal timing, and (c) interactive visual analytics on big urban mobility data and various metrics for traffic prediction and transportation performance evaluation. The platform is designed using a multi-level componentization paradigm and is implemented using modular and adaptive architecture, rendering it as a generalizable and extendable prototype for other urban management applications. We present several use cases to demonstrate CTwin’s core capabilities for supporting decision-making in smart urban mobility management.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The charging load of heavy-duty charging station can reach several megawatts, which could induce adverse impacts on the distribution grid if not effectively mitigated. To analyze the impacts and provide corresponding solutions, we select four representative distribution systems - including both single-feeder cases and a multi-feeder case - and design thorough test metrics for the impact analysis. The charging load profiles used in the analysis are derived from realistic conventional heavy-duty vehicle travel data. Based on the analysis results, charging stations are placed at three different representative locations in each distribution system: best, good, and worst locations. Mitigation strategies using a combination of smart charger functionality, on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, and on-site energy storage (ES) are proposed and tested. A sizing method is also proposed to find the optimal PV-ES-charger capacity that minimizes the capital cost.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A method for determining optimal electric range by considering electric vehicle lightweighting on perceived ownership cost","Ou, Shiqi; Zhang, Shengyong; Lin, Zhenhong; Davis, Stacy","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; battery electric vehicle; design optimization; electric driving range; energy consumption; light-weighting; perceived cost of vehicle ownership","The limited driving range due to high costs and low energy densities of batteries constraints the battery electric vehicle (BEV) market growth. Lightweighting in theory can reduce energy consumption rate and extend the driving range. The knowledge gap is to quantitatively link the cost-effectiveness of light-weight technologies with range extension and consumer acceptance of BEVs. In this study, a physics-based energy consumption model of BEVs is constructed and associated with a statistics-based model on the basis of travel surveys. A perceived cost of ownership (PCO) is then developed by adding intangible costs to traditional total cost of ownership models. We estimate, at the disaggregate vehicle model and driver level and the aggregate market level, 1) the extended range due to lightweighting for a given battery size; and 2) the optimal electric range based on lightweighting decisions. The cost-effectiveness of lightweighting for BEV range extension is found to vary with income-dependent daily range limitation value, driving patterns and lightweighting technology costs. In general, adopting lightweighting in BEVs is more cost-effective for consumers with higher daily limitation value, as well as for those with higher driving intensity or suitable daily driving patterns. When the lightweighting involves a higher vehicle production cost, less lightweighting could reduce the overall PCO for BEV owners. 4 of the selected top ten BEV models are found to benefit from additional 2.09%–4.45% lightweighting. Finally, the method built in this study can guide automakers in planning R&D investments in battery and lightweighting technologies.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Due to the increasing importance of unimolecular decomposition reactions in high-temperature combustion, we have investigated the di-isobutylene isomers in high dilution utilizing a pyrolysis microflow reactor and detected radical intermediates and stable products using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy. Additional speciation data at oxidative conditions were also recorded utilizing a plug flow reactor at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 725-1150 K at equivalence ratios of 1.0 and 3.0 and at residence times of 0.35 s and 0.22 s, respectively. Combustion products were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). Ignition delay time measurements for di-isobutylene were performed at pressures of 15 and 30 bar at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 diluted in 'air' in the temperature range 900-1400 K using a high-pressure shock-tube facility. New measurements of the laminar burning velocities of di-isobutylene/air flames are also presented. The experiments were performed using the heat flux method at atmospheric pressure and initial temperatures of 298-358 K. Moreover, data consistency was assessed with the help of analysis of the temperature and pressure dependencies of laminar burning velocity measurements, which was interpreted using an empirical power-law expression. Electronic structure calculations were performed to compute the energy barriers to the formation of many of the product species formed. The predictions of the present mechanism were found to be in adequate agreement with the wide variety of experimental measurements performed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Regression analysis is used to assess the relationships between station utilization and several contextual and environmental factors. We conclude that local EV adoption is a strong indicator of utilization; L2 station utilization decreases with the size of the local charging network, while DCFC stations are less affected; and increased charging power has a greater effect on utilization for DCFC stations than L2.

Power electronics is inherently a multidomain field where semiconductor physics and electrical, thermal, and mechanical design knowledge converge to achieve a practical realization of desired targets in the form of conversion efficiency, power density, and reliability. Due to the promising nature of artificial intelligence in delivering rapid results, engineers are starting to explore the ways in which it can contribute to making power electronics more compact and reliable. Here, we conduct a brief review of the foray of artificial intelligence in three distinct subtechnologies within a power electronics system in the context of electric vehicles: semiconductor devices, power electronics module design and prognostics, and thermal management design. The intent is not to report an exhaustive literature review, but to identify the state of the art and opportunities for artificial intelligence to play a meaningful role in power electronics design from a mechanical and thermal standpoint, as well as to discuss a few promising future research directions.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Mitigation of emissions and energy consumption due to light-duty vehicle size increases","Gohlke, David; Kelly, Jarod; Stephens, Thomas; Wu, Xinyi; Zhou, Yan","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Fuel efficiency; Electrification; Greenhouse gas emissions; Vehicle size","Analysts need to consider the shift of light-duty vehicle sales from cars to light trucks to accurately project fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and consumer spending. Here, we find that energy consumed by on-road light-duty vehicles in the United States can vary by 10% by changing assumptions regarding the sales mix. Scenarios aligned with third-party forecasts, assuming a greater sales proportion of light trucks and fewer cars, yield petroleum consumption 3–8% higher than forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), with greenhouse gas emissions 5–7% higher and a 4–9% increase in consumer spending on vehicles and fuel. This incremental energy consumption can be offset by additional technologies for these vehicles. If most sedans were phased out in favor of larger sport utility vehicles, we find a sales share of 30% battery electric vehicles or 39% hybrid electric vehicles would equal the emissions of the EIA Reference Case.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Enhancing $\phi$-sensitivity of ignition delay times through dilution of fuel-air mixture","Cho, Jaeyoung; Luecke, Jon; Rahimi, Mohammad J.; Kim, Yeonjoon; Zigler, Bradley T.; Kim, Seonah","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; advanced fuel ignition delay analyzer; dilution; ignition delay; iso-octane; phi-sensitivity","The high $\phi$-sensitivity (η) of ignition delay time (τ<sub>IDT</sub>) is one of the desirable fuel properties for the high-load extension of advanced compression ignition engine. Recent studies revealed the effectiveness of a high dilution rate (x<sub>D</sub>) for enhancing η at the engine-relevant conditions. This study aims to quantify the effect of dilution on the η of isooctane using a combined experiment-simulation approach. The ignition delay of the isooctane/air mixture was measured with an Advanced Fuel Ignition Delay Analyzer (AFIDA) over the temperature range of 623 - 923 K at 10 bar pressure with global $\phi$ = 0.3 - 0.6, with and without 28.6% of additional N<sub>2</sub> dilution. For precise evaluation of experimental η, the facility effect of the AFIDA experiment was characterized with three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3-D CFD) simulation. The temperature in the combustion chamber from 3-D CFD indicated a substantial temporal dependency, varying up to ~52 K by charge-cooling of fuel injection and heat transfer from the wall. We introduced the dimensionless number θ(t) for characterizing the temporal profile of chamber temperature. Consideration of the facility effect using θ(t) resulted in better agreement between the experimental ..eta.. and zero-dimensional (0-D) kinetics simulation. The refined η were then further utilized to quantify the effectiveness of dilution to η The extent of η enhancement with dilution strategy was maximized at the low-temperature chemistry regime, increasing η by 77% with a 28.6% dilution rate. Further analysis on the dilution effect was carried out using 0-D kinetics simulation, revealing the critical dimensionless numbers relevant to the effectiveness of dilution to η enhancement. Here, this study is the first experiment-simulation combined research to quantify the effect of dilution on η, facilitating the kinetics model refinement for better reproduction of $\phi$-sensitivity.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As the world grapples with the environmental fallout from rising CO2 emissions, a prevailing strategy to mitigate the impact of air travel is through the utilization of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) produced from biogenic carbon sources such as fats, oils, greases, and biomass. However, with the demand for SAF expected to grow substantially in the coming decades, there is concern around the availability of these feedstocks at scale. Recent studies have proposed that this potential gap in supply could be closed by utilizing CO2 as a complementary source of carbon combined with renewable electricity to drive the chemical transformation. In this study, a crosscutting comparison of an emerging CO2-to-SAF pathway with existing routes to SAF is performed, revealing the potential for CO2-derived SAF to be competitive both in terms of costs and carbon intensity, further diversifying future options for SAF and providing a complementary option for the conversion of CO2-to-SAF beyond the decades old methanol to olefins (MTO) and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) technologies. In addition, we discuss potential technical, market, and systems integration risks for the ultimate scale-up and commercialization of the pathway identified herein.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results offer a change in paradigm - instead of biofuels being competitors to fossil fuels, biofuels can add value to refineries' product slates, because of their favorable properties. This potential value can be characterized by calculating the breakeven value (BEV), as defined below. The proposed modeling framework incorporates extensive data from (1) projected product demands over the next few decades, (2) crude oil and refinery products pricing, and (3) fuel specifications. The complete refinery models serve as a basis for assessing the value of biofuels, assuming profitability remains the same for representative petroleum refinery configurations. Resulting valuations varied widely with BEVs observed between 10-120 dollars/bbl given the considered blending levels and crude prices. Further, BEV was correlated with the fuel octane ratings such as octane numbers (research, RON and motor octane numbers, MON) and both antiknock index (AKI, average of RON and MON) and sensitivity (S, difference between RON and MON), with a slightly higher correlation with the sensitivity. However, the expected decrease in gasoline demand for the upcoming years could negatively impact biofuels demand and value, in a business-as-usual scenario. The analysis also showed high valuations in smaller refineries since they can enhance the capabilities for producing specialty, high-value fuels/products, and introduce high octane-barrels into otherwise constrained blending operations. Additional implications towards refiners include opportunities to rebalance operations, access to high-value fuel markets, and synchronization with broader transportation industry trends. Furthermore, results indicate the value of Co-Optima boosted spark ignition (BSI) efficiency gains can extend to refiners to incentivize decarbonization and diversified feedstock production.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Impact of Electric Vehicle customer response to Time-of-Use rates on distribution power grids","Birk Jones, C.; Vining, William; Lave, Matthew; Haines, Thad; Neuman, Christopher; Bennett, Jesse; Scoffield, Don R.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; caldera; electric vehicles; EVI-Pro; grid; OpenDSS; time-of-use","Electric Vehicles (EV) present a unique challenge to electric power system (EPS) operations because of the potential magnitude and timing of load increases due to EV charging. Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing is an established way to reduce peak system loads. It is effective at shifting the timing of some customer-activated residential loads - such as dishwashers, washing machines, or HVAC systems - to off-peak periods. EV charging, though, can be larger than typical residential loads (up to 19.2 kW) and may have on-board controls that automatically begin charging according to a pre-set schedule, such as when off-peak periods begin. To understand and quantify the potential impact of EV charging's response to TOU pricing, this paper simulates 10 distribution feeders with predicted 2030 EV adoption levels. The simulation results show that distribution EPS experience an increase in peak demand as high as 20% when a majority of the charging begins immediately after on-peak times end, as might occur if EV charging is automatically scheduled. However, if charging start times are randomized within the off-peak period, EV charging is spread out and the simulations showed a decrease in the peak load to be 5% lower than results from simulations that did not implement TOU rates.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The authors investigate the feasibility of mounting the battery pack inside the vehicle and air-cooling it with fans supplying conditioned air from the cabin. Moreover, the cells within each module are to be immersed in a heat-transfer fluid to improve temperature homogeneity. A multi-stage thermal analysis is performed to ensure adequate thermal regulation of the battery under the proposed design, considering installation and operational constraints. The authors perform thermal and electrical characterization tests on a single cell. Results inform the development of computational fluid dynamics models of the cells, modules, and pack. Module-level analysis shows that the cell temperatures can be maintained below their upper operational limit of 55 °C with module wall-to-air heat transfer coefficients between 10 and 20 Wm<sup>-2</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>. Pack-level analysis of distinct configurations determines effective airflow paths for adequate heat transfer and delivers a final battery pack design that achieves sufficient cooling and temperature uniformity. A reduced-order electrothermal model is developed to rapidly predict the transient battery performance and to develop a temperature control strategy.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We leverage large-scale vehicle telematics data (>205 million miles of driving) to estimate the charging behaviors and infrastructure requirements for U.S. battery-electric semi-trailer trucks within three operating segments: local, regional, and long-haul. We model two types of charging - mid-shift (fast) and off-shift (slow) - and show that off-shift charging at speeds compatible with current light-duty charging infrastructure (i.e., =350 kW) can supply 35% to 77% of total energy demand for local and regional trucks with =300-mile range. Megawatt-level speeds are required for mid-shift charging, which make up 44% to 57% of energy demand for long-haul trucks with =500-mile range. However, demand shifts from mid-shift to off-shift charging as the range for battery-electric trucks increases and when off-shift charging is widely available. Finally, we observe geographic trends in charging demand, finding that local trucks have greater demand within urban areas, whereas long-haul trucks have more demand along rural interstate corridors. As the range for battery-electric trucks increases, we show that charging demand shifts from rural to urban locations due to observed vehicle dwell tendencies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Understanding Subsidies to Achieve Diesel Powertrain Financial Parity for Heavy-Duty Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles","Sujan, Vivek Anand","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel cell vehicles; heavy trucks; hydrogen fuel; fuel cells; commercial vehicles; cost analysis","The development of a long-term sustainable hydrogen energy economy for commercial vehicle transportation will need to overcome key critical technical and logistics considerations in the near term. As compared to zero-emission powertrains, fossil-fuel-based powertrains provide mission flexibility and high uptime at a comparatively low total cost of ownership (TCO). While the incumbent carbon-intensive powertrains suffer from poor efficiency and are not sustainable to support global climate change initiatives in transportation decarbonization, techno-economic challenges continue to create complex barriers to the large-scale displacement of these with highly electrified powertrains architectures. Here, this article specifically addresses opportunities that well-targeted subsidies would afford in achieving fuel cell electric powertrain financial parity with diesel powertrains in heavy-duty trucks (HDTs). It shows that a rigorous assessment of system TCO factors will be critical in designing a viable subsidy strategy. Based on powertrain component and fuel price points, subsidy variations (for both capital expenses and operating fuel expenses) are assessed and quantified to determine where and how much subsidies should be leveraged to accelerate achieving diesel system financial parity. It shows that subsidies on hydrogen fuel expenses (and associated constituents) will play an important role in achieving this goal while subsidies on capital expenses (the more typical subsidy formulation) may not always be the preferred subsidy strategy. The results provide subsidy agencies with clear guidance and a database approach to characterize and implement viable HDT hydrogen powertrain system subsidy strategies. The approach may be readily tailored for other applications and system architectures.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Numerical and Experimental Investigations on the Ignition Behavior of OME","Wiesmann, Frederik; Strauß, Lukas; Rieß, Sebastian; Manin, Julien; Wan, Kevin; Lauer, Thomas","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; CFD; OME; e-fuels; multi-injection; oxygenated fuels; spray modeling","On the path towards climate-neutral future mobility, the usage of synthetic fuels derived from renewable power sources, so-called e-fuels, will be necessary. Oxygenated e-fuels, which contain oxygen in their chemical structure, not only have the potential to realize a climate-neutral powertrain, but also to burn more cleanly in terms of soot formation. Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODE or OMEs) are a frequently discussed representative of such combustibles. However, to operate compression ignition engines with these fuels achieving maximum efficiency and minimum emissions, the physical-chemical behavior of OMEs needs to be understood and quantified. Especially the detailed characterization of physical and chemical properties of the spray is of utmost importance for the optimization of the injection and the mixture formation process. The presented work aimed to develop a comprehensive CFD model to specify the differences between OMEs and dodecane, which served as a reference diesel-like fuel, with regards to spray atomization, mixing and auto-ignition for single- and multi-injection patterns. The simulation results were validated against experimental data from a high-temperature and high-pressure combustion vessel. The sprays’ liquid and vapor phase penetration were measured with Mie-scattering and schlieren-imaging as well as diffuse back illumination and Rayleigh-scattering for both fuels. To characterize the ignition process and the flame propagation, measurements of the OH* chemiluminescence of the flame were carried out. Significant differences in the ignition behavior between OMEs and dodecane could be identified in both experiments and CFD simulations. Liquid penetration as well as flame lift-off length are shown to be consistently longer for OMEs. Zones of high reaction activity differ substantially for the two fuels: Along the spray center axis for OMEs and at the shear boundary layers of fuel and ambient air for dodecane. Additionally, the transient behavior of high temperature reactions for OME is predicted to be much faster.","MDPI","","Sandia National Lab.

A charging scheduling model is further proposed and a rolling horizon approach is utilized in the second phase to optimize the real-time charging scheduling of electric buses. Compared to existing electric bus system planning methods, the proposed integrated model can reduce the total system cost by 19.5%. In addition, compared to uncontrolled charging, the proposed rolling horizon-based charging strategy can reduce the total charging cost by 68.3%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cordon screen: A cordon-based congestion pricing policy evaluation method for U.S. cities","Simeone, Christina E.; Thornton, Matthew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; congestion pricing; sketch planning; transportation planning; transportation planning tool","Global trends toward urbanization will exacerbate traffic congestion, delays in economic productivity, and air pollution issues for growing cities. Traffic congestion pricing is one method available to help ameliorate these concerns. New York City is on the verge of implementing a cordon-based traffic congestion pricing policy around its central business district. For budget-constrained municipalities, evaluating implementation of such policy could be costly. This article proposes a sketch-planning methodology, called Cordon Screen, for major U.S. cities to evaluate the net income, traffic mitigation, and avoided pollution emissions from cordon-based traffic congestion pricing. This method relies on national datasets and limited user-specific data inputs, along with a range of user-selectable assumptions informed by academic literature to deliver order-of-magnitude results. The numerous limitations of this method are acceptable for preliminary policy evaluation to determine if greater financial investment to obtain more accurate results is justified. The Denver metropolitan area is used to demonstrate Cordon Screen capabilities, with mid-range assumption results suggesting the policy is most effective at generating net income and increasing vehicle speeds on major interstates. For Denver, the policy is comparably less effective at reducing air pollution and increasing speeds on minor roadways. Validation against early implementation results from the London cordon are acceptable. Still, users should discount revenue generation projections. Choice of cordon area may be the most difficult obstacle when using the Cordon Screen.

Lately, the battery research community has focused on identifying XFC bottlenecks and determining novel design solutions. Like other LiB components, cathodes can present XFC bottlenecks, especially when considering long-term battery life. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of how XFC conditions degrade LiB cathodes. The present article reviews relevant cathode-focused studies and summarizes the current understanding regarding cathode performance and aging issues under XFC conditions. Dominant aging modes and mechanisms are identified at different length-scales with electrochemical correlations for LiNi<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC)-based cathodes. A range of electrochemical techniques and models provide key insights into cathode performance and life issues. A suite of multimodal and multiscale microscopy and X-ray techniques is surveyed to quantify chemical, structural, and crystallographic NMC-cathode degradation. Cathode cycle-life is scaled to equivalent EV miles to illustrate how cathode degradation translates to real-world scenarios and quantifies cathode-related bottlenecks that hinder XFC adoption. Finally, the article discusses several cathode cycle-life aging mitigation strategies with example case studies and identifies remaining challenges.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Octane Requirements of Lean Mixed-Mode Combustion in a Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition Engine","Kim, Namho; Vuilleumier, David; Singh, Eshan; Sjöberg, Magnus","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel-lean combustion; mixed-mode combustion; octane requirements; multimode SI engine operation","Here, this study investigates the octane requirements of a hybrid flame propagation and controlled autoignition mode referred to as mixed-mode combustion (MMC), which allows for strong control over combustion parameters via a spark-initiated deflagration phase. Due to the throughput limitations associated with both experiments and 3-D computational fluid dynamics calculations, a hybrid 0-D and 1-D modeling methodology was developed, supported by experimental validation data. This modeling approach relied on 1-D, two-zone engine simulations to predict bulk in-cylinder thermodynamic conditions over a range of engine speeds, compression ratios, intake pressures, trapped residual levels, fueling rates, and spark timings. Those predictions were then transferred to a 0-D chemical kinetic model, which was used to evaluate the autoignition behavior of fuels when subjected to temperature–pressure trajectories of interest. Finally, the predicted autoignition phasings were screened relative to the progress of the modeled deflagration-based combustion in order to determine if an operating condition was feasible or infeasible due to knock or stability limits. The combined modeling and experimental results reveal that MMC has an octane requirement similar to modern stoichiometric spark-ignition engines in that fuels with high research octane number (RON) and high octane sensitivity (S) enable higher loads. Experimental trends with varying RON and S were well predicted by the model for 1000 and 1400 rpm, confirming its utility in identifying the compatibility of a fuel’s autoignition behavior with an engine configuration and operating strategy. However, the model was not effective in predicting (nor designed to predict) operability limits due to cycle-to-cycle variations, which experimentally inhibited operation of some fuels at 2000 rpm. Putting the operable limits and efficiency from MMC in the context of a state-of-the-art engine, the MMC showed superior efficiencies over the range investigated, demonstrating the potential to further improve fuel economy.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

The sector is also among the last to reduce criteria pollutants and is responsible for up to 3% of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. For the first time, the maritime sector is facing regulatory action on multiple fronts: reductions in fuel sulfur content, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, as well as expected upcoming limits on black carbon emissions. Decarbonizing the maritime sector requires the development of new fuel sources that do not compete with other transportation fuels in the global market. Additionally, because of the extremely large physical size of the internal combustion engines present in shipping vessels, experimental development of the engine-fuel system is often cost prohibitive. This work aims to develop a computational model of a scaled marine engine. The scaled model is representative of a custom-built 1:10 scale research engine commissioned for lubricant research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Reduced chemical mechanisms are developed for diesel, biodiesel, bio-oil, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The mechanisms are combined, and the impact of these fuel blends on the emissions of NO<sub>x</sub> and PAHs (as a surrogate for soot) is assessed.

Under the Co-Optima initiative, the U.S. Department of Energy is leveraging capabilities from its nine national laboratories and more than 35 university and industry partners including advanced computational tools, process design, data analysis, and economic and sustainability modeling tools to simultaneously design fuels and engines capable of running efficiently in an affordable, scalable, and sustainable way. In this work, we conducted techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to understand the cost, technology development, and environmental impacts of producing selected bioblendstocks for advanced engines such as multimode (MM) type engines at the commercial scale. We assessed 12 biofuel production pathways from renewable lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks using different conversion technologies (biochemical, thermochemical, or hybrid) to produce target co-optimized biofuels. TEA and LCA were used to evaluate 19 metrics across technology readiness, economic viability, and environmental impact and for each ranked on a set of criteria as favorable, neutral, unfavorable, or unknown. We found that most bioblendstocks presented in this study showed favorable economic metrics, while the technology readiness metrics were mostly neutral. The economic viability results showed potentially competitive target costs of less than $\$4$ per gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) for six candidates and less than $\$2.5$/GGE for methanol. We identified 10 MM bioblendstock candidates with synergistic blending performance and with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% or more compared to petroleumderived gasoline. The analysis presented here also provides insights into major economic and sustainability drivers of the production process and potential availability of the feedstocks for producing each MM bioblendstock.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Such advantages are increasing with government policy promotion and technology improvement. However, the exploration of EV flexibility requires the coordination of both transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), to ensure the safe and reliable operation of power network. In this paper, we propose a coordinated evaluation method that determines the optimal utilization of EV temporal flexibility without compromising EV owners’ usage. At the distribution level, DSOs first evaluate EV aggregators’ operational boundaries to exploit distribution level services. At the transmission level, TSOs then determine EV charging schedules and ancillary service capacity simultaneously, taking into account the requirement from DSOs. Here, we validate the model in a case study using the IEEE 123 node test feeder and EV charging sessions obtained from a transportation simulation tool that uses real-world data.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

This process produces branched alkanes from DME using a Cu/BEA catalyst and is a promising alternative to other syngas conversion processes such as Fischer-Tropsch to linear alkanes and traditional ZSM-5 catalyzed methanol to aromatic gasoline. In this short article we describe some advances in our understanding related to separations and purification via the use of more detailed experimental speciation in an updated process model involving multiple phase equilibrium-based separation steps. Primary modeled reactor outlet constituents (and weight %) are: C3 and lighter hydrocarbon gases (11.1%), C4s (54.5%), H<sub>2</sub> (1.2%), CO<sub>2</sub> (2.9%), water (5.0%), unreacted DME (16.5%), methanol (2.3%), and C5+ hydrocarbons (6.4%). DME (the primary reactant) and H<sub>2</sub> recycle and reuse are important for the overall process efficiency, and the recycle of C4s is important to increase the C5+ yield via reactivation and homologation. Thus H<sub>2</sub>, C4s, and DME are targeted for recycle, while methanol and water need to be removed from the product to conform with fuel specifications. Model predictions from Aspen Plus using the NRTL-RK property method indicate a fuel composition with C5+ content of 97.1 wt%, with minor constituents: 2.4 wt% C4s, 0.3 wt% methanol, 0.1 wt% DME, 0.03 wt% water, and 0.01 wt% C3s. These ranges of minor components conform with fuel quality requirements, and the modeled product is amenable for unconstrained blending to boost gasoline octane ratings.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While the vast majority of household vehicles are still powered by conventional internal combustion engines, the progress of adopting emerging vehicle technologies will critically depend on how soon the existing vehicles are transacted out of the household fleet. Leveraging a nationally representative longitudinal data set, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study examines how household decisions to dispose of or replace a given vehicle are: 1) influenced by the vehicle’s attributes, 2) mediated by households’ concurrent socio-demographic and economic attributes, and 3) triggered by key life cycle events. Coupled with a newly developed machine learning interpretation tool, TreeExplainer, we demonstrate an innovative use of machine learning models to augment traditional logit modeling to both generate behavioral insights and improve model performance. We find the two gradient-boosting-based methods, CatBoost and LightGBM, are the best performing machine learning models for this problem. The multinomial logistic model can achieve similar performance levels after its model specification is informed by TreeExplainer. Both machine learning and multinomial logit models suggest that while older vehicles are more likely to be disposed of or replaced than newer ones, such probability decreases as the vehicles serve the family longer. Pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles are less likely to be disposed of or replaced than cars, and leased vehicles are more likely to be transacted than owned vehicles. We find that married families, families with higher education levels, homeowners, and older families tend to keep their vehicles longer. Furthermore, life events such as childbirth, residential relocation, and change of household composition and income are found to increase vehicle disposal and/or replacement. We provide additional insights on the timing of vehicle replacement or disposal, in particular, the presence of children and childbirth events are more strongly associated with vehicle replacement among younger parents.","Frontiers Media SA","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With an increased level of connectivity and automation of intelligent transportation systems, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to be able to proactively adjust their driving strategies subject to constraints imposed by the predicted future traffic. As a result, many potential benefits can be achieved, such as improved energy efficiency, enhanced traffic safety, among many others. Notably, the way CAVs are controlled affects the following legacy vehicles (LVs) due to complex traffic dynamics. Here, we are particularly interested in studying the energy and mobility impact of CAVs with an improved traffic prediction method on mixed vehicle platoons at various market penetration rates. Leveraging traffic prediction, CAVs are controlled with co-optimization of their speed and gear position. Specifically, a traffic prediction framework in a rolling horizon fashion is employed based upon a modified Payne–Whitham (PW) model capable of handling mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and LVs. The prediction error of the modified PW model is reduced by 53.62% compared to that of the standard PW model under test scenarios. According to the predicted traffic conditions, speed and gear position of CAVs are co-optimized with the primary goal of minimizing energy consumption when driving on a signalized arterial. The energy benefits achieved by CAVs and the impact of CAVs on LVs behind are studied comprehensively for mixed vehicle platoons. The lead LV follows a real-world speed profile collected on TH-55 in Minnesota. Numerical results show that energy benefits achieved by the vehicle platoon range from 2% to 16%, and a 1% to 5% reduction in travel time for LVs behind CAVs is also observed, at different penetration rates of CAVs in various traffic scenarios.

"Preliminary conceptual design of fast neutron spectrum nuclear thermal rocket cores using monolithic uranium nitride fuel","Youinou, Gilles J.; Lin, Ching-Sheng","22 GENERAL STUDIES OF NUCLEAR REACTORS; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Nuclear Thermal Propulsion; Uranium Nitride; Fast Neutron Spectrum","This paper presents a few nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) reactor core preliminary conceptual designs based on the use of monolithic uranium nitride (UN) fuel plates or pins clad with tungsten (W), alloyed or unalloyed as needed. High-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) as well as high-enriched uranium (HEU) are considered. Nominal core thermal powers are between 300 and 1100 MW corresponding to thrusts between 66 kN and 240 kN. The estimated thrust-to-reactor-weight ratios (T/WRx) achievable with the HEU plate and pin configurations are between 3.8 and 10.9. The T/WRx achievable with the HALEU plate and pin configurations are lower, 1.9–4.0, than those achievable with HEU. It is noteworthy that even a relatively modest increase in fuel enrichment above the HALEU limit enables a significant increase in T/WRx. It must be emphasized that these results do not yet account for uncertainties and that the appropriateness of the assumed fuel thermal design limits for normal operation (i.e., peak centerline temperature of 3100 K) will need to be confirmed. Finally, just like for the other UN-based fuels currently considered for NTR applications (i.e., CERMET and CERCER), the proposed UN fuel systems need significant testing in prototypic conditions to confirm the appropriate performance for safe NTR applications. However, the monolithic fuel systems may have, overall, a higher technology readiness level (TRL), and, consequently, shorter fuel development and validation time may result.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

"Multistage Stabilized Continuation for Indirect Optimal Control of Three-Dimensional Hypersonic Trajectories","Vedantam, Mihir; Akella, Maruthi R.; Grant, Michael J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Optimal Control; Hypersonic Vehicles; Angle of Attack; Boundary Value Problems; Flight Path Angle; Drag Coefficient; Earth; Numerical Integration; Controllability Gramian; Particle Swarm Optimization","This work presents the development of a multistaged stabilized continuation for the three-dimensional unpowered hypersonic trajectory planning problem using indirect optimal control methods. The stabilized continuation method is noniterative and guaranteed to terminate within a finite number of floating point operations, thereby making it well suited for onboard autonomous implementations. Here, we present a multistage formulation of the stabilized continuation scheme that involves starting with a “loose” integration tolerance during the first stage and ramping up toward a “strict” integration tolerance through subsequent stages. An important benefit of this approach is that even when the solution to the underlying optimal control problem is numerically unstable, such as with the hypersonic vehicle footprint generation problem, the stabilized continuation algorithm is shown to be successful in finding a solution while providing some additional insights into the underlying cause of the numerical instability.","AIAA","","Sandia National Lab.

Building upon nuclear engine tests performed from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, the present research and testing focuses on advanced materials and fabrication methods. A number of transient tests have been performed to evaluate materials performance under high-temperature, high-flux conditions, with several more experiments in the pipeline for future testing. The measured data obtained from those tests are being used to validate the Griffin reactor multiphysics code for this particular type of application. Griffin was developed at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) using the MOOSE framework. This article describes the simulation results of the SIRIUS-CAL calibration experiment in the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT). SIRIUS-CAL was the first transient test conducted on NASA fuels, and although the test was performed with a relatively low core peak power, the test specimen survived a temperature exceeding 900 K. Griffin simulations of the experiment successfully matched the reactor’s power transient after calibrating the initial control rod position to match the initial reactor period. The thermal-hydraulics model largely matches the time-dependent response of a thermocouple located within the experiment specimen to within the uncertainty estimate. However, the uncertainty range is significant and must be reduced in the future.</p>","MDPI AG","","Idaho National Lab.

This will likely require a combination of potentially costly distribution infrastructure upgrades and synergistic grid-transportation solutions such as managed charging and strategic charger placement. Fully implementing such strategic planning and control methods - including business models and mechanisms to engage and compensate consumers - can minimize or even eliminate required grid upgrades. Moreover, there are also opportunities for EV charging to support the grid by helping solve existing and emerging distribution system challenges associated with increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar generation and battery energy storage.

The best-known issue in the fast charging of current LIBs (based on LiNi<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>1–x–y</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/graphite) is lithium plating, which is barely reversible and is accompanied by capacity loss over time. Therefore, understanding the reasons for the irreversibility of lithium plating driven by fast charging is critical to enhancing the fast-charging capability of LIBs. Here, a study of the irreversibility and heterogeneity of lithium plating is carried out by using electrochemical analyses, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Further, the study shows that the majority of the lithium plated during fast charging remains inactive even with very slow discharging rates, implying that most of the plated lithium is irreversibly lost. The study also reveals that chemical compounds such as LiF, Li<sub>2</sub>O and Li<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>) are formed heterogeneously within the lithium plating and are responsible for some of the irreversibility of the plated lithium.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

"Developing Novel Performance Measures for Traffic Congestion Management and Operational Planning Based on Connected Vehicle Data","Khadka, Swastik; Li, Pengfei “Taylor”; Wang, Qichao","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; arterial traffic signal performance; connected vehicle; freeway queue management; vehicle trajectories","In this study, the authors present their efforts in exploring a new type of traffic data, referred to as internet-connected vehicle (ICV) data, for traffic congestion management and operational planning. Most currently manufactured vehicles contain onboard GPS and cellular modules, and they constantly connect to automobile manufacturers' clouds via cellular networks and upload their status. Some automobile manufacturers have recently redistributed the nonpersonal part of such data, such as geolocation, to third-party organizations for innovative applications. Compared with the traditional vehicle GPS data, the ICV data contain high-resolution GPS waypoints accompanied with the vehicles' abnormal moving events (e.g., hard braking). The ICV data also have huge potential in congestion management and operational planning. They explore to identify and analyze traffic congestion on both freeways and arterials using the ICV data. The ICV data adopted for this research are redistributed by Wejo Data Service, representing 10%-15% of all moving vehicles in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area in Texas. Through one case study for a freeway segment and one for an arterial segment, new traffic performance metrics based on the characteristics of ICV data have been presented. The highlights of these efforts are as follows: (I) queue length and propagation at freeway bottlenecks can be directly measured based on where and when most internet-connected vehicles slow down and join the queue; (II) an internet-connected vehicle's actual delay time on arterials can be directly measured according to its slow movement percentage, without assuming the nondelay travel speed; and (III) the ICV data set are also combined with the high-resolution traffic signal events to generate a ground-truth time-space diagram (TSD) on arterials - a common visualization of arterial signal performance for transportation planning and operations.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Coupling a Lagrangian–Eulerian Spark-Ignition (LESI) model with LES combustion models for engine simulations","Kazmouz, Samuel J.; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Cheng, Zhen; Dai, Meizhong; Pomraning, Eric; Senecal, Peter K.; Sjöberg, Magnus","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; advanced ignition modeling; ignition-combustion coupling; internal combustion engines; spark ignition","In the United States transportation sector, Light-Duty Vehicles (LDVs) are the largest energy consumers and CO<sub>2</sub> emitters. Electrification of LDVs is posed as a potential solution, but SI engines can still contribute to decarbonization. Car manufacturers have turned to unconventional engine operation to increase the efficiency of Spark-Ignition (SI) engines and reduce the carbon emissions of their fleets. Dilute, lean, and stratified-charge engine operation has the potential for engine efficiency improvements at the expense of increased cyclic variability and combustion instability. At such demanding engine conditions, the spark ignition event is key for flame initiation and propagation and for enhanced combustion stability. Reliable and accurate spark ignition models can help design ignition systems that reduce cyclic variability. Multiple computational spark-ignition models exist that perform well under conventional conditions, but the underlying physics needs to be expanded, for unconventional engine operation. In this paper, a hybrid Lagrangian–Eulerian Spark-Ignition (LESI) model is coupled with different turbulent flame propagation models for engine simulations. LESI relies on Lagrangian arc tracking and Eulerian energy deposition. The LESI model is coupled with the Well-Stirred Reactor (WSR), Thickened Flame Model (TFM), and g-equation model and used to simulate several cycles of a Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition (DISI) engine using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) engine solver. The results showcase the successful coupling of LESI with the combustion models. Global engine metrics, such as pressure and Apparent Heat Release Rate (AHRR), for each simulation setup are compared to experimental engine results, for validation. In addition, results highlight the successful prediction of spark channel movement by comparing simulation images to experimental optical engine images. Finally, the successful coupling of LESI to combustion models, making it a usable model in the engine modeling community, is emphasized and future development details are discussed.","EDP Sciences","","Argonne National Lab.

To evaluate special operations including emerging technologies, a microscopic simulation that tracks detailed interactions of all the elements of the traffic systems is usually needed. This type of simulation is usually computationally demanding. This work developed an Airport Shuttle Planning and Improved Routing Event-driven Simulation (ASPIRES) package to simulate and evaluate current, potential, and future airport shuttle operations. Here, the simulation was driven by data and thus did not require much calibration effort. The discrete-event simulation nature of ASPIRES makes the simulation computationally efficient. Simulating 1 day of shuttle operations takes less than 2s. The study site of this work is the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in the U.S. The shuttle service that connects the five terminals of the airport and the rental car center was studied. Travel times, dwell times, and passenger arrivals were simulated using empirical distributions derived mainly from real data to capture the stochastic nature of the rental car center shuttle bus operations. Data on bus miles traveled, bus energy consumption, passenger wait times, and passengers left behind at stops were collected to study the trade-off between energy use and passenger experience. Electric bus and on-demand bus operations were also included. The simulation outputs can show passengers statistics at terminals, shuttles statistics, and charging station statistics. ASPIRES cannot be used to model a generic traffic system but is well-suited for fleet systems.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"A Framework to Analyze the Requirements of a Multiport Megawatt-Level Charging Station for Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicles","Mishra, Partha; Miller, Eric; Santhanagopalan, Shriram; Bennion, Kevin; Meintz, Andrew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; batteries; DC fast charging; heavy-duty electric vehicle; station design; station load; vehicle telemetry; charging infrastructure; charging load","Widespread adoption of heavy-duty (HD) electric vehicles (EVs) will soon necessitate the use of megawatt (MW)-scale charging stations to charge high-capacity HD EV battery packs. Such a station design needs to anticipate possible station traffic, average and peak power demand, and charging/wait time targets to improve throughput and maximize revenue-generating operations. High-power direct current charging is an attractive candidate for MW-scale charging stations at the time of this study, but there are no precedents for such a station design for HD vehicles. We present a modeling and data analysis framework to elucidate the dependencies of a MW-scale station operation on vehicle traffic data and station design parameters and how that impacts vehicle electrification. This framework integrates an agent-based charging station model with vehicle schedules obtained through real-world vehicle telemetry data analysis to explore the station design and operation space. A case study applies this framework to a Class 8 vehicle telemetry dataset and uses Monte Carlo simulations to explore various design considerations for MW-scale charging stations and EV battery technologies. The results show a direct correlation between optimal charging station placement and major traffic corridors such as cities with ports, e.g., Los Angeles and Oakland.

Di-isobutylene is also popularly used as an alkene representative in multi-component surrogate models for engine studies of gasoline fuels. However, there is limited experimental data available in the literature for neat di-isobutylene under engine-like conditions. Hence, most existing di-isobutylene models have not been extensively validated, particularly at lower temperatures (< 1000 K). Most gasoline surrogate models include the di-isobutylene sub-mechanism published by Metcalfe et al. [1] with little or no modification. The current study is undertaken to develop a detailed kinetic model for di-isobutylene and validate the model using a wide range of relevant experimental data. Part 1 of this study exclusively focuses on the low- to intermediate temperature kinetics of di-isobutylene. An upcoming part 2 discusses the high-temperature model development and validation of the relevant experimental targets. Ignition delay time measurements for the di-isobutylene isomers were performed at pressures ranging from 15 - 30 bar at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 diluted in air and in the temperature range 650 - 900 K using two independent rapid compression machine facilities. In addition, measurements of species identified during the oxidation of these isomers were performed in a jet-stirred reactor and in a rapid compression machine. A detailed kinetic model for the di-isobutylene isomers is developed to capture the wide range of new experimental targets. For the first time, a comprehensive low-temperature chemistry submodel is included. The differences in the important reaction pathways for the accurate prediction of the oxidation of the two DIB isomers are compared using reaction path analysis. The most sensitive reactions controlling the ignition delay times of the DIB isomers under the pressure and temperature conditions necessary for autoignition in engines are identified.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, conventional polycrystalline high-Ni cathodes severely suffer from intrinsic chemo-mechanical degradation and fast capacity fade. The emerging single-crystallization strategy offers a promising pathway to improve the chemo-mechanical stability, however, the single-crystallinity of the cathode is not always guaranteed and residual grain boundaries (GBs) could persist in nonideal synthesis conditions, leading to the formation of ‘quasi’ single-crystalline (QSC) cathodes. So far, there is a lack of understanding of the influence of these residual GBs on the electrochemical performance and structural stability. Herein, we investigate the degradation pathway of a QSC high-Ni cathode through transmission electron microscopy and X-ray techniques. The residual GBs caused by insufficient calcination time, dramatically exacerbate the cathode’s chemo-mechanical instability and cycling performance. Our work offers important guidance for the next-generation cathodes for long-life LIBs.","American Chemical Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The overarching aim of this manuscript is to elucidate the hard-magnetic properties through a better understanding of phase formation by the structural, microstructural, and magnetic properties in these materials. Improved mutual solubility of Fe in the 1:5 phase has been observed with an extended homogeneity range by Cu substitution. For both composition series, Fe contents of x ≤ 0.6 show a homogeneous microstructure with a single 1:5 phase and good magnetic properties. The composition region 0.6 < x ≤ 0.9 appears to be near the boundary of solubility and evolution of other phases. At x = 1.8, it is found that the homogeneous 1:5 phase and magnetic hardness deteriorated due to the evolution of secondary phases such as 2:17, 2:7, and Fe–Co. Furthermore, the addition of Fe improved both the magnetization and Curie temperature via increased effective exchange interactions, while an increase in Cu content enhanced coercivity.","Elsevier","","Ames Lab., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Energy Efficiency Office.

However, their low energy density and high water-solubility present barriers to their adoption. Both concerns were recently addressed by our research group by synthesizing a mixture of POME structures having butyl end-groups and n = 1-6, termed B*POME1-6. B*POME1-6 maintained the advantageous properties of the parent MM-POMEs, and exhibited improved energy density and most notably, dramatically decreased water solubility. For evaluation against a set of criteria for a blended diesel blendstock, a 20 vol% blend of B*POME1-6 with a base diesel fuel was investigated here. Oxidation stability, cetane number, sooting tendency, lubricity and conductivity were improved in the B*POME1-6 blend compared with the base diesel, while also maintaining the flash point, cloud point, energy density, viscosity, and boiling point requirements. The B*POME1-6 product demonstrated a synergistic blending behavior at 10 vol% and a linear blending behavior at 20-30 vol% blends, in agreement with similar POME blends at comparable blend levels. Finally, common environmental and toxicity models performed on B*POME1-6 component molecules suggested they have a greater propensity to partition into the water compartment compared to a common diesel surrogate, but with a lower tendency to bioaccumulate.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Ideally, CAV applications would be fully evaluated and validated prior to real-world implementation. However, many technical challenges in both software and hardware hinder the process. To comprehensively evaluate all aspects of CAV applications, an integrated evaluation environment is needed with various simulation tools from different domains. In the current literature, there lacks a well-developed interface to enable multi-resolution simulation of vehicle, traffic, virtual environment, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. In this work, a modular and flexible interface is developed to enable multi-resolution vehicle and traffic co-simulation for CAV applications. This interface is built upon Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL’s) Real-Sim approach, can support various simulation tools and real-time X-in-the-loop (XIL) simulations, and is based on network communication protocols. The network communication delays are analyzed for simultaneous connection of up to 20 simulators. Then, two example applications are studied to demonstrate the potential usage of the Real-Sim interface: (1) a centralized merging scenario where the dynamics of two ego vehicles are emulated with detailed vehicle and powertrain dynamics models and (2) a signal-controller-in-the-loop (SCIL) evaluation where one intersection of the simulated traffic scenario is controlled by a physical signal controller. This Real-Sim interface is a tool that allows researchers to bring real, tangible hardware and software into simulated environments to comprehensively evaluate and support a wide variety of CAV applications.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Optimal strategies to accelerate EV adoption must weigh the relative value of alternative policy mechanisms to consumers, including public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies. We use a historically validated light-duty vehicle consumer choice tool, the ADOPT model, to simulate personal light-duty vehicle adoption and related emissions in California. ADOPT is updated to incorporate a quantification of the tangible value of public charging infrastructure, allowing us to simulate the impact of investments in public charging infrastructure and vehicle purchase subsidies under different scenarios. We show that both policies result in increased EV adoption, with the most effective policy varying depending on vehicle technology assumptions. Under conservative technology improvement assumptions, infrastructure investments are most effective in promoting EV sales and reducing CO2 emissions, while under optimistic technology improvement assumptions a combination of infrastructure and subsidies best supports EV sales and CO2 emission reductions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

There is also a significant reduction in NOx emissions due to the reduced peak cylinder temperatures. Furthermore, the ability of conventional spark ignition systems to reliably ignite dilute mixtures limits the dilution tolerance due to the onset of combustion instability. In this study, an active pre-chamber system was evaluated at part load condition with various EGR rates using a regular grade full boiling range gasoline. A premixed air-fuel mixture was supplied to the pre-chamber, which assists in scavenging the residual mass fractions to enable reliable ignition of EGR dilute mixtures in the main combustion chamber. A range of pre-chamber injection, air-fuel mixture formulation, and ignition timing strategies were evaluated during the EGR sweeps. In addition, 0-D and 1-D simulations were conducted in GT-Power to assess the thermodynamic state and composition in the pre-chamber, as well as estimate the jet momentum at the various dilution rates. The active pre-chamber extended the EGR dilution limit from 20% for conventional SI to above 30%, with a higher pre-chamber flow rate (more scavenging) resulting in increased combustion stability. A tradeoff between the jet momentum and spark timing was observed when analyzing the GT-Power simulations and the pre-chamber jet momentum was found to decrease with increasing EGR rate. At unstable high EGR operation, no relation could be found between the pre-chamber indicated data and main chamber combustion stability.","SAGE Publications","","Argonne National Lab.

We model the effect of load modulation control on aggregate charging profiles with a novel machine learning approach that replaces traditional optimization approaches. We demonstrate its performance modeling workplace charging control with multiple electricity rate schedules, achieving small errors (2.5% to 4.5%), while accelerating computations by more than 4000 times. We illustrate the methodology by generating scenarios for California's 2030 charging demand including multiple charging segments and controls, with scenarios run locally in under 50 seconds, and for assisting rate design modeling the large-scale impact of a new workplace charging rate.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); California Energy Commission; National Science Foundation (NSF); USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES).

"Enabling cooperative adaptive cruise control on strings of vehicles with heterogeneous dynamics and powertrains","Flores, Carlos; Spring, John; Nelson, David; Iliev, Simeon; Lu, Xiao-Yun","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Adaptive; CACC; Control; Cooperative; Cruise; Dynamics; String; Vehicle","Recent studies have shown that positive impact of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) can only be guaranteed as market penetration rate increases. Removing the string homogeneity constraint is essential to encourage widespread adoption. In this work, a hierarchical architecture is proposed to enable CACC on vehicles with not only mixed dynamics but also different powertrain types. A low-level layer deals with the vehicle and powertrain dynamics to provide accurate and consistent reference speed tracking response. The high-level layer uses: (1) a Linear Parameter Varying feedback system to provide loop stability, robustness and enforce a variable time gap policy and (2) a feedforward system that processes Vehicle-to-Vehicle information to enhance string stability and response bandwidth, by dealing with the string heterogeneity. A gap management strategy is built on top of the CACC architecture to handle gap setting changes or cut-in/out situations, via a dynamics constrained time gap trajectory planning algorithm. We report the proposed work has been designed, developed and validated on three different real passenger vehicles on public highways and test tracks, showing the potential of the proposed algorithm to enable robust string stable CACC, despite the different dynamics and powertrains considered.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The effects of primary and secondary particle morphologies on various transition metal oxides have been studied, but new findings are still being reported. To date, few studies have focused on the effects of particle morphologies on Li- and Mn-rich oxides (>50% Mn) and even fewer studies have focused on the influence over key properties such as electrode-level impedance. In this study, we report the effects of particle morphologies on the area-specific-impedance (ASI) and thermal behavior of Li- and Mn-rich oxides. Samples with a fixed, layered–layered–spinel (LLS), composition were synthesized with differing primary morphologies and tested under standardized, full-cell protocols. The results suggest that smaller primary particle size (i.e., higher surface area) leads to lower overall ASI, a delay in the increasing impedance at low states-of-charge (SOCs), and surprisingly, improved thermal behavior.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As adoption of electric vehicles increases, fast charging has become a key driver in enhancing consumer recharge experience. Recently, the research community has made significant improvements in developing charge protocols to support XFC. New charge protocol designs derived using a combination of advanced, physically derived models, and electrochemical and secondary characterization methods, increase charge acceptance and decrease aging. By coordinating these methods and modifying protocols to account for different material constraints, including lithium plating and cathode particle degradation, novel charge protocols have increased the energy accepted during charging by over 25% in 10 min and increased the charge acceptance prior to a constant-voltage step by approximately 3x. Here, we review several charge-protocol advances, aging factors which are enhanced by XFC and advances which will enable adoption of XFC capable vehicles. These advances include implementing machine learning and other detection algorithms to reduce and classify lithium plating, which is known to significantly degrade cell performance and reduce cell life. The review concludes by discussing full-system fast charge requirements, including electric vehicle service equipment needs for implementing XFC protocols.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Characterizing the Payback and Profitability for Automated Heavy Duty Vehicle Platooning","Sujan, Vivek; Jones, Perry T.; Siekmann, Adam","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; platooning; traffic; payback; profitability; revenue; automation","Heavy duty vehicle platooning under highway operating conditions has been projected to provide significant fuel economy gains based on aerodynamic drag improvements of the platooning vehicles. Realizing these benefits and the economic viability under real-world operating conditions presents several challenges. The objective of this paper (the third as part of a series) is to analytically quantify the payback and profitability of heavy-duty vehicles platooning across the U.S. Interstate highway system. In this paper, a rigorous assessment of several factors that influence the platooning system payback for an end-user as well as the revenue potential for suppliers who may be utilizing an equipment lease model dependent on end-user savings, is presented. In this assessment key interactions explored include market adoption rates, platooning velocities, platoon-able daily mileage, platooning likelihood, variations in baseline powertrain fuel economy (diesel or electric), price of fuel (diesel or electricity), platooning fuel economy benefits, price of the added technology, and the impact of natural platooning due to traffic interactions. Further, the paper explores the economic impact of higher levels of vehicle automation for the trailing vehicles in the platoon, where extending the driver Hours of Service (HoS) may provide additional financial benefits. While the approach makes use of a limited fidelity vehicle analytical model for longitudinal dynamics and operations economics, the narrative provides application decision personnel with a mechanism and well-defined set of impact factors to consider as part of their architectural selection process.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we conduct a technoeconomic evaluation for three hallmark off-road vehicles, tractors, wheel loaders, and excavators, comparing vehicles with hydrogen fuel cell + battery hybrid powertrains to traditional diesel powertrains. Stakeholder-valued performance metrics include fuel cell engine power, engine durability, hydrogen consumption rate, hydrogen storage system volume, and energy-regenerative drivetrain efficiency. The total cost of ownership includes capital, operating and maintenance, fuel, and fuel storage costs. State-of-the-art fuel cell powered wheel loaders and excavators are currently cost competitive with diesel platforms.

"Light-Duty Vehicle Trip Classification Using One-Class Novelty Detection and Exhaustive Feature Extraction","Zhu, Lei; Borlaug, Brennan; Lin, Lei; Holden, Jacob; Gonder, Jeffrey","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Global Positioning System; GPS; novelty detection; one-class support vector machines; travel mode detection; feature extraction; data models; anomaly detection; training","Travel mode classification within travel survey data sets, especially light-duty vehicle (LDV) trips, is foundational, though nontrivial, to emerging mobility systems, travel behavior analysis, and fuel consumption estimation. Current travel mode detection approaches require well-sampled and balanced data sets with ground truth travel mode labels. The detection approaches are rarely applied and validated on large-scale, real-world data sets, which may not satisfy the dataset requirements. This work proposes an LDV trip detection model as a supplement to current travel mode detection methods, for the case when the training set is highly (and/or completely) unbalanced, to the extent that classical machine-learning approaches become difficult or impossible to deploy. The proposed model uses a novelty detection technique - one-class support vector machines (OCSVMs) - and a novel exhaustive feature extraction (EFE) technique on continuous time series data (i.e., Global Positioning System [GPS] speed profiles) for single-mode trip trajectories. Training and validation of the model are conducted on a large-scale, real-world data set. The proposed method accurately identifies LDV trips from a broad set of multimodal trips by leveraging a wealth of preexisting in-vehicle GPS travel data. Additional sensitivity analysis sheds light on the optimal training size and feature selection, which will benefit applications limited by highly imbalanced data. The paper also discusses performance comparison with regular machine-learning approaches, the model's robustness, and the potential to extend the proposed model to multi-modal trip prediction.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Estimating Fast Charging Infrastructure Requirements to Fully Electrify Ride-Hailing Fleets Across the United States","Moniot, Matthew; Ge, Yanbo; Wood, Eric","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; charging; DCFC; electric vehicle; electrification; infrastructure; ride-hailing","Ride-hailing electrification is made challenging by a variety of factors, including limited driver access to overnight charging and a nascent network of public direct-current fast charging (DCFC). This article projects the DCFC infrastructure needed to electrify ride-hailing across 384 cities in the United States. Research leveraging a novel infrastructure projection tool, Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Tool for On-Demand Mobility Services model (EVI-OnDemand), estimates that 25,400 DCFC ports capable of charging vehicles at a mean power of 150 kW are required to electrify 1.45 million ride-hailing vehicles in the baseline scenario. Results show that ride-hailing vehicles require 17.5 DCFC ports per 1000 vehicles, three times that of personal electric vehicles (EVs). Infrastructure demand is also shown to vary across cities; 63% more DCFC ports are needed to support 1000 battery EVs in Chicago versus Miami. The analysis also includes sensitivity studies that explore variation in charging demand across input assumptions, finding that charging power, vehicle class, overnight charging access rates, and port utilization influence the network size needed. Projections vary from 18,600 to 41,300 DCFC ports across sensitivity scenarios, indicating that ride-hailing electrification will require significant expansion of access to fast charging even in the most optimistic scenarios, and investments into supporting assets can reduce the scale of the public charging expansion needed.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Using fractional thermal runaway calorimetry and high-speed radiography, the response of three different geometries of cylindrical cell (18650, 21700, and D-cell) to different abuse mechanisms (thermal, internal short circuiting, and nail penetration) are quantified and statistically examined. Correlations between the geometry of cells and their thermal behavior are identified, such as increasing heat output per amp-hour (kJ Ah-1) of cells with increasing cell diameter during nail penetration. High-speed radiography reveals that the rate of thermal runaway propagation within cells is generally highest for nail penetration where there is a relative increase in rate of propagation with increasing diameter, compared to thermal or internal short-circuiting abuse. For a given cell model tested under the same conditions, a distribution of heat output is observed with a trend of increasing heat output with increased mass ejection. Finally, internal temperature measurements using thermocouples embedded in the penetrating nail are shown to be unreliable thus demonstrating the need for care when using thermocouples where the temperature is rapidly changing.

Upon reaching each target, the UAV collects information and if the operator of the UAV deems that the information collected is not of sufficient fidelity, then the UAV has to visit all the supplemental targets corresponding to that target to collect additional information before proceeding to visit the next target.

"Next-Cycle Optimal Dilute Combustion Control via Online Learning of Cycle-to-Cycle Variability Using Kernel Density Estimators","Maldonado Puente, Bryan; Kaul, Brian; Schuman, Catherine; Young, Steven; Mitchell, Parker","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Internal combustion engines; Stochastic systems; Statistical learning; Optimal control; Kernel density estimation","Dilute combustion using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) presents a cost-effective method for increasing the efficiency of spark-ignition (SI) engines. However, the maximum amount of EGR that can be used at a given condition is limited by a rapid increment of cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV). This study describes a methodology to design a model-based stochastic optimal controller to adjust the cycle-to-cycle fuel injection quantity in order to reduce CCV and further extend the dilute limit. Given the complexity and chaotic nature of combustion events, the controller was enhanced with online learning in order to identify the statistical properties of combustion efficiency, which are needed to generate predictions for next-cycle events. This study showed that a kernel density estimator (KDE) can be used to learn the combustion properties in real time and can be incorporated into the feedback policy in order to calculate the optimal control command. Experimental results suggested that the dilute limit can be extended from 18.5% to 21% EGR fraction at an operating condition relevant for highway cruising. Additionally, the proposed controller can achieve a large CCV reduction with less fuel enrichment compared to previous methods, overall contributing to an increase in 0.2% indicated fuel conversion efficiency.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The basic prerequisite for developing such a system is to propose a reliable crash risk evaluation model that takes real-time traffic flow data as input. Previous studies have primarily focused on real-time crash prediction using some statistical or machine-learning methods. However, further quantitative evaluation and classification of crash risks have been ignored. In this study, we conduct a systematic crash risk evaluation workflow, including crash risk prediction, crash risk quantification, and crash risk classification. Specifically, the crash risk prediction using an extended logit model is proposed, from which CAS, CSD, UAS, DAS, DTV are identified to be contributing factors of crash risks. Then a crash risk quantification model based on the parameter evaluation of the extended logit model is developed. The crash risks of urban expressways and their spatial-temporal evolution trends are quantified. Finally, the crash risks are classified into high crash risk level, moderate crash risk level, and low crash risk level by the k-means cluster algorithm. Then the threshold boundaries of different crash risk levels are determined. The research results provide a proactive guidance for traffic safety management of urban expressways.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Scalable probabilistic estimates of electric vehicle charging given observed driver behavior","Powell, Siobhan; Cezar, Gustavo Vianna; Rajagopal, Ram","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Electric vehicle; Charging behavior; Graphical model; Clustering; Long-term planning; Large-scale","To prepare for rapid growth in global electric vehicle adoption, grid and policy planners depend on detailed forecasts of future charging demand. In this paper we propose a novel holistic, scalable, probabilistic framework to produce large-scale estimates of electric vehicle charging load for long-term planning that capture real drivers’ charging patterns. Our framework captures the uncertainty and stochasticity in charging demand by taking a graphical modeling approach. It has three core elements: driver groups, charging segment choices, and charging session time and energy requirements. The framework uses hierarchical clustering to group drivers by their charging histories, capturing their heterogeneous behaviors and preferences across different segments or types of charging. The framework uses probabilistic mixture models for each driver group’s sessions to identify the unique charging behaviors observed within each segment. We illustrate its application with a large data set from California, profiling the charging patterns and unique driver clusters it identifies. Using the model knobs representing drivers’ battery capacities, behavior, and segment access we present scenarios for California’s charging demand in 2030 with 8 million passenger electric vehicles. Peak charging demand ranged from 3.3 to 8.7 GW across scenarios. Furthermore, each was calculated in under 45 s on a laptop computer.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF); California Energy Commission","","United States","2022-01-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 309","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 118382","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; EPC-16-057; 1554178; TRN: US2306129","10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118382","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1867005","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1867005","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1867005","Applied Energy","","309"

Scenario and sensitivity analysis were explored the life-cycle effects of these electrification options in China from 2020 to 2040. It is found that green electricity and green hydrogen are the most important factors influencing the life-cycle emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>X</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>for different HDTs’ electrification options. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle of HDTs has shown good performance in terms of total cost and carbon emissions, mainly due to the reduced battery capacity and the current grid mix in China.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Method of Optimal Control for Class 8 Vehicle Platoons Over Hilly Terrain","Ward, Jacob; Stegner, Evan; Hoffman, Mark; Bevly, David M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Platooning; Class 8; Trucks; Fuel-optimal; NMPC; Optimal control; Vehicles; Fuels; Fuel consumption; Architecture; Control systems; Energy efficiency; Predictive control; Trajectories (Physics)","This work develops and implements an NMPC control system to facilitate fuel-optimal platooning of Class 8 vehicles over challenging terrain. Prior research has shown that Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), which allows multiple Class 8 vehicles to follow in close succession, can save between 3 and 8% in overall fuel consumption on flat terrain. However, on more challenging terrain, e.g. rolling hills, platooning vehicles can experience diminished fuel savings, and, in some cases, an increase in fuel consumption relative to individual vehicle operation. This research explores the use of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) with predefined route grade profiles to allow platooning vehicles to generate an optimal velocity trajectory with respect to fuel consumption. In order to successfully implement the NMPC system, a model relating vehicle velocity to fuel consumption was generated and validated using experimental data. Additionally, the predefined route grade profiles were created by using the vehicle's GPS velocity over the desired terrain. The real-time NMPC system was then implemented on a two-truck platoon operating over challenging terrain, with a reference vehicle running individually. The results from NMPC platooning are compared against fuel results from a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) headway control method. Furthermore, this comparison yields the comparative fuel savings and energy efficiency benefit of NMPC system. In the final analysis, significant fuel savings of greater than 14 and 20% were seen for the lead and following vehicles relative to their respective traditional cruise control and platooning architectures.","ASME","","American Center for Mobility, Ypsilanti, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2022-01-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 011108","","","EE0008470","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-0434","10.1115/1.4053087","","2023-01-05T00:00:00Z","1833566","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1833566","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1833566","Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control","1","144"

Using attitudinal indicators, this paper identifies prevalent types of attitudes towards AV. It then explores the variation of those attitudes across different demographic groups and quantifies the influence of these attitudes on the preference for AV. The paper uses stated preference survey data collected among respondents of Chicago in 2019. The exploratory factor analysis of the attitudinal indicators identifies four factors, namely 'Cautious Travelers', 'Hedonists', 'Utilitarians', and 'Safety-First'. Next, the paper develops an integrated choice and latent variable model to test the influence of these four types of attitudes on the preference for AV. Finally, the results indicate that the cautious travelers associate higher Value of Travel Time (VOTT) to AV and enthusiasts associate lower VOTT to AV than a base model without such attitudes.","Taylor & Francis","","Argonne National Lab.

"Data mining of plug-in electric vehicles charging behavior using supply-side data","Siddique, Choudhury; Afifah, Fatima; Guo, Zhaomiao; Zhou, Yan","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Charging behaviors; Electric vehicle; Regression analysis; Supply-side data","This paper aims to better understand the charging patterns of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and identify factors that may significantly impact PEVs’ charging behavior. We collected 189,864 supply-side charging session data over 13 months from 821 charging stations in Illinois from ChargePoint. Through descriptive and regression analyses, we characterize the distributions of key charging behavior indicators, including charging location, dwell time, and battery start state of charge (SOC), and quantify the impacts of closely related factors on these charging behaviors. In this work, we find that: (1) PEVs are more likely to charge in the morning at multifamily commercial locations with a lower start SOC compared with single family residential locations; (2) Weekday and morning sessions are more likely to utilize workplace charging and have shorter dwell time compared with weekend and afternoon sessions; (3) Single family residential area and locations with Levels 1/2 chargers have a higher start SOC and longer dwell time compared with other locations and DC fast chargers (DCFCs). These findings provide policy insights to identify potential time and locations to incentivize PEVs for grid services, as well as identify critical location categories for further charging infrastructure investment to better reduce range anxiety and promote PEV adoption.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, long-term transit bus monitoring data were utilized to empirically compare fuel consumption of diesel and hybrid buses under various driving conditions. Artificial neural network (ANN) based high-fidelity microscopic (1 Hz) and mesoscopic (5–60 min) fuel consumption models were developed for hybrid buses. The microscopic model contained 1 Hz driving, grade, and environment variables. The mesoscopic model aggregated 1 Hz data into 5 to 60-minute traffic pattern factors and predicted average fuel consumption over its duration. The prediction results show mean absolute percentage errors of 1–2% for microscopic models and 5–8% for mesoscopic models. The data were partitioned by different driving speeds, vehicle engine demand, and road grade to investigate their impacts on prediction performance.","Elsevier","","Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority, Chattanooga, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

While many studies have examined the impact of the sharing economy (namely ridesourcing) on vehicle ownership of ridesourcing customers, there is a gap in understanding its impact on vehicle ownership among ridesourcing suppliers. Data from an original survey are used to develop discrete choice models that evaluate the effects of earning potential, automation, and shared autonomous vehicle services on vehicle transaction decisions. The estimated models are applied to perform national-level simulations. It is found that, in comparison to a non-sharing economy context, individuals in the sharing economy tend to purchase more vehicles in times of income gain, and to preserve their fleets more readily in times of income loss. This study provides evidence that the sharing economy incentivizes some individuals to own more - not fewer - vehicles.","Informa UK Limited","","Argonne National Lab.

The control strategy is based on a supervisory control algorithm that alternately employs charge-dominant control and discharge-dominant control to manage multiple powertrain sources, and enable an optimal overall efficiency-based powertrain operation state by maximizing the inherent optimal powertrain efficiency through best all transmission gear choice and the blend of motor and/or engine power. In the model, a component energy efficiency database was developed to rapidly enable an smart and optimal operating state determined from a set of efficiency maps characterizing the component and powertrain control states as a function of the instantaneous vehicle operational condition. The results revealed that the energy savings achieved with the innovative powertrain control improved by 10%–30% compared with the baseline hybrid powertrain control strategy. The benefits of eco-driving with respect to energy consumption were also evaluated using the powertrain model. The powertrain control model was implemented into a real hybrid bus. Measured energy savings with the optimized control strategy were similar to the simulated results.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To help plan for a future of integrated mobility, this paper investigates the impacts of SAVs serving FMLM connections, as a mode that provides flexibility in access/egress decisions and is well coordinated with train station schedules. To achieve this objective, a novel dynamic pooling algorithm was introduced to match SAVs with riders while coordinating the riders' arrival times at the light-rail station to a known train schedule. Microsimulations of SAVs and travelers throughout two central Austin neighborhoods show how larger service areas, higher levels of SAV demand, and longer arrival times between successive trains require larger SAV fleet sizes and higher SAV utilization rates to deliver close traveler wait times. Four-person SAVs appear to perform similar to 6-seat SAVs but will cost less to provide. Using a dynamic pooling algorithm tightly coordinated with train arrivals (every 15 min) delivers 87% of travelers to their stations in time to catch the next train, whereas uncoordinated assignments deliver just 58% of travelers in time.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The experimental setup from the literature consists of sensors placed in front of obstacles, including a thermal camera; red, green, blue (RGB) camera; 360° camera; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); and radar. These sensors were used either in combination or single-handedly on agricultural vehicles to detect objects hidden inside the agricultural field. The thermal camera successfully detected hidden objects, such as barrels, human mannequins, and humans, as did LiDAR in one experiment. The RGB camera and stereo camera were less efficient at detecting hidden objects compared with protruding objects. Radar detects hidden objects easily but lacks resolution. Hyperspectral sensing systems can identify and classify objects, but they consume a lot of storage. To obtain clearer and more robust data of hidden objects in vegetation and extreme weather conditions, further experiments should be performed for various climatic conditions combining active and passive sensors.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, research has found that while today’s BEVs typically reduce GHGs, they can increase certain CAPs, though with significant regional variability based on the electric grid mix. In addition, the environmental performance of electric and gasoline vehicles is not static, as key factors driving emissions have undergone significant changes recently and are expected to continue to evolve. In this study, we perform a cradle-to-grave life cycle analysis using state-level generation mix and vehicle operation emission data. We generated state-level emission factors using a projection from 2020 to 2050 for three light-duty vehicle types. We found that BEVs currently provide GHG benefits in nearly every state, with the median state’s benefit being between approximately 50% to 60% lower than gasoline counterparts. However, gasoline vehicles currently have lower total NOx, urban NOx, total PM<sub>2.5</sub>, and urban PM<sub>2.5</sub> in 33%; 15%; 70%; and 10% of states, respectively. BEV emissions will decrease in 2050 due to a cleaner grid, but the relative benefits when compared to gasoline vehicles do not change significantly, as gasoline vehicles are also improving over this time.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

Adaptive traffic signal control studies can be categorized into modeling-based approaches and learning-based approaches. In order to take advantages of these two systems, this study developed an offline-online combined Partial Observable Imitation Network for Traffic signal control (POINT). In the offline system, the traffic signal timing optimization problem was formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) given complete traffic information, i.e., second-by-second speeds and locations of all vehicles. Furthermore, the objective of MINLP is to minimize total travel delays considering individual vehicle trajectories under Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. The calculated optimal solutions under various traffic conditions were considered as the ”expert” decisions. In the online system, an imitation neural network model was developed to learn the ”expert” signal plans generated from offline system. Given partial observable traffic conditions in real time, e.g., the aggregate-level of traffic volume, the POINT model can compute the signal timing parameters in the online system. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art signal control method under high and unbalanced traffic demand levels in terms of reducing travel delays and queue length.","Elseiver","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The large data set reveals temperature-, charge C-rate-, depth-of-discharge-, and state of charge (SOC)-dependent degradation patterns that would be unobserved in a smaller test matrix. Model structure is informed by incremental capacity analysis that shows loss of lithium inventory and cathode-material loss as the dominant capacity fade mechanisms. The model includes terms attributable to solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) growth, electrode cracking, cycling-driven acceleration of SEI growth, and ""break-in"" mechanisms that slightly decrease or increase available Li inventory early in life. The study explores what mathematical couplings of these mechanisms best describe calendar aging, cycle aging, and mixed calendar/cycle aging. Various approaches are discussed for extracting relevant stress factors from complex cycling profiles to predict lifetime during real-world battery loads using models trained on constant-current laboratory test results. The complexity of the present human-driven model identification process motivates future work in machine learning to more widely search and statistically discern the optimal model that correctly extrapolates capacity fade based on physical knowledge.","IOP Publishing - The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dynamic Ride-Matching for Large-Scale Transportation Systems","Cokyasar, Taner; de Souza, Felipe; Auld, Joshua; Verbas, Omer","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Agent-based Simulation; Large-scale Transportation Systems; Optimization; Ride-matching","Efficient dynamic ride-matching (DRM) in large-scale transportation systems is a key driver in transport simulations to yield answers to challenging problems. Although the DRM problem is simple to solve, it quickly becomes a computationally challenging problem in large-scale transportation system simulations. Therefore, this study thoroughly examines the DRM problem dynamics and proposes an optimization-based solution framework to solve the problem efficiently. To benefit from parallel computing and reduce computational times, the problem’s network is divided into clusters utilizing a commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm along with a linear programming model. Then, these sub-problems are solved using another linear program to finalize the ride-matching. At the clustering level, the framework allows users adjusting cluster sizes to balance the trade-off between the computational time savings and the solution quality deviation. A case study in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, U.S., illustrates that the framework can reduce the average computational time by 58% at the cost of increasing the average pick up time by 26% compared with a system optimum, that is, non-clustered, approach. Further, another case study in a relatively small city, Bloomington, Illinois, U.S., shows that the framework provides quite similar results to the system-optimum approach in approximately 62% less computational time.","SAGE Publications","","Argonne National Lab.

"A Modular and Transferable Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Fleet Rebalancing Problem","Skordilis, Erotokritos; Hou, Yi; Tripp, Charles; Moniot, Matthew; Graf, Peter; Biagioni, David","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; fleet management; intelligent control; mobility on demand; optimal rebalancing; reinforcement learning","Mobility on demand (MoD) systems show great promise in realizing flexible and efficient urban transportation. However, significant technical challenges arise from operational decision making associated with MoD vehicle dispatch and fleet rebalancing. For this reason, operators tend to employ simplified algorithms that have been demonstrated to work well in a particular setting. To help bridge the gap between novel and existing methods, we propose a modular framework for fleet rebalancing based on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) that can leverage an existing dispatch method to minimize system cost. In particular, by treating dispatch as part of the environment dynamics, a centralized agent can learn to intermittently direct the dispatcher to reposition free vehicles and mitigate against fleet imbalance. We formulate RL state and action spaces as distributions over a grid partitioning of the operating area, making the framework scalable and avoiding the complexities associated with multiagent RL. Numerical experiments, using real-world trip and network data, demonstrate that RL reduces waiting time by 28% to 38% for the same-day evaluation, 17% to 44% for cross-day evaluation, and 22% to 25% for cross-season evaluation compared with no rebalancing scenarios. This approach has several distinct advantages over baseline methods including: improved system cost; high degree of adaptability to the selected dispatch method; and the ability to perform scale-invariant transfer learning between problem instances with similar vehicle and request distributions.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here in this paper, we report bimetallic catalysts that balance the net hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activity during DME homologation. The Cu-Zn/BEA catalyst exhibited greater relative dehydrogenation activity attributed to higher ionic site density, resulting in a lower P/O ratio (6.6) versus the benchmark Cu/BEA (9.4). The Cu-Ni/BEA catalyst exhibited increased hydrogenation due to reduced Ni species, resulting in a higher P/O ratio (19). The product fuel properties were estimated with an efficiency merit function and compared against finished gasolines and a typical alkylate blendstock.

"Spatial and unobserved heterogeneity in consumer preferences for adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles: A Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach","Khattak, Zulqarnain H.; Khattak, Asad J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Alternative fuel vehicles; electric; hybrids; consumer adoption; Preference heterogeneity; Bayesian hierarchical models; Bayesian logit models","The transition to low carbon vehicles known as alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) is well underway. This transition has been motivated partly by consumer demand and partly by legislation such as the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which requires manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of their vehicles as AFVs. While the long-term adoption of AFVs (specifically, electric and hybrids) may take several years, there is a need to understand consumer preferences for AFV adoption and the pathways of AFV adoption from a national perspective. Therefore, this study sought to provide information about consumer preferences regarding AFV ownership while considering spatial and unobserved heterogeneity in consumer preferences, which can potentially impact societal transition to low carbon fueled vehicles. The 2017 National Household Travel Survey was used to calibrate Bayesian logit and hierarchical models. Here, the findings of these models reveal that higher gasoline prices contribute toward the adoption of battery electric vehicles. The results also reveal that the perceived disadvantages of AFVs for long commutes are the key barrier in wider adoption of AFVs. Interestingly, frequent use of the internet by consumers revealed a higher likelihood for purchase of hybrid vehicles. Furthermore, West Coast residents are observed to be a large portion of the early adopters and are more likely to purchase hybrids as compared to battery electric vehicles. The knowledge generated by this study has implications for making better informed decisions about AFV adoption and developing incentives to promote wider adoption of AFVs by overcoming their perceived disadvantages.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Calibrating Microscopic Car-Following Models for Adaptive Cruise Control Vehicles: Multiobjective Approach","de Souza, Felipe; Stern, Raphael","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are the first step toward comprehensive vehicle automation. However, the impacts of such vehicles on the underlying traffic flow are not yet clear. Therefore, it is of interest to accurately model vehicle-level dynamics of commercially available ACC vehicles so that they may be used in further modeling efforts to quantify the impact of commercially available ACC vehicles on traffic flow. Importantly, not only model selection but also the calibration approach and error metric used for calibration are critical to accurately model ACC vehicle behavior. In this work, we explore the question of how to calibrate car following models to describe ACC vehicle dynamics. Specifically, we apply a multi-objective calibration approach to understand the tradeoff between calibrating model parameters to minimize speed error vs. spacing error. Three different car-following models are calibrated for data from six vehicles. The results are in line with recent literature and verify that targeting a low spacing error does not compromise the speed accuracy whether the opposite is not true for modeling ACC vehicle dynamics.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Argonne National Lab.

Aggregator-based centralized solver is computation and time intensive while consensus-based distributed control is communication intensive.

"Performance Comparison of LPG and Gasoline in an Engine Configured for EGR-Loop Catalytic Reforming","Szybist, James; Pihl, Josh; Hawa, Hani; Roychoudhury, Subir","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","In prior work, the EGR loop catalytic reforming strategy developed by ORNL has been shown to provide a relative brake engine efficiency increase of more than 6% by minimizing the thermodynamic expense of the reforming processes, and in some cases achieving thermochemical recuperation (TCR), a form of waste heat recovery where waste heat is converted to usable chemical energy. In doing so, the EGR dilution limit was extended beyond 35% under stoichiometric conditions. In this investigation, a Microlith®-based metal-supported reforming catalyst (developed by Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI)) was used to reform the parent fuel in a thermodynamically efficient manner into products rich in H2 and CO. We were able to expand the speed and load ranges relative to previous investigations: from 1,500 to 2,500 rpm, and from 2 to 14 bar break mean effective pressure (BMEP). Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of the H/C ratio of the fuel on H2 production and on the engine efficiency in order to compare E10 gasoline (H/C = 1.95) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), comprised primarily of propane (H/C = 2.67). Additionally, the compression ratio of the engine was increased to ascertain whether further efficiency improvements could be realized based on a reduced knock propensity of the dilute EGR mixture with the reformed fuel. Both the gasoline and propane reforming strategies provided efficiency gains up to 1.85 percentage points and further efficiency improvements with the increased compression ratio were realized. The fuel specific effects of gasoline vs. LPG, the effect of engine operating condition on reforming, and knock limits of the reformed mixture are discussed in detail.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Fuel Effects on Advanced Compression Ignition Load Limits","Powell, Tommy; Szybist, James","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","In order to increase the efficiency of light-duty gasoline engines, the Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative from the U.S. Department of Energy is investigating multi-mode combustion strategies. Multi-mode combustion can be describe as using conventional spark-ignited combustion at high loads, and at the part-load operating conditions, various advanced compression ignition (ACI) strategies are being investigated to increase efficiency. Of particular interest to the Co-Optima initiative is the extent to which optimal fuel properties and compositions can enable higher efficiency ACI combustion over larger portions of the operating map. Extending the speed-load range of these ACI modes can enable greater part-load efficiency improvements for multi-mode combustion strategies. In this manuscript, we investigate fuel effects for six different fuels, including four with a research octane number (RON) of 98 and differing fuel chemistries, iso-octane, and a market representative E10 fuel, on the load limits for two different ACI strategies: spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) and partial fuel stratification-gasoline compression ignition (PFS-GCI) operation. Experimental results show that limits to intake boosting limit high load operation for most fuels, but high smoke emissions for high particulate matter index (PMI) fuels under SACI conditions could also be a limitation. Contrastingly, low load is limited by combustion efficiency, but these effects have more pronounced variation with fuel chemistry for PFS-GCI than with SACI. Additional, distinct effects affecting autoignition timing and peak heat release at higher speeds were identified for fuels having different low temperature heat release (LTHR) propensities for both ACI modes.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Most roadway link-level vehicle energy consumption data are estimated using average annual daily traffic measures derived from the Highway Performance Monitoring System; however, this method does not reflect day-to-day energy consumption fluctuations. As transportation planners and operators are becoming more environmentally attentive, they need accurate real-time link-level vehicle energy consumption data to assess energy and emissions; to incentivize energy-efficient routing; and to estimate energy impact caused by congestion, major events, and severe weather. This paper presents a computational workflow to automate the estimation of time-resolved vehicle energy consumption for each link in a road network of interest using vehicle probe speed and count data in conjunction with machine learning methods in real time. The real-time pipeline can deliver energy estimates within a couple seconds on query to its interface. The proposed method was evaluated on the transportation network of the metropolitan area of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The volume estimation results were validated with ground truth traffic volume data collected in the field. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the energy consumption pipeline was applied to real-world data to quantify road transportation-related energy reduction because of mitigation policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to measure energy loss resulting from congestion.","SAGE Publications","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fuel Stratification Effects on Gasoline Compression Ignition with a Regular-Grade Gasoline on a Single-Cylinder Medium-Duty Diesel Engine at Low Load","Curran, Scott; Szybist, James; Kaul, Brian; Easter, Jordan; Sluder, Scott","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Prior research studies have investigated a wide variety of gasoline compression ignition (GCI) injection strategies and the resulting fuel stratification levels to maintain control over the combustion phasing, duration, and heat release rate. Previous GCI research at the US Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has shown that for a combustion mode with a low degree of fuel stratification, called “partial fuel stratification” (PFS), gasoline range fuels with anti-knock index values in the range of regular-grade gasoline (~87 anti-knock index or higher) provides very little controllability over the timing of combustion without significant boost pressures. On the contrary, heavy fuel stratification (HFS) provides control over combustion phasing but has challenges achieving low temperature combustion operation, which has the benefits of low NOX and soot emissions, because of the air handling burdens associated with the required high exhaust gas recirculation rates. This work investigates HFS and PFS combustion, efficiency, and emissions performance on a single-cylinder, medium-duty engine with a regular-grade gasoline (91 research octane number) at 1,200 rpm, 4.3 bar, and 3.0 nominal gross indicated mean effective pressure operating points with boost levels similar to those in a medium-duty diesel application. Authority of combustion phasing with main injection timing sweeps for HFS and second injection timing sweeps and fuel split sweeps for PFS are shown. In addition, this work is discussed in the context of previous findings with a light-duty diesel platform, and next steps and future direction for this work are presented1.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A potential solution for reducing GHG emissions in this sector is to use green hydrogen in fuel cell electric vehicles (FC-HDV) and establish an accompanying hydrogen refueling station (HRS) network. In this paper, we apply an existing refueling network design model to a HDV-HRS network for Germany until 2050 based on German traffic data for heavy-duty trucks and estimate its costs. Comparing different fuel supply scenarios (pipeline vs. on-site), the on-site scenario results show a network consisting of 137 stations at a cost of 8.38 billion € per year in 2050 (0.40 € per vehicle km), while the centralized scenario with the same amount of stations shows a cheaper cost with 7.25 billion euros per year (0.35 € per vehicle km).

The presented methodology includes synchronous datasets gathered in Fort Collins, Colorado using a test vehicle equipped with sensors to measure ego vehicle position and motion and that of surrounding objects as well as receive Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) information. These datasets are utilized to compare the effect of different signal categories on prediction fidelity for different prediction horizons within a POEMS framework. Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms use the collected data to output future vehicle velocity prediction models. The effects of different combinations of signals and different models on prediction fidelity in various prediction windows are explored. All of these combinations are ultimately addressed where the rubber meets the road: fuel economy (FE) enabled from POEMS. FE optimization is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimizer. FE improvements from MPC control at various prediction time horizons are compared to that of full-cycle DP. All FE results are determined using high-fidelity simulations of an Autonomie 2010 Toyota Prius model. The full-cycle DP POEMS provides the theoretical upper limit on fuel economy (FE) improvement achievable with POEMS but is not currently practical for real-world implementation. Perfect prediction MPC (PP-MPC) represents the upper limit of FE improvement practically achievable with POEMS. Real-Prediction MPC (RP-MPC) can provide nearly equivalent FE improvement when used with high-fidelity predictions. Constant-Velocity MPC (CV-MPC) uses a constant speed prediction and serves as a “null” POEMS. Results showed that RP-MPC, enabled by high-fidelity ego future speed prediction, led to significant FE improvement over baseline nearly matching that of PP-MPC.","MDPI AG","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Sustainable Transportation.

Currently, fast charging is limited by increased cell aging, which is primarily driven by Li plating and degradation of cathode materials. Here, using combined sets of experimental and computational analysis and a suite of different charge protocols, we begin to examine the interplay between failure mode, cell designs, and ultimately aging mechanisms. Slight variation in cell design and the subsequent impacts that charge protocols have on aging can create distinct cell-to-cell variation. As little as 2% difference in porosity change at the cell negative electrode during cycling due to early Li metal plating has been found to alter the aging pathway and either accelerate or inhibit the loss due to Li plating.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The high cost and the added weight of the batteries have limited the size (energy storage capacity) and, therefore, the driving range of these vehicles. However, consumers are steadily purchasing these vehicles because of the fast acceleration, quiet ride, and high energy efficiency. The higher pack-to-wheel efficiency and the lower energy cost per mile, as well as the lower expense for maintenance and repair, translate to operating savings over conventional vehicles. Here we compare battery electric vehicles with internal combustion engine vehicles based on the total cost of ownership. It is seen that the higher initial cost of electric vehicles can be recovered in as little as 5 years. This is especially true for electric vehicles with shorter driving ranges. Specifically, a vehicle with an electric driving range under 200 miles may achieve cost parity with an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle in 8 years or less.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Impact of fuel chemical function characteristics on spark assisted and kinetically controlled compression ignition performance focused on multi-mode operation","D.F. Chuahy, Flavio; Powell, Tommy; Curran, Scott J.; Szybist, James P.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Advanced compression ignition; Multi-mode; Spark assisted compression ignition; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Partial fuel stratification","The DOE Co-Optima initiative has a focus on investigating the ability of fuel properties to work in tandem with advanced combustion engines to increase fuel economy. Advanced compression ignition strategies like spark assisted compression ignition (SACI) and partial fuel stratification (PFS) have been shown to achieve better efficiency and emissions performance than traditional combustion processes (i.e., conventional diesel combustion, spark ignited combustion). These strategies rely on a high degree of fuel mixing and a globally dilute environment to achieve lower temperature combustion. The avoidance of fuel rich regions and the reduction in peak flame temperatures result in low soot and NOx formation. Despite their clear benefits, operating range limitations have been identified for all combustion strategies. The limitations stem from the fundamental characteristics of each combustion process, hence they can't be entirely avoided. These limitations are also geometry, fuel type, dilution level and mixture preparation dependent. Metal engine experiments have been conducted on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with variable valve actuation and a 12.5:1 compression ratio, more appropriate for high load boosted spark ignition operation. Five fuels with different chemical class compositions but matched research octane number (RON) were tested under both SACI and PFS at mid load conditions. Combustion phasing was changed over the whole range of operability to show trade-offs between the fuels. Specific chemical, mixture preparation and thermodynamic effects are discussed for performance and emission results. SACI and PFS are then compared to a baseline spark ignition (SI) condition to estimate potential benefits of operating under advanced combustion modes. The results show that there are significant fuel specific effects even at matched RON and octane sensitivity that affect emissions, engine efficiency and range of operability of the different advanced combustion modes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, high-demand routes are prone to the so-called bus bunching -- a tendency of buses to group as a consequence of variations in travel times and demands. Bus holding is applied to overcome this effect. In this study, we present a novel method for bus holding in which the control law is based only on the buses' position using a computationally efficient rolling horizon approach. The method uses similar inputs as linear control approaches while not increasing significantly the computational time. However, the method overcomes key a weakness of the linear control approach thanks to the explicit constraint handling that always ensures the control action effectiveness. Simulation experiments in a validation case and a model-specific for a bus rapid transit line in Curitiba, Brazil showed a reduced holding time and improved resilience, delivering more than 20% reduction in delay time accounting for the on-board and station delays.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Distributed Maneuver Planning With Connected and Automated Vehicles for Boosting Traffic Efficiency","Goulet, Nathan; Ayalew, Beshah","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; maneuver planning; distributed predictive control; connected and automated vehicles; CAVs; traffic energy efficiency","Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve traffic throughput and achieve a more efficient utilization of the available roadway infrastructure. They also have the potential to reduce energy consumption through traffic motion harmonization, even when operating in mixed traffic with other human-driven vehicles. The key to realizing these potentials are coordinated control schemes that can be implemented in a distributed manner with the CAVs. In this paper, we propose a distributed predictive control framework that features a two-dimensional maneuver planner incorporating explicit coordination constraints between connected vehicles operating in mixed traffic at various penetration levels. Here, the framework includes a distributed implementation of a reference speed assigner that estimates local traffic speed from on-board measurements and communicated information. We present an extensive evaluation of the proposed framework in traffic micro-simulations at various CAV penetrations from traffic flow, energy use, and lane utilization points of view. Results are compared to a baseline scenario with no CAVs, as well as, a benchmark one-dimensional planner.","IEEE","","Clemson Univ., SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Scaling of oxygen-methane reacting coaxial jets using x-ray fluorescence to measure mixture fraction","Bennewitz, John W.; Schumaker, S. Alexander; Lietz, Christopher F.; Kastengren, Alan L.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; injector scaling; liquid rocket engines; mixture fraction; reacting coaxial jets; x-ray fluorescence","Stoichiometric mixing length L<sub>s</sub> of reacting coaxial jet flames is a critical scaling parameter for liquid rocket engine combustors. Previous studies have shown that L<sub>s</sub> for shear coaxial flames can be scaled like their non-reacting counterparts using a non-dimensional momentum flux ratio J. In addition, stoichiometric mixing lengths of reacting and nonreacting coaxial jets collapse upon a single line by altering J using an effective outer flow gas density. This effective density is calculated from a modified version of the equivalence principle, originally developed by Tacina and Dahm [1, 2] and accounts for the effects of heat release on mixing. However, previous studies also required a second nonphysical scaling constant S<sub>c</sub> for the reacting jets, which is not predicted by the equivalence principle [3]. It was originally hypothesized that S<sub>c</sub> is attributed to the limitation of hydroxyl (OH) planar laser-induced fluorescence, which only infers L<sub>s</sub>. Direct quantitative measurement of conserved scalar fields using conventional optical diagnostics is difficult due to the lack of a tracer that easily fluoresces, survives high temperature oxygen flames, and is not dominated by quenching effects. To measure a conserved scalar field, this work implements x-ray fluorescence of Kr and Ar tracers to obtain quantitative mixture fraction fields. From these mixture fraction fields, stoichiometric mixing lengths for two CH<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> flames are calculated and scaled against nonreacting coaxial mixing lengths using the equivalence principle. By directly measuring the stoichiometric mixing length, it is established that the additional constant is a byproduct of the OH measurement technique and the equivalence principle fully captures the scaling. Finally, comparison with high-fidelity simulation of the flame further supports this conclusion. In addition to further strengthening this scaling method, this work represents the first use of x-ray fluorescence to make quantitative conserved scalar measurements in turbulent flames.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Taking into account greenhouse gas emissions of electric vehicles for transportation de-carbonization","Gan, Yu (ORCID:0000000178217400); Wang, Michael (ORCID:0000000283150201); Lu, Zifeng (ORCID:0000000173315861); Kelly, Jarod","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Greenhouse Gas; Plug-in electric vehicle; Vehicle fuel consumption/economy regulation; Well-to-wheels","Plug-in electric vehicles pose great potentials to de-carbonize the transportation sector. To jump-start their market deployment, regulations in China, the U.S., and the European Union provide preferential treatments, including counting a single plug-in electric vehicle with multipliers (super-credits) in calculating sales-averaged emissions (regulation dilution effect) and considering zero emissions for the electric mileage by omitting electricity generation emissions (regulation leakage effect). This study quantifies greenhouse gas emission increases due to these two effects in the three markets. We show that plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2012-2025 in the three markets will result in greenhouse gas emission increases of more than 1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent through 2050 relative to the case without the two effects. The increase is 671, 280, and 143 million tonnes in China, the U.S., and the EU, respectively. The dilution effect causes an increase of 615 million tonnes, and the leakage effect 479 million tonnes. As the plug-in electric vehicle market grows, their super-credits should be gradually withdrawn, and well-to-wheels emissions need to be considered to achieve holistic greenhouse gas emission reductions. Future regulations should be carefully designed to incentivize new technologies while mitigating the risk of increasing emissions elsewhere so that the intent of environmental regulations is not compromised.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Joint Modeling of Access Mode and Parking Choice of Air Travelers Using Revealed Preference Data","Ge, Yanbo; Biehl, Alec; Ravulaparthy, Srinath; Garikapati, Venu; Lunacek, Monte; Phillips, Caleb","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; access mode; airport; nested logistic regression","Airport ground access mode choice is distinct from everyday mode choice decisions, necessitating context-specific choice model estimation. Understanding airport ground access mode choice decisions is not only important for developing infrastructure planning strategies, but also for assessing the impacts of emerging modes on airport revenues, particularly from parking. However, parking choice is an often-overlooked dimension in airport ground access choice modeling. This paper addresses this gap through the development of a joint model of airport access mode and parking option choice using a passenger survey conducted at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International Airport in 2015. Compared with a traditional conditional logit model that does not consider parking options available at DFW airport, the joint model of mode and parking decisions was found to generate more realistic values of travel time and was shown to have better predictive performance, both of which are critical for obtaining better airport parking revenue estimates and identifying traveler cohorts who may respond more strongly to potential policies targeting curb congestion and parking demand.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Development of in-use engine speed/torque heat maps across multiple heavy-duty commercial vehicle vocations","Zhang, Chen; Kelly, Kenneth; Kotz, Andrew; Miller, Eric","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; commercial vehicles; engine efficiency; engine model; on-road data; operational heat maps","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) established the SuperTruck program with the goal of achieving brake thermal efficiency (BTE) greater than or equal to 55% as demonstrated in an operational heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine at a 65-miles-per-hour (mph) cruise point. Beyond the line-haul application, HD engines operate in a wide range of speed and torque conditions that are unlikely to yield the same efficiency under real-world operation. Thereby, the in-use engine heat maps described in this paper are a valuable tool to illustrate whether the engine-efficiency “sweet spot” matches the most frequent operating conditions. In this study, NREL developed engine heat maps to quantify the important operating points for various vocations using our Fleet DNA database of commercial fleet vehicle operations data. These heat maps clearly show that high-frequency operating points vary significantly according to vehicle vocation, while only a few of them match the sweet spot. Beyond the illustration, engine in-use heat maps can also be leveraged to build up reduced-order engine-efficiency models, needed by many rapid powertrain simulations. As case studies, nine reduced-order models – including line-haul truck, transfer truck, transit bus, transit bus with compressed natural gas (CNG) engine, drayage, refuse pickup, local delivery, utility truck, and school bus with CNG engine – using a trust-region reflective algorithm to fit the on-road data extracted based on the engine in-use heat maps.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It has long been known that fuel composition has a significant impact on particulate emissions from gasoline engines. Since gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines have become the market-leading technology, this has become more significant because the evaporative behavior of fuel increases in importance. Several PM indices have been developed to provide metrics describing this behavior and correlating PM emissions. In this article, 16 different PM indices are identified and collected - to the authors' knowledge, all of the indices are available at the time of writing. The indices are reviewed and discussed in the context of the information required to calculate them, as well as their utility. Additionally, the authors believe that there is a need for indices that provide both a detailed and robust correlation, as well as those that are less sophisticated yet sufficient for specific use cases. Future research is suggested to guide the technical community toward improvements in the indices' methods and equations for both high and low fidelity and high and low time investment.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model considers finite heat transfer rate, variable heat source and sink temperatures, and irreversibilities associated with the expansion and compression. Expressions for the maximum power and efficiency at maximum power output are obtained as a function of hot and cold reservoir temperatures, the equivalent isentropic efficiency of compression and expansion components, and the effective conductance ratio between heat exchangers. In all cases, the Curzon–Ahlborn efficiency is retrieved at constant reservoir temperatures and neglected compression–expansion irreversibilities. The proposed model allows assessing the effect of isentropic efficiencies and heat exchanger design and operation characteristics for different thermodynamic cycles.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effects of fuel oxygenation and ducted fuel injection on the performance of a mixing-controlled compression-ignition optical engine with a two-orifice fuel injector","Mueller, Charles J.; Nilsen, Christopher W.; Biles, Drummond E.; Yraguen, Boni F. (ORCID:0000000198060041)","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Diesel; engine; oxygenate; ducted fuel injection; optical; soot; combustion; emissions","This paper describes results from an optical-engine investigation of oxygenated fuel effects on ducted fuel injection (DFI) relative to conventional diesel combustion (CDC). Three fuels were tested: a baseline, non-oxygenated No. 2 emissions certification diesel (denoted CF<sub>B</sub>), and two blends containing potential renewable oxygenates. The first oxygenated blend contained 25 vol% methyl decanoate in CF<sub>B</sub> (denoted MD25), and the second contained 25 vol% tri-propylene glycol mono-methyl ether in CF<sub>B</sub> (denoted T25). Whereas DFI and fuel oxygenation primarily curtail soot emissions, intake-oxygen mole fractions of 21% and 16% were employed to explore the potential additional beneficial impact of dilution on engine-out emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>). It was found that DFI with an oxygenated fuel can attenuate soot incandescence by ~100X (~10X from DFI and an additional ~10X from fuel oxygenation) relative to CDC with conventional diesel fuel, regardless of dilution level and without large effects on other emissions or efficiency. This breaks the soot/NO<sub>x</sub> trade-off with dilution, enabling simultaneous reductions in both soot and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, even with conventional diesel fuel. Significant cyclic variability in soot incandescence for both CDC and DFI suggests that additional improvements in engine-out soot emissions may be possible via improved control of in-cylinder mixture formation and evolution.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Empirical Estimation of Shortest Route Length along U.S. Interstate Highways Based on Great Circle Distance","Liu, Nawei; Xie, Fei; Lin, Zhenhong; Jin, Mingzhou","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","In this study, 98 regression models were specified for easily estimating shortest distances based on great circle distances along the U.S. interstate highways nationwide and for each of the continental 48 states. This allows transportation professionals to quickly generate distance, or even distance matrix, without expending significant efforts on complicated shortest path calculations. For simple usage by all professionals, all models are present in the simple linear regression form. Only one explanatory variable, the great circle distance, is considered to calculate the route distance. For each geographic scope (i.e., the national or one of the states), two different models were considered, with and without the intercept. Based on the adjusted R-squared, it was observed that models without intercepts generally have better fitness. Additionally, all these models generally have good fitness with the linear regression relationship between the great circle distance and route distance. At the state level, significant variations in the slope coefficients between the state-level models were also observed. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of the effect of highway density on this variation was conducted.","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Dean; Whitesides, Russell A.; McNenly, Matthew J.","42 ENGINEERING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; knock; Livengood-Wu integral; octane sensitivity; CFD; two-stage ignition","This work describes the development of a transported Livengood–Wu (L–W) integral model for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to predict autoignition and engine knock tendency. The currently employed L–W integral model considers both single-stage and two-stage ignition processes, thus can be generally applied to different fuels such as paraffin, olefin, aromatics, and alcohol. The model implementation is first validated in simulations of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion for three different fuels, showing good accuracy in prediction of autoignition timing for fuels with either single-stage or two-stage ignition characteristics. Then, the L–W integral model is coupled with G-equation model to indicate end-gas autoignition and knock tendency in CFD simulations of a direct-injection spark-ignition engine. This modeling approach is about 10 times more efficient than the ones that based on detailed chemistry calculation and pressure oscillation analysis. Two fuels with same Research Octane Number (RON) but different octane sensitivity are studied, namely, Co-Optima alkylate and Co-Optima E30. Feed-forward neural network model in conjunction with multivariable minimization technique is used to generate fuel surrogates with targets of matched RON, octane sensitivity, and ethanol content. The CFD model is validated against experimental data in terms of pressure traces and heat release rate for both fuels under a wide range of operating conditions. The knock tendency—indicated by the fuel energy contained in the autoignited region—of the two fuels at different load conditions correlates well with the experimental results and the fuel octane sensitivity, implying the current knock modeling approach can capture the octane sensitivity effect and can be applied to further investigation on composition of octane sensitivity.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"How Many Trip Requests Could We Support? An Activity-Travel Based Vehicle Scheduling Approach","Mahmoudi, Monirehalsadat; Tong, Lu (Carol); Garikapati, Venu; Pendyala, Ram M.; Zhou, Zuesong","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; activity-based vehicle routing problem; activity-travel graphs; column generation; space-time networks","In a world of ever-changing travel behavior and ever-increasing modal options, is vital to have integrated models that could capture the interactions between supply and demand layers of travel. Addressing this need, we propose three different versions of network representation and mathematical models for the activity-based vehicle routing problem to connect activity-travel graphs of passengers (demand layer) to spatio-temporal networks of vehicles (supply layer). Versions I and II are arc-based, while version III is path-based. In version I, we introduce the concept of activity-travel graphs for passengers. For vehicles, we construct space–time networks and add a new dimension, called “under-service state”, to track the execution status of trip requests at any location and time. In version II, we reduce the complexity of the network structure by eliminating the state dimension and some other modifications in the structure of the passengers’ and vehicles’ network. Although both versions can capture various behavioral constraints of the activity-based vehicle routing problem (e.g., mandatory and optimal activities, duration of activities, chain of activities, preferred starting and ending times of activities), due to the high level of complexity of the network structure, both versions can only solve small-sized problems. To tackle the computational complexity, we propose a path-based network representation in version III, and to make a balance between the disutility of passengers and vehicles, we present a tolled user equilibrium problem. Mathematical models are coded in C and GAMS and implemented on real-world Phoenix regional transportation network with more than 39 million trip requests, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for the original and restricted master problems.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One strategy to decrease emissions is to split the fuel injection into a series of smaller injections. In this paper, we explore a new way of discovering optimal control strategies for the next generation of CI engines using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We outline a DRL procedure to maximize the weighted reward of engine work while minimizing end-of-cycle NO <sub>x</sub> emissions. Through the procedure outlined in this paper, we show that the DRL agent is able to reduce NO <sub>x</sub> emissions threefold while only decreasing network by 2%. We demonstrate the use of transfer learning (TL) across hierarchies of physical models to accelerate the learning process, making this approach feasible for a range of control problems within this space. This paper presents a framework and demonstration for using DRL to design control systems in technology areas such as multi-pulse engine control where a hierarchy of models combined with multi-objective rewards are used for optimal operation. </p>","SAGE Publications","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Evaluating the fuel economy benefit of a new technology in specific powertrain systems is straightforward; and, in an early concept phase, obtaining a projection of energy efficiency benefits from new technologies is extremely useful. However, when carmakers consider new technology or powertrain configurations, they must deal with a trade-off problem involving factors such as energy efficiency and performance, because of the complexities of sizing a vehicle’s powertrain components, which directly affect its energy efficiency and dynamic performance. As powertrains of modern vehicles become more complicated, even more effort is required to design the size of each component. This study presents a component-sizing process based on the forward-looking vehicle simulator “Autonomie” and the optimization algorithm “POUNDERS”; the supervisory control strategy based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) assures sufficient computational system efficiency. We tested the process by applying it to a single power-split hybrid electric vehicle to determine optimal values of gear ratios and each component size, where we defined the optimization problem as minimizing energy consumption when the vehicle’s dynamic performance is given as a performance constraint. The suggested sizing process will be helpful in determining optimal component sizes for vehicle powertrain to maximize fuel efficiency while dynamic performance is satisfied. Indeed, this process does not require the engineer’s intuition or rules based on heuristics required in the rule-based process.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

A novel methodology is presented that correlates measured ignition delay (ID) time to RON in an Advanced Fuel Ignition Delay Analyzer (AFIDA) constant-volume combustion chamber device at a single pressure/temperature condition, with an r2 of 0.99 and standard error (SE) of 1.0. The correlation of the slope of the ID time between two additional temperature points to octane sensitivity (S) produces an r2 of 0.97 and SE of 0.69; however, fuels with S>12 are indistinguishable. These results are based on methodology calibration using 31 primary and toluene reference fuels containing 0%-40% ethanol with RON values ranging from 85 to 113. Validation of these methods using a 102-sample fuel matrix spanning an array of base fuels and additive chemistry designed to test the robust applicability of the method, along with pump gasoline and high-octane surrogate blend samples, demonstrates an r2 of 0.94 and SE of 1.3 for the RON correlation over all samples, whereas the equivalent S correlation produces an r2 of 0.78 and SE of 1.2 by excluding two additives, 3-pentanone and diisobutylene, which displayed poor S correlation results. This novel AFIDA analysis method can be performed in 1 h and with 40 mL of fuel, offering significant improvements in time and volume requirements over traditional techniques.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Cabin Thermal Management Analysis for SuperTruck II Next-Generation Hybrid Electric Truck Design","Okaeme, Charles; Lustbader, Jason; Sigler, Cory; Jorgensen, Iner; Grover, Ben; Kiesser, Jordan; Moniot, Matthew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; cabin modeling; commercial vehicle; thermal comfort; thermal management; truck HVAC; vehicle simulation; vehicle thermal modeling","In this article, we present a multistage, coupled thermal management simulation approach, informed by physical testing where available, to aid design decisions for PACCAR's SuperTruck II hybrid truck cabin concept. Focus areas include cabin insulation, battery sizing, and sleeper curtain position, as well as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) component and accessory configurations, to maintain or improve thermal comfort while saving energy. The authors analyzed weather data and determined the national vehicle miles traveled weighted temperature and solar conditions for long-haul trucks. Example weather day profiles were selected to approximate the 5th and 95th percentile weighted conditions. A daylong drive cycle was developed to impose appropriate external wind conditions during rest and driving periods. Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's vehicle HVAC modeling and simulation tool VTCab, HVAC load design trade-off studies for the new truck geometry concept were completed. Parameters analyzed included effects of paint color, insulation, glass transmissivity, and curtain location. Simulation results helped with early design material selections for efficient cabin climate control. A detailed three-dimensional computer-aided engineering (CAE), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), radiation, and human physiology co-simulation, referred to in this article as CAE Thermal-CFD, was used to evaluate thermal comfort and energy impacts of diffuser configurations and air supply settings in driving and hoteling modes. Analysis revealed that it is more difficult to heat the cabin in hoteling mode during the winter than to cool the space in the summer. This seasonal load profile drives the requirement of additional energy storage for heating comfort. To determine the battery capacity requirement, multiday HVAC operation drive cycle simulations were then completed, showing that a 15-kWh battery would be required for HVAC operation during hoteling. Results helped reduce cabin thermal loads, determine component sizing requirements, and improve occupant comfort to save fuel and contribute to the economic viability of the hybrid system.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Numerical investigation of a fueled pre-chamber spark-ignition natural gas engine","Kim, Joohan; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Som, Sibendu; Shah, Ashish; Biruduganti, Munidhar S.; Longman, Douglas E.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; combustion model evaluation; computational fluid dynamics; natural gas engine; pre-chamber spark-ignition; turbulent jet ignition; ultra-lean combustion","Pre-chamber spark-ignition (PCSI) is a leading advanced ignition concept for internal combustion engines with the potential to enable diesel-like efficiency in medium-duty/heavy-duty (MD/HD) natural gas (NG) engines. By leveraging distributed ignition sources from multiple turbulent jets, the PCSI technology can deliver extremely short combustion duration in ultra-lean mixtures and significantly improve the engine thermal efficiency. However, in the automotive industry there is a lack of adequate science base and predictive simulation tools required for commercial development of PCSI engines. Here, in this study, Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes simulations are carried out to describe the combustion process in lean-burn NG engines, focusing on the combustion modeling approach. Two combustion models, multi-zone well-stirred reactor (MZ-WSR) and G-equation, are used to simulate the combustion process in an MD NG engine equipped with a fueled-PCSI system for four operating conditions close to the lean operating limit. A skeletal chemical mechanism and a laminar flame speed tabulation are used to compute the combustion accurately. Simulation results are compared with experimental data regarding measured cylinder pressure, heat release rate, and combustion duration. By dividing the PCSI combustion process into four distinct phases, the difference between the two models’ results for each phase is analyzed in detail. The MZ-WSR model overestimates the combustion duration for early flame kernel growth in the pre-chamber due to the lack of a specific formulation to take turbulence-chemistry interaction into account. Despite the prolonged combustion duration and low pressure built-up inside the pre-chamber, the model matches the combustion rate in the main-chamber. In contrast, the G-equation model delivers good agreements for the pre-chamber combustion and turbulent jet-driven combustion processes. However, the model starts to underestimate the combustion rate in the main-chamber, especially under ultra-lean mixture conditions. Finally, improvements are needed for both models to simulate the later combustion stage that occurred in the near-wall regions.","SAGE","","Argonne National Lab.

"A system of shared autonomous vehicles for Chicago: Understanding the effects of geofencing the service","Gurumurthy, Krishna Murthy; Auld, Joshua; Kockelman, Kara","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; POLARIS; agent-based simulation; chicago; dynamic ride-sharing; geofences; shared autonomous vehicles","With autonomous vehicles (AVs) still in the testing phase, researchers and planners must resort to simulation techniques to explore possible futures regarding shared and automated mobility. An agent-based discrete-event transport simulator, POLARIS, is used in this study to simulate travel in the 20-county Chicago region with a shared AV (SAV) mobility option. Using this framework, the effect of an SAV fleet on system performance when constrained to serve within geofences is studied under four distinct scenarios: service restricted to the city, to the city plus suburban core, to the core plus exurban areas, and to the entire region — along with the choice of dynamic ridesharing (DRS) versus solo travel in an SAV. Results indicate that service areas need a balanced mix of trip generators and attractors, and an SAV fleet’s empty VMT (eVMT) can be noticeably reduced through suitable geofencing and DRS. Geofences can also help lower response times, reduce systemwide VMT across all modes, and ensure uniform access to SAVs. DRS is most useful in lowering VMT and %eVMT that arises from sprawled land development, but with insufficient demand to share rides, savings from the use of geofences is higher. Geofences targeting neighborhoods with high trip density bring about low response times and %eVMT, but fleet sizes in these regions need to be designed for uniformly low response times throughout a large region, as opposed to maximizing vehicle use in a 24-hour day.","University of Minnesota Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

The Tampa Bay region, in particular, is considered one of the most vulnerable areas in the United States to hurricanes and severe tropical weather. A particular vulnerability stems from how all petroleum fuel comes to the area by marine transport through Port Tampa Bay, which can be (and has been in the past) impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms. The case study discussed in this paper covers previous fuel challenges, vulnerabilities, and lessons learned by key Tampa Bay public agency fleets during the past 10 years (mainly as a result of the most recent 2017 Hurricane Irma) to explore ways to improve the area’s resilience to natural disasters. Some of the strategies for fuel-supply resiliency include maintaining emergency fuel supply, prioritizing fuel use, strategically placing the assets around the region to help with recovery, investing in backup generators (including generators powered by alternative fuels), planning for redundancies in fuel supply networks, developing more efficient communication procedures between public fleets, hurricane preparedness-planning, and upgrading street drainage systems to reduce the threat of local flooding.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper quantifies the impact of VTO R&D on vehicle energy consumption and cost compared to expected historical improvements across vehicle classes, powertrains, component technologies and timeframes. We have implemented a large scale simulation process to develop and simulate tens of thousands of vehicles on U.S. standard driving cycles using Autonomie, a vehicle simulation tool developed by Argonne National Laboratory. Results demonstrate significant additional reductions in both cost and energy consumption due to the existence of VTO R&D targets compared to predicted historical trends.

Results show a high variation of provincial WTW GHG emission intensities for battery electric vehicles (BEVs, 22–293 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs, 82–298 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) in contrast to gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs, 227–245 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km) and gasoline hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs, 141–164 g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/km). Due to the GHG-intensive coal-based electricity and cold weather, WTW GHG emission intensities of BEVs and PHEVs are higher than those of gasoline ICEVs in seven and ten northern provinces in China, respectively. WTW GHG emission intensities of gasoline HEVs, on the other hand, are lower in 18 and 26 provinces than those of BEVs and PHEVs, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to develop representative cycles for heavy-duty vehicles. By implementing decision tree regression (DTR) to the Fleet DNA on-road vehicle data, a broader set of metrics, such as engine power and fuel consumption, can be used for more robust cycle development. Additionally, the influence of each metric on the regression target is also accounted for by a weighted number derived through the DTR to enhance the representativenss of the developed cycle. As case studies, we applied the proposed method to five heavy-duty vocations (drayage, long haul, regional haul, local delivery, and transit bus) and derived the most representative cycle, as well as four extreme cycles (maximal energy consumption, maximal power-weighted work, maximal fraction of high speed, and minimal fuel economy) to advance the related alternative powertrain design.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed optimization model and stochastic simulation are tested using shuttle route data provided by the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. In this work, results indicate that optimized routes can lead to a 20% energy reduction in shuttle operations with a modest 2-min increase in average shuttle wait times.

Collectively, this combustion mode has become kn+own as gasoline compression ignition (GCI). One of the biggest challenges with GCI operation is maintaining control over the combustion process through the fuel injection strategy, such that the engine can be controlled on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Research studies have investigated a wide variety of GCI injection strategies (i.e., fuel stratification levels) to maintain control over the heat release rate while achieving low-temperature combustion (LTC). This work shows that at loads relevant to light-duty engines, partial fuel stratification (PFS) with gasoline provides very little controllability over the timing of combustion. On the contrary, heavy fuel stratification (HFS) provides very linear and pronounced control over the timing of combustion. However, the HFS strategy has challenges achieving LTC operation due to the air handling burdens associated with the high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates that are required to reduce NOx emissions to near zero levels. In this work, a wide variety of gasoline fuel reactivities (octane numbers ranging from &lt;40 to 87) were investigated to understand the engine performance and emissions of HFS-GCI operation on a multi-cylinder light-duty engine. Overall, the results indicate that over an EGR sweep at 4 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), the gasoline fuels can achieve LTC operation with ultra-low NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions, while conventional diesel combustion (CDC) is unable to simultaneously achieve low NO<sub>x</sub> and soot. At 10 bar BMEP, all the gasoline fuels were compared to diesel, but using mixing controlled combustion and not LTC.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Solid particulate mass and number from ducted fuel injection in an optically accessible diesel engine in skip-fired operation","Wilmer, Brady M.; Nilsen, Christopher William; Biles, Drummond Edward; Mueller, Charles J.; Northrop, William F.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; ducted fuel injection; diesel, particle mass; particle size distribution; particle number; compression ignition; internal combustion engines","Ducted fuel injection (DFI) is a new combustion strategy that has been shown to significantly attenuate soot formation in diesel engines. While previous studies have used optical diagnostics and optical filter smoke number methods to show that DFI reduces in-cylinder soot formation and engine-out soot emissions, respectively, this is the first study to measure solid particle number (PN) emissions in addition to particle mass (PM). Furthermore, this study quantitatively evaluates the use of transient particle instruments for measuring particles from skip-fired operation in an optical single cylinder research engine (SCRE). Engine-out PN was measured using an engine exhaust particle sizer following a catalytic stripper, and PM was measured using a photoacoustic analyzer. The study improves on earlier preliminary emissions studies by clearly showing that DFI reduces overall PM by 76%–79% and PN for particles larger than 23 nm by 77% relative to conventional diesel combustion at a 1200-rpm, 13.3-bar gross indicated mean effective pressure operating condition. The degree of engine-out PM reduction with DFI was similar across both particulate measurement instruments used in the work. Through the use of bimodal distribution fitting, DFI was also shown to reduce the geometric mean diameter of accumulation mode particles by 26%, similar to the effects of increased injection pressure in conventional diesel combustion systems. This work clearly shows the significant solid particulate matter reductions enabled by DFI while also demonstrating that engine-out PN can be accurately measured from an optical SCRE operating in a skip-fired mode. Based on these results, it is believed that DFI has the potential to enable fuel savings when implemented in multi-cylinder engines, both by lowering the required frequency of active diesel particulate filter regeneration, and by reducing the backpressure imposed by exhaust filtration systems.","SAGE","","Sandia National Lab.

"Lean-Stratified Combustion System with Miller Cycle for Downsized Boosted Application - Part 2","Battiston, Paul; Wheeler, Jennifer; Solomon, Arun; Sczomak, David","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Automotive manufacturers relentlessly explore engine technology combinations to achieve reduced fuel consumption under continued regulatory, societal and economic pressures. For example, technologies enabling advanced combustion modes, increased expansion to effective compression ratio and reduced parasitics continue to be developed and integrated within conventional and hybrid propulsion strategies across the industry. Here, a high-efficiency gasoline engine capable for use in conventional or hybrid electric vehicle platforms is highly desirable. This paper is the second of two papers describing the multi-cylinder integration of a technology package combining lean-stratified combustion with Miller cycle for downsized boosted applications. The first paper describes the design, analysis and single-cylinder testing conducted to down-select the combustion system deployed to the multi-cylinder engine. This paper defines a light-duty engine package capable of achieving a 35% fuel economy improvement at US Tier 3 emission standards over a naturally aspirated stoichiometric baseline vehicle. A multi-mode combustion system was developed enabling highly efficient lean-stratified operation at light-load and stoichiometric Miller-cycle operation at mid- to high-loads. A central direct-injection four-valve layout was designed with high-tumble ports and a bowl-in-piston capable of stable operation under highly dilute mixtures when properly matched to fuel spray characteristics, injection strategy, and a high-energy ignition system. Boost system layout and base engine architecture were selected to minimize parasitics and maximize after treatment effectiveness. A multi-cylinder engine was developed and calibrated over a steady-state map. Results fed vehicle simulations over the EPA city and highway test cycles to predict the fuel economy improvement and tailpipe emissions potential. Fuel economy improvements over the baseline vehicle were projected at 42% and 39% for active-urea and passive-ammonia SCR after treatment systems respectively. Controls complexity to achieve regulatory compliance and the cost of the lean after treatment system were identified as the primary challenges to commercial viability.","SAE International","","General Motors LLC, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Lean-Stratified Combustion System with Miller Cycle for Downsized Boosted Application - Part I","Solomon, Arun; Battiston, Paul; Sczomak, David","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Automotive manufacturers relentlessly explore engine technology combinations to achieve reduced fuel consumption under continued regulatory, societal and economic pressures. For example, technologies enabling advanced combustion modes, increased expansion to effective compression ratio, and reduced parasitics continue to be developed and integrated within conventional and hybrid propulsion strategies across the industry. A high-efficiency gasoline engine capable for use in conventional or hybrid electric vehicle platforms is highly desirable. This paper is the first to two papers describing the development of a combustion system combining lean-stratified combustion with Miller cycle for downsized boosted applications. The work was completed under a multi-year US DOE project. The goal was to define a light-duty engine package capable of achieving a 35% fuel economy improvement at US Tier 3 emission standards over a naturally aspirated stoichiometric baseline vehicle. A multi-mode combustion system was developed enabling highly efficient lean-stratified operation at light-load and stoichiometric Miller-cycle operation at mid- to highloads. Some of the unique challenges in synergistically combining the two concepts are highlighted in this paper. Here, a central direct-injection four-valve layout was designed with high-tumble ports and a bowl-in-piston capable of stable operation under highly dilute (lean plus EGR) mixtures when properly matched to fuel spray characteristics, a multiple-injection strategy, and a high-energy ignition system. Other challenges specific to meeting exhaust emissions requirements with a high-efficiency engine are also explored in this study. In this Part 1 of the paper, the single-cylinder combustion system design, analysis, and testing is described. Multicylinder engine system design, analysis and development is described in Part 2 of the paper.","SAE International","","General Motors LLC, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Performance of direct injected propane and gasoline in a high stroke-to-bore ratio SI engine: Pathways to diesel efficiency parity with ultra low soot","Splitter, D.; Boronat, V.; Chuahy, FDF; Storey, J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; LPG; spark ignition; soot, efficiency; turbulence","<p> This work explores pathways to achieve diesel-like, high-efficiency combustion with stoichiometric 3-way catalyst compatible combustion in a single-cylinder spark ignition (SI) research engine. A unique high stroke-to-bore engine design (1.5:1) with cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and high compression ratio ( r <sub>c</sub> ) was used to improve engine efficiency by up to 30% compared with a production turbocharged gasoline direct injection spark ignition engine. Engine experiments were conducted with both 91 RON E10 gasoline and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) (i.e. autogas) and were compared to legacy gasoline data on the production engine. Geometric compression ratio ( r <sub>c</sub> ) of 13.3:1 was used for both fuels with additional experiments at 16.8:1 for LPG only. Measurements of exhaust soot particle size and number concentrations were made with both fuels. Significant reduction in soot particles across the whole particle size range were achieved with LPG due to the elimination of in-cylinder liquid films. The effects of EGR, late intake valve closing (IVC) and fuel characteristics were investigated through their effects on efficiency, combustion stability and soot production. Results of 47% gross thermal efficiency, and 45% net thermal efficiency at stoichiometric engine operation, at up to 17 bar IMEP and 2000 r/min with 16.8:1 r <sub>c</sub> were achieved with LPG. Estimated brake efficiency values were compared to a contemporary medium duty diesel engine illustrating the benefits of the chosen path for achieving diesel efficiency parity. </p>","SAGE Publications","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Numerical Analysis of Fuel Effects on Advanced Compression Ignition Using a Cooperative Fuel Research Engine Computational Fluid Dynamics Model","Kalvakala, Krishna; Pal, Pinaki; Wu, Yunchao; Kukkadapu, Goutham; Kolodziej, Christopher; Gonzalez, Jorge Pulpeiro; Waqas, Muhammad Umer; Lu, Tianfeng; Aggarwal, Suresh K.; Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel combustion; computational fluid dynamics; homogeneous charge compression ignition; CFR engine; low-temperature heat release; thermal stratification; energy systems analysis; engines; fuels; compression; ignition; heat","Growing environmental concerns and demand for a better fuel economy are driving forces that motivate the research for more advanced engines. Multi-mode combustion strategies have gained attention for their potential to provide high thermal efficiency and low emissions for light-duty applications. These strategies target optimizing the engine performance by correlating different combustion modes to load operating conditions. The extension from boosted spark ignition (SI) mode at high loads to advanced compression ignition (ACI) mode at low loads can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio and utilizing intake air heating. Further, in order to enable an accurate control of intake charge condition for ACI mode and rapid mode-switches, it is essential to gain fundamental insights into the autoignition process. Within the scope of ACI, homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode is of significant interest. It is known for its potential benefits, operation at low fuel consumption, low NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions. In the present work, a virtual Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine model is used to analyze fuel effects on ACI combustion. In particular, the effect of fuel octane sensitivity (S) (at constant Research Octane Number (RON)) on autoignition propensity is assessed under beyond-RON (BRON) and beyond-MON (BMON) ACI conditions. The three-dimensional CFR engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model employs a finite-rate chemistry approach with a multi-zone binning strategy to capture autoignition. Two binary blends with Research Octane Number (RON) of 90 are chosen for this study: primary reference fuel (PRF) with S = 0 and toluene–heptane (TH) blend with S = 10.8, representing paraffinic and aromatic gasoline surrogates. Reduced mechanisms for these blends are generated from a detailed gasoline surrogate kinetic mechanism. Simulation results with the reduced mechanisms are validated against experimental data from an in-house CFR engine, with respect to in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, and combustion phasing. Thereafter, the sensitivity of combustion behavior to ACI operating condition (BRON versus BMON), air-fuel ratio (λ = 2 and 3), and engine speed (600 and 900 rpm) is analyzed for both fuels. It is shown that the sensitivity of a fuel’s autoignition characteristics to λ and engine speed significantly differs at BRON and BMON conditions. Moreover, this sensitivity is found to vary among fuels, despite the same RON. It is also observed that the presence of low-temperature heat release (LTHR) under BRON condition leads to more sequential autoignition and longer combustion duration than BMON condition. Finally, the study indicates that the octane index (OI) fails to capture the trend in the variation of autoignition propensity with S under the BMON condition.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

For this work, a natural gas port fuel injection system with an independent injection control for each cylinder was added to the DD15 engine. For the dual-fuel strategies investigated, 65%–90% of the total fuel energy was supplied through the added port fuel injection natural gas (NG) fueling system. The remaining fuel energy was supplied by one or more direct injections of diesel fuel using the production high pressure diesel fueling system. The production DD15 air handling system and combustion geometry were unmodified for this study. Efficiency and emissions with dual-fuel strategies including both low temperature combustion (LTC) and non-LTC approaches such as dual fuel direct-injection were investigated along with control authority over combustion phasing. Parametric studies of dual-fuel NG/diesel advanced combustion were conducted in order to experimentally investigate the potential of high-efficiency, dual-fuel combustion strategies to improve BTE in a multi-cylinder engine, understand the potential reductions in engine-out emissions, and characterize the range of combustion phasing controllability. Characterization of mode transitions from mixing-controlled diesel pilot ignition to kinetically controlled ignition is presented. Key findings from this study included a reproducible demonstration of BTE approaching 48% at up to a 13-bar brake mean effective pressure with significant reductions in engine-out NOx and soot emissions. Finally, additional results from investigating load transients in dual-fuel mode and initial characterization of particle size distribution during dual-fuel operation are presented.","SAGE Publications","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the range of electric vehicles decreases in cold climates partly because of the additional thermal loads associated with cabin heating. One way to improve the efficiency of cabin heating is to replace resistive heating elements with an air-source heat pump system. However, to gain the full benefit of heat pumping, frost formation on the outdoor heat exchanger must be minimized. In this work, we modified the surface wettability of aluminum louvered-fin automotive heat pump evaporators and tested them under realistic operating conditions in a transcritical carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) heat pump. Each heat exchanger underwent several consecutive frosting and defrosting cycles to understand the cyclic performance of the system. The heat exchanger with a superhydrophobic outer surface was able to delay frost formation and maintain higher heat transfer rates when compared to heat exchangers with higher surface energies (hydrophilic). The delayed frost formation resulted in a system efficiency benefit in the first few frosting cycles but diminished in later cycles due to water retention and incomplete defrosting. However, for most automotive applications the superhydrophobic heat exchanger showed substantial benefits for normal driving trips. We report the scalable and optimized superhydrophobic heat exchangers developed here have the potential to increase the efficiency of automotive heat pumps and consequently increase the range and reduce energy consumption of electric vehicles.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to effectively manage urban deliveries, city planners and policy makers need to better understand driver behaviors and the challenges they experience in performing deliveries. In this study, we collected data on commercial vehicle (CV) driver behaviors by performing ridealongs with various logistics carriers. Ridealongs were performed in Seattle, Washington, covering a range of vehicles (cars, vans, and trucks), goods (parcels, mail, beverages, and printed materials), and customer types (residential, office, large and small retail). Observers collected qualitative observations and quantitative data on trip and dwell times, while also tracking vehicles through GPS devices. The results showed that, on average, urban CVs spent 80 percent of their daily operating time parked. The study also found that, unlike the common belief, drivers (especially those operating heavier vehicles) parked in authorized parking locations, with only less than 5 percent of stops occurring in the travel lane. Dwell times associated with authorized parking locations were significantly longer than those of other parking locations, and mail and heavy goods deliveries generally had longer dwell times. We also identified three main criteria CV drivers used for choosing a parking location: avoiding unsafe maneuvers, minimizing conflicts with other users of the road, and coopetition with other commercial drivers. Here, the results provide estimates for trip times, dwell times, and parking choice types, as well as insights into why those decisions are made and the factors affecting driver choices.","SAGE","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-03-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board; Journal Volume: 2675; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 608-619","","","EE0008462","Journal ID: ISSN 0361-1981","10.1177/03611981211003575","","2021-12-13T00:00:00Z","1764618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1764618","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1764618","Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board","9","2675"

To understand the impact, this work simulates two EV charging scenarios (home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 EV adoption levels on 10 actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of existing (non-EV) vehicles taken from global positioning system (GPS) data. The GPS driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal EV charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the EPS simulations incorporate the EV charging demands to calculate the power flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system components. Line loading impacts are more noticeable, with a maximum increase of about 15%. Additionally, the feeder peak load times experience a slight shift for residential and mixed feeders (≈1 h), not at all for the industrial, and 8 h for the commercial feeder.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

"Gasoline fuels properties for multi-mode operation – Observations in a GDI and the CFR engine","Shah, Ashish; Hoth, Alexander; Kolodziej, Christopher P.; Rockstroh, Toby","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Multi-mode Combustion; Octane sensitivity","The combustion behavior of five full boiling range RON98 gasoline blends was evaluated for multi-mode operation in a GDI and the CFR octane rating engine. The GDI engine tests were conducted with stoichiometric air-fuel ratio in spark-ignition (SI), and with air-diluted homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode. In the CFR engine, the knocking combustion was analyzed under standard RON testing conditions at both peak knocking lambda and stoichiometric air-fuel ratios, whereas compression ignited operation was characterized by utilizing the HCCI number test protocol. Disparate knock limited SI and HCCI combustion behavior was observed for the test fuels, despite four of the fuels having the same RON and octane sensitivity. It was found that knock-limited combustion phasing in the GDI engine did not align well with the RON. However, a detailed comparison of knock-limited SI operation in the GDI and CFR engine revealed that a more appropriate effective RON based on a common knock intensity metric (MAPO) and stoichiometric air-fuel ratio resulted in comparable knock characterization between the two engine platforms. Furthermore, the critical intake air temperature and the critical compression ratio were proposed to characterize knock-limited SI operation, while the minimum intake air heating and compression ratio were used to define a fuel's autoignition propensity for compression ignition operation in the GDI and CFR engine, respectively. Finally, each fuel's characteristic compression ratio needed to obtain knock-limited SI (KLSI) and HCCI operation was used to calculate an effective multi-mode octane number (MM-ON) based on the primary reference fuel blends.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Characterization of commercial vehicles’ start-up operations from in-use data","Zhang, Chen; Miller, Eric; Kotz, Andrew; Kelly, Kenneth; Thornton, Matthew; Geller, Michael; Brezny, Rasto","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; commercial vehicle; cold start; in-use data; selective catalytic reduction; federal test procedure","Diesel engines produce disproportionate levels of emissions when the engine and after-treatment systems are operating at low temperatures. This situation arises most commonly when the vehicle is first started after overnight. To quantify emissions attributable to vehicle starts, a sizable collection of on-road commercial vehicle operating data is analyzed to identify start-up events and inspect associated emissions. Data was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Fleet DNA and from the Center for Environmental Research & Technology (CE-CERT). Included are 500 + diesel vehicles with more than 42,000 recorded days, drawn from 25 vocational categories across the United States. Analysis shows that vehicle behavior, in terms of engine cold- and warm-operation, starts per day, soak time, and warm-up duration, differs significantly between vehicle vocations. Also, weighting factors for cold- and hot-starts currently used in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Federal Test Procedure (FTP) for heavy-duty emissions certification accurately represent real-world operations. Although the FTP includes a comparable fraction of cold operation, the hot fraction is much shorter than real-world operation due to limited test duration. The investigation also revealed that real-world engines operate for a significant amount of time when the engine coolant is in the “hot-stabilized” region, but the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) temperature is below its effective operating temperature of 200 °C. Of the vehicles under investigation, almost 20% of their operational time is within this condition.

"Multilane Automated Driving With Optimal Control and Mixed-Integer Programming","Dollar, Robert Austin; Vahidi, Ardalan","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; decentralized control; intelligent vehicles; mathematical programming; motion planning; optimal control","Road vehicle lane changes often initiate traffic disturbances and can therefore impact road networks’ energy and time efficiency. Furthermore, unexpected changes in traffic conditions may also render lane changes counterproductive for the lane-changing vehicle. Vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity combined with anticipative control could address these challenges via improved lane change decisions by automated vehicles. In a move toward this objective, receding horizon control cast as a mixed-integer quadratic program is used to plan lane changing and acceleration in a coupled optimization. A long-term pacing module, based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle from optimal control theory, sets terminal and input references for receding horizon control to target a user’s expected travel time. To remove nonlinear vehicle dynamics from the receding horizon controller, lane change commands are passed to a pure pursuit steering module whose response is approximated by a second-order linear model. Here, comparison against a rule-based reactive algorithm in arterial and highway scenarios shows an 8.9%–13.7% reduction in energy consumption and a 5.2%–10.3% reduction in the travel time, along with navigational improvements.","IEEE","","Clemson Univ., SC (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Electric-Drive Vehicle Power Electronics Thermal Management: Current Status, Challenges, and Future Directions","Moreno, Gilberto; Narumanchi, Sreekant; Feng, Xuhui; Anschel, Paul; Myers, Steve; Keller, Phil","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; advanced cooling; electric drive vehicles; power electronics; thermal managment","Effective thermal management of traction-drive power electronics is critical to the advancement of electric-drive vehicles and is necessary for increasing power density and improving reliability. Replacing traditional silicon devices with more efficient, higher temperature, higher voltage, and higher frequency wide-bandgap (WBG) devices will enable increased power density but will result in higher device heat fluxes. Compact packaging of high-temperature WBG devices near low-temperature-rated components creates thermal management challenges that need to be addressed for future power-dense systems. This paper summarizes the thermal performance of on-road automotive power electronics thermal management systems and provides thermal performance and pumping-power metrics for select vehicles. Thermal analyses reveal that the package/conduction resistance dominates the total thermal resistance (for existing automotive systems). We model advanced packaging concepts and compare the results with existing packaging designs to quantify their thermal performance enhancements. Double-side-cooled configurations that do not use thermal interface materials are package concepts predicted to provide a low junction-to-fluid thermal resistance (compared to current packages). Dielectric-fluid-cooled concepts enable a redesign of the package to reduce the package resistance, can be implemented in single- and two-phase cooling approaches, and allow for cooling of passive components (e.g., capacitors) and bus bars.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To this aim, high spatial and temporal resolution optical diagnostics were applied in an optically accessible engine working in PFS mode for two fuels and two different durations of pilot injection at the time of spark: 210 µs and 330 µs for E30 (gasoline blended with ethanol by 30% volume fraction) and gasoline, respectively. In both conditions, early injections during the intake stroke were used to generate a well-mixed lean background. The results were compared to rich, stoichiometric and lean well-mixed combustion with different spark timings. In the PFS combustion process, it was possible to detect a non-spherical and highly wrinkled blue flame, coupled with yellow diffusive flames due to the combustion of rich zones near the spark plug. The initial flame spread for both PFS cases was faster compared to any of the well-mixed cases (lean, stoichiometric and rich), suggesting that the flame propagation for PFS is enhanced by both enrichment and enhanced local turbulence caused by the pilot injection. Different spray evolutions for the two pilot injection durations were found to strongly influence the flame kernel inception and propagation. PFS with pilot durations of 210 µs and 330 µs showed some differences in terms of shapes of the flame front and in terms of extension of diffusive flames. Yet, both cases were highly repeatable.</p>","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

Relatively little effort, however, has been dedicated to understanding representative ambient conditions a light-duty vehicle may experience. As such, the framework introduced in this article provides a means of quantifying ambient conditions specific to light-duty vehicle operation by incorporating both when and where vehicles are driven. The analysis presented expands the literature beyond solely focusing on temperature; distributions for humidity, solar irradiance, and air density are also included. A procedure is presented that calculates the ambient condition distributions for each metric by relating open-source data sets describing representative vehicle utilization and representative ambient conditions. While this study explores ambient conditions related to light-duty vehicle utilization, the framework may also be applied to separate vocations. Finally, the article concludes with an example use case of the ambient condition weighting process. A binning methodology is introduced that facilitates insight into vehicle energy consumption in response to ambient conditions at the national and local levels while minimizing the number of tests or simulations required.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Truck platooning in the U.S. national road network: A system-level modeling approach","Noruzoliaee, Mohamadhossein; Zou, Bo; Zhou, Yan (Joann)","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Truck platooning; Platoon formation time; Fuel saving; Effective road capacity; Multiclass network equilibrium; Spatially constrained multivariate clustering","Truck platooning enables a group of trucks to move close together, which helps reduce truck fuel use and increase effective road capacity. In this paper, a system-level equilibrium model is developed to characterize spontaneous truck platooning with coexistence of non-platooning vehicles in a network, by explicitly accounting for the interlocking relationship among platoon formation time, truck fuel saving, and increase in effective road capacity. To equilibrate the relationships, an algorithm is proposed which involves a diagonalization approach and a bush based algorithm to solve decomposed subproblems. The condition of proportionality is imposed to obtain unique traffic flows for each class of vehicles on road links. In addition, a spatially constrained multivariate clustering technique is employed to construct origin/destination zones that are smaller than the coarse Freight Analysis Framework (FAF) zones, while maintaining reasonable computational burden for network traffic assignment. Model implementation in the U.S. shows that platooning could lead to 7.9% fuel saving among platoonable trucks in 2025 and a comparable increase in effective capacity of platoonable road links, which would account for 60% of rural interstate roads. The fuel saving and road capacity improvement translate into an annual cost reduction of $\$$868 million for the U.S. intercity trucking sector and reduced road infrastructure investment needs worth $\$$4.8 billion. Extensive sensitivity analysis further reveals that fuel saving of platoonable trucks increases with platoon size but decreases with inter-truck distance in a platoon. Fuel saving potential suggests that priority should be given to rural rather than urban roads in deploying platooning technologies. As we expected, greater market penetration of platooning technologies means higher fuel saving and greater increase in effective road capacity.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This paper systematically studies the modeling approach for progressive failure simulation and short-circuit prediction. Hemispherical indentation experiments are conducted on a battery specimen containing 5 representative sandwich (RS) layers to examine the deformation and progressive failure behavior of battery components. Three different models, viz, a high-fidelity detailed model, an intermediate homogenized model and a fully homogenized model, are developed and employed to simulate the progressive failure in a multi-layer battery specimen. The simulation results obtained using the three models all correlate well with experimental phenomena, capturing the overall stress-strain response and ultimate failure of the battery structure. The numerical results can help us understand the failure behavior and the mechanism for mechanical abuse-induced short circuit in LIBs. The feasibility of the three models for use in progressive failure prediction is compared by analyzing the capability of the models in predicting the critical failure events, the computational efficiency of the models, and the feasibility to implement coupled mechanical-electrochemical-thermal simulations. The results of this work provide useful insights on practical choices for the modeling strategy and safety design of LIBs under mechanical abuse conditions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the advancement in technology and reduction in the cost of batteries, plug-in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly attractive options for improving energy efficiency and reducing air emissions of MHDVs. In this paper, we compared the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gases (GHGs) and criteria air pollutant emissions of MHD BEVs with their conventional diesel counterparts across weight classes and vocations. We expanded the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model to conduct the WTW analysis of MHDVs. The fuel economy for a wide range of MHDV weight classes and vocations, over various driving cycles, was evaluated using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic simulation software (Autonomie). The environmental impacts of MHD BEVs are sensitive to the source of electricity used to recharge their batteries. The WTW results show that MHD BEVs significantly improve environmental sustainability of MHDVs by providing deep reductions in WTW GHGs, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide emissions, compared to conventional diesel counterparts. Increasing shares of renewable and natural gas technologies in future national and regional electricity generation are expected to reduce WTW particulate matters and sulfur oxide emissions for further improvement of the environmental performance of MHD BEVs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Additionally, these techniques are designed for analyzing multivariate traffic data from radar-based highway sensors and camera-based intersection sensors recording turn movements and vehicle speed, in the Chattanooga Metropolitan Area, with the capability of (a) revealing multiscale mobility patterns using different levels of data aggregation (e.g., individual sensor for microscale, multiple sensors along a corridor for mesoscale, and a larger number of sensors across the region for macroscale visualization) at different intervals (e.g., 5-min intervals, time of day, full day, and day-of-the-week), and (b) exploring the spatial variation of multiple traffic-related variables (e.g., volumes, speeds, turn movements, and traffic light colors) provided by the sensors. We close with a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiscale and multivariate visualization techniques.

"A Framework for Characterizing the Initial Thermal Conditions of Light-Duty Vehicles in Response to Representative Utilization Patterns, Ambient Conditions, and Vehicle Technologies","Moniot, Matthew; Baker, Chad; Lustbader, Jason; Lee, Byungho; Fink, Justin; Agnew, Scott","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; cold start; dwell; energy consumption; fuel economy; hot start; light-duty vehicle; off-cycle; real-world; representative; thermal","It is widely understood that the thermal state of a light-duty vehicle at the beginning of a trip influences the vehicle performance throughout the drive cycle. Cold starts, or initial states with component temperatures near ambient conditions, are strongly correlated with reduced vehicle performance and energy efficiency and with increased emissions. Despite this understanding, there is little literature available that characterizes initial thermal states beyond empirical studies and simplified analyses of dwell times. We introduce a framework that considers vehicle activity patterns, including the previous drive event, duration of the previous dwell event, and relevant ambient conditions occurring during these events. Moreover, the framework allows for technologies to influence the prominence of cold starts and warm starts. An example application of the methodology using a powertrain model approach revealed the significance of all constituent factors: controlling for ambient conditions, the shortest dwell lengths corresponded to an average initial oil temperature of 70°C versus 23°C for the long dwell length simulations, and aggressive conditioning cycles corresponded to an average initial oil temperature of 51°C versus only 35°C for a short conditioning cycle. The coldest ambient conditions evaluated (-30°C to -10°C) produced a weighted initial oil temperature of 19°C versus 57°C for the warmest ambient conditions evaluated (30°C to 50°C). Finally, we introduce weighting factors that account for the real-world frequency of conditioning cycle and dwell length combinations. The procedure outlined may be useful for discovering real-world performance improvements associated with vehicle technologies, a topic of interest to both vehicle manufacturers and regulators.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Three-Dimensional CFD Investigation of Pre-Spark Heat Release in a Boosted SI Engine","Guo, Hengjie; Torelli, Roberto; Szybist, James; Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Low-temperature heat release (LTHR) in spark-ignited internal combustion engines is a critical step toward the occurrence of auto-ignition, which can lead to an undesirable phenomenon known as engine knock. As such, correct predictions of LTHR are of utmost importance to improve the understanding of knock and enable techniques aimed at controlling it. While LTHR is typically obscured by the deflagration following the spark ignition, extremely late ignition timings can lead to LTHR occurrence prior to the spark, i.e., pre-spark heat release (PSHR). In this research, PSHR in a boosted direct-injection SI engine was numerically investigated using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A hybrid approach was used, based on the G-equation model for representing the turbulent flame front and the multi-zone well-stirred reactor model for tracking the chemical reactions within the unburnt region. A recently developed best practice was also employed which keeps the well-stirred reactor model active throughout the entire simulation. This allowed for correct predictions of the previous cycle trapped residuals which have a considerable effect on the onset of LTHR. Multi-cycle simulations were conducted using Co-Optima alkylate and E30 fuels. The predicted in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate agreed well with the experimental data and served as validation for the CFD model. Following the initial validation, the dynamics of PSHR was discussed and a series of parameters of interest were assessed. First, the effect of exhaust valve temperature was investigated, qualitatively highlighting the importance of boundary conditions uncertainty. Further analyses were carried out on the effects of fuel properties, including laminar flame speed (LFS) and heat of vaporization (HOV). The results indicate that PSHR phasing is slightly advanced with lower LFS as more trapped unburnt fuel is made available for the next cycle. A similar trend was observed with lower HOV as less intense spray cooling led to higher mixture temperatures, i.e., higher mixture reactivity. Finally, a comparison of Co-Optima alkylate and E30 fuels was made using the pressure-temperature trajectory framework. It was shown that the differences between Co-Optima alkylate and E30 in PSHR tendency are correlated with both HOV and chemical effects.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"EGR Dilution and Fuel Property Effects on High-Efficiency Spark-Ignition Flames","Dal Forno Chuahy, Flavio; Splitter, Derek; Wissink, Martin; Boronat Colomer, Vicente","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Single cylinder engines; computational fluid dynamics; exhaust gas recirculation; spark ignition engines; combustion and combustion processes","Modern spark ignition internal combustion engines rely on fast combustion rates and high dilution to achieve high brake thermal efficiencies. To accomplish this, new engine designs have moved towards increased tumble ratios and stroke-to-bore ratios. Increased tumble ratios correlate positively with increases in turbulent kinetic energy and improved fuel and residual gas mixing, all of which favor faster and more efficient combustion. Longer stroke-to-bore ratios allow higher geometric compression ratios and use of late intake valve closing to control peak compression pressures and temperatures. The addition of dilution to improve efficiency is limited by the resulting increase in combustion instabilities manifested by cycle-to-cycle variability. A number of effects - preferential diffusion, turbulence-combustion interactions, stochastic flow patterns, laminar-turbulent flame kernel transitions, and relative length and velocity scales between flame and turbulence - are believed to be responsible for the increase in cycle-to-cycle variations, where their contributions are likely interlinked. Several studies have shown the influence of stochastic flow characteristics on the nature of combustion instabilities, such as velocity patterns on flame kernel formation and cycle-to-cycle variations in residual gas. However, few have focused on the specific effects of fuel properties. The objective of this work is to contrast the effects of dilution on propane stoichiometric combustion against gasoline. Dilution tolerance experiments were conducted in a purpose-built high stroke-to-bore ratio single cylinder engine with both gasoline and LPG. Three-dimensional full cycle computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations employing a level-set combustion approach and Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling was used to qualitatively assess the changes in length and velocity scales for turbulence and the flame. The experimental results showed that LPG can tolerate higher exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) dilution under a variety of conditions. Analysis of CFD simulations showed that propane flames are likely less sensitive to influences from the flow field due to less thickening of the flame and higher effective flame speeds.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This off-road hybrid engine system is expected to deliver 15-20% reduction in fuel consumption over current Tier 4 Final-based diesel engines and consists of a downsized heavy-duty diesel engine containing advanced combustion technologies, capable of elevated peak cylinder pressures and thermal efficiencies, exhaust waste heat recovery via SuperTurbo™ turbocompounding, and hybrid energy recovery through both mechanical (high speed flywheel) and electrical systems. The first year of this project focused on the definition of the hybrid elements using extensive dynamic system simulation over transient work cycles, with hybrid supervisory controls development focusing on energy recovery and transient load assist, in Caterpillar’s DYNASTY™ software environment. Three key off-road applications were the focus of the hybrid concept definition with an aim of understanding the system’s modular capability for the diverse off-road heavy-duty market. Core engine performance 1D and 3D simulations isolated the efficiency contributions from the downsized engine, turbocompounding, and in-cylinder thermal barrier coatings. A fuel consumption improvement range of 14 to 24% was predicted, resulting in successful project progression to the design and experimental validation phase. Furthermore, an overview of the experimental engine and hybrid system status concludes the discussion along with the multi-year project’s next steps.","SAE International","","Caterpillar Inc., Deerfield, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Dilute Combustion Control Using Spiking Neural Networks","Maldonado Puente, Bryan; Kaul, Brian; Schuman, Catherine; Young, Steven; Mitchell, Parker","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Dilute combustion with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in spark-ignition engines presents a cost-effective method for achieving higher levels of engine efficiency. At high levels of EGR, however, cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) of the combustion process is exacerbated by sporadic occurrences of misfires and partial burns. Previous studies have shown that temporal deterministic patterns emerge at such conditions and certain combustion cycles have a significant influence over future events. Due to the complexity of the combustion process and the nature of CCV, harnessing all the deterministic information for control purposes has remained challenging even with physics based 0-D, 1-D, and high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. In this study, we present a data-driven approach to optimize the combustion process by controlling CCV adjusting the cycle-to-cycle fuel injection quantity. Readily available data from in-cylinder pressure was used to train a spiking neural network (SNN) which learns the optimal way to manage fuel injection in order to reduce CCV while maintaining acceptable levels of fuel consumption. SNNs are particularly well suited for powertrain control applications due to their ability to be deployed on FPGA-based neuromorphic hardware which are small, inexpensive, and have a low power demand. The high-performance computing (HPC) resources of Oak Ridge National Laboratory were used to run an evolutionary-based training approach for choosing the best SNN configuration that minimizes the size of the network while achieving the desired goal. The neuromorphic hardware with the optimized SNN deployed was connected to the rapid prototyping engine control system for real-time control implementation and tested on a single cylinder version of a GM LNF 4-cylinder engine. The results show a significant reduction of CCV with a small percentage of additional fuel used to stabilize the charge.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

(ORCID:0000000235504423); Splitter, Derek A.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; octane sensitivity; octane index; low temperature heat release; knock; multimode; advanced compression ignition","The U.S. Department of Energy's Co-Optimization of Engines and Fuels (Co-Optima) initiative is pursuing higher efficiency engines on the basis of fuel properties, and in particular, using fuels that enable multimode combustion strategies that include both boosted spark ignited (SI) and advanced compression ignition (ACI) operation. Despite the fact that autoignition plays a central role in both, a limiting factor in boosted SI and a requirement for ACI, conventional autoignition metrics do not adequately describe fuel behavior under these combustion modes: research octane number (RON), motor octane number (MON), and antiknock index (AKI). The octane index (OI), which is an emerging autoignition metric, has gained significant acceptance as a superior autoignition metric to describe fuel performance under engine operating conditions that are outside of the thermodynamic pressure-temperature (PT) constraints of RON and MON tests. However, there are questions about whether OI is adequate for the unconventional fuels being investigated and developed within the Co-Optima initiative. In this experimental investigation, the performance of 19 different fuels are studied, including several with unconventional chemistries relative to petroleum-derived gasoline, across a range of PT trajectory conditions, including both boosted SI and ACI operating conditions. It is found that the fuels with unconventional chemistry perform in accordance with OI, while the largest deviations in performance can be attributed to high concentrations of aromatics and olefins, which are chemical families ubiquitous to petroleum-derived gasoline.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Multi-agent motion planning with sporadic communications for collision avoidance","Boardman, Beth Leigh; Harden, Troy Anthony; Martinez, Sonia","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Multi-Agent; Path Planning; Collision Avoidance; Motion Planning; Event-triggered","Here, a novel multi-vehicle motion planning and collision avoidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed. The algorithm aims to reduce the amount of onboard calculations and inter-agent communications needed for each vehicle to successfully navigate through an environment with static obstacles and reach their goals. To this end, each agent first calculates a path to the goal by means of an asymptotically optimal rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT*) with respect to the static obstacles. Then, other agents are treated as dynamic obstacles and potential collisions are determined by means of collision cones. Collision cones depend on the position and velocity from other agents and are grown conservatively between inter-agent communications. Based on the available information, each agent determines if a deconfliction maneuver is needed, if it can continue along its current path, or if communication is needed to make a decision about a conflict. With probability one, our algorithm guarantees that the agents keep from colliding with each other. Under an assumption on the existence of a solution for a vehicle to its goal, this algorithm also solves the planning problem with probability one. Simulations illustrate a group of agents successfully reaching their goal configurations and examine how the uncertainty affects the communication frequency of the multi-agent system.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We dissect our controller into two parts: 1. the unconnected mode, active when following a human-driven vehicle, and 2. the connected mode, active when following another automated vehicle equipped with connectivity. Probabilistic constraints balance safety considerations with inter-vehicle compactness, and vehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use of powertrain maps. Emergent highway traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway distributions from empirical traffic data. To study the impact of automation over a range of demands of free-flow to stop-and-go, we vary vehicle flux from low to high and vary automated vehicle penetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios, network capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as rush-hour traffic. We further find that with connected automated vehicles introduced, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume scenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for conventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles perform at a 10%-20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform at a 3%-9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering electric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic flow and reducing unnecessary braking, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with automated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10% more energy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

S.; Wood, Eric; Meintz, Andrew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; automated electric shuttles; in-route inductive charging; optimization; system planning; inductive power transfer (IPT)","In-route inductive charging technology, as applied to automated electric vehicles, can help realize a fully automated system of both vehicles and chargers. This study presents a planning optimization analysis for fixed-route automated shuttles supported by in-route inductive charging technology. A techno-economic feasibility of inductive charging was assessed in comparison with stationary charging, including Level 2 AC chargers, and DC fast chargers (DCFCs). This analysis considered both present-day and future vehicle operations and overall system costs. A real project with two circulator Navya Arma shared automated electric vehicles (SAEVs) at the University of Michigan was investigated using real-world collected energy and travel data. The outcomes show that the proper design of quasi-dynamic inductive chargers at designated stops allows SAEVs to realize unlimited driving range and be cost-competitive to DCFC technology. Considering present-day costs and vehicles, low-speed SAEVs can realize charge-sustaining operation at a minimum cost either by implementing a 50-kW inductive charger at two stops with one segment per position and a 29-kWh onboard battery, or by installing a 100-kW inductive charger at one stop with one segment per position and a 28-kWh onboard battery. Overall, considering future costs and vehicles, either a 40-kW charger at one stop with a 29-kWh battery or a 50-kW charger at the north stop with a 14-kWh battery would enable charge-sustaining operation. In addition, quasi-dynamic inductive solution can reduce the onboard battery by about 15% while providing unlimited driving range, but stationary scenarios require about 112% additional battery capacity to support a 12-h driving range.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Feasibility of Operating a Heavy-Duty Battery Electric Truck Fleet for Drayage Applications","Tanvir, Shams; Un-Noor, Fuad; Boriboonsomsin, Kanok; Gao, Zhiming","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Vehicle fleet electrification is regarded as one major pathway toward achieving energy independence and reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, electrification of heavy-duty vehicles, especially Class 8 trucks, is more challenging owing to the battery size required to attain the driving range necessary for their operating goals. As drayage trucks generally have a limited daily mileage, return to a home base every night, and spend a large amount of time creeping and idling, drayage operation has been the first targeted application for Class 8 electric trucks. The feasibility of operating battery electric drayage trucks at the individual vehicle level has recently been demonstrated. However, questions remain as to whether these trucks are capable of meeting the needs of typical drayage operation at the fleet level. Here we present a feasibility analysis of operating an electric truck fleet based on real-world operation data of a diesel drayage operator in Southern California. Second-by-second activity data collected from 20 trucks in the fleet were used to estimate the corresponding electric energy consumption and the state of charge of the battery using a microscopic electric energy consumption model. An algorithm for generating tours of drayage activity from the collected data was developed and implemented. Multiple scenarios with different battery charging and truck scheduling assumptions were analyzed. The results show that 85% of the tours could be served by electric trucks if there is opportunity for charging at the home base during the time gap between consecutive tours.","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper investigates the safety impact of CAVs in a mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections. Analyzing real-world AV crashes in California revealed that rear-end crashes at intersections are the dominant crash type. Therefore, to enhance our understanding of the future interactions between human-driven vehicles with CAVs at intersections, a simulation framework was developed to model the mixed traffic environment of Automated Vehicles (AV), cooperative AVs, and conventional human-driven vehicles. In order to model AVs driving behavior, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and cooperative ACC (CACC) models are utilized. Particularly, this study explores system improvements due to automation and connectivity across varying CAV market penetration scenarios. ACC and CACC car following models are used to mimic the behavior of AVs and cooperative AVs. Real-world connected vehicle data are utilized to modify and tune the acceleration/deceleration regimes of the Wiedemann model. Next, the driving volatility concept capturing variability in vehicle speeds was utilized to calibrate the simulation to represent the safety performance of a real-world environment. Two surrogate safety measures are used to evaluate the safety performance of a representative intersection under different market penetration rate of CAVs: the number of longitudinal conflicts and driving volatility. At low levels of ACC market penetration, the safety improvements were found to be marginal, but safety improved substantially with more than 40% ACC penetration. Additional safety improvements can be achieved more quickly through the addition of cooperation and connectivity through CACC. Furthermore, ACC/CACC vehicles were found to improve mobility performance in terms of average speed and travel time at intersections.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Optimal assignment for the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem","Cokyasar, Taner; Larson, Jeffrey","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Autonomous vehicle routing; Mixed-integer programming; Operational decision-making","Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported. While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities, such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled. In this study, we solve the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost-optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day. Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios. Here, we provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities. Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model, we present the model in a component-wise fashion. This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time. We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to find an optimal solution, and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people. We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve significantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real-time scheduling. We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators, who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost/tax scenarios.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Raising cell temperature is one approach to enable fast charge; the higher temperature facilitates charge migration and lowers electrode polarization limited by the rates of diffusion and interfacial transport. In this study we examine the behavior of cells subjected to constant current and pulse current charging, at rates from 1C to 8C in the 30 degrees C to 55 degrees C range. To demonstratesafecharge conditions that averts Li metal plating on the anode, we use a microprobe reference electrode to continuously monitor the electrode potentials during tests. We then adopt a state-of-the-art multiphase electrochemical model to extrapolate the anodereferencepotential to the anodesurfacepotential, which determines the overpotential for Li plating. For constant current charging, the results suggest that safe charging at 6C to 80% full capacity would be untenable for all but the thinnest electrodes. For pulse charging, thesafeconditions depend on cell voltage, temperature, and the rate/duration of the pulse. The ""safe lines"" established in this study can help define charging protocols that enable higher charge rates, while minimizing losses in cell performance over time.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Impact of Selected High-Performance Fuel Blends on Three-Way Catalyst Light Off under Synthetic Spark-Ignition Engine-Exhaust Conditions","Sinha Majumdar, Sreshtha; Pihl, Josh A.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Mixtures; Catalysts; Hydrocarbons; Aromatic compounds; Fossil fuels","The U.S. Department of Energy funded Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines initiative aims to simultaneously develop advanced engines along with high-performance fuels to reduce petroleum consumption. The engine exhaust of spark-ignited light-duty vehicles contains pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane organic gases. When operated above their “light-off” temperature, three-way catalysts (TWCs) efficiently control the emissions of these pollutants from the vehicle exhaust. However, below the catalyst light-off temperature, during cold start, the TWCs are not effective. Thus, the stringent environmental regulations necessitate cold-start compliance of advanced engines operating on novel fuels for commercialization. Exhaust composition strongly impacts the effectiveness of TWCs. Hence, ensuring that the high-performance fuels under consideration do not have detrimental effects on current emissions control technology is necessary. To mitigate cold-start emissions, a low light-off temperature of the fuel on the TWC is desirable. As real-world fuels are multicomponent blends, we conducted investigations into the light-off behavior of representative fuel mixtures on a three-mode redox-aged commercial TWC under synthetic engine-exhaust conditions. The high-performance fuels in this study included 10–30% volumetric levels of ethanol, isobutanol, diisobutylene, and an aromatic mixture. Each of these high-performance fuel components was mixed into a gasoline surrogate blendstock for oxygenate blending (BOB). Our results showed that aromatics and alkenes in the surrogate BOB inhibit low-temperature reactivity of alkanes, alcohols, and CO on the TWC and dominate the blend light-off behavior. All the high-performance fuel blends had a very similar light-off behavior to the surrogate gasoline BOB, indicating that blending up to 30% (by vol.) of high-performance blendstocks in a gasoline base fuel can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved engine efficiency and petroleum displacement without jeopardizing the ability to meet emissions regulations. While some high-performance blendstocks demonstrated lower light-off temperatures than a surrogate gasoline blend, taking advantage of the higher catalytic reactivity of these blendstocks to reduce cold-start emissions would require reducing the aromatic content in petroleum-based market fuels.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The iso-damping loop property is sought, which yields a desired closed-loop stability that results invariant despite changes on the controlled plant gain. In addition, the graphical nature of the proposed design approach demonstrates its portability and applicability to any type of vehicle dynamics without complex reconfiguration.

In this paper, a co-optimization scheme is proposed to optimize fuel efficiency for HEVs. Here, the proposed optimization scheme uses obtainable future speed prediction as the basis to optimally tune control parameters for the existing powertrain control system. The ramp-up time of the catalyst temperature to reach its light-off level in the exhaust emission system is also considered as an additional optimization constraint to reduce emission. The Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model which is an integrated model for a powertrain and exhaust emission system is validated using real data from several real driving cycle scenarios. Then, to simplify the formulation of the proposed algorithm, the model for the optimization for powertrain and exhaust emission systems is represented by a set of equivalent neural network (NN) models learned using the data generated from the well-validated Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model. Using NN models, a co-optimization algorithm is established that provides an optimal tuning of some fuel-sensitive powertrain control parameters using future speed prediction, leading to a novel co-optimization algorithm, achieving on average a further 9.22% fuel savings for the Toyota Prius Hybrid Simulink model.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

L.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel injection; gaseous jet; LES; outward opening injector; engine efficiency","Direct injection (DI) strategy of natural gas (NG) into internal combustion engines (ICE) has led to higher thermal efficiency and lower exhaust emissions. In order to thoroughly understand the most relevant phenomena affecting the performances of such engines, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays a key role as an accurate description of the jet evolution and interaction within the combustion chamber is required to that aim. Accurate description of high-pressure gaseous jets is rather challenging at high Mach numbers, as the injected gas is strongly under-expanded once in the ambient, giving room to shocks due to compressibility effects. Also the interaction between shock waves and mixing layers needs to be carefully represented with a multi-dimensional model, calling for substantial computational resources requirements. In this paper a numerical investigation of the behavior of a gaseous jet (Argon) through an outward opening injector has been carried out. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach has been used in order to track the structures derived by the interaction of the injected fuel with the surrounding ambient. Although already good results were obtained using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach, the adoption of LES is required to characterize more accurately the jet properties in terms of vortex structures and mixing effectiveness. Finally, the effect of the Nozzle Pressure Ratio (NPR) on the jet evolution has been highlighted in the paper, showing how a higher NPR would give a faster injection process, compromising however the homogeneity of the mixture.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Results of experiments based on national average travel data indicate that the actual WPC strategy varies by budget level. Through optimization, the strategy could reduce impacts of the varied electricity price by shifting charging schedules to periods when electricity prices are low. Also, the model is expanded to study the trade-off between providing WPC and addressing consequence of degraded charging service by including the per-mile shadow cost of unsatisfied charging demand.

A number of studies have examined opportunities to increase efficiency in future vehicles, but potential impacts on the legacy fleet have not received as much attention. In this study, our effort focused on experimental studies on an engine using high-octane fuels without changing the engine’s CR. Spark timing was advanced until maximum torque was reached or knock was encountered for each engine condition, using each individual fuel to maximize engine efficiency. Knock-limited conditions occurred as the output brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) neared the maximum attainable output at a given engine speed. Increasing research octane numbers generally enabled knock-free operation under a greater number of operating conditions. Vehicle modeling using Autonomie was used to project vehicle energy use, fuel economy, and tailpipe CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET), and the US06 cycle. Results show that decreases in energy consumption of up to 2% for a small SUV are possible through the use of a 97 RON fuel compared to a baseline using 91 RON fuel, provided that the formulation of the fuel does not cause unanticipated operational issues such as lower maximum BMEP. Greater improvements using high-octane fuels are possible if the CR is increased, but there is no opportunity to increase the CR in legacy vehicles. Thus, these vehicles realize an improvement from increased octane rating in accordance with their ability to spark advance to take advantage of a fuel with a higher octane rating. For the modeled vehicle, improvements of up to 2% in volumetric fuel economy may be possible through the use of a 97 RON fuel with the largest gains expected on the US06 cycle. Fuel economy impacts are strongly coupled to the heating value of the fuels in addition to changes in engine efficiency. Similarly, decreases in tailpipe CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are also achievable. However, simultaneous improvements in energy consumption, fuel economy, and tailpipe CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not guaranteed and are dependent upon fuel formulation.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In addition, EV can hardly represent a green option if its electricity primarily depends on fossil energy. Considering these two problems, this paper studies a battery swapping-charging system based on wind farms (hereinafter referred to as W-BSCS). In a W-BSCS, the wind farms not only supply electricity to the power grid but also cooperate with a centralized charge station (CCS), which can centrally charge EV batteries and then distribute them to multiple battery swapping stations (BSSs). The operational framework of the W-BSCS is analyzed, and some preprocessing technologies are developed to reduce complexity in modeling. Then, a joint optimal scheduling model involving a wind power generation plan, battery swapping demand, battery charging and discharging, and a vehicle routing problem (VRP) is established. Then a heuristic method based on the exhaustive search and the Genetic Algorithm is employed to solve the formulated NP-hard problem. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the joint optimal scheduling model, and they also show that the W-BSCS has great potential to promote EVs and wind power.","Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering (CSEE)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficient proactive vehicle relocation for on-demand mobility service with recurrent neural networks","Lei, Zengxiang; Qian, Xinwu; Ukkusuri, Satish V.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Proactive relocation; Vehicle dispatching; Optimal matching; Stable matching; Deep neural network","One major challenge for on-demand mobility service (OMS) providers is to seamlessly match empty vehicles with trip requests so that the total vacant mileage is minimized. In this work, we develop an innovative data-driven approach for devising efficient vehicle relocation policy for OMS that (1) proactively relocates vehicles before the demand is observed and (2) reduces the inequality among drivers' income so that the proactive relocation policy is fair and is likely to be followed by drivers. Our approach represents the fusion of optimization and machine learning methods, which comprises three steps: First, we formulate the optimal proactive relocation as an optimal/stable matching problems and solve for global optimal solutions based on historical data. Second, the optimal solutions are then grouped and fed to train the deep learning models which consist of fully connected layers and long short-term memory networks. Low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the model complexity and improve the training performances. Finally, we use the trained model to predict the relocation policy which can be implemented in real time. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method using New York City taxi data. Here, the results suggest that our method will reduce empty mileage per trip by 54-70% under optimal matching strategy, and a 25-32% reduction can also be achieved by following stable matching strategy. We also validate that the predicted relocation policies are robust in the presence of uncertain passenger demand level and passenger trip-requesting behavior.","Elsevier","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-07-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 102678","","","EE0008524","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X","10.1016/j.trc.2020.102678","","2021-07-08T00:00:00Z","1644033","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1644033","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1644033","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","C","117"
"Range cost-effectiveness of plug-in electric vehicle for heterogeneous consumers: An expanded total ownership cost approach","Hao, Xu; Lin, Zhenhong; Wang, Hewu; Ou, Shiqi; Ouyang, Minggao","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Total ownership cost; Monte Carlo simulation; Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV); Consumer heterogeneity; Range anxiety","Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) appears to have sales momentum in major personal vehicle markets but are still at the early market stage. Opportunities to accelerate PEV adoption can be discovered through comprehensive total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis. Understanding the cost-effective electric ranges of PEVs for consumers, manufacturers, and the society is critical for any discussion of PEV mass markets. This study expanded the traditional TCO approach by (1) fully considering heterogeneous consumer driving patterns, (2) quantifying the charging inconvenience and range anxiety cost of battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), and (3) monetizing both tangible and intangible PEV policies. Uncertainties were handled through Monte Carlo simulation. The results suggest that BEVs with an electric range of 250–350 km have the lowest TCO in cities with government-enacted purchase limitations, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) have the lowest TCO in cities without purchase limitations, even when considering PEV subsidies. The lowest TCO for some consumer groups is obtained by BEVs with an electric range of 400–450 km, especially in northern China, where the weather is colder. The cost-effective all-electric range for BEVs in each city in 2025 will decrease due to improved battery performance in cold environments and an expanded charging infrastructure. Finally, based on TCO, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are currently more suitable for drivers with a high average daily mileage or a large mileage variance. However, by 2025, BEVs with a long driving range may become a more cost-effective choice for these drivers.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper provides a detailed assessment of the current (2019) levelized cost of light-duty EV charging in the United States, considering the purchase and installation costs of charging equipment and electricity prices from real-world utility tariffs. We find national averages of $0.15/kWh for battery EVs and $0.14/kWh for plug-in hybrid EVs in the United States. Costs, however, vary considerably (e.g., $0.08/kWh to $0.27/kWh for battery EVs) for different charging behaviors and equipment costs, corresponding to a total projected fuel cost savings between $3,000 and $10,500 compared with gasoline vehicles (over a 15-year time horizon).

This study attempts to discover the common vehicle pricing patterns in the Chinese market by quantifying statistical correlations among critical vehicle features from intrinsic powertrain systems to extrinsic market positioning. The data samples involve almost all passenger vehicle models sold in 2013 to 2019. After comparing multiple statistical methodologies, a log-transformation variant of the multinomial linear regression model was found to be the best one, and the goodness of fit shows that this model can offer stable estimates, which were validated using 2019 market data. The insights achieved are: (1) The price and major performance features of SUVs/crossovers are similar to those of sedans; (2) If all other explicit features remain the same, the price of a Japanese midsize sedan is 62% higher than that of a Chinese midsize sedan, and European midsize vehicles have the highest prices overall. (3) The incremental price of fuel consumption varies by vehicle class and fuel economy. For example, from 30 to 50 MPG, the vehicle price increases by $119 for a Chinese brand sedan vehicle, by $69 for a Chinese brand SUV.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This elucidates how LiB performance is markedly affected by microstructural heterogeneities, particularly under high rate conditions. The elongated shape and wide size distribution of the active particles not only affect the lithium-ion transport but also lead to a heterogeneous current distribution and non-uniform lithiation between particles and along the through-thickness direction. Building on these insights, we propose and compare potential graded-microstructure designs for next-generation battery electrodes. To guide manufacturing of electrode architectures, in-situ X-ray CT is shown to reliably reveal the porosity and tortuosity changes with incremental calendering steps.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, two online methods are used to provide real time system identification of ACC enabled vehicles. The first technique is a recursive least squares (RLS) approach, while the second method solves a nonlinear joint state and parameter estimation problem via particle filtering (PF). We provide a parameter identifiability analysis for both methods to analytically show that the model parameters are not identifiable using equilibrium driving. The accuracy and computational runtime of the online methods are compared to a commonly used offline simulation-based optimization (i.e., batch optimization) approach. The methods are tested on synthetic data as well as on empirical data collected directly from a 2019 model year ACC vehicle using data from sensors that are part of the stock ACC system. The online methods are scalable and provide comparable accuracy to the batch method. RLS runs in real time and is two orders of magnitude faster than the batch method for modest sized (e.g., 15 min) datasets. The particle filter also runs in real- time, and is also suitable in streaming applications in which the datasets can grow arbitrarily large.","IEEE","","Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Quantifying the impacts of micro- and mild- hybrid vehicle technologies on fleetwide fuel economy and electrification","Ou, Shiqi; Gohlke, David; Lin, Zhenhong","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Hybrid electric vehicle; Micro hybridization; Fuel economy; Vehicle market penetration; Discrete choice model","Micro- and mild-hybridization (jointly labeled as M-HEV) is gaining popularity as a cost-effective technology for fuel economy improvement, but whether and how M-HEV may compete against less efficient conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV), more efficient full hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) is not well understood. As such, this study aims at evaluating the impact of the market adoption of M-HEV on the average fuel economy of the new vehicle fleet and on the sales share of PEVs. The study reviews recent sales trends and market forecasts, and uses published estimates of manufacturing cost and fuel economy of M-HEV with an existing discrete choice model (Market Acceptance of Advanced Automotive Technologies or MA3T) to project the market penetration and impacts of M-HEV under different scenarios of M-HEV choice positions, designed to enhance conclusion robustness. It is found that among engine-based powertrain choices, micro-HEV appears to be the most cost-effective, followed by ICEVs, mild-HEV and finally full HEVs. M-HEV technologies are likely to improve fleetwide average fuel economy without significant adverse effects on sales of plug-in electric vehicles, and are likely to remain highly competitive outside PEVs through 2050.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The results show that the achievable reliability performances differ significantly with the path loss models considered. For a moderate communication distance between a transmitter and a receiver, with established deterministic and stochastic path loss models, the network-level reliability is around 55%, whereas with the realistic path loss models that consider obstacles and traffic, the reliability falls below 30%. To improve the network- and application-level reliabilities, we propose a feedbackless relaying mechanism that can be deployed on top of IEEE 802.11p, where, the relay vehicle selection is done autonomously.

Diagnostics included high-frequency chamber pressure measurements, chemiluminescence imaging of the combustor annulus (aft looking forward), and particle image velocimetry measurements at the exit plane of the engine and tangent to the center body. Detonation surface plots are created from chemiluminescence images and allow for the extraction of properties such as dominant mode frequencies and wave number, speed, and direction. Dynamic mode decomposition is also applied to the chemiluminescence images to isolate various spatial modes within each test. Singular-spectrum analysis is used to isolate modes corresponding to the detonation frequency in the signals of velocity components obtained from particle image velocimetry, maintaining instantaneous phase information. Results from a case with a primary mode corresponding to a single wave rotating clockwise with a minor wave rotating counterclockwise are presented. Results from a case with two detonation waves rotating clockwise in the combustor annulus are also presented. Furthermore, the dominant chamber frequency for the case with two co-rotating waves in the chamber is found to be 3.46 kHz, corresponding to two individual waves traversing the annular combustion chamber at average speeds of 68% of the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Dynamic mode decomposition indicates the presence of two major detonation waves rotating clockwise and periodically intersecting with two minor, counterclockwise rotating waves in the annulus during operation. Axial and azimuthal components of velocity from this case are observed to remain nearly in phase and are determined to correspond to the two minor, counterclockwise rotating waves.","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)","","Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc., Canoga Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 498-507","","","FE0023983","Journal ID: ISSN 1533-3876; DOE-AR-3983-5","10.2514/1.b37740","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1817706","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1817706","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1817706","Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online)","4","36"

Here, we develop the concept of a prototype CAV-enabled LCS application and provides a preliminary assessment of the potential improvement it offers over traditional LCS. Real-world data obtained from an LCS on I-66 in Northern Virginia was used to calibrate and validate a baseline simulation model. Further, the current lane control scenarios utilized in the Northern Virginia LCS were identified and relevant data resulting from implementation of those scenarios were collected to model the LCS in a simulation environment. The performance of real-world LCS was then compared to a prototype CAV-enabled LCS application developed in this research. The CAV-enabled LCS application consistently outperformed the traditional LCS with increased throughput and speeds. On average, an increase of 18.4%, 9.6% and 12.8% in throughput was observed for three selected scenarios under the best case of a 1 sec headway. Furthermore, the CAV-enabled LCS application was also found to reduce volatility, represented by variation in acceleration and deceleration regimes, by an average of 25.6% and 49.6%.

It is demonstrated that coating the catalyst layer with a thin layer of ionomer and then hot pressing the GDEs to the membrane is required to achieve comparable catalyst activity and air performance to catalyst-coated-membrane MEAs. We show that there is a critical amount of ionomer required to achieve maximized performance. Using electron microscopy, we show that the combination of the ionomer overlayer and hot-pressing bonds the catalyst layer to the membrane, increasing the interfacial contact area and quality of this interface. We also find that the ionomer overlayer smooths the surface of the GDE and provides increased contact area between the GDE and the membrane. Additionally, we demonstrate that much less ionomer is required for high-performance than has been previously reported. Through model fitting of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we show that this improvement in the catalyst layer - membrane interface reduces the effective catalyst layer resistance, which reduces Ohmic losses and increases catalyst utilization.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

NTP systems are being revisited, with expectations of improved performance resulting from improved fuel materials, allowing propellant temperatures near 2,800 K and over 20 thermal propulsion cycles.

An identification algorithm which can accurately extract individual EV charging profiles out of widely available smart meter measurements has attracted great interests. This paper proposes a non-intrusive identification framework for EV charging profile extraction, which is driven by deep generative models (DGM). First, the proposed DGM is designed as a representation layer embedded into the Markov process and used to model the joint probability distribution of available time-series data. A novel contribution is to approximate posterior distributions by neural networks whose parameters are obtained by variational inference and supervised learning. Second, the EV charging status is inferred from the DGM via dynamic programming. Lastly, the desired EV charging profile can be reconstructed by the rated power of EV models and inferred status. Compared with the benchmark Hidden Markov Models, the proposed framework can better handle noise in data with less computational complexity and better overall accuracy performances with smaller recall. The proposed framework is validated by numerical experiments on the Pecan Street dataset.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"The use of partial fuel stratification to enable stable ultra-lean deflagration-based Spark-Ignition engine operation with controlled end-gas autoignition of gasoline and E85","Hu, Zongjie; Zhang, Junjie; Sjöberg, Magnus; Zeng, Wei","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Lean Spark-Ignition engine operation; controlled end-gas autoignition; partial fuel stratification; alternative fuels; high efficiency","Lean operation of Spark-Ignition engines can provide higher thermal efficiency compared to standard stoichiometric operation. However, for a homogeneous lean mixture, the associated reduction of flame speeds becomes an important issue from the perspective of robust ignition and fast flame spread throughout the charge. This study is focused on the use of a lean partial fuel stratification strategy that can stabilize the deflagration, while sufficiently fast combustion is ensured via the use of end-gas autoignition. The engine has a spray-guided Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition combustion system and was fueled with either a high-octane certification gasoline or E85. Partial fuel stratification was achieved using several fuel injections during the intake stroke in combination with a small pilot-injection concurrent with the Spark-Ignition. The results reveal that partial fuel stratification enables very stable combustion, offering higher thermal efficiency for parts of the load range in comparison to well-mixed lean and stoichiometric combustion. The heat release and flame imaging demonstrate that the combustion often has three distinct stages. The combustion of the pilot-injected fuel, ignited by the normal spark, acts as a “super igniter,” ensuring a very repeatable initiation of combustion, and flame incandescence reveals locally rich conditions. The second stage is mainly composed of blue flame propagation in a well-mixed lean mixture. The third stage is the compression autoignition of a well-mixed and typically very lean end-gas. The end-gas autoignition is critical for achieving high combustion efficiency, high thermal efficiency, and stable combustion. Partial fuel stratification enables very effective combustion-phasing control, which is critical for controlling the occurrence and intensity of end-gas autoignition. Finally, comparing the gasoline and E85 fuels, it is noted that achieving end-gas autoignition for the higher octane E85 requires a more aggressive compression of the end-gas via the use of a more advanced combustion phasing or higher intake-air temperature.","SAGE","","Sandia National Lab.

"Performance of Vehicle Fuel System Elastomers and Plastics with Test Fuels Representing Gasoline Blended with 10% Ethanol (E10) and 16% Isobutanol (iBu16)","Kass, Michael; Janke, Christopher; Connatser, Raynella M.; Lewis, Samuel; Baustian, James; Wolf, Les; Koch, Wolf","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; plastic; elastomer; compatibility; ethanol; isobutanol; volume; hardness","The compatibilities of fuel system elastomers and plastics were evaluated for test fuels containing 16 vol.% isobutanol (iBu16) and 10 vol.% ethanol (E10). Elastomers included two fluorocarbons, four acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers (NBRs), and one type of fluorosilicone, neoprene, and epichlorohydrin/ethylene oxide. Plastic materials included four nylon grades, three polyamides, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyoxymethylene (POM), flexible polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyetherimide (PEI), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and a phenol formaldehyde reinforced with glass fiber (GFPF). For each polymer material, the volume, mass, and hardness were measured before and after drying. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements were also performed on the dried specimens.For the elastomer materials the measured properties were similar for both fuels. The fluorocarbons and fluorosilicone swelled the least (~20%), while more moderate (20-45%) expansion occurred for the two NBR hose grades and (ECO). HNBR, neoprene, and silicone exhibited high swelling and softening, which likely precludes their use in many fuel systems. For the plastic materials, the observed swell was low; Nylon 11 swelled around 15%, but otherwise, their measured swell was <10%. Many of the plastics also showed sensitivity to alcohol type, as the E10 test fuel often imparted appreciably higher swell than iBu16. In general, the plastic materials showed good compatibility with the iBu16 and E10 test fuels. Here, the sole exception was the PVC material, which was structurally degraded from exposure to either fuel type. Compositional analysis showed high fuel retention in Nylon 12 and PVC. PVC also experienced a significant reduction in plasticizer compounds following exposure, which resulted in embrittlement and an increase in the glass-to-rubber transition temperature.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the production, transportation, and refueling of hydrogen are more energy- and emissions-intensive compared to gasoline. In this research, a well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and emissions analysis was conducted to compare a HFCEV (Toyota Mirai) with a gasoline conventional ICEV (Mazda 3). Two sets of specific fuel consumption data were used for each vehicle: (1) fuel consumption derived from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) window-sticker fuel economy figure, and (2) weight-averaged fuel consumption based on physical vehicle testing with a chassis dynamometer on EPA's five standard driving cycles. The WTW results show that a HFCEV, even fueled by hydrogen from a fossil-based production pathway (via steam methane reforming of natural gas), uses 5%–33% less WTW fossil energy and has 15%–45% lower WTW greenhouse gas emissions compared to a gasoline conventional ICEV. The WTW results are sensitive to the source of electricity used for hydrogen compression or liquefaction.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Evaluating national hydrogen refueling infrastructure requirement and economic competitiveness of fuel cell electric long-haul trucks","Liu, Nawei; Xie, Fei; Lin, Zhenhong; Jin, Mingzhou","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel cell electric truck; long-haul heavy-duty truck; hydrogen refueling infrastructure; Freight Analysis Framework; ownership cost","This study explored the national hydrogen refueling infrastructure requirement along major United States (US) interstate highway corridors to support the deployment of fuel cell electric trucks (FCETs) for the national long-haul trucking fleet. Given the long-haul trucking shipment demand in 2025 projected by the Freight Analysis Framework, locations and capacities of hydrogen stations were identified for inter-zone freight flows, and the total daily refueling demand was estimated for intra-zone flows for each FAF zone. Based on the infrastructure deployment results, we conducted an economic feasibility analysis of FCETs by evaluating the total ownership cost. We found that when the FCET penetration is relatively high (e.g., 10% penetration), FCETs become more competitive in terms of fuel cost and idling cost and could be economic viable if the incremental vehicle cost is reduced to meet the near-term FCET technology cost targets and the liquefaction cost is reduced to an optimal case. We also observed that the station cost depends on regional factors, particularly regional demand, which is used to determine station capacity. Thus, one possible strategy for station roll-out is to have early investment in target regions where station costs are expected to be relatively low such as the Pacific and West South Central regions.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To achieve maximum mobility and minimum energy consumption, it is critical to understand the energy cost of decisions and optimize accordingly. The Route Energy prediction model (RouteE) enables accurate estimation of energy consumption for a variety of vehicle types over trips or sub-trips where detailed drive cycle data are unavailable. Applications include vehicle route selection, energy accounting and optimization in transportation simulation, and corridor energy analyses, among others. The software is a Python package that includes a variety of pre-trained models from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). However, RouteE also enables users to train custom models using their own data sets, making it a robust and valuable tool for both fast calculations and rigorous, data-rich research efforts. The pre-trained RouteE models are established using NREL’s Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulator paired with approximately 1 million miles of drive cycle data from the Transportation Secure Data Center, resulting in energy consumption behavior estimates over a representative sample of driving conditions for the United States. Validations have been performed using on-road fuel consumption data for conventional and electrified vehicle powertrains. Transferring the results of the on-road validation to a larger set of real-world origin-destination pairs, it is estimated that implementing the present methodology in a green-routing application would accurately select the route that consumes the least fuel 90% of the time. The novel machine learning techniques used in RouteE make it a flexible and robust tool for a variety of transportation applications.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work is motivated by the potential of connected/automated vehicle technologies to reduce fuel consumption in both urban/suburban and highway scenarios. The authors begin by presenting a hierarchical model-predictive control scheme that optimizes multiple chassis and powertrain functionalities for fuel consumption. These functionalities include: vehicle routing, arrival/departure at signalized intersections, speed trajectory optimization, platooning, predictive optimal gear shifting, and engine demand torque shaping. The primary optimization goal is to minimize fuel consumption, but the hierarchical controller explicitly accounts for other key objectives/constraints, including operator comfort and safe inter-vehicle spacing. This work is experimentally experimentally validated via a sequence of EIL studies intended for evaluating the computational costs and fuel savings associated with these algorithms. These EIL studies involve the closed-loop validation of the proposed control strategies, both individually and combined. These studies show that this hierarchy of algorithms is capable of running online, with the round-trip communication delay inherent in EIL simulation being one of the key factors affecting the EIL results. Moreover, the EIL studies are encouraging, both in terms of the successful hierarchical integration of the underlying algorithms and also in the resulting fuel savings seen in the EIL tests. In particular, the EIL results suggest that an aggressive overall goal of reducing vehicle fuel consumption by 15-20% or more is potentially achievable, especially in urban/suburban scenarios.","SAE International","","Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD (United States); Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series; Journal Volume: 1; Conference: WCX SAE World Congress Experience, (Held Virtually), 2020","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 2020-01-0592","","","AR0000801","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-7191","10.4271/2020-01-0592","","2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","1592480","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1592480","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1592480","Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series","","1"

Range anxiety is exacerbated when drivers could not reliably predict the remaining battery range or when their journeys were unexpectedly extended. This paper quantifies the impact of reliable range estimation on BEV feasibility using GPS-tracked travel survey data, collected over an 18-month period (from November 2004 to April 2006) in the Seattle metropolitan area. BEV feasibility is quantified as the number of days when travel adaption is needed if a driver replaces a conventional gasoline vehicle (CGV) with a BEV. The distribution of BEV range is estimated based on the real-world fuel efficiency data. A driver is assumed to choose between using a BEV or a substitute gasoline vehicle, based on the cumulative prospect theory (CPT). BEV is considered feasible for a particular driver if he/she needs to use a substitute vehicle on less than 0.5% of the travel days. By varying the values of some CPT parameter, the percentage of BEV feasible vehicles could change from less than 5% to 25%. Additionally, the numerical results show that with a 50% reduction in the standard deviation and 50% increase in the mean of the BEV range distribution BEV feasibility increases from less than 5% of the sampled drivers to 30%.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We propose a mixed integer programming model to optimally coordinate the charging/discharging of AEVs with DDNR, while satisfying AEVs' original travel plan. Numerical studies based on a test system overlaying the IEEE 33-node test feeder and Sioux Falls transportation network show that DDNR and AEV complement each other, which improves the operation of the distribution system.

"Innovative scenarios for modeling intra-city freight delivery","Moore, Amy M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","There has been a shift in the focus of freight modeling to the short-haul (or last-mile) due to an increase in online shopping. This study considers innovative freight delivery modes and multi-modal shifts, especially for the last-mile portion of intra-city freight delivery. For this study, GPS data were obtained from a truck fleet from a major parcel delivery company's depot near Columbus, Ohio and used to develop a freight delivery demand estimation model. Freight delivery tours were modeled in TransCAD and used to develop scenarios to incorporate various modal shifts to compare energy usage in kilowatt-hour estimates. Innovative modes of freight delivery were considered for the scenarios and were compared to a class six truck: electric class six trucks, electric delivery vans, parcel delivery lockers, drones, and electric passenger vehicles. Initial findings suggest that electric trucks reduce energy usage when the majority of miles traveled are in the long-haul, or stem portion of the route.

"Optimized Integration of Electric Vehicles in Low Voltage Distribution Grids","Spitzer, Martin; Schlund, Jonas; Apostolaki-Iosifidou, Elpiniki; Pruckner, Marco","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; electric vehicles; optimization; grid model; grid integration; coordinated charging","All over the world the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the transportation sector, becomes more and more important. Electric vehicles will be one of the key factors to mitigate GHG emissions due to their higher efficiency in contrast to internal combustion engine vehicles. On the other hand, uncoordinated charging will put more strain on electrical distribution grids and possible congestions in the grid become more likely. In this paper, we analyze the impact of uncoordinated charging, as well as optimization-based coordination strategies on the voltage stability and phase unbalances of a representative European semi-urban low voltage grid. Therefore, we model the low voltage grid as a three-phase system and take realistic arrival and departure times of the electric vehicle fleet into account. Subsequently, we compare different coordinated charging strategies with regard to their optimization objectives, e.g., cost reduction or GHG emissions reduction. Results show that possible congestion problems can be solved by coordinated charging. Additionally, depending on the objective, the costs can be reduced by more than 50% and the GHG emissions by around 40%.","MDPI AG","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 4059","","","AC02-76SF00515","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; TRN: US2104295","10.3390/en12214059","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","1604573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1604573","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1604573","Energies","21","12"
"Challenges of Fast Charging for Electric Vehicles and the Role of Red Phosphorous as Anode Material: Review","Zhao, Hong; Wang, Li; Chen, Zonghai; He, Xiangming","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; electric vehicles; electrode materials; fast-charging; infrastructure; li-ion batteries","<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are being endorsed as the uppermost successor to fuel-powered cars, with timetables for banning the sale of petrol-fueled vehicles announced in many countries. However, the range and charging times of EVs are still considerable concerns. Fast charging could be a solution to consumers’ range anxiety and the acceptance of EVs. Nevertheless, it is a complicated and systematized challenge to realize the fast charging of EVs because it includes the coordinated development of battery cells, including electrode materials, EV battery power systems, charging piles, electric grids, etc. This paper aims to serve as an analysis for the development of fast-charging technology, with a discussion of the current situation, constraints and development direction of EV fast-charging technologies from the macroscale and microscale perspectives of fast-charging challenges. If the problem of fast-charging can be solved, it will satisfy consumers’ demand for 10-min charging and accelerate the development of electric vehicles. This paper summarized the development statuses, issues, and trends of the macro battery technology and micro battery technology. It is emphasized that to essentially solve the problem of fast charging, the development of new battery materials, especially anode materials with improved lithium ion diffusion coefficients, is the key. Finally, it is highlighted that red phosphorus is one of the most promising anodes that can simultaneously satisfy the double standards of high-energy density and fast-charging performance to a maximum degree.</p>","MDPI AG","","Argonne National Lab.

"Intensity and daily pattern of passenger vehicle use by region and class in China: estimation and implications for energy use and electrification","Ou, Shawn; Yu, Rujie; Lin, Zhenhong; Ren, Huanhuan; He, Xin; Przesmitzki, Steven V.; Bouchard, Jessey","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; vehicle kilometers traveled; daily commuting distance; vehicle-use intensity; China's vehicle market; utility factor","Given the explosive growth of the passenger vehicle market and energy demands in China, research on vehicle-use intensity and driver-travel patterns is critical for better assessing travel demand and its implications for alternative fuel vehicles, energy security, and environmental policies. This study attempts to estimate annual vehicle kilometers traveled (AVKT) per privately-owned passenger vehicle and their daily distance patterns by vehicle class and geographic region. The data sample from a survey consists of 169,292 privately owned passenger vehicles, made by 177 car manufacturers during 2003–2018, running in 82 cities from 27 provincial regions. The log-transformed average AVKT is estimated to be 12,377 km with 95% probability ranging from 5490 to 28,579 km. The investigation reveals that vehicles from South China have the highest AVKT at 13,320 km. Generally, vehicles in small cities have higher AVKT than in big cities, except AVKT of tier 1 cities being higher. Another trend is that more expensive or larger vehicles tend to be driven more. A model is fitted for estimating AVKT based on region, city type, automaker, price range, and certain vehicle features including class and age. Data of daily commuting distances in recent years are also analyzed. The average daily commuting distances typically range from 21 to 28 km. Using the validated Gamma distribution method, daily distance distributions are specified for different regions. It is found that 99% of the daily driving distance is no more than 88.0–112.0 km, depending on region. Utility factors of plug-in electric vehicles are also estimated to be much higher than those based on driving data in the USA. Finally, these findings suggest global mitigations strategies on vehicle fuel use, electrification, and greenhouse gases should consider vehicle-use intensity at the regional level.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Risk Assessment of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles in Tunnels","Ehrhart, Brian David; Brooks, Dusty Marie; Muna, Alice Baca; LaFleur, Chris Bensdotter","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Hydrogen; Risk; Fuel cell electric vehicle; Event sequence diagram","The need to understand the risks and implications of traffic incidents involving hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in tunnels is increasing in importance with higher numbers of these vehicles being deployed. A risk analysis was performed to capture potential scenarios that could occur in the event of a crash and provide a quantitative calculation for the probability of each scenario occurring, with a qualitative categorization of possible consequences. The risk analysis was structured using an event sequence diagram with probability distributions on each event in the tree and random sampling was used to estimate resulting probability distributions for each end-state scenario. Here, the most likely consequence of a crash is no additional hazard from the hydrogen fuel (98.1–99.9% probability) beyond the existing hazards in a vehicle crash, although some factors need additional data and study to validate. These scenarios include minor crashes with no release or ignition of hydrogen. When the hydrogen does ignite, it is most likely a jet flame from the pressure relief device release due to a hydrocarbon fire (0.03–1.8% probability). This work represents a detailed assessment of the state-of-knowledge of the likelihood associated with various vehicle crash scenarios. This is used in an event sequence framework with uncertainty propagation to estimate uncertainty around the probability of each scenario occurring.","Springer","","Sandia National Lab.

However, recently, the reputation of IC engines has been dealt a severe blow by emission scandals that threaten the ability of this technology to make significant and further contributions to the reduction of transportation sector emissions.

"Exploring microscopic driving volatility in naturalistic driving environment prior to involvement in safety critical events—Concept of event-based driving volatility","Wali, Behram; Khattak, Asad J.; Karnowski, Thomas","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Naturalistic driving studies; Event-based volatility; Vehicular jerk; Crash; Near-crash; Crash propensity; Crash risk; Fixed and random parameters; Logit models","The sequence of instantaneous driving decisions and its variations, known as driving volatility, prior to involvement in safety critical events can be a leading indicator of safety. Here, this study focuses on the component of “driving volatility matrix” related to specific normal and safety-critical events, named “event-based volatility.” The research issue is characterizing volatility in instantaneous driving decisions in the longitudinal and lateral directions, and how it varies across drivers involved in normal driving, crash, and/or near-crash events. To explore the issue, a rigorous quasi-experimental study design is adopted to help compare driving behaviors in normal vs unsafe outcomes. Using a unique real-world naturalistic driving database from the 2nd Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP), a test set of 9593 driving events featuring 2.2 million temporal samples of real-world driving are analyzed. This study features a plethora of kinematic sensors, video, and radar spatiotemporal data about vehicle movement and therefore offers the opportunity to initiate such exploration. By using information related to longitudinal and lateral accelerations and vehicular jerk, 24 different aggregate and segmented measures of driving volatility are proposed that captures variations in extreme instantaneous driving decisions. In doing so, careful attention is given to the issue of intentional vs. unintentional volatility. The volatility indices, as leading indicators of near-crash and crash events, are then linked with safety critical events, crash propensity, and other event specific explanatory variables. Owing to the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and omitted variable bias, fixed- and random-parameter discrete choice models are developed that relate crash propensity to unintentional driving volatility and other factors. Statistically significant evidence is found that driver volatilities in near-crash and crash events are significantly greater than volatility in normal driving events. After controlling for traffic, roadway, and unobserved factors, the results suggest that greater intentional volatility increases the likelihood of both crash and near-crash events. A one-unit increase in intentional volatility is associated with positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction increases the chance of crash and near-crash outcome by 15.79 and 12.52 percentage points, respectively. Importantly, intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in lateral direction has more negative consequences than intentional volatility in positive vehicular jerk in longitudinal direction. Compared to acceleration/deceleration, vehicular jerk can better characterize the volatility in microscopic instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events. Finally, the magnitudes of correlations exhibit significant heterogeneity, and that accounting for the heterogeneous effects in the modeling framework can provide more reliable and accurate results. The study demonstrates the value of quasi-experimental study design and big data analytics for understanding extreme driving behaviors in safe vs. unsafe driving outcomes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

From the perspective of demand pull-supply push, this study examines China's PEV market by reviewing sales, product performance, and government policies from the last decade; and by comparing it with the market in the United States, the study attempts to generate market dynamics insights to the Chinese PEV market. On the demand side, inexpensive, small-sized PEVs have contributed the most to the recent rapid increase in sales, but this trend is diminishing. The majority of Chinese PEV sales in recent years occurred in economically prosperous regions or cities that are able to supply lucrative monetary incentives and otherwise PEV purchasing and driving privileges to consumers. On the supply side, expansion of the PEV market, incentivized by government policies, enable young, privately-owned automakers to compete with the established automakers. Overall, the PEV market concentration ratio is still small: hundreds of PEV models and new PEV automakers are competing in China; but when it comes to some major local markets, PEV sales are commonly dominated by the local automakers. In the U.S. market, except for the Tesla, the vast majority of PEV models are manufactured by established manufacturers of conventional vehicles. Demand-pull policies (e.g. direct monetary purchase incentives) are being transitioned to supply-push policies (e.g. special fuel economy credits for PEVs and PEV sales mandate) which will be major government measures to further stimulate PEV sales with less fiscal burden.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The uncertainty of traffic signal timing for signalized intersections on the road is considered. The eco-driving problem is formulated as a data-driven chance-constrained robust optimization problem. Effective red-light duration (ERD) is defined as a random variable, and describes the feasible passing time through the signalized intersections. Usually, the true probability distribution for ERD is unknown. Consequently, a data-driven approach is adopted to formulate chance constraints based on empirical sample data. This incorporates robustness into the eco-driving control problem with respect to uncertain signal timing. Dynamic programming (DP) is employed to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate optimal speed reference trajectories with 40% less vehicle fuel consumption, while maintaining the arrival time at a similar level compared to a modified intelligent driver model (IDM). The proposed control approach significantly improves the controller's robustness in the face of uncertain signal timing, without requiring to know the distribution of the random variable a priori.","IEEE","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Online); Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3759-3773","","","AR0000791","Journal ID: ISSN 2327-4662; 2327-4662","10.1109/jiot.2020.2968120","","2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","1799085","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799085","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799085","IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Online)","5","7"
"Future private car stock in China: current growth pattern and effects of car sales restriction","Gan, Yu; Lu, Zifeng; Cai, Hao; Wang, Michael; He, Xin; Przesmitzki, Steven","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; China; Energy Consumptions; Private Car Stock; Projection; Sales Restrictions; Car Sales","Car stock projection is essential to evaluating the energy and environmental impacts of private cars in China. Since the private car ownership rate in China has not reached its saturation level, limited and outdated data used in previous studies has resulted in high uncertainties regarding the functions of car ownership and significantly reduced the robustness of the projection of private car stocks. In this work, we estimate China's current growth pattern of private car ownership by analyzing more than 6300 pairs of private car ownership and income data collected from various official statistics at the national, provincial, and city levels in the period of 1997-2017. The dataset covers a much wider per-capita disposable income range than national-level data alone and allows us to make satisfactory projections of private car stocks in China up to 2040. We project that the private car stock in China could reach 403 million in 2040, if the current growth pattern of car ownership continues. Significant discrepancies in private car ownership curves are observed for cities with and without car sales restrictions. Without car sales restrictions, we estimate that the private car stock would be even higher at 455 million by 2040, demonstrating the effectiveness of the current restriction policy in controlling car stocks in China. We further quantify the potential impacts of car sales restrictions on future car stock levels by implementing hypothetical national car sales caps. Results show that, although the private car stocks would still continue to grow before 2030, the stock levels would be stable at ~ 280 and ~ 350 million by 2040 for scenarios of 20 and 25 million sales caps, respectively. The impact of private car stock growth on energy consumption in China is also examined. Pump-to-wheels energy consumption of the private car fleet is projected to be 131, 147, 90, and 113 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2040 for scenarios of the current growth pattern, no sales restriction, the 20 million sales cap, and the 25 million sales cap, respectively. Analysis reveals that private car sales restriction and vehicle population growth control could be an effective strategy for energy consumption reduction (thus greenhouse gas emission mitigation) in China, although the development of the automotive industry may be restrained.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

"Experimental investigation of the relationship between thermal barrier coating structured porosity and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine combustion","Powell, Tommy; O’Donnell, Ryan; Hoffman, Mark; Filipi, Zoran; Jordan, Eric H.; Kumar, Rishi; Killingsworth, Nick J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Thermal barrier coating; yttria-stabilized zirconia; low temperature combustion; heat transfer; homogeneous charge compression ignition","<p>Heat transfer has a monumental influence on homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion. When a thermal barrier coating is applied to the combustion chamber, the insulating effect magnifies the wall temperature swing, decreasing heat transfer during combustion. This enables improvements in both thermal and combustion efficiency without the detrimental impacts of intake charge heating. Increasing the temperature swing requires coatings with lower thermal conductivity and heat capacity. An enticing avenue for simultaneously decreasing both thermal conductivity and capacity is to increase the porosity fraction. A proprietary solution precursor plasma spray process enables discrete organization of the porosity structure, called inter-pass boundaries, which in turn produces a step-reduction in thermal conductivity for a given porosity level. In this investigation, yttria-stabilized zirconia is used to create four different thermal barrier coatings to study the potential of structured porosity as means of improving the “temperature swing” behavior in a homogeneous charge compression ignition engine. The baseline coating is “dense YSZ,” applied using a standard air-plasma spray process. Furthermore, significant reductions of the thermal conductivity are achieved by utilizing the solution precursor plasma spray process to create inter-pass boundaries with a moderate overall porosity. Performance, efficiency, and emissions are compared against both a baseline configuration with a metal piston and an air-plasma spray “dense YSZ” coating. Experiments are carried out in a single-cylinder gasoline homogeneous charge compression ignition engine with exhaust re-induction. Experiments indicate that incorporating structured porosity into thermal barrier coatings produces tangible gains in combustion and thermal efficiencies. However, there is an upper limit to porosity levels acceptable for homogeneous charge compression ignition engine application because an elevated porosity fraction leads to excessive surface roughness and undesirable fuel interactions. Comparison of the coatings showed the best results with coating thickness of up to 150 µm. Thicker coatings led to slower surface temperature response and attenuated swing temperature magnitude.</p>","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The proposed framework uses a ground vehicle and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that travel cooperatively and visit a set of targets while satisfying the communication constraints. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and a branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to solve the problem to optimality. Furthermore, a transformation method and a heuristic are also developed for the problem. The effectiveness of all the algorithms is corroborated through extensive computational experiments on several randomly generated instances. Furthermore, this paper is motivated by an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission involving a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a ground vehicle, where the vehicles must coordinate their activity in the presence of communication constraints. The combination of a small UAV and a ground vehicle is an ideal platform for such missions, since small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats that would be problematic for the ground vehicle alone. This paper addresses the coordinated routing problem involving these two vehicles and presents an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution for this problem, fast heuristics to obtain good feasible solutions, and also a transformation method to transform any instance of this cooperative vehicle routing problem to an instance of the one-in-a-set traveling salesman problem.","IEEE","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Single-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition through catalytic partial oxidation reformation of diesel fuel","Hariharan, Deivanayagam; Rahimi Boldaji, Mozhgan; Yan, Ziming; Mamalis, Sotirios; Lawler, Benjamin","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","A single-fuel RCCI concept has been proposed to avoid the need for a secondary fuel system required for conventional RCCI by generating the secondary fuel from the primary fuel through catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) reformation. In conventional RCCI, gasoline or natural gas can be used as the low-reactivity fuel, and diesel can be used as the high-reactivity fuel. In this study, two reformate mixtures generated by reforming diesel fuel at different operating conditions were used as the low-reactivity fuel, with the parent diesel as the high reactivity fuel. The combustion characteristics of reformate-diesel RCCI were compared with the conventional RCCI. A CFD model was also developed and validated against the experimental results. The model was then used to validate a necessary approximation of the reformate mixture's species concentrations. Compared to conventional RCCI fuel pairs, reformate-diesel RCCI shows marginally better thermal efficiency, approximately 10% better THC emissions, approximately 50% lower NOx emissions, and good controllability. Because the reformate mixture has a high concentration of diluents it displaces a large fraction of intake air and acts similarly to EGR. The combustion behavior of reformate-diesel RCCI is in between that of gasoline-diesel and natural gas-diesel conventional RCCI. From the results, it can be concluded that reformate-diesel RCCI is not overly sensitive to the reformation process itself and the exact species concentrations in the reformate mixture. Finally, a small change in the start of injection of diesel, blend ratio, and EGR fraction can be used to compensate for reformate mixture concentration differences.","Elsevier","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technologies Office (EE-3V)","","United States","2019-12-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 264; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 116815","","","EE0007216","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-2361","10.1016/j.fuel.2019.116815","","2020-12-21T00:00:00Z","1607730","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1607730","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1607730","Fuel","C","264"
"Public charging infrastructure for plug-in electric vehicles: What is it worth?","Greene, David L.; Kontou, Eleftheria; Borlaug, Brennan A.; Brooker, Aaron D.; Muratori, Matteo","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; charging infrastructure; plug-in electric vehicles; PEV","A lack of charging infrastructure is an important barrier to the growth of the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) market. Public charging infrastructure has tangible and intangible value, such as reducing range anxiety or building confidence in the future of the PEV market. Quantifying the value of public charging infrastructure can inform analysis of investment decisions and can help predict the impact of charging infrastructure on future PEV sales. Estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) based on stated preference surveys are limited by consumers' lack of familiarity with PEVs. As an alternative, we focus on quantifying the tangible value of public PEV chargers in terms of their ability to displace gasoline use for PHEVs and to enable additional electric (e-) vehicle miles for BEVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of shorter range and longer recharging time. Simulation studies provide data that can be used to quantify e-miles enabled by public chargers and the value of additional e-miles can be inferred from econometric estimates of WTP for increased vehicle range. Functions are synthesized that estimate the WTP for public charging infrastructure by plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, conditional on vehicle range, annual vehicle travel, pre-existing charging infrastructure, energy prices, vehicle efficiency, and household income. A case study based on California's public charging network in 2017 indicates that, to the purchaser of a new BEV with a 100-mile range and home recharging, existing public fast chargers are worth about $1500 for intraregional travel, and fast chargers along intercity routes are valued at over $6500.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Planning Optimization for Inductively Charged On-demand Automated Electric Shuttles Project at Greenville, South Carolina","Mohamed, Ahmed A. S.; Zhu, Lei; Meintz, Andrew L; Wood, Eric W","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; autonomous electric shuttles; dynamic wireless charging; fixed route; optimization; wireless power transfer; WPT","Wireless charging technology presents an ideal fit for autonomous electric vehicles for realizing a fully automated system (vehicle and charger). This paper presents a planning optimization analysis for a pilot project of in-route wireless charging infrastructure serving fixed-route on-demand shared automated electric shuttles (SAESs) at Greenville, South Carolina, USA. A single-objective non-linear mixed integer system planning optimization problem is formulated. A comprehensive cost model representing the overall inductively charged SAESs system is developed, considering road construction, power electronics and materials, traction battery, and installation costs. The optimization problem is solved to determine the best combination of the system key design parameters (number and allocations of wireless chargers, charging power level, track length and on-board battery capacity) that show the most cost-effective solution and allow the SAESs to achieve charge-sustaining operation. The planning platform incorporates representative simulated traffic data (driving speed and routes) for four SAESs in the Greenville using the Simulation of Urban Mobility tool. These data are fed to a vehicle powertrain model and a wireless charger power model to predict the battery power, energy and state-of-charge profiles, which are provided to the search algorithm to assess the design objectives under specific constraints. Finally, the results indicate that implementing high-power (100 kW) wireless charger at a few designated stops for fixed-route SAESs with the proper track length allows the vehicles to realize charge-sustaining operation, infinite range, and zero recharge downtime, with a significant reduction in the on-board battery (36%) and road coverage (69%), at minimum cost.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study applies a life cycle framework to demonstrate and evaluate the synergies of the following four emerging transportation system technologies both qualitatively and quantitatively: (1) wireless charging; (2) shared mobility services; (3) autonomous driving; and (4) battery electric vehicles (BEV). The new concept of a wireless charging and shared autonomous battery electric vehicle (W+SABEV) system is introduced and modeled. First, an analytical framework is presented to assess the pros and cons of the W+SABEV system vs. a conventional plug-in charging BEV system, adhering to the principles of sustainable mobility and highlighting the impacts and dynamics of the disruptive technologies on the key parameters that define sustainable mobility. Second, a quantitative analysis presents the synergies of the four technologies by modeling a W+SABEV system and demonstrates that the combination of the four technologies can shorten the payback time of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission burdens for infrastructure and vehicles. Finally, compared to a plug-in charging BEV system, a W+SABEV system pays back the additional GHG emission burdens of wireless charging infrastructure deployment within 5 years if the wireless charging utility factor (ratio of en route charging time vs. trip time) is above 19%.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has more than 4500 employees, most of which live in and around Knoxville, Tennessee. ORNL is currently developing a pilot commuting program for all employees, which incorporates the use of park-and-ride facilities. This study outlines the methodology behind the preliminary geoanalysis and routing used in developing a lab-wide commuting program. The data used for the study included numbers of employee residences per zip code. Commuting configurations by clustered zip code area and vehicle type were developed. Satellite imagery was used to locate actual, suitable parking facilities to accommodate the specified number of residents involved in each commuting configuration. Routing and estimations of travel times were performed using TransCAD. Energy estimates in kilowatt-hours (kwh) and gallons of gasoline, and gallons of gasoline equivalent, were all determined based on the resulting scenarios. Standard petroleum-fuelled vehicles were used in the initial estimates. Standard electric vehicles were also used in alternative scenarios to estimate potential additional energy and fuel savings. The initial findings from this work will be used to develop a pilot program for ORNL.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Smart charging equipment and patterns of charging service will be one of the research focuses at the next stage. Smart charging equipment schedules EV's charging on the basis of electricity price, and this method enables users to hold the right of controlling their own EV's charging procedure. Thus, there exists a Stackelberg game between charging service providers, who set the price, and independent EVs. The marginal charging price, which reflects properties of individual EV, and the pricing strategy of charging service providers can be derived through solving this game problem. A price based charging strategy is proposed, which is suitable for the dynamic electricity price mechanism because of its light communication burden.

The proposed rotary transformer features a nonferrite rotating part made of lightweight strong nonconductive and nonmagnetic composite material and a large air gap, allowing safe operation at high rotational speeds. Hence, this novel rotary transformer can enable the adoption of wound rotor synchronous machines for electric or hybrid vehicle traction.

"Impact of Time-Varying Passenger Loading on Conventional and Electrified Transit Bus Energy Consumption","Liu, Luying; Kotz, Andrew J; Salapaka, Aditya; Miller, Eric S; Northrop, William F.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; vehicle mass; energy consumption; electrified transit bus","Transit bus passenger loading changes greatly over the course of a workday. Therefore, time-varying vehicle mass as a result of passenger load becomes an important factor in instantaneous energy consumption. Battery-powered electric transit buses have restricted range and longer 'fueling' time compared with conventional diesel-powered buses; thus, it is vital to know how much energy they require. Our previous work has shown that instantaneous transit bus mass can be obtained by measuring the pressure in the vehicle's airbag suspension system. This report leverages this novel technique to determine the impact of time-varying mass on energy consumption. Sixty-five days of velocity and mass data were collected from in-use transit buses operating on routes in the Twin Cities, MN metropolitan area. The simulation tool Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulator was modified to allow both velocity and mass as time-dependent inputs. This tool was then used to model an electrified and conventional bus on the same routes and determine the energy use of each bus. Results showed that the kinetic intensity varied from 0.27 to 4.69 mi-1 and passenger loading ranged from 2 to 21 passengers. Simulation results showed that energy consumption for both buses increased with increasing vehicle mass. The simulation also indicated that passenger loading has a greater impact on energy consumption for conventional buses than for electric buses owing to the electric bus's ability to recapture energy. This work shows that measuring and analyzing real-time passenger loading is advantageous for determining the energy used by electric and conventional diesel buses.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A desire to quantify and compare both existing and emerging transportation options motivated development of the mobility energy productivity (MEP) metric described here. The MEP metric fundamentally measures the potential of a city's transportation system to connect a person to a variety of services and activities that define a high quality of life, relative to the convenience, cost, and energy needed to provide these connections. Fundamentally derived from accessibility theory, the MEP advances practice by using readily available travel time data (either from web-based application programming interfaces or outputs from an urban transportation model) combined with established parameters that reflect the energy intensity and cost of various travel modes, and relative frequency of activity engagement. The construction of the MEP metric allows for aggregation and disaggregation to the appropriate spatial, modal, and trip purpose resolution, as analysis needs dictate. As a result, the MEP could be used to compare alternative futures related to technology, infrastructure investment, or policy, providing a much-needed tool for planners, researchers, and analysts.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.","IEEE","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

ACI combustion strategies have demonstrated extremely low engine-out soot while achieving high break thermal efficiencies. However, US-regulated emissions for particulate matter (PM) are on a mass basis, which can consist of ash, soot or elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC). The composition of PM mass from ACI combustion ranges from nearly 100% OC to a mix of EC and OC particulates as the extent of fuel stratification increases. How the mass, compositions, and morphology of PM changes as fuel stratifies within the combustion chamber and what this can tell us about PM formation are presented through multi-cylinder, metal engine experiments. Using ACI modes ranging from homogeneous to highly stratified approaches, this study aimed to advance the understanding of how air-fuel stratification and fuel properties impact PM emissions formation; advanced gaseous and solid emission characterizations are also given. This study is part of a collaborative multi-lab initiative at the US Department of Energy that aims to simultaneously transform both transportation fuels and vehicles in order to maximize performance and energy efficiency, minimize environmental impact, and accelerate widespread adoption of innovative combustion strategies by providing the underlying science for this initiative.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Experimental Study and Model Predictive Control of a Lean-Burn Gasoline Engine Coupled With a Passive Selective Catalytic Reduction System","Lin, Qinghua; Chen, Pingen; Prikhodko, Vitaly Y.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; lean-burn gasoline engine; passive selective catalytic reduction system; model predictive control; three-way catalyst","Lean-burn gasoline engines have reflected 10–20% engine efficiency gain over stoichiometric engines and are widely considered as a promising technology for meeting the 54.5 miles-per-gallon (mpg) corporate average fuel economy standard by 2025. Nonetheless, nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions control for lean-burn gasoline for meeting the stringent Environmental Protection Agency tier 3 emission standards has been one of the main challenges toward the commercialization of highly efficient lean-burn gasoline engines in the United States. Passive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, which consist of a three-way catalyst (TWC) and SCR, have demonstrated great potentials of effectively reducing NO<sub>x</sub> emissions for lean gasoline engines at low cost. Yet, passive SCR operation may cause significant fuel penalty since rich engine combustion is required for ammonia generation. The purpose of this study is to develop a model-predictive control (MPC) scheme for a lean-burn gasoline engine coupled with a passive SCR system to minimize the total equivalent fuel penalty associated with passive SCR operation while satisfying stringent NO<sub>x</sub> and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the MPC approach can reduce the fuel penalty by 43.9% in a simulated US06 cycle and 28.0% in a simulated urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) cycle, respectively, compared to the baseline control, while achieving over 97% DeNO<sub>x</sub> efficiency and less than 15 ppm tailpipe ammonia slip.

"Co-optimization of Heavy-Duty Fuels and Engines: Cost Benefit Analysis and Implications","Ou, Longwen; Cai, Hao; Seong, Hee Je; Longman, Douglas E.; Dunn, Jennifer B.; Storey, John M.

Reduced engine-out emissions could potentially alleviate the emission control burden, and thus bring about reductions in the cost associated with aftertreatment systems, which translates into savings in vehicle ownership. This study evaluates potential reductions in manufacturing and operating costs of redesigned emission aftertreatment systems of line-haul heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) with reduced engine-out emissions brought about by co-optimized fuel and engine technologies. Three emissions reduction cases representing conservative, medium, and optimistic engine-out emission reduction benefits are analyzed, compared to a reference case: the total costs of aftertreatment systems (TCA) of the three cases are reduced to $11,400(1.63 cent/km), $9,100 (1.30 cent/km), and $8,800 (1.26 cent/km), respectively, compared to $12,000 (1.71 cent/km) for the reference case. The largest potential reductions result from reduced diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) usage due to lower NOx emissions. Downsizing aftertreatment devices is not likely, because the sizes of devices are dependent on not only engine-out emissions, but also other factors such as engine displacement. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the price and usage of DEF have the largest impacts on TCA reduction.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The active material volume change due to lithium insertion/extraction causes the electrode deformation and porosity variation. The porosity variation affects the mechanical properties of each component of the cell as well as the transport processes. Consecutively, the electrode deformation also affects porosity variation and the electrochemical processes (transport and equilibrium potential). Variables such as particle size and specific surface area are also simultaneous updated based on the approximated electrode deformation and porosity distributions. The model is applied to simulate the performance of a cell composed of Si anode and NMC532 cathode to study the effect of active material volume change on the cell performances. The simulation results show that during the charging process the porosity of each cell component experiences significant reduction due to the large expansion of Si particles. Also, a notable hydrostatic stress develops within the cell, which introduces an overpotential in addition to that caused by porosity reduction. The model is also employed to study the effects of charging rate, initial anode porosity, cell loading and fixture condition.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Synthesis of convection velocity and turbulence measurements in three-stream jets","Stuber, Marcie; Lowe, K. Todd; Ng, Wing F.","42 ENGINEERING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Key flow regions linked to jet noise sources are investigated through comparison of convection velocity and turbulence measurements in high-speed three-stream nozzles. Time-resolved flow imaging using a photomultiplier tube array was applied in the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig at NASAs Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Lab to measure 250 kHz repetition laser scattering signals arising from seeding particles at 32 points in high-speed flow. Particle image velocimetry measurements previously reported by NASA provided mean velocity and turbulence intensity. Results for convection velocity of the particle concentration field were obtained from the time-resolved data for three-stream nozzle configurations using a cross-correlation approach. The three-stream cases included an axisymmetric and an asymmetric, offset nozzle configuration. For the axisymmetric case, areas of high convection velocity and turbulence intensity were found to occur 4–6 area-equivalent nozzle diameters downstream from the nozzle exit. Comparison of convection velocity between the axisymmetric and offset cases shows this same region as having the greatest reduction in convection velocity due to the offset, up to 20% reduction for the offset case compared to the axisymmetric case. Finally, these findings suggest that this region along the centerline near the end of the potential core is an important area for noise generation with jets and contributes to the noise reductions seen from three-stream offset nozzles.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Joint Optimization Scheme for the Planning and Operations of Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle Fleets Serving Mobility on Demand","Sheppard, Colin J. R.; Bauer, Gordon S.; Gerke, Brian F.; Greenblatt, Jeffery B.; Jenn, Alan T.; Gopal, Anand R.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Electric Vehicles; Vehicle Grid Integration; SharedMobility; Connected and Autonomous Vehicles","As the transportation sector undergoes three major transformations—electrification, shared/on-demand mobility, and automation—there are new challenges to analyzing the impacts of these trends on both the transportation system and the power sector. Most models that analyze the requirements of fleets of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) operate at the scale of an urban region, or smaller. A quadratically constrained, quadratic programming problem is formulated, designed to model the requirements of SAEVs at a national scale. The size of the SAEV fleet, the necessary charging infrastructure, the fleet charging schedule, and the dispatch required to serve demand for trips in a region are treated as decision variables. By minimizing both the amortized cost of the fleet and chargers as well as the operational costs of charging, it is possible to explore the coupled interactions between system design and operation. To apply the model at a national scale, key complications about fleet operations are simplified; but a detailed agent-based regional simulation model to parameterize those simplifications is leveraged. Preliminary results are presented, finding that all mobility in the United States (U.S.) currently served by 276 million personally owned vehicles could be served by 12.5 million SAEVs at a cost of $\$ 0.27$/vehicle-mile or $ 0.18/passenger-mile. In conclusion, the energy requirements for this fleet would be 1142 GWh/day (8.5% of 2017 U.S. electricity demand) and the peak charging load 76.7 GW (11% of U.S. power peak). Several model sensitivities are explored, and it is found that sharing is a key factor in the analysis.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Characterization of Low Temperature Reactions in the Standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) Engine","Waqas, Muhammad Umer; Hoth, Alexander; Kolodziej, Christopher P.; Rockstroh, Toby; Gonzalez, Jorge Pulpeiro; Johansson, Bengt","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; CFR engine; HCCI; RON","A number of proposals for fuel rating in spark ignition (SI) engine have been suggested till date and still no consensus on this has been reached. The automobile industry is continuing to use RON and MON tests for rating fuels, and still there exists a need to come up with new fuel rating systems. The fuel’s knocking tendency in SI engines is mainly governed by the end-gas autoignition. Another combustion mode, homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), is also driven by autoignition of the complete charge inside the cylinder. Fundamentally, the combustion process in both combustion modes is driven by autoignition, and HCCI combustion mode can be used to understand the knocking behavior in SI engines. The lean combustion environment in HCCI mode provides a good platform to replicate the operating conditions of modern SI engines, which are operating at boosted pressures and low intake temperatures, and understanding of the fuel knocking behavior under such conditions is vital for achieving high-efficient engines. Therefore in this study, HCCI combustion will be used in the standard CFR engine to understand the autoignition behavior of the fuels for SI engines. For this purpose, three fuel blends were selected, which had the research octane number equal to 90. The standard CFR engine was operated with varying intake pressures and temperatures under HCCI combustion mode. The Lund-Chevron HCCI fuel number was used to rate the fuels and this was compared with RON and MON of the blends. It was found that HCCI combustion could be used to rate the fuels with the standard CFR engine with minor modifications to accommodate the boosted conditions without affecting the geometry and the flow inside the CFR engine. Low temperature reactions were observed and were correlated with the Lund-Chevron HCCI fuel numbers.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

"Diesel Engine Characterization and Performance Scaling Via Brake Specific Fuel Consumption Map Dimensional Analysis","Pelletier, Evan; Brennan, Sean","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","The goal of this work is to develop easily generalized models of heavy duty truck engine maps that allow for approximate comparisons of engine performance, thus enabling fuel efficient matching of engines to a set of corresponding loads and routes. This is achieved by applying dimensional analysis to create a uniformly applicable, dimensionless Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) map that fits the behavior of a wide range of diesel engines. Here, a commonality between maps was found to occur when engine data is scaled by specific dimensional parameters that target data consistency among the primary operating points across engines. This common map highlights observable trends in engine performance based on the influence of these same parameters being scaled across engines. The resulting dimensionless engine map fits the minimum BSFC regions of four diesel engines to within 2.5 percent.","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (AMSE)","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-09-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference; Journal Volume: 2; Conference: Proceedings of ASME 2019 Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, Park City, UT (United States), 8-11 Oct 2019","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. DSCC2019-9110","","","AR0000801","Journal ID: ISSN 2151-1853","10.1115/DSCC2019-9110","","2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","1561789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1561789","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1561789","Proceedings of the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference","","2"
"Route-Optimized Energy Management of Connected and Automated Multi-Mode Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Dynamic Programming","Rama, Neeraj; Wang, Huanqing; Orlando, Joshua; Robinette, Darrell; Chen, Bo","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This paper presents a methodology to optimize the blending of charge-depleting (CD) and charge-sustaining (CS) modes in a multi-mode plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) that reduces overall energy consumption when the selected route cannot be completely driven in all-electric mode. The PHEV used in this investigation is the second-generation Chevrolet Volt and as many as four instrumented vehicles were utilized simultaneously on road to acquire validation data. The optimization method used is dynamic programming (DP) paired with a reduced-order powertrain model to enable onboard embedded controller compatibility and computational efficiency in optimally blending CD, CS modes over the entire drive route. The objective of the optimizer is to enable future Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to best utilize onboard energy for minimum overall energy consumption based on speed and elevation profile information from Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Internet of Things (IoT), High-definition Mapping, and onboard sensing technologies. Emphasis is placed on runtime minimization to quickly react and plan an optimal mode scheme in highly dynamic road conditions with minimal computational resources. On-road performance of the optimizer paired with automated CD and CS mode selection is evaluated on a fleet of four instrumented Chevrolet Volts in a variety of driving scenarios. Here, the results indicate variable energy savings depending on the drive route and initial battery SOC with potential ranging between 2 to 12% and less than 7 seconds initial optimization for a 24-mile drive cycle.","SAE International","","Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series; Journal Volume: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: 13 p.","","","AR0000788","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-7191","10.4271/2019-01-1209","","2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","1572169","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1572169","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572169","Society of Automotive Engineers Technical Paper Series","","1"

FCETs use a battery combined with onboard hydrogen storage for energy storage. The additional battery provides regenerative braking and better fuel economy, but it will also increase the initial cost of the vehicle. Heavier reliance on stored hydrogen might be cheaper initially, but operational costs will be higher because hydrogen is more expensive than electricity. Achieving the right tradeoff between these power and energy choices is necessary to reduce the ownership cost of the vehicle. This paper develops an optimum component sizing algorithm for FCETs. The truck vehicle model was developed in Autonomie, a platform for modelling vehicle energy consumption and performance. The algorithm optimizes component sizes to minimize overall ownership cost, while ensuring that the FCET matches or exceeds the performance and cargo capacity of a conventional vehicle. Class 4 delivery truck and class 8 linehaul trucks are shown as examples. We estimate the ownership cost for various hydrogen costs, powertrain components, ownership periods, and annual vehicle miles travelled.","MDPI AG","","Argonne National Lab.

For plug-in electric vehicles, direct-current fast charging (DCFC) is proposed as a solution to support long-distance travel and relieve range anxiety. However, DCFC has also been shown to be potentially more expensive compared to residential or workplace charging. In particular, electricity demand charges can significantly impact electricity cost for fast charging applications. Here we explore technological solutions that can help reduce the electricity cost for electric vehicle fast charging. In particular, we consider thousands of electricity rates available in the United States and real-world vehicle charging load scenarios to assess opportunities to reduce the cost of DCFC by deploying solar photovoltaics (PV) panels and energy storage (battery), and implementing a co-location configuration where a DCFC station is connected to an existing meter within a commercial building. Results show that while the median electricity cost across more than 7000 commercial retail rates remains less than $0.20/kWh for all charging load scenarios considered, cost varies greatly, and some locations do experience significantly higher electricity cost. Co-location is almost always economically viable to mitigate fixed cost and demand charges, but the relative benefit of co-locating diminishes as station size and utilization increase. Energy storage alone can help mitigate demand charges and is more effective at reducing costs for “peaky” or low-utilization loads. On the other hand, PV systems primarily help mitigate energy charges, and are more effective for loads that are more correlated with solar production, even in areas with lower solar resource. PV and energy storage can deploy synergistically to provide cost reductions for DCFC, leveraging their ability to mitigate demand and energy charges.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most recently, onboard reforming has been proposed to enable “Single-Fuel RCCI” combustion and therefore, this paper explores catalytic partial oxidation reforming of three potential transportation-relevant fuels: gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. Reformation is performed at two pressure levels (between 15 and 60 psig) for each parent fuel for equivalence ratios ranging from 3.7 to 7.6 and the gaseous reformate mixtures are characterized with gas chromatography. The percentage of diesel oxidized during reformation is similar across all of the equivalence ratios. However, the percentage of gasoline and natural gas oxidized during reformation decreased with increasing equivalence ratio. The energy released during the reformation process is also calculated and presented for each gaseous reformate fuel. The lower heating value of every reformate fuel is lower than 20% of their respective parent fuel, due to the high concentration of inert gases (mostly nitrogen) in the reformate fuel mixtures. Two reformed fuels for each parent fuel were then selected to study their autoignition characteristics using HCCI combustion on a Co-operative Fuel Research (CFR) engine. The equivalence ratio is maintained at 0.31 and the combustion phasing was held constant by varying the intake temperature. Although the equivalence ratio is constant, the input energy from the different reformate fuels is not constant due to the component concentrations in the fuel. The gaseous reformate fuels are then compared to gasoline, natural gas, and the primary reference fuels in HCCI to determine an effective Primary Reference Fuel (PRF) number or effective octane rating for each gaseous reformate fuel. The effective octane rating for the gaseous reformate fuels fell slightly above the PRF number scale at an effective octane number of ~110.","Elsevier","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technologies Office (EE-3V)","","United States","2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 246; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 295-307","","","EE0007216","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-2361","10.1016/j.fuel.2019.02.003","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1607725","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1607725","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1607725","Fuel","C","246"
"Reactivity of novel high-performance fuels on commercial three-way catalysts for control of emissions from spark-ignition engines","Sinha Majumdar, Sreshtha; Pihl, Josh A.; Toops, Todd J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","The Department of Energy “Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines” initiative aims to simultaneously develop novel high-performance fuels with advanced engine designs to reduce petroleum consumption. To achieve commercialization, advanced engines running on alternative fuels still must meet emissions regulations. Warm three-way catalysts (TWC) are very effective at meeting the stringent emissions regulations on pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane organic gases (NMOG) and carbon monoxide (CO) from gasoline-fueled spark-ignition (SI) engines operating under stoichiometric conditions; thus, most SI engine emissions occur during cold-start, when the TWC has not yet achieved light-off. In the current study, the light-off behavior of novel high-performance fuel candidates has been investigated on a hydrothermally-aged commercial TWC using a synthetic engine-exhaust flow reactor system according to industry guidelines. Over 30 potential fuel components were examined in this study, including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, esters, aromatic ethers, and non-oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Short-chain acyclic oxygenates, including alcohols, ketones, and esters, tended to light off at relatively low temperatures, while alkenes, aromatics, and cyclic oxygenates tended to light off at relatively high temperatures. The light-off behavior of alkanes and alkenes depended strongly on their size and structure. In terms of the influence on CO light-off on the TWC, the fuels fell into two distinct categories: (i) non-inhibiting species including C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> alcohols, alkanes, acyclic ketones, and esters; and (ii) inhibiting species including alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic oxygenates, and C<sub>4</sub> alcohols.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impact of fuel and engine operating conditions on efficiency of a heavy duty truck engine running compression ignition mode using energy and exergy analysis","Wang, Buyu; Pamminger, Michael; Wallner, Thomas","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; gasoline compression ignition; multi-cylinder engine; first law analysis; second law analysis; exergy; ideal efficiency","Gasoline compression ignition using a single gasoline-type fuel for direct/port injection has been shown as a method to achieve low temperature combustion with low engine-out NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions and high indicated thermal efficiency. However, key technical barriers to achieving low temperature combustion on multi-cylinder engines include the air handling system (limited amount of exhaust gas recirculation) as well as mechanical engine limitations (e.g. peak pressure rise rate). In light of these limitations, high temperature combustion with reduced amounts of exhaust gas recirculation appears more practical. Previous studies by the authors demonstrated that utilizing port and direct injection of E85 gasoline simultaneously resulted in the best performance and the highest brake thermal efficiency of 47.1%, which was 1.2% higher compared to diesel baseline. For further efficiency improvement, a better understanding of energy and exergy loss mechanisms is required. As such, in this work first and second law thermodynamics analysis were applied to experiments with gasoline compression ignition at an engine speed of 1038 rpm and brake mean effective pressure of 1.4 MPa on a 12.4 L multi-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. The impact on the efficiency, losses, and irreversibility with respect to various parameters such as fuel, injection strategy, intake condition, and port injected water mass was quantified. The peak efficiency of ideal cycles and the combined efficiency with a waste heat recovery system were also estimated in this study to assess opportunities for further efficiency gains. It was found that the combustion irreversibility was dominated by the combustion temperature rather than the fuel structure. Despite its highest brake thermal efficiency, E85 gasoline generated the highest exergy destruction due to its lowest combustion temperature. For the same reason, retarding the combustion phasing or adopting a port and direct injection strategy increased the exergy destruction. The combustion duration loss was more notable than the phasing loss and was affected by both the combustion duration and shape of heat release profile. Water port injection increased the exhaust energy, but the available energy dropped significantly attributed to the decrease in the exhaust temperature, rendering waste heat recovery ineffective. The second law analysis serves as a helpful tool in conjunction with the first law analysis to explore pathways to maximize engine efficiency.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Detection of low Temperature heat release (LTHR) in the standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine in both SI and HCCI combustion modes","Waqas, Muhammad Umer; Hoth, Alexander; Kolodziej, Christopher P.; Rockstroh, Toby; Gonzalez, Jorge Pulpeiro; Johansson, Bengt","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; CFR; HCCI; LTHR; SI; Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI); Spark Ignition (SI); Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine; octane rating","To this date, extensive research has been conducted to understand the low-temperature auto-ignition chemistry of gasoline. The detection of low-temperature chemical reactions under Spark Ignition (SI) combustion cannot be detected, as they are hidden by the flame propagation. Alternatively, Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion has a two-stage combustion involving low and high-temperature heat release (LTHR and HTHR respectively). Both Knocking SI and HCCI combustion involve auto-ignition and are governed by fuel characteristics and the pressure-temperature (P-T) history. Therefore, HCCI combustion might provide an alternative to understand the knocking behavior and LTHR in modern SI engines. A standard Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine was operated at lean HCCI conditions (lambda 3), as well as SI conditions at stoichiometry. For SI combustion, the CFR engine was operated with RON-like conditions, but at late spark timing to induce LTHR prior to flame propagation. Three RON 90 binary fuel blends were investigated, being composed of n-heptane with isooctane, toluene, or ethanol. This work demonstrated that the CFR engine under stoichiometric SI with late spark timing and HCCI combustion mode can help to detect LTHR which is not possible in the standard RON test. The intake pressure and temperature sweeps showed similar effects on LTHR for both combustion modes. The linking of auto-ignition behavior of SI and HCCI was dependent primarily on intake valve closing (IVC) conditions. In conclusion, the high exhaust temperature in SI lead to high IVC temperatures. In order to match the IVC temperatures and to overlap the P-T trajectories, the intake temperature for HCCI was increased.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

An internal short-circuiting (ISC) device is implanted into three 18650 cell designs: one standard, one with a bottom vent, and one with a thicker casing. Through an extensive study of 228 cells, the position at which thermal runaway initiates is shown to greatly affect the tendency of cells to rupture and incur side-wall breaches at specific locations. The risks associated with each failure mechanism and position of the ISC device are quantified using a custom calorimeter that can decouple the heat from ejected and non-ejected contents. Furthermore the causes of high-risk failure mechanisms, such as bursting and side-wall breaches, are elucidated using high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging at 2000 frames per second and image-based 3D thermal runaway computational models, which together are used to construct a comprehensive description of external risks based on internal structural and thermal phenomena.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A New Design Approach to Mitigating the Effect of Parasitics in Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer Systems for Electric Vehicle Charging","Sinha, Sreyam; Kumar, Ashish; Regensburger, Brandon; Afridi, Khurram K.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This paper introduces a new design approach to mitigate the effect of parasitic capacitances and achieve high performance in large air-gap capacitive wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for electric vehicle (EV) charging. In a capacitive WPT system for EVs, the vehicle chassis and roadway introduce multiple parasitic capacitances that can overwhelm the coupling capacitance and severely degrade power transfer and efficiency. The proposed approach addresses this challenge by employing split-inductor matching networks, which allow the complex network of parasitic capacitances to be simplified into an equivalent four-capacitance model. The shunt capacitances of this model are directly utilized as the matching network capacitors, hence, absorbing the parasitic capacitances and eliminating the need for discrete high-voltage capacitors. A systematic procedure is developed to accurately measure the equivalent capacitances of the model, enabling the system's performance to be reliably predicted. The proposed approach is used to design two 6.78-MHz 12-cm air-gap prototype capacitive WPT systems with capacitor-free matching networks. The first system transfers up to 590 W using 150-cm <sup>2</sup> square coupling plates and achieves an efficiency of 88.4%. The second prototype system transfers up to 1217 W using 118-cm <sup>2</sup> circular coupling plates, achieving a power transfer density of 51.6 kW/m <sup>2</sup> . The measured output power profiles of the two systems match well with their predicted counterparts, validating the proposed design approach.","IEEE","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-07-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification (Online); Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1040-1059","","","AR0000618","Journal ID: ISSN 2332-7782; 2332-7782","10.1109/tte.2019.2931869","","2022-06-08T00:00:00Z","1799044","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799044","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799044","IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification (Online)","4","5"

However, the deployment of wireless charging lanes on highways and urban road networks can be costly and resource-intensive. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted here to compare the sustainability performance of DWPT applied in a network of highways and urban roads for charging electric passenger cars. The assessment compares DWPT to stationary wireless charging and to conventional plug-in charging using a case study of Washtenaw County in Michigan, USA over 20 years. The LCA is based on three key sustainability metrics: costs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and energy burdens, encompassing not only the use-phase burdens from electricity and fuel, but also the upfront deployment burdens of DWPT infrastructure. A genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rollout of DWPT infrastructure both spatially and temporally in order to minimize life cycle costs, GHG, and energy burdens: (1) spatial optimization selects road segments to deploy DWPT considering traffic volume, speed, and pavement remaining service life (RSL); (2) temporal optimization determines in which year to deploy DWPT on a particular road segment considering EV market share growth as a function of DWPT coverage rate, future DWPT cost reduction, and charging efficiency improvement. Results indicate that optimal deployment of DWPT electrifying up to about 3% of total roadway lane-miles reduces life cycle GHG emissions and energy by up to 9.0% and 6.8%, respectively, and enables downsizing of the EV battery capacity by up to 48%, compared to the non-DWPT scenarios. Roadside solar panels and storage batteries are essential to significantly reduce life cycle energy and GHG burdens but bring additional costs. Breakeven analysis indicates a breakeven year for solar charging benefits to pay back the DWPT infrastructure burdens can be less than 20 years for GHG and energy burdens but longer than 20 years for costs. A monetization of carbon emissions of at least $250 per metric tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> is required to shift the optimal “pro-cost” deployment to the optimal “pro-GHG” deployment. A roadway segment with volume greater than about 26,000 vehicle counts per day, speed slower than 55 miles per hour (1 mile ≈ 1.609 km), and pavement RSL shorter than 3 years should be given a high priority for early-stage DWPT deployment.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Electricity rates for electric vehicle direct current fast charging in the United States","Muratori, Matteo; Kontou, Eleftheria; Eichman, Joshua D.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; electricity rates; electric vehicles; DC fast charging; demand charges; charging stations","While several efforts are promoting a widespread and convenient network of direct current fast charging (DCFC) stations to support electric vehicles, there is limited understanding of the magnitude and variability of the cost of electricity for these applications. This information gap may hinder optimal investing and planning for charging station placement and in turn affect electric vehicle adoption and usage. Here, we assess the electricity cost for different scenarios of DCFC station size and use based on over 7500 commercial and industrial electricity rates available for 2017 across the United States. Results show that the cost of electricity for DCFC varies dramatically, ranging from less than 0.10 cents to over 2 dollars per kilowatt-hour, depending on station design and high uncertainty in use. The main driver of cost is low utilization, which results from a combination of few charging events and limited energy recharged during each event. Low utilization leads to significantly higher electricity cost, particularly for rates with demand charges; however, cost decreases rapidly as utilization increases. For high-utilization stations, selecting rates with demand charges can actually reduce electricity costs compared to non-demand-charge rates. Furthermore, significant opportunities for cost savings based on existing rates include preferential charging during off-peak hours and limiting multi-plug station power so that not all plugs can be used simultaneously at maximum power.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The impact of water injection and exhaust gas recirculation on combustion and emissions in a heavy-duty compression ignition engine operated on diesel and gasoline","Pamminger, Michael; Wang, Buyu; Hall, Carrie M.; Vojtech, Ryan; Wallner, Thomas","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; EGR; Early pilot injection; Gasoline compression ignition; Injection strategies; Water injection","Steady-state experiments were conducted on a 12.4L, six-cylinder heavy-duty engine to investigate the influence of port-injected water and dilution via exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on combustion and emissions for diesel and gasoline operation. Adding a diluent to the combustion process reduces peak combustion temperatures and can reduce the reactivity of the charge, thereby increasing the ignition-delay and, allowing for more time to premix air and fuel. Experiments spanned water/fuel mass ratios up to 140mass% and exhaust gas recirculation ratios up to 20vol% for gasoline and diesel operation with different injection strategies. Diluting the combustion process with either water or EGR resulted in a significant reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions along with a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the sensitivity of brake thermal efficiency to water and EGR varied among the fuels and injection strategies investigated. An efficiency breakdown revealed that water injection considerably reduced the wall heat transfer; however, a substantial increase in exhaust enthalpy offset the reduction in wall heat transfer and led to a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. Additionally, regular diesel operation with main and post injection exhibited a brake thermal efficiency of 45.8% and a 0.3% reduction at a water/fuel ratio of 120%. The engine operation with gasoline, early pilot, and main injection strategy showed a brake thermal efficiency of 45.0% at 0% water/fuel ratio, and a 1.2% decrease in brake thermal efficiency for a water/fuel ratio of 140%. Using EGR as a diluent reduced the brake thermal efficiency by 0.3% for diesel operation, comparing ratios of 0% and 20% EGR. However, a higher impact on brake thermal efficiency was seen for gasoline operation with early pilot and main injection strategy, with a reduction of about 0.8% comparing 0% and 20% EGR. Dilution by means of EGR exhibited a reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions up to 15 g/kWh; water injection showed only up to 10 g/kWh reduction for the EGR rates and water/fuel ratio investigated.","SAGE","","Argonne National Lab.

Nevertheless, the loose coupling between the transmitter and receiver generates intensive electromagnetic fields (EMFs) around the system, which may influence living objects' safety if the typical limits are exceeded. Moreover, these fields induce voltages in the vehicle body, which may lead to touch current passing through the human body when it gets in contact with two metal parts or one part and the ground. Following the international standards and recommendations, this study presents comprehensive test guidelines for the near-EMFs and touch currents from a commercial 25-kW wireless charger from Momentum Dynamics, which was installed in an electric shuttle operating at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) campus. The paper investigates the measuring devices, test setup, test points and standard limits. The impact of the misalignments on the measurements is considered during testing. EMFs are measured in areas around and inside the shuttle and near the power supply and compared with the reference levels defined by the international standards, including ICNIRP 2010, IEEE C95.1 and ACGIH TLV 2017. Touch currents are evaluated among different metal parts and ground in comparison with the standard limits. The results show that both EMFs and touch currents comply with the standard limits. Moreover, thermal inspection for the system after installation was provided.

"Economic Optimal Control for Minimizing Fuel Consumption of Heavy-Duty Trucks in a Highway Environment","Borek, John; Groelke, Ben; Earnhardt, Christian; Vermillion, Chris","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This paper provides a comparative assessment of three economic optimal control strategies, aimed at minimizing the fuel consumption of heavy-duty trucks in a highway environment, under a representative lead vehicle model informed by traffic data. These strategies fuse a global, offline dynamic programming (DP) optimization with online model predictive control (MPC). We then show how two of the three strategies can be adapted to accommodate the presence of traffic and optimally navigate signalized intersections using infrastructure-to-vehicular (I2V) communication. The MPC optimization, which is local in nature, makes refinements to a coarsely (but globally, subject to grid resolution) optimized target velocity profile from the DP optimization. The three candidate economic MPC formulations that are evaluated include: a nonlinear time-based formulation that directly penalizes predicted fuel consumption, a nonlinear time-based formulation that penalizes braking effort as a surrogate for fuel consumption, and a linear distance-based convex formulation that maintains a tradeoff between energy expenditure and tracking of the coarsely optimized velocity profile obtained from DP. Using a medium-fidelity Simulink model, based on a Volvo truck's longitudinal and engine dynamics, we analyze the optimization's performance on four highway routes under various traffic scenarios. Results demonstrate 3.7-8.3% fuel economy improvement on highway routes without traffic and 6.5-10% on the same routes with traffic included.

"Formulation and Comparison of Two Real-Time Predictive Gear Shift Algorithms for Connected/Automated Heavy-Duty Vehicles","Xu, Chu; Geyer, Stephen; Fathy, Hosam K.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; DP; neural network; rain flow counting; gear shift optimization","Our work investigates the problem of predictive gear scheduling for fuel consumption minimization in connected/automated heavy trucks. The literature highlights the fuel economy benefits of such predictive scheduling, but there is a need to optimize such scheduling online, in real time. To address this need, we begin by using dynamic programming (DP) to schedule gear shifting offline, in a manner that achieves a globally optimal Pareto tradeoff between the conflicting objectives of minimizing fuel consumption and shift frequency. The computational cost of DP is unfavorable for online implementation, but we present two algorithms addressing this issue. Both algorithms rely on the fact that in the Pareto limit where fuel consumption minimization is the sole objective, DP furnishes a simple static shift map . Our first algorithm trains a recurrent neural network to prune the shift schedule generated by this map. The second algorithm performs this pruning in a direct manner tailored to reduce the schedule's rain flow count. We simulate these algorithms for different drive cycles. Both algorithms achieve a reasonable tradeoff between fuel consumption and gear shift frequency. Yet, the rain flow count algorithm is both more effective in approaching the DP-based Pareto front and more computationally efficient.","IEEE","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2019-06-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology; Journal Volume: 68; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 7498-7510","","","AR0000801","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9545","10.1109/TVT.2019.2921702","","2020-06-09T00:00:00Z","1556940","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1556940","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1556940","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","8","68"

As individuals interact and exchange information with, or observe the behaviors of, those in close proximity of themselves, they are likely to shape their behavioral choices accordingly. For this reason, econometric choice models that account for spatial dependency effects have been developed and applied in a number of fields, including transportation. However, spatial dependence models to date have largely defined the strength of association across behavioral units based on spatial or geographic proximity. In the current context of social media platforms and ubiquitous internet and mobile connectivity, the strength of associations among individuals is no longer solely dependent on spatial proximity. Rather, the strength of associations among individuals may be based on shared attitudes and preferences as well. In other words, behavioral choice models may benefit from defining dependency effects based on attitudinal constructs in addition to geographical constructs. In this paper, frequency of usage of car-sharing and ride-hailing services is modeled using a generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) framework that incorporates multi-dimensional dependencies among decision-makers. The model system is estimated on the 2014-2015 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study survey sample, with proximity in latent attitudinal constructs defined by a number of personality trait variables. Model estimation results show that social dependency effects arising from similarities in attitudes and preferences are significant in explaining shared mobility service usage. Ignoring such effects may lead to erroneous estimates of the adoption and usage of future transportation technologies and mobility services.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Performance Analysis of Li-ion Battery Under Various Thermal and Load Conditions","Chatterjee, Krishnashis; Majumdar, Pradip; Schroeder, David; Kilaparti, S. Rao","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels","<p>In the recent years, with the rapid advancements made in the technologies of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, selecting suitable batteries has become a major factor. Among the batteries currently used for these types of vehicles, the lithium-ion battery leads the race. Apart from that, the energy gained from regenerative braking in locomotives and vehicles can be stored in batteries for later use for propulsion thus improving the fuel consumption and efficiency. But batteries can be subjected to a wide range of temperatures depending upon the operating conditions. Thus, a thorough knowledge of the battery performance over a wide range of temperatures and different load conditions is necessary for their successful employment in future technologies. In this context, this study aims to experimentally analyze the performance of Li-ion batteries by monitoring the charge–discharge rates, efficiencies, and energy storage capabilities under different environmental and load conditions. Sensors and thermal imaging camera were used to track the environment and battery temperatures, whereas the charge–discharge characteristics were analyzed using CADEX analyzer. The results show that the battery performance is inversely proportional to charge–discharge rates. This is because, at higher charge–discharge rates, the polarization losses increase thus increasing internal heat generation and battery temperature. Also, based on the efficiency and energy storage ability, the optimum performing conditions of the Li-ion battery are 30–40 °C (temperature) and 0.5 C (C-rate).</p>","ASME","","Northern Illinois Univ., DeKalb, IL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X","","","EE0003975","Journal ID: ISSN 2381-6872","10.1115/1.4041983","","2020-06-18T00:00:00Z","1613977","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613977","","Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage","2","16"

When utilised by a vehicle, this optimal velocity trajectory reduces fuel consumption. The objective of this optimisation problem is to reduce dynamic losses, required tractive force, and completing trip distance with a given travel time. Sequential quadratic programming method is employed for this nonlinearly constrained optimisation problem. When applied to a GM Volt-2, the generated velocity trajectory saves fuel compared to a real-world drive cycle. The simulation results confirm the fuel consumption reduction with the rule-based mode selection and the energy management strategy of a GM Volt 2 model in Autonomie.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IET Intelligent Transport Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1329-1335","","","AR0000788","Journal ID: ISSN 1751-956X","10.1049/iet-its.2018.5110","","2020-10-09T00:00:00Z","1572161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1572161","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572161","IET Intelligent Transport Systems","10","12"

The concept involves injecting the fuel through a small tube within the combustion chamber to facilitate the creation of a leaner mixture in the autoignition zone, relative to a conventional free-spray configuration (i.e., a fuel spray that is not surrounded by a duct). Although previous experiments demonstrated that DFI lowers both soot incandescence and soot mass in a constant-volume combustion vessel with a single-component normal-alkane fuel (n-dodecane), this work provides the first evidence that the technology provides similar benefits in an engine application using a commercial diesel fuel containing ~30 wt% aromatics. The present study investigates the effects on engine-out emissions and efficiency with a two-orifice injector tip for charge-gas mixtures containing 16 and 21 mol% oxygen. The result is that DFI is shown to be effective at curtailing engine-out soot emissions. It also breaks the soot-NO<sub>x</sub> tradeoff by simultaneously attenuating soot and NO. with increasing dilution.","SAE International","","Sandia National Lab.

However, challenges remain due to the lack of effective strategies to enhance the structural integrity of the anode during electrochemical cycling. Here, we develop a nanoscale polyamide coating, using spatial molecular layer deposition (MLD) of m-phenylenediamine and trimesoyl chloride precursors, to preserve the structural integrity of Si anodes. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) has been widely used in Si-based anodes as a binding agent due to its effective binding interactions with Si particles. However, the structural integrity of the anode is compromised by thermochemical decomposition of the poly(acrylic acid) binder, which can occur during electrode drying or during electrochemical cycling. Decomposition causes a 62% decrease in the elastic modulus of the Si anode, as measured by nanoindentation in electrolyte-soaked conditions. This study shows that an ultrathin polyamide coating counteracts this structural degradation, increases the elastic modulus of the degraded anode by 345%, and improves cohesion. Electrochemical analysis of polyamide-coated anodes reveals a film thickness dependence in cycling behavior. High overpotentials and fast capacity fading are observed for Si anodes with a 15 nm coating, whereas Si anodes with a 0.5 nm coating demonstrate stable cycling over 150 cycles with a capacity >1400 mAh g-1. Our findings identify polyamide as an effective electrode coating material to enhance structural integrity, leading to excellent cyclability with higher capacity retention. Furthermore, the use of the spatial MLD approach to deposit the coating enables short deposition time and a facile route to scale-up.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Injecting a gaseous fuel in the intake port significantly reduces the volumetric efficiency and consequently torque as compared to gasoline. In addition to eliminating the volumetric efficiency challenge, direct injection (DI) of natural gas (NG) can enhance the in-cylinder flow, mixing, and combustion process resulting in improved efficiency and performance. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach to model high-pressure gaseous injection was developed and validated against X-ray data from Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source. NG side and central DI of various designs and injection strategies were assessed experimentally along with CFD correlation. Significant effects on combustion metrics were quantified and explained via improved understanding of the in-cylinder flow effects due to NG injection. On-demand in-cylinder blending using E10 PFI and NG DI provides an additional lever to adjust in-cylinder turbulence as well as knock resistance across the engine speed and load range. NG DI improves part-load dilution tolerance due to higher in-cylinder turbulence and the high knock resistance of NG compared to E10 improves wide open throttle (WOT) performance while enabling increased compression ratios (CR). Vehicle level simulations suggest that implementing this strategy on a ½ ton pick-up truck with a naturally aspirated engine at 12.5:1 CR improves energy consumption on the aggressive US06 drive cycle by 15.5% compared to E10 operation, and gives a petroleum reduction of 78% over the blended range. There are challenges regarding market acceptance and widespread adoption of dual-fuel NG-gasoline vehicle applications beyond the performance degradation when the vehicle runs out of natural gas. Furthermore, those challenges include practical concerns such as loss of cargo volume and payload due to the NG storage tank, extended NG refueling times, fueling convenience due to gasoline and NG fuel tanks, and limited NG fueling infrastructure.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

"Analytical Examination of the Relationship between Fuel Properties, Engine Efficiency, and R Factor Values","Sluder, C. Scott","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","<p>The variability in gasoline energy content, though most frequently not a consumer concern, is an issue of concern for vehicle manufacturers in demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements. Advancements in both vehicle technology, test methodology, and fuel formulations have increased the level of visibility and concern with regard to the energy content of fuels used for regulatory testing.</p><p>The R factor was introduced into fuel economy calculations for vehicle certification in the late 1980s as a means of addressing batch-to-batch variations in the heating value of certification fuels and the resulting variations in fuel economy results. While previous studies have investigated values of the R factor for modern vehicles through experimentation, subsequent engine studies have made clear that it is difficult to distinguish between the confounding factors that influence engine efficiency when R is being studied experimentally.</p><p>The proposed study focuses on an analytical approach to examining the heating value effects so that R values can be studied without the influence of confounding effects of other fuel properties. Data previously published for a 1.6-liter naturally-aspirated engine are used as a case study to explore the relationship between fuel properties, engine efficiency, and R factor values. The results demonstrate that engine efficiency does vary as a result of differences in heating value among fuels, although other factors that are variant among fuels also impact efficiency. R factor values depend not only on the difference in heating value between two fuels, but also on the directionality of the change and on engine operating loads. The latter is integral because the reference engine efficiency point is itself a function of the engine operating condition. R factor values asymptotically approach unity as engine operating load increases. Increasing engine efficiency causes R values for a given test fuel to increase. A method is presented for which the test data from only one fuel is required to establish R factor values for individual vehicles and test cycles. An alternative method of establishing Indolene fuel economy equivalency for certification tests is also discussed.</p>","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Various low reactivity gasoline-range fuels were compared with ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) for steady-state engine performance and emissions. Specially, particulate matter (PM) emissions were examined for their mass, size and number concentrations, and further characterized by organic/elemental carbon analysis, chemical speciation and thermogravimetric analysis. As more fuel-efficient PPCI combustion was promoted, a slight reduction in fuel consumption was observed for all gasoline-range fuels, which also had higher heating values than ULSD. Since mixing-controlled combustion dominated the latter part of the combustion process, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were only slightly increased with the gasoline-range fuels. In contrast, soot emissions were significantly reduced with the gasoline-range fuels, including a ~70% reduction in micro soot sensor measurements and a >50% reduction in smoke meter measurements. All gasoline-range fuel PM samples were also found to contain higher amount of volatile species and organic carbon fractions compared to ULSD PM samples as measured by thermogravimetric and EC-OC analyses. Various partially oxidized HC species and nitrophenolic compounds were also detected by TDP-GC-MS and CE-MS techniques, which implied that more pronounced PPCI combustion occurred with the gasoline-range fuels. As a whole similar PM oxidation behavior was observed despite the differences in reactivity and chemical properties of the fuels, even though there may be some significant impacts under certain operating conditions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The investigation began by establishing baseline and repeatability of energy consumption at various battery states of charge. It was determined that drive cycle energy consumption under a randomized set of boundary conditions varied within 3.6% of mean energy consumption regardless of initial battery state of charge. After completing 30 baseline drive cycles, a design for six sigma (DFSS) L18 array was designed to look at sensitivity of a range of parameters to energy consumption as related to connected and automated vehicles to target highest return on engineering development effort. The parameters explored in the DFSS array that showed the most sensitivity, in order of importance, were battery state of charge, vehicle mass, propulsion system thermal conditioning, HVAC setting and driver behavior.

"Effects of Fuel Properties on Particle Number and Particle Mass Emissions from Lean and Stoichiometric Gasoline Direct Injection Engine Operation","Bock, Noah; Jeon, Joonho; Kittelson, David; Northrop, William","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Particulate matter (PM); Fuel economy; Energy conservation; Particulate filters; Emissions; Pressure; Gasoline","Engine-out particle size distributions and soot mass emissions were measured from a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine fueled by seven different gasoline formulations. Additionally, particle size distributions were simultaneously measured downstream of a catalyzed gasoline particulate filter (GPF) to determine the size resolved filtration efficiency. Stoichiometric, lean homogeneous, and lean stratified combustion modes were studied at four steady-state engine conditions. The particulate matter (PM) Index was calculated for each fuel as a function of the double bond equivalent and vapor pressure of the fuel components. There was generally poor correlation between particle number (PN)/PM mass emissions and the PM Index for steady state stoichiometric conditions with clean injectors, which emitted low particle concentrations. However, under high-load lean homogeneous conditions, there was good correlation between PN/PM mass emission and the PM Index, with the exception that the high ethanol content fuel produced significantly higher PM emissions than the other fuels. Under lean stratified conditions, most fuels produced similar particle size distributions and concentrations with the exception that the E50 fuel produced significantly lower concentrations than the other fuels. These results demonstrate the profound sensitivity of particle emissions from high ethanol content fuel to engine operating conditions. Additionally, these results show the predominant factor influencing particle formation is charge mixture formation, which fuel properties influence, but not as significantly as engine conditions. Here, the GPF reduced the tailpipe particle number concentrations by 60 - 95% and showed evidence of passive regeneration under higher load lean engine conditions (Temp>400°C, Lambda>1.3). Total PN filtration efficiencies ranged from ~60 % with a clean filter to greater than 95% with as little as 25 mg/L of soot loaded on the filter with a most penetrating particle size (MPPS) between 100 and 150 nm.

"Navigation Application Programming Interface Route Fuel Saving Opportunity Assessment on Large-Scale Real-World Travel Data for Conventional Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles","Zhu, Lei; Holden, Jacob R.; Gonder, Jeffrey D.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; data analysis; evaluation and assessment; fuel consumption; global positioning system; hybrid vehicles; intelligent transportation systems; navigation","The green-routing strategy instructing a vehicle to select a fuel-efficient route benefits the current transportation system with fuel-saving opportunities. This paper introduces a navigation application programming interface (API), route fuel-saving evaluation framework for estimating fuel advantages of alternative API routes based on large-scale, real-world travel data for conventional vehicles (CVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Navigation APIs, such as Google Directions API, integrate traffic conditions and provide feasible alternative routes for origin-destination pairs. This paper develops two link-based fuel-consumption models stratified by link-level speed, road grade, and functional class (local/non-local), one for CVs and the other for HEVs. The link-based fuel-consumption models are built by assigning travel from many global positioning system driving traces to the links in TomTom MultiNet and road grade data from the U.S. Geological Survey elevation data set. Fuel consumption on a link is computed by the proposed model. This paper envisions two kinds of applications: (1) identifying alternate routes that save fuel, and (2) quantifying the potential fuel savings for large amounts of travel. An experiment based on a large-scale California Household Travel Survey global positioning system trajectory data set is conducted. The fuel consumption and savings of CVs and HEVs are investigated. At the same time, the trade-off between fuel saving and travel time due to choosing different routes is also examined for both powertrains.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using ducted fuel injection to attenuate or prevent soot formation in mixing-controlled combustion strategies for engine applications","Gehmlich, R. K.; Mueller, C. J.; Ruth, D. J.; Nilsen, C. W.; Skeen, S. A.; Manin, J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Soot; Duct; Diesel; Spray; Mixing; Combustion","Ducted fuel injection is a strategy that can be used to enhance the fuel/charge-gas mixing within the combustion chamber of a direct-injection compression-ignition engine. The concept involves injecting the fuel through a small tube within the combustion chamber to make the most fuel-rich regions of the micture in the autoignition zone leaner relative to a conventional free-spray configuration (i.e., a fuel spray that is not surrounded by a duct). This study is a follow-on to initial proof-of-concept experiments that also were conducted in a constant-volume combustion vessel. While the initial natural luminosity imaging experiments demonstrated that ducted fuel injection lowers soot incandescence dramatically, this work adds a more quantitative diffuse back-illumination diagnostic to measure soot mass, as well as investigates the effects on performance of varying duct geometry (axial gap, length, diameter, and inlet and outlet shapes), ambient density, and charge-gas dilution level. The result is that ducted fuel injection is further proven to be effective at lowering soot by 35–100% across a wide range of operating conditions and geometries, and guidance is offered on geometric parameters that are most important for improving performance and facilitating packaging for engine applications.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Correlation of nanoparticle size distribution features to spatiotemporal flame luminosity in gasoline direct injection engines","Jeon, Joonho; Bock, Noah; Kittelson, David B.; Northrop, William F.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Gasoline direct injection engines; particle size distribution; flame light intensity; soot formation; lean combustion","Particle size distribution measured by mobility instruments is a common diagnostic used to characterize ultrafine and nanoparticle emissions in engine exhaust; however, some features of particle size distribution data are poorly correlated to in-cylinder combustion phenomena. In this work, in-cylinder spatiotemporal flame luminosity is quantitatively correlated to features in the solid particle size distribution measured in the exhaust of a gasoline direct injection engine operating in lean and stoichiometric combustion modes. A multi-channel optical sensor was used to measure diffusion flame light intensity in different areas of the combustion chamber. Furthermore, total solid particle number and particle size distribution in the exhaust were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer after a catalytic stripper that removed semi-volatile compounds. Results of the experiments showed that different flame phenomenon resulted in distinct particle size distribution characteristics. A large accumulation mode (particles with diameter of 50–100 nm) in the particle size distribution from stoichiometric engine operation with early injection resulted from anomalous diffusion flames like piston-top pool fires. In lean operation incorporating a secondary fuel injection, particle emissions were dominated by flame propagation through fuel-rich regions of the combustion chamber resulting in a comparatively broad particle size distribution. More generally, this work illustrates how particle size distribution data can be more accurately used to diagnose soot formation in gasoline direct injection engines.","SAGE","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

"Quantitative Evaluation of MD/HD Vehicle Electrification using Statistical Data","Gao, Zhiming; Lin, Zhenhong; Davis, Stacy Cagle; Birky, Alicia K.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This paper presents a wide-ranging analysis of Class 3-8 commercial vehicle electrification by means of developing a framework tool which uses a quantitative method of estimating electric vehicle energy consumption and appropriate charging considerations. The Fleet DNA composite statistics on real-world driving behavior is used to evaluate feasible or market-ready battery electric vehicle (BEV) technologies in medium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) applications. In the paper, ten representative Class 3-8 commercial vehicle electrifications have been evaluated as a function of various service coverages, including applications in port drayage tractors, refuse trucks, delivery trucks, buses, and bucket trucks. The results indicate significant energy savings and fuel cost savings across all MD/HD vehicle electrifications. The majority of MD BEVs, with the exception of Class 3 bucket trucks, achieve better than a 5-year payback with 50–75% service coverage. For HD BEVs, with the exception of the Class 8 port drayage tractors, the 90% service coverage results in a 10-year or longer payback time, while the 50% service coverage yields a 7–8 year payback. Class 8 port drayage tractors should achieve payback in no more than a 3.5 years with 50–75% service coverage. Thus, the analysis indicates a highly feasible potential for Class 3-6 MD vehicles to be electrified, and feasible opportunities for electrification in Class 7-8 HD short-distance applications.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Progress toward understanding vortex generation in stepped-lip diesel engine combustion chambers","Busch, Stephen; Perini, Federico","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Stepped-lip diesel pistons can enhance in-cylinder vortex formation and thereby improve the thermal efficiency and emissions behavior of a diesel engine. Further improvements to diesel combustion systems may be realized through improved understanding of the mechanisms by which fuel sprays interact with pistons to form vortices. Analysis of computational fluid dynamics simulations provides insight about vorticity formation in one particular region of a particular stepped-lip combustion chamber. Interactions at the boundary between the sprays and the piston surface are a source of new vorticity that is transported upward and outward. This process is believed to be the origin of an energetic vortex that has been experimentally observed in the outermost region of the combustion chamber during the mixing-controlled combustion process, and is associated with improved turbulent mixing.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Trip Energy Estimation Methodology and Model Based on Real-World Driving Data for Green-Routing Applications","Holden, Jacob; Van Til, Harrison; Wood, Eric; Zhu, Lei; Gonder, Jeffrey; Shirk, Matthew","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; energy estimation; drive cycles; green routing; GPS trajectories; transportation data; trip energy","A data-informed model to predict energy use for a proposed vehicle trip has been developed in this paper. The methodology leverages roughly one million miles of real-world driving data to generate the estimation model. Driving is categorized at the sub-trip level by average speed, road gradient, and road network geometry, then aggregated by category. An average energy consumption rate is determined for each category, creating an energy rate look-up table. Proposed vehicle trips are then categorized in the same manner, and estimated energy rates are appended from the look-up table. The methodology is robust and applicable to a wide range of driving data. The model has been trained on vehicle travel profiles from the Transportation Secure Data Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and validated against on-road fuel consumption data from testing in Phoenix, Arizona. When compared against the detailed on-road conventional vehicle fuel consumption test data, the energy estimation model accurately predicted which route would consume less fuel over a dozen different tests. When compared against a larger set of real-world origin-destination pairs, it is estimated that implementing the present methodology should accurately select the route that consumes the least fuel 90% of the time. The model results can be used to inform control strategies in routing tools, such as change in departure time, alternate routing, and alternate destinations to reduce energy consumption. This work provides a highly extensible framework that allows the model to be tuned to a specific driver or vehicle type.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition to traditional traveler advisory systems such as dynamic message signs (DMS) and 511 systems, probe data are being used for automatic incident detection, integrated corridor management (ICM), end of queue warning systems, and mobility-related smartphone applications. Several private sector vendors offer minute by minute network-wide travel time and speed probe data. The quality of such data in terms of deviation of the reported travel time and speeds from ground-truth has been extensively studied in recent years, and as a result concerns over the accuracy of probe data have mostly faded away. However, the latency of probe data - defined as the lag between the time at which disturbance in traffic speed is reported in the outsourced data feed, and the time at which the traffic is perturbed - has become a subject of interest. The extent of latency of probe data for real-time applications is critical, so it is important to have a good understanding of the amount of latency and its influencing factors. This paper uses high-quality independent Bluetooth/Wi-Fi re-identification data collected on multiple freeway segments in three different states, to measure the latency of the vehicle probe data provided by three major vendors. The statistical distribution of the latency and its sensitivity to speed slowdown and recovery periods are discussed.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The highest volume predictions, for 100,000 and 500,000 units per year, result in a total system cost of 50/kWnet and 45/kWnet, respectively. The assumptions and methodology of the DFMA® analysis of the 2017 baseline FC system were validated by comparison with the FC system in the commercially available Toyota Mirai.

DC fast charging (DCFC) increases customer convenience by lowering charging time, enables long-distance EV travel, and could allow the electrification of high-mileage fleets. Yet, high capital costs and uneven power demand have been major challenges to the widespread deployment of DCFC stations. There is a need to better understand DCFC stations' loading and customer service quality. Furthermore, the relationship between the initial investment decision on building certain number of ports and customer satisfaction should be quantified. This paper aims to analyze these aspects using one million vehicle days of travel data within the Columbus, OH, USA, region. Monte Carlo analysis is carried out in three types of areas - urban, suburban, and rural - to quantify the effect of uncertain parameters on DCFC station loading and service quality. Additional simulations based on a homogeneous vehicle population are carried out, and closed-form equations are derived therefrom to estimate charging duration and waiting time in the queue.

In this study, utilizing toluene primary reference fuels (TPRF) as a gasoline surrogate and a recently developed multicomponent gasoline kinetic mechanism, we have demonstrated a general approach to analyze autoignition in arbitrary spark-ignition (SI) and advanced compression ignition (ACI) engine conditions by combining thermodynamic pressure-temperature trajectory and the fuel ignition delay iso-contours. This method allows direct evaluation of controlling chemistry, potential involvement of low temperature heat release, and the dependence of autoignition to conventional fuel metrics (research and motor octane rating, i.e., RON and MON, and octane sensitivity OS = RON-MON) and engine operating conditions such as equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) ratio and engine intake conditions. Applying the analysis to the pressure-temperature trajectories of the conventional RON and MON tests, as well as those beyond RON and beyond MON, distinct roles of conventional gasoline fuel metrics and engine operating parameters are identified for all representative engine conditions. By comparing the autoignition behavior in ACI and SI engine conditions, the knowledge obtained from SI engine knock cannot be directly transferred to ACI bulk combustion phasing control in general, due to the different mixture equivalence ratios and the associated differences in reactivity and its dependence. Furthermore, this method could be extended to generate an auto-ignition map for arbitrary fuels and arbitrary engine trajectories, and the useful insights and overall evaluations can be used to complement conventional kinetic simulation of engine cycles.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"CFD-Guided Combustion System Optimization of a Gasoline Range Fuel in a Heavy-Duty Compression Ignition Engine Using Automatic Piston Geometry Generation and a Supercomputer","Pei, Yuanjiang; Pal, Pinaki; Zhang, Yu; Traver, Michael; Cleary, David; Futterer, Carsten; Brenner, Mattia; Probst, Daniel; Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) guided combustion system optimization was conducted for a heavy-duty diesel engine running with a gasoline fuel that has a research octane number (RON) of 80. The goal was to optimize the gasoline compression ignition (GCI) combustion recipe (piston bowl geometry, injector spray pattern, in-cylinder swirl motion, and thermal boundary conditions) for improved fuel efficiency while maintaining engine-out NO<sub>x</sub> within a 1-1.5 g/kW-hr window. The numerical model was developed using the multi-dimensional CFD software CONVERGE. A two-stage design of experiments (DoE) approach was employed with the first stage focusing on the piston bowl shape optimization and the second addressing refinement of the combustion recipe. For optimizing the piston bowl geometry, a software tool, CAESES, was utilized to automatically perturb key bowl design parameters. This led to the generation of 256 combustion chamber designs evaluated at several engine operating conditions. The second DoE campaign was conducted to optimize injector spray patterns, fuel injection strategies and in-cylinder swirl motion for the best performing piston bowl designs from the first DoE campaign. This comprehensive optimization study was performed on a supercomputer, Mira, to accelerate the development of an optimized fuel-efficiency focused design. Compared to the production combustion system in the baseline engine, the new combustion recipe from this study showed significantly improved closed-cycle fuel efficiency across key engine operating points while meeting the engine-out NO<sub>x</sub> targets. Optimized piston bowl designs and injector spray patterns were predicted to provide enhanced in-cylinder air utilization and more rapid mixing-controlled combustion, thereby leading to a fuel efficiency improvement. In addition, shifting the engine thermal boundary conditions toward leaner operation was also key to the improved fuel efficiency.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

"Influence of Charge Motion and Compression Ratio on the Performance of a Combustion Concept Employing In-Cylinder Gasoline and Natural Gas Blending","Sevik, James; Pamminger, Michael; Wallner, Thomas; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Wooldridge, Steven; Boyer, Brad; Miers, Scott; Hall, Carrie","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Combustion; Fuels; Engines; Compression; Cylinders; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gasoline; Plates (structures); Natural gas; Stress","Here, the present paper represents a small piece of an extensive experimental effort investigating the dual-fuel operation of a light-duty spark ignited engine. Natural gas (NG) was directly injected into the cylinder and gasoline was injected into the intake-port. Direct injection (DI) of NG was used in order to overcome the power density loss usually experienced with NG port-fuel injection (PFI) as it allows an injection after intake valve closing. Having two separate fuel systems allows for a continuum of in-cylinder blend levels from pure gasoline to pure NG operation. The huge benefit of gasoline is its availability and energy density, whereas NG allows efficient operation at high load due to improved combustion phasing enabled by its higher knock resistance. Furthermore, using NG allowed a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions across the entire engine map due to the higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was used to (a) increase efficiency at low and part-load operation and (b) reduce the propensity of knock at higher compression ratios (CRs) thereby enabling blend levels with greater amount of gasoline across a wider operating range. Two integral engine parameters, CR and incylinder turbulence levels, were varied in order to study their influence on efficiency, emissions, and performance over a specific speed and load range. Increasing the CR from 10.5 to 14.5 allowed an absolute increase in indicated thermal efficiency of more than 3% for 75% NG (25% gasoline) operation at 8 bar net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and 2500 rpm. However, as anticipated, the achievable peak load at CR 14.5 with 100% gasoline was greatly reduced due to its lower knock resistance. The incylinder turbulence level was varied by means of tumble plates (TPs) as well as an insert for the NG injector that guides the injection “spray” to augment the tumble motion. The usage of TPs showed a significant increase in EGR dilution tolerance for pure gasoline operation, however, no such impact was found for blended operation of gasoline and NG.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

Utilizing wireless power transfer (WPT) technology to charge the SAEVs provides perfect fits for realizing a fully automated mobility system. However, the investment in wireless charging infrastructure (WCI) presents a critical barrier for commercializing and adopting this technology. The barrier can be cleared by realizing the proper design of the WPT system that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the cost of WCI at the same time. This paper introduces a system design optimization tool and methodology for WCI for serving fixed-route SAEVs in automated mobility districts (AMDs). The tool offers the capability of integrating driving data (simulated or collected from the real world), vehicle parameters (e.g., battery, motor, dimensions, and so on), and wireless charger characteristics (rate, locations, alignment, and so on) to generate energy and state-of-charge profiles for each vehicle, considering motoring, regenerative braking, and charging. Furthermore, the proposed tool incorporates a multi-objective optimization layer for searching the optimum design parameters based on predefined objectives and constraints. The proposed method was utilized to design the WCI for a hypothetical AMD scenario with four SAEVs. The outcomes show that implementing in-route wireless chargers at designated stops for the SAEVs with maximum power level has the potential to provide a charge sustaining operation with 52% reduction in the on-board battery and presents the most cost-effective solution. The proposed solution is assessed in comparison with other charging technologies, such as stationary WPT and dc fast charging, and it shows the most feasible option for an AMD network in terms of cost, convenience, and performance.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, two deep learning models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are proposed to predict travel time in a road network. One major advantage of using deep learning for travel time prediction is that it can make accurate predictions for all the segments in the transportation network with a single model structure, instead of building customized models for each segment separately. The proposed models were evaluated on a transportation network in the City of Saint Louis, Missouri. The prediction results show that deep learning can provide accurate prediction for both congested and uncongested traffic conditions, and can successfully capture the traffic dynamics of unexpected incidents or special events. The study findings show that deep learning offers a promising approach to real-time prediction of travel times on a network scale.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Reduction of Cyclic Variations by Using Advanced Ignition Systems in a Lean-Burn Stationary Natural Gas Engine Operating at 10 Bar BMEP and 1800 rpm","Almansour, Bader; Vasu, Subith; Gupta, Sreenath","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; natural gas engines; ignition and combustion instability; laser ignition; advanced ignition systems","In stationary natural gas engines, lean-burn combustion offers higher engine efficiencies with simultaneous compliance with emission regulations. A prominent problem that one encounters with lean operation is cyclic variations. Advanced ignition systems offer a potential solution as they suppress cylic variations in addition to extending the lean ignition limit. In this paper, the performance of three ignition systems – conventional spark ignition (SI), single point laser ignition (LI) and pre-chamber equipped laser ignition (PCLI) - in a single-cylinder natural gas engine is presented. First, a thorough discussion regarding the efficacy of several metrics, in addition to COV_IMEP, in representing combustion instability is presented. This is followed by a discussion about the performance of the three ignition systems at a single operational condition, i.e., same excess-air ratio (λ) and ignition timing (IT). Next, these metrics are compared at the most optimal operational points for each ignition system, i.e., at points where λ and IT are optimized to achieve highest efficiency. From these observations, it is noted that PCLI achieves highest increase in engine efficiency, Δη = 2.1% points, and outperforms the other two methods of ignition. In conclusion, a closer look reveals that the variation in Ignition Delay (COV_ID) was negligible, whereas that in combustion duration (COV_CD) was significantly lower by 2.2% points. However, the metrics COV_ID and COV_CD are not well correlated with COV_IMEP.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, we investigate the residual values of PEVs and compare them with those of other vehicle powertrain technologies using the “true market value” data from Edmunds.com, and considering U.S. federal incentives. We define the adjusted retention rate as the ratio between resale value and the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, subtracting incentives. We develop statistical models to quantify the effects of powertrain technologies on residual value while controlling key factors, including vehicle size, brand, and market segments. We find that the long-range high-performance Tesla Model S holds value significantly better than any other vehicle type evaluated, including internal combustion engine vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles and plugin hybrid electric vehicles are comparable to one another. They hold slightly less value than internal combustion engine vehicles, but significantly more than short-range (<125 miles) battery electric vehicles. However, short-range battery electric vehicles have a faster improvement in 3-year adjusted retention rate than any other powertrain technology from model year 2013–2014. Finally, the other factor that significantly influences adjusted retention rate is the home country of the vehicle manufacturer (e.g., United States, Japan, or Germany).","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

A refueling infrastructure network that guarantees adequate coverage and expands in line with vehicle sales is required for FCEVs to be successfully adopted by private customers. In this article, we provide an overview of modelling methodologies used to project hydrogen refueling infrastructure requirements to support FCEV adoption, and we describe, in detail, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's scenario evaluation and regionalization analysis (SERA) model. As an example, we use SERA to explore two alternative scenarios of FCEV adoption: one in which FCEV deployment is limited to California and several major cities in the United States; and one in which FCEVs reach widespread adoption, becoming a major option as passenger vehicles across the entire country. Such scenarios can provide guidance and insights for efforts required to deploy the infrastructure supporting transition toward different levels of hydrogen use as a transportation fuel for passenger vehicles in the United States.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Gasoline blends with various ABE content (0 vol % to 80 vol % ABE, referred to as G100, ABE10, ABE20, ABE30, ABE60, and ABE80, respectively) were used as test fuels, where the volumetric concentration of A/B/E was 3:6:1. The experiments were conducted at engine loads of 3, 4, 5, and 6 bar brake mean effective pressure at an engine speed of 1200 rpm and under various equivalence ratios (Φ = 0.83–1.25). The results showed that ABE addition in the fuel blends could increase brake thermal efficiency and decrease unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), carbon dioxide (CO), and oxynitride (NO<sub>x</sub>). As for unregulated emissions, acetaldehyde and 1,3-budatiene emissions increased with the increased ABE content in blend fuels.

One major barrier to greater consumer acceptance of PEVs is the lack of home parking spaces for charging outlets. This paper developed a methodology to estimate the residential parking ratios (parking spaces vs household numbers) and project the residential community-weighted parking availabilities (home parking availabilities) in China, by area and by province, through data mining from several major real estate trading network platforms. The results show that the home parking availabilities from 2015 to 2050 vary by geographic areas and building life expectancy. A method was developed to quantify the shadow values of home parking impacting on PEV ownership costs and combined with Monte Carlo simulation to address estimation uncertainty. Depending on the PEV type and all-electric range, the value of home parking space to a PEV owner, measured by the reduced vehicle ownership cost, ranges from $2399 USD to 10,802 USD. Finally, the total incremental shadow value, relative to the 2015 situation, of the home parking availability for PEV owners increases over time due to both improvement in home parking availability and increase in the PEV population, and is estimated to reach over 2.51 billion USD by 2025 (U.S. dollars in 2015 level).","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Re-additization of commercial biodiesel blends during long-term storage","Christensen, Earl D.; Alleman, Teresa; McCormick, Robert L.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; renewable fuel; biodiesel; oxidation stability; storage stability; antioxidant","Commercial biodiesel blends were aged at 43 degrees C while monitoring stability. The oxidation stability -- or oxidation reserve expressed as Rancimat induction period (IP) -- gradually decreased from its initial value. At a predetermined IP threshold, an antioxidant was used to restore IP to the ASTM D7467 specification minimum of 6 h, referred to as re-additization. At lower IP values, the amount of antioxidant required increased significantly, and the effectiveness tended to be reduced. Once IP fell to essentially zero, the acid content increased to above the allowable limit and insoluble material was also detected. Storage life was increased relative to the as-received fuels as evidenced by longer time to produce acids. Experience in the field may vary based on storage conditions; however, these results indicate re-additization can significantly increase storage life of biodiesel blends when used with regular monitoring of IP and acid number. An assessment of the storage stability of the as-received fuels showed that the initial IP did not predict storage behavior, although fuels above the specification minimum remained stable for >12 weeks accelerated aging (1 year simulated).","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Measurement of Heat of Vaporization for Research Gasolines and Ethanol Blends by DSC/TGA","Fioroni, Gina M.; Fouts, Lisa A.; Christensen, Earl D.; Anderson, James E.; McCormick, Robert L.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; gasoline; engine knock; heat of vaporization; differential scanning calorimetry; thermogravimetric analysis","The heat of vaporization (HOV) is a relatively poorly studied fuel property that can be related to a fuel's evaporation characteristics and knock resistance and, therefore, the emissions and efficiency of direct-injection spark-ignition engines. Methods for measuring the HOV of complex gasoline mixtures and blends of gasoline with ethanol and other oxygenates require additional development. Recently, we described a differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric (DSC/TGA) method to perform HOV measurements. Herein we describe a detailed investigation of factors affecting the precision and accuracy of the DSC/TGA method and examine enthalpy evolution and mass loss rate for research gasolines as a function of fraction evaporated. Examination of n-hexane evaporation using several DSC/TGA pan/lid configurations showed that initial sample loss can be reduced using a well-fitting pinhole lid on the sample pan, which reduces the evaporation rate during the balance of the experiment. However, additional experiments with research gasolines revealed that tight lid placement on the pans is not always achieved. Nevertheless, accurate total HOV measurements, with less than 10% initial sample loss, could be achieved for low volatility gasolines regardless of lid placement. A higher mass loss might be expected for higher vapor pressure (wintertime) gasolines. Because of variations in pan lids and their placement and their significant impact on results, quantitative comparisons between different samples of mass loss rate and heat flow curves versus time or fraction evaporated are not yet possible. However, features in the mass loss rate and heat flow curves are reproducible. Furthermore, results show that ethanol-gasoline blend evaporation is highly influenced by the formation of near-azeotropic mixtures of ethanol and specific gasoline components, causing a flattening of the mass and heat curves, with a sharp evaporation rate reduction after the ethanol is evaporated.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, the direct comparison with X-Ray measurements done at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory will be described. This allows an evaluation of the OCM technique and a comparison of the different measurement quantities in the first 500 μm range of the spray. The structure of the spray is measured by X-Ray phase contrast imaging and the fuel mass distribution is measured by X-Ray absorption imaging. A detailed comparison of the two X-Ray techniques and the OCM technique has been possible for the first time. It is found that the measurement data of the spray near field are very congruent with all three methods. Due to this comparison, the measurement of the non-perturbed length, which describes the distance from the nozzle orifice up to the point where the formation of surface disturbances is starting, by the OCM is validated for the first time. Within this non-perturbed length of the spray, the OCM signal is weak before it starts to illuminate from the scattering of the perturbed surface. Hence, the OCM technique can deliver two characteristic length scales, the <em>non-perturbed length</em> and the <em>breakup length</em>, characterizing the primary spray breakup.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

A.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Oscillations; Pressure; Combustion; Fuels; Engines; Pressure transducers; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel; Cylinders; Computer simulation","In an earlier publication, the authors compared numerical predictions of the mean cylinder pressure of diesel and dual-fuel combustion, to that of measured pressure data from a medium-speed, large-bore engine. In these earlier comparisons, measured data from a flush-mounted in-cylinder pressure transducer showed notable and repeatable pressure oscillations which were not evident in the mean cylinder pressure predictions from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this paper, the authors present a methodology for predicting and reporting the local cylinder pressure consistent with that of a measurement location. Such predictions for large-bore, medium-speed engine operation demonstrate pressure oscillations in accordance with those measured. The temporal occurrences of notable pressure oscillations were during the start of combustion and around the time of maximum cylinder pressure. With appropriate resolutions in time steps and mesh sizes, the local cell static pressure predicted for the transducer location showed oscillations in both diesel and dual-fuel combustion modes which agreed with those observed in the experimental data. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis on both experimental and calculated pressure traces revealed that the CFD predictions successfully captured both the amplitude and frequency range of the oscillations. Furthermore, resolving propagating pressure waves with the smaller time steps and grid sizes necessary to achieve these results required a significant increase in computer resources.","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Coordinated platooning with multiple speeds","Luo, Fengqiao; Larson, Jeffrey; Munson, Todd","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimization modeling; Vehicle platooning routing","In a platoon, vehicles travel one after another with small intervehicle distances; trailing vehicles in a platoon save fuel because they experience less aerodynamic drag. This work presents a coordinated platooning model with multiple speed options that integrates scheduling, routing, speed selection, and platoon formation/dissolution in a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total fuel consumed by a set of vehicles while traveling between their respective origins and destinations. The performance of this model is numerically tested on a grid network and the Chicago-area highway network. We find that the fuel-savings factor of a multivehicle system significantly depends on the time each vehicle is allowed to stay in the network; this time affects vehicles’ available speed choices, possible routes, and the amount of time for coordinating platoon formation. For problem instances with a large number of vehicles, we propose and test a heuristic decomposed approach that applies a clustering algorithm to partition the set of vehicles and then routes each group separately. When the set of vehicles is large and the available computational time is small, the decomposed approach finds significantly better solutions than does the full model.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Global Sensitivity Analysis and Estimation of Model Error, Toward Uncertainty Quantification in Scramjet Computations","Huan, Xun; Safta, Cosmin; Sargsyan, Khachik; Geraci, Gianluca; Eldred, Michael S.; Vane, Zachary P.; Lacaze, Guilhem; Oefelein, Joseph C.; Najm, Habib N.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","The development of scramjet engines is an important research area for advancing hypersonic and orbital flights. Progress toward optimal engine designs requires accurate flow simulations together with uncertainty quantification. However, performing uncertainty quantification for scramjet simulations is challenging due to the large number of uncertain parameters involved and the high computational cost of flow simulations. These difficulties are addressed in this paper by developing practical uncertainty quantification algorithms and computational methods, and deploying them in the current study to large-eddy simulations of a jet in crossflow inside a simplified HIFiRE Direct Connect Rig scramjet combustor. First, global sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential uncertain input parameters, which can help reduce the system’s stochastic dimension. Second, because models of different fidelity are used in the overall uncertainty quantification assessment, a framework for quantifying and propagating the uncertainty due to model error is presented. In conclusion, these methods are demonstrated on a nonreacting jet-in-crossflow test problem in a simplified scramjet geometry, with parameter space up to 24 dimensions, using static and dynamic treatments of the turbulence subgrid model, and with two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries.","AIAA","","Sandia National Lab.

In order to design an optimal thick electrode, understanding how performance loss occurs is necessary. While it is known that both ionic and electronic conductivity contribute to rate performance, we observed a stronger correlation between electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of electrodes at a loading of >25 mg/cm<sup>2</sup> under C/3 to 1C, rates most relevant to electric vehicle applications. To illustrate this effect, we explore the mud-cracking phenomenon during electrode fabrication to obtain narrow, vertical channels which reduce electrode tortuosity, and therefore decrease the liquid phase ionic resistance in thick electrodes. Variation in crack densities enables us to systematically investigate the effects of ionic and electronic conductivity on electrochemical performance in electrodes with identical overall porosity and composition. Rate and cycling performances of mud-cracked thick electrodes have stronger correlations with electronic conductivity than ionic conductivity. These findings shed new light on the relative importance of electronic versus ionic conductivities, arguing for the need to further optimize electronic conduction in thick electrodes when they are cycled in conditions relevant to electric vehicle applications.","The Electrochemical Society","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technologies Office (EE-3V)","","United States","2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society Journal Volume: 165 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: p.

These results were presented at the 5th Workshop of the ECN in Detroit, Michigan. Application of x-ray diagnostics to the Spray D standard cold condition enabled quantification of distributions of mass, phase interfacial area, and droplet size in the near-nozzle region from 0.1 to 14 mm from the nozzle exit. Using these data, several modeling frameworks, from Lagrangian-Eulerian to Eulerian-Eulerian and from Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), were assessed in their ability to capture and explain experimentally observed spray details. Due to its computational efficiency, the Lagrangian-Eulerian approach was able to provide spray predictions across a broad range of conditions. In general, this “engineering-level” simulation was able to reproduce the details of the droplet size distribution throughout the spray after calibration of the spray breakup model constants against the experimental data. Complementary to this approach, higher-fidelity modeling techniques were able to provide detailed insight into the experimental trends. For example, interface-capturing multiphase simulations were able to capture the experimentally observed bimodal behavior in the transverse interfacial area distributions in the near-nozzle region. Further analysis of the spray predictions suggests that peaks in the interfacial area distribution may coincide with regions of finely atomized droplets, whereas local minima may coincide with regions of continuous liquid structures. Lastly, the results from this study highlight the potential of x-ray diagnostics to reveal salient details of the near-nozzle spray structure and to guide improvements to existing primary atomization modeling approaches.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

Using a stock-flow model, we compare a baseline scenario with scenarios that incorporate an exemplary technological innovation: a novel aluminum–cerium–magnesium alloy. We find that the introduction of the novel alloy demonstrates that even low penetration rates can exceed domestic cerium production capacity, illustrating possible consequences of technological innovations to material supply and demand. End-of-life vehicles can, however, overtake domestic mining as a source of materials, calling for proper technologies and policies to utilize this emerging source. The long-term importing of critical materials in manufactured and semi-manufactured products shifts the location of material stocks and hence future secondary supply of high-value materials, culminating in a double benefit to the importing country. This modeling approach is adaptable to the study of varied scenarios and materials, linking technologies with supply and demand dynamics in order to understand their potential economic and environmental consequences.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are creating new connections between the transportation and electric sectors, and PEV charging will create opportunities and challenges in a system of growing complexity. Here, I use highly resolved models of residential power demand and PEV use to assess the impact of uncoordinated in-home PEV charging on residential power demand. While the increase in aggregate demand might be minimal even for high levels of PEV adoption, uncoordinated PEV charging could significantly change the shape of the aggregate residential demand, with impacts for electricity infrastructure, even at low adoption levels. Clustering effects in vehicle adoption at the local level might lead to high PEV concentrations even if overall adoption remains low, significantly increasing peak demand and requiring upgrades to the electricity distribution infrastructure. This effect is exacerbated when adopting higher in-home power charging.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

William","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This is the second part of a two-part investigation of on-board catalytic fuel reforming to increase the brake efficiency of a multicylinder, stoichiometric spark-ignited (SI) engine. In Part 1 of the investigation, we analytically and experimentally characterized the energetics and kinetics of a candidate reforming catalyst over a range of reforming equivalence ratios and oxygen concentration conditions to identify the best conditions for efficient reforming. In the present part of our investigation, we studied an engine strategy that combined exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)–loop reforming with dilution limit extension of the combustion. In our experiments, we found that, under an engine operating condition of 2000 rpm and brake mean effective pressure (4 bar), catalytic EGR reforming made it possible to sustain stable combustion with a volumetric equivalent of 45%–55% EGR. Under this same operating condition with stoichiometric engine exhaust (and no reforming), we were only able to sustain stable combustion with EGR under 25%. In conclusion, these results indicate that multicylinder gasoline engine efficiency can be increased substantially with catalytic reforming combined with and higher EGR operation, resulting in a decrease of more than 8% in fuel consumption, compared to baseline operation.","American Chemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, the focus is placed on unsteady flames with repetitive extinction and ignition (FREI) to determine the potential of this regime for fuel testing and calibration of reduced chemical mechanisms. First, it is shown that the FREI regime does occur at elevated pressures for sufficiently small tube diameters. The sensitivity of the extinction and ignition temperatures to low-temperature chemistry is found to be significantly enhanced at 25 bar compared to atmospheric conditions. The ignition and extinction temperatures differ by up to 100 K between PRF mixtures with varying octane numbers. Ternary mixtures of iso-octane/n-heptane/toluene and iso-octane/n-heptane/ethanol at similar research and motor octane numbers are also studied. Second, the potential of using data from the micro flow reactor to infer reaction rates is assessed. A reduced chemical mechanism combining a small fuel-dependent submechanism with a detailed fuel-independent submechanism for the core species chemistry is used for that purpose. Only the most sensitive fuel-dependent reactions are inferred. the calibrated reduced model is compared to a detailed model and good agreement in ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds is observed. Finally, this illustrates the potential of a micro flow reactor with a controlled temperature profile to test fuels and infer kinetic data.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In some cases, the responsible electrochemistry and charged-species transport is complex. However, to date, there are essentially no general-purpose modeling capabilities that facilitate the incorporation of thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport complexities into the simulation of electrochemical processes. A vast majority of the modeling literature uses only a few (often only one) global charge-transfer reactions, with the rates expressed using Butler-Volmer approximations. The objective of the present paper is to identify common aspects of electrochemistry, seeking a foundational basis for designing and implementing software with general applicability across a wide range of materials sets and applications. The development of new technologies should be accelerated and improved by enabling the incorporation of electrochemical complexity (e.g., multi-step, elementary charge-transfer reactions and as well as supporting ionic and electronic transport) into the analysis and interpretation of scientific results. The spirit of the approach is analogous to the role that Chemkin has played in homogeneous chemistry modeling, especially combustion. The Cantera software, which already has some electrochemistry capabilities, forms the foundation for future capabilities expansion.","The Electrochemical Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Its relatively large band gap, however, limits the conversion efficiency of BFO absorber-based PV devices. In this study, based on density functional theory calculations we demonstrate that with well-designed Fe-site elemental substitution, tetragonal BFO can exhibit a much lower fundamental band gap than conventional rhombohedral BFO without forming in-gap electronic states and unravel the underlying mechanisms. Cation atomic size, electronegativity, and crystallographic symmetry are evidenced as critical parameters to tailor the metal 3d – oxygen 2p orbital interactions and thus intrinsically modify electronic structure, particularly, the shape and character of the valence and conduction band edges. With reduced band gap, improved mobility, and uncompromised ferroelectric and magnetic ground states, the present results provide a new strategy of designing high symmetry BFO for efficient optoelectronic applications.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of Missouri, Columbia, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Chemistry C; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1239-1247","","","SC0014607; U1530129; 11774044","Journal ID: ISSN 2050-7526; JMCCCX; TRN: US1801333","10.1039/c7tc04160h","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1419252","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1419252","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1419252","Journal of Materials Chemistry C","5","6"
"Sensitivity of Emissions to Uncertainties in Residual Gas Fraction Measurements in Automotive Engines: A Numerical Study","Aithal, S. M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Emissions; Quasi-dimensional; Residual Gas Fraction","<p>Initial conditions of the working fluid (air-fuel mixture) within an engine cylinder, namely, mixture composition and temperature, greatly affect the combustion characteristics and emissions of an engine. In particular, the percentage of residual gas fraction (RGF) in the engine cylinder can significantly alter the temperature and composition of the working fluid as compared with the air-fuel mixture inducted into the engine, thus affecting engine-out emissions. Accurate measurement of the RGF is cumbersome and expensive, thus making it hard to accurately characterize the initial mixture composition and temperature in any given engine cycle. This uncertainty can lead to challenges in accurately interpreting experimental emissions data and in implementing real-time control strategies. Quantifying the effects of the RGF can have important implications for the diagnostics and control of internal combustion engines. This paper reports on the use of a well-validated, two-zone quasi-dimensional model to compute the engine-out NO and CO emission in a gasoline engine. The effect of varying the RGF on the emissions under lean, near-stoichiometric, and rich engine conditions was investigated. Furthermore, numerical results show that small uncertainties (~2–4%) in the measured/computed values of the RGF can significantly affect the engine-out NO/CO emissions.</p>","Hindawi Publishing Corporation","","Argonne National Lab.

"Low-Temperature Combustion of High Octane Fuels in a Gasoline Compression Ignition Engine","Cung, Khanh Duc; Ciatti, Stephen Anthony; Tanov, Slavey; Andersson, Oivind","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; endoscope imaging; gasoline compression ignition; high octane; internal combustion engine","Gasoline Compression Ignition (GCI) has been shown as one of the advanced combustion concepts that could potentially provide a pathway to achieve cleaner and more efficient combustion engines. Fuel and air in GCI are not fully premixed as compared to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) which is a completely kinetic-controlled combustion system. Therefore, the combustion phasing can be controlled by the time of injection, usually post injection in a multiple-injection scheme, to mitigate combustion noise. Gasoline fuels ignite more difficult than Diesel. The autoignition quality of gasoline can be indicated by research octane number (RON). Fuels with high octane tend to have more resistance to auto-ignition, hence more time for fuel-air mixing. In this study, three fuels, namely, Aromatic, Alkylate, and E30, with similar RON value of 98 but different hydrocarbon compositions were tested in a multi-cylinder engine under GCI combustion mode. Considerations of EGR, start of injection (SOI), and boost were investigated to study the sensitivity of dilution, local stratification, and reactivity of the charge, respectively, for each fuel. Combustion phasing was kept constant during the experiments to the changes in ignition and combustion process before and after 50% of the fuel mass is burned. Emission characteristics at different levels of EGR and lambda were revealed for all fuels with E30 having the lowest filter smoke number (FSN) and was also most sensitive to the change in dilution. Reasonably low combustion noise (< 90 dB) and stable combustion (COVIMEP < 3%) were maintained during the experiments. The second part of this paper contains visualization of the combustion process obtained from endoscope imaging for each fuel at selected conditions. Soot radiation signal from GCI combustion were strong during late injection, and also more intense at low EGR conditions. Furthermore, soot/temperature profiles indicated only the high-temperature combustion period, while cylinder pressure-based heat release rate (HRR) showed a two-stage combustion phenomenon.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Argonne National Lab.

"Measuring and predicting sooting tendencies of oxygenates, alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics on a unified scale","Das, Dhrubajyoti D.; John, Peter C.; McEnally, Charles S.; Kim, Seonah; Pfefferle, Lisa D.","09 BIOMASS FUELS; soot; biofuels; color ratio pyrometry; group contribution method; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Databases of sooting indices, based on measuring some aspect of sooting behavior in a standardized combustion environment, are useful in providing information on the comparative sooting tendencies of different fuels or pure compounds. However, newer biofuels have varied chemical structures including both aromatic and oxygenated functional groups, which expands the chemical space of relevant compounds. In this work, we propose a unified sooting tendency database for pure compounds, including both regular and oxygenated hydrocarbons, which is based on combining two disparate databases of yield-based sooting tendency measurements in the literature. Unification of the different databases was made possible by leveraging the greater dynamic range of the color ratio pyrometry soot diagnostic. This unified database contains a substantial number of pure compounds (≥ 400 total) from multiple categories of hydrocarbons important in modern fuels and establishes the sooting tendencies of aromatic and oxygenated hydrocarbons on the same numeric scale for the first time. Then, using this unified sooting tendency database, we have developed a predictive model for sooting behavior applicable to a broad range of hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons. The model decomposes each compound into single-carbon fragments and assigns a sooting tendency contribution to each fragment based on regression against the unified database. The model’s predictive accuracy (as demonstrated by leave-one-out cross-validation) is comparable to a previously developed, more detailed predictive model. The fitted model provides insight into the effects of chemical structure on soot formation, and cases where its predictions fail reveal the presence of more complicated kinetic sooting mechanisms. Our work will therefore enable the rational design of low-sooting fuel blends from a wide range of feedstocks and chemical functionalities.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The task of detecting driving cycles (driving or car-mode trajectory segments) from wearable GPS data has been the subject of much research. Specifically, distinguishing driving cycles from other motorized trips (such as taking a bus) is the main research problem in this paper. Many mode detection methods only focus on raw GPS speed data while some studies apply additional information, such as geographic information system (GIS) data, to obtain better detection performance. Procuring and maintaining dedicated road GIS data are costly and not trivial, whereas the technical maturity and broad use of map service application program interface (API) queries offers opportunities for mode detection tasks. The proposed driving cycle detection method takes advantage of map service APIs to obtain high-quality car-mode API route information and uses a trajectory segmentation algorithm to find the best-matched API route. The car-mode API route data combined with the actual route information, including the actual mode information, are used to train a logistic regression machine learning model, which estimates car modes and non-car modes with probability rates. The experimental results show promise for the proposed method's ability to detect vehicle mode accurately.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper explores the impact of implementing dual fuel capabilities on a sedan and demonstrates that a dual fuel E10 and compressed natural gas engine is able to improve the average engine efficiency by up to 6.5% compared to a single fuel engine on standard drive cycles. An optimal control technique is also developed, and the proposed approach allows factors including fuel cost and fuel availability to be taken into account.

In response to the growing BEV inter-city travel demand, the framework integrates both an optimization model for decisions on where and when to build charging stations and a stochastic queuing model to determine how many chargers are needed for each station. A genetic algorithm based heuristic method is developed to efficiently solve the problem. The model is applied to investigate the long-term infrastructure requirement in the state of California where significant growth in BEV demand is expected in coming decades. Our findings indicate that the charging infrastructure is expanded in both network coverage (number of stations) and service capacity (number of chargers per station) as the BEV demand grows. We also found that the infrastructure requirement is dependent on many factors, such as the BEV electrified range, the required level of service at charging stations, and the range anxiety cost. For most simulated scenarios, the results show that it is beneficial to invest in the inter-city fast charging infrastructure, even though the range anxiety cost is at its low end.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A detailed electro-thermal model of a stationary lithium-ion battery system is developed and an evaluation of its energy efficiency is conducted. The model offers a holistic approach to calculating conversion losses and auxiliary power consumption. Sub-models for battery rack, power electronics, thermal management as well as the control and monitoring components are developed and coupled to a comprehensive model. The simulation is parametrized based on a prototype 192 kWh system using lithium iron phosphate batteries connected to the low voltage grid. The key loss mechanisms are identified, thoroughly analyzed and modeled. Generic profiles featuring various system operation modes are evaluated to show the characteristics of stationary battery systems. Typically the losses in the power electronics outweigh the losses in the battery at low power operating points. The auxiliary power consumption dominates for low system utilization rates. For estimation of real-world performance, the grid applications Primary Control Reserve, Secondary Control Reserve and the storage of surplus photovoltaic power are evaluated. Conversion round-trip efficiency is in the range of 70-80%. Finally, overall system efficiency, which also considers system power consumption, is 8-13 percentage points lower for Primary Control Reserve and the photovoltaic-battery application. However, for Secondary Control Reserve, the total round-trip efficiency is found to be extremely low at 23% due to the low energy throughput of this application type.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

But, the mechanisms of spray collapse are not fully understood and are difficult to predict. The purpose of this work is to study the aerodynamics in the inter-spray region, which can potentially lead to plume collapse. High-speed (100 kHz) particle image velocimetry is applied along a plane between plumes to observe the full temporal evolution of plume interaction and potential collapse, resolved for individual injection events. Supporting information along a line of sight is obtained using simultaneous diffused back illumination and Mie-scatter techniques. Experiments are performed under simulated engine conditions using a symmetric eight-hole injector in a high-temperature, high-pressure vessel at the “Spray G” operating conditions of the engine combustion network. Indicators of plume interaction and collapse include changes in counter-flow recirculation of ambient gas toward the injector along the axis of the injector or in the inter-plume region between plumes. Furthermore, the effect of ambient temperature and gas density on the inter-plume aerodynamics and the subsequent plume collapse are assessed. Increasing ambient temperature or density, with enhanced vaporization and momentum exchange, accelerates the plume interaction. Plume direction progressively shifts toward the injector axis with time, demonstrating that the plume interaction and collapse are inherently transient.","SAGE","","Sandia National Lab.

"The structure and propagation of laminar flames under autoignitive conditions","Krisman, Alex; Hawkes, Evatt R.; Chen, Jacqueline H.","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; laminar flame speed; internal combustion engines; autoignition; flame propagation; multi-stage ignition","The laminar flame speed s<sub>l</sub> is an important reference quantity for characterising and modelling combustion. Experimental measurements of laminar flame speed require the residence time of the fuel/air mixture (τ<sub>f</sub>) to be shorter than the autoignition delay time (τ). This presents a considerable challenge for conditions where autoignition occurs rapidly, such as in compression ignition engines. As a result, experimental measurements in typical compression ignition engine conditions do not exist. Simulations of freely propagating premixed flames, where the burning velocity is found as an eigenvalue of the solution, are also not well posed in such conditions, since the mixture ahead of the flame can autoignite, leading to the so called “cold boundary problem”. In this paper, a numerical method for estimating a reference flame speed, s<sub>R</sub>, is proposed that is valid for laminar flame propagation at autoignitive conditions. Two isomer fuels are considered to test this method: ethanol, which in the considered conditions is a single-stage ignition fuel; and dimethyl ether, which has a temperature-dependent single- or two-stage ignition and a negative temperature coefficient regime for τ. Calculations are performed for the flame position in a one-dimensional computational domain with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, as a function of the inlet velocity U<sub>I</sub> and for stoichiometric fuel–air premixtures. The response of the flame position, L<sub>F</sub>, to U<sub>I</sub> shows distinct stabilisation regimes. For single-stage ignition fuels, at low U<sub>I</sub> the flame speed exceeds U<sub>I</sub> and the flame becomes attached to the inlet. Above a critical U<sub>I</sub> value, the flame detaches from the inlet and L<sub>f</sub> becomes extremely sensitive to U<sub>I</sub> until, for sufficiently high U<sub>I</sub>, the sensitivity decreases and L<sub>f</sub> corresponds to the location expected from a purely autoignition stabilised flame. The transition from the attached to the autoignition regimes has a corresponding peak dL<sub>f</sub>/dU<sub>I</sub> value which is proposed to be a unique reference flame speed s<sub>R</sub> for single-stage ignition fuels. For two-stage ignition fuels, there is an additional stable regime where a high-temperature flame propagates into a pool of combustion intermediates generated by the first stage of autoignition. This results in two peaks in dL<sub>f</sub>/dU<sub>I</sub> and therefore two reference flame speed values. The lower value corresponds to the definition of s<sub>R</sub> for single-stage ignition fuels, while the higher value exists only for two-stage ignition fuels and corresponds to a high temperature flame propagating into the first stage of autoignition and is denoted <math><msubsup is=""true""><mi is=""true"">s</mi><mi is=""true"">R</mi><msup is=""true""><mrow is=""true""></mrow><mo is=""true"">'</mo></msup></msubsup></math>.

"A Comparative Assessment of Economic Model Predictive Control Strategies for Fuel Economy Optimization of Heavy-Duty Trucks","Groelke, Ben; Borek, John; Earnhardt, Christian; Li, Jian; Geyer, Stephen; Vermillion, Chris","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","This paper provides a comparative assessment of three control strategies that fuse a global, offline dynamic programming (DP) optimization with online model predictive control (MPC) in an effort to minimize fuel consumption for a heavy-duty truck. The online MPC optimization, which is local in nature, makes refinements to a coarsely (but globally, subject to grid resolution) optimized target velocity profile from the DP optimization. Three candidate economic MPC formulations are evaluated: a time-based formulation that directly penalizes predicted fuel consumption, a simplified time-based formulation that penalizes braking effort in place of fuel consumption, and a distance-based convex formulation that maintains a tradeoff between energy expenditure and tracking of the coarsely optimized velocity based on DP. The performance of each approach is presented for three representative route profiles, using a medium-fidelity proprietary Volvo model of the heavy-duty truck’s longitudinal dynamics. Results demonstrate 4-7% fuel economy improvement across all three formulations, when compared to a baseline strategy. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of energy usage by “type” (aerodynamic losses, braking losses, and comparison of brake-specific fuel consumption), under each candidate control approach.","IEEE","","North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh, NC (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the American Control Conference (ACC); Journal Volume: 2018; Conference: 2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC), Milwaukee, WI (United States), 27-29 Jun 2018","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 834-839","","","AR0000801","Journal ID: ISSN 2378-5861","10.23919/ACC.2018.8431050","","2020-09-16T00:00:00Z","1557256","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1557256","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1557256","Proceedings of the American Control Conference (ACC)","","2018"

While the range that BEVs can travel on a single recharge is improving, the rate at which these vehicles can be recharged is still much slower than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. To achieve comparable recharge times we explore the vehicle considerations of charge rates up to 350 kW. This faster recharge is expected to significantly mitigate the perceived deficiencies for long-distance transportation, to provide alternative charging in densely populated areas where overnight charging at home may not be possible, and to reduce range anxiety for travel within a city when unplanned charging maybe required. This substantial increase in the charging rate is expected to create technical issues in the design of the battery system and the vehicle electrical architecture that must be resolved.

"Isolating the effects of reactivity stratification in reactivity-controlled compression ignition with iso-octane and <em>n</em>-heptane on a light-duty multi-cylinder engine","Wissink, Martin L.; Curran, Scott J.; Roberts, Greg; Musculus, Mark P. B.; Mounaim-Rousselle, Christine","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) is a dual-fuel variant of low-temperature combustion that uses in-cylinder fuel stratification to control the rate of reactions occurring during combustion. Using fuels of varying reactivity (autoignition propensity), gradients of reactivity can be established within the charge, allowing for control over combustion phasing and duration for high efficiency while achieving low NO<sub>x</sub> and soot emissions. In practice, this is typically accomplished by premixing a low-reactivity fuel, such as gasoline, with early port or direct injection, and by direct injecting a high-reactivity fuel, such as diesel, at an intermediate timing before top dead center. Both the relative quantity and the timing of the injection(s) of high-reactivity fuel can be used to tailor the combustion process and thereby the efficiency and emissions under RCCI. While many combinations of high- and low-reactivity fuels have been successfully demonstrated to enable RCCI, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of what properties, chemical or physical, are most important or desirable for extending operation to both lower and higher loads and reducing emissions of unreacted fuel and CO. This is partly due to the fact that important variables such as temperature, equivalence ratio, and reactivity change simultaneously in both a local and a global sense with changes in the injection of the high-reactivity fuel. This study uses primary reference fuels iso-octane and <i>n</i>-heptane, which have similar physical properties but much different autoignition properties, to create both external and in-cylinder fuel blends that allow for the effects of reactivity stratification to be isolated and quantified. This study is part of a collaborative effort with researchers at Sandia National Laboratories who are investigating the same fuels and conditions of interest in an optical engine. Furthermore, this collaboration aims to improve our fundamental understanding of what fuel properties are required to further develop advanced combustion modes.","SAGE","","Sandia National Lab.

However, the problems of high cost and limited range associated with on-board batteries have substantially limited the popularity of battery electric buses. The technology of dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT), which provides bus operators with the ability to charge buses while in motion, may be able to effectively alleviate the drawbacks of electric buses. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously selecting the optimal location of the DWPT facilities and designing the optimal battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system. The problem is first constructed as a deterministic model in which the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time of electric buses is neglected. The methodology of robust optimization (RO) is then adopted to address the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time. The affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the deterministic model is developed, and its equivalent tractable mathematical programming is derived. Both the deterministic model and the robust model are demonstrated with a real-world bus system. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed deterministic model can effectively determine the allocation of DWPT facilities and the battery sizes of electric buses for a DWPT electric bus system; and the robust model can further provide optimal designs that are robust against the uncertainty of energy consumption and travel time for electric buses.","Elsevier","","Pacificorp, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOT; Mountain-Plains Consortium (MPC)","","United States","2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; Journal Volume: 83; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 77-103","","","EE0007997","Journal ID: ISSN 0968-090X; PII: S0968090X17301985","10.1016/j.trc.2017.07.013","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1429115","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1429115","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1429115","Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies","C","83"

Isolated methanol molecules adsorbed at the anatase (101) surface show a negligible photoactivity. Two ways of methanol activation were found. First, methoxy groups formed by reaction of methanol with coadsorbed O<sub>2</sub> molecules or terminal OH groups are photoactive, and they turn into formaldehyde upon UV illumination. The methoxy species show an unusual C 1s core-level shift of 1.4 eV compared to methanol; their chemical assignment was verified by DFT calculations with inclusion of final-state effects. The second way of methanol activation opens at methanol coverages above 0.5 monolayer (ML), and methyl formate is produced in this reaction pathway. The adsorption of methanol in the coverage regime from 0 to 2 ML is described in detail; it is key for understanding the photocatalytic behavior at high coverages. There, a hydrogen-bonding network is established in the adsorbed methanol layer, and consequently, methanol dissociation becomes energetically more favorable. DFT calculations show that dissociation of the methanol molecule is always the key requirement for hole transfer from the substrate to the adsorbed methanol. Here, we show that the hydrogen-bonding network established in the methanol layer dramatically changes the kinetics of proton transfer during the photoreaction.","American Chemical Society","","Princeton Univ., NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2017-09-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Catalysis Journal Volume: 7 Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: p. 7081-7091","","","SC0007347","Journal ID: ISSN 2155-5435","10.1021/acscatal.7b02003","","2021-08-19T00:00:00Z","1393722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1393722","","ACS Catalysis","10","7"

Despite the utility of such models, they require that material researchers input system design specifications that cannot be estimated easily. To address this challenge, a design tool has been developed that allows researchers to directly enter kinetic and thermodynamic chemical hydrogen storage material properties into a simple sizing module that then estimates system parameters required to run the storage system model. Additionally, the design tool can be used as a standalone executable file to estimate the storage system mass and volume outside of the Framework model.

For automotive applications this will most likely involve using internal combustion engine exhaust as the heat source, with the TEG positioned after the catalyst system. Applications to exhaust gas recirculation systems and compressed air coolers have also been suggested. A thermoelectric generator based on half-Heusler thermoelectric materials was developed, engineered, and fabricated, targeting a gasoline passenger sedan application. This generator was installed on a gasoline engine exhaust system in a dynamometer cell, and positioned immediately downstream of the closecoupled three-way catalyst. The generator was characterized using a matrix of steady-state conditions representing the important portions of the engine map. Detailed performance results are presented. Measurements indicate the generator can produces over 300 W of power with 900 °C exhaust at relatively high flow rates, but less than 50 W when the exhaust is 600 °C and at lower flow rates. The latter condition is typical of standard test cycles and most driving scenarios.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Understanding chemistry-specific fuel differences at a constant RON in a boosted SI engine","Szybist, James P.; Splitter, Derek A.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Octane index; Knock; Octane sensitivity","The goal of the US Department of Energy Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines (Co-Optima) initiative is to accelerate the development of advanced fuels and engines for higher efficiency and lower emissions. A guiding principle of this initiative is the central fuel properties hypothesis (CFPH), which states that fuel properties provide an indication of a fuel’s performance, regardless of its chemical composition. This is an important consideration for Co-Optima because many of the fuels under consideration are from bio-derived sources with chemical compositions that are unconventional relative to petroleum-derived gasoline or ethanol. In this study, we investigated a total of seven fuels in a spark ignition engine under boosted operating conditions to determine whether knock propensity is predicted by fuel antiknock metrics: antiknock index (AKI), research octane number (RON), and octane index (OI). Six of these fuels have a constant RON value but otherwise represent a wide range of fuel properties and chemistry. Consistent with previous studies, we found that OI was a much better predictor of knock propensity that either AKI or RON. However, we also found that there were significant fuel-specific deviations from the OI predictions. Combustion analysis provided insight that fuel kinetic complexities, including the presence of pre-spark heat release, likely limits the ability of standardized tests and metrics to accurately predict knocking tendency at all operating conditions. While limitations of OI were revealed in this study, we found that fuels with unconventional chemistry, in particular esters and ethers, behaved in accordance with CFPH as well as petroleum-derived fuels.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Evaluation of the Hazard of Dust Impacts on Interstellar Spacecraft","London, Richard A.; Early, James T.","79 ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; interstellar travel; dust; grains; damage","Spacecraft traveling to nearby stars will experience energetic collisions with interstellar dust grains. For thin structures, such as light sails, grains pass through with little damage. For thick structures, all the grain energy will be deposited, possibly leading to significant damage. This paper presents a quantitative assessment of damage caused by grain-vehicle collisions and designs to reduce damage. Computer simulations of grain-vehicle collisions were performed with a radiation/hydrodynamic code, that models deposition of grain energy in the material, energy transport by conduction and radiation, expansion of the heated volume melting and other damage processes to the surrounding material. It is found that the grain energy is deposited in a long, thin cylindrical volume, creating temperatures larger than 10<sup>7</sup> K. The spreading of this energy can potentially lead to a large damaged volume. Radiation and evaporation can remove energy, thereby limiting the damage. The reduction of damage by the choice of shielding material on the leading surface and by placement of a thin shield in front of the vehicle to atomize and disperse the grains before they hit the main body of the craft is described.","British Interplanetary Society","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This study aims to shed more light on the combined effect of lightweighing and electrification by assessing different lightweight designs and electric powetrians from the environmental perspective using a life cycle analysis coupled with an emphasis on energy expenditures and carbon dioxide emissions. This article discusses the life cycle assessment for several advanced powertrains namely; plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) relative to the conventional gasoline operated internal combustion engine based power train vehicles. The main focus will be on the energy greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the material extraction and resources phase, manufacturing phase and use phase (operation and maintenance). While most of the current studies focus on the use phase that does not reflect the correct environmental impacts associated with advanced powertrains, thus the presented text applies a holistic LCA approach that covers pre-manufacturing, manufacturing, operational and end-of-life phases, plus another indirect phase to account for fuel extraction, refining and transportation to the end-users or customers. Based on the LCA emissions results, one may infer that environmental policies that reduce emissions rates from the electricity sector can mitigate this effect without completely eliminating it. Interestingly, the analysis show that lightweight vehicles with internal combustion engines have less impacts on the environment as a direct result of upstream emissions associated with electricity generation in United States. This scenario can differ in other countries with higher renewable and sustainable energy generated electric powers.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

M.; Boot, Michael D.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; sugar; engine knock; octane booster; levulinate; furan","Here, the objective of this paper is to investigate the anti-knock quality of sugar-derived levulinic esters (methyl levulinate (ML) and ethyl levulinate (EL)) and cyclic ethers (furfuryl ethyl ether (FEE) and ethyl tetrahydrofurfuryl ether (ETE)). To this end, combustion experiments were carried out in both an engine and a constant volume autoignition device. The results from both apparati demonstrate that ML, EL and FEE have superior anti-knock quality than the reference Euro95 gasoline. ETE, conversely, performed markedly worse than the reference fuel on both setups and might therefore be a more appropriate fuel for compression ignition engines. The main reason of the distinctions in anti-knock quality can be found in the molecular structure of the neat biofuels. ML and EL are levulinic esters, with a ketone (C=O) functionality and an ester (C(=O)-O) group on the carbon chain. They can readily produce stable intermediates during the auto-ignition process, thereby slowing down the overall reaction rate. The unsaturated cyclic ether (FEE) has very strong ring C-H bonds. However, the saturated cyclic ether (ETE) has weak ring C-H bonds, which facilitate more readily ring opening reactions. Long side chains on the cyclic ethers further accelerate the reaction rate. Importantly for future research, our results suggest that IQT and engine experiments are interchangeable setups with respect to qualitative anti-knock quality evaluation of novel compounds.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When compared to multi-hole diesel sprays, the plumes are closely spaced, and the sprays are more likely to interact. The effects of multi-jet interaction on entrainment and spray targeting can be influenced by small variations in the mass fluxes from the holes, which in turn depend on transients in the needle movement and small-scale details of the internal geometry. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of a multi-institutional effort to experimentally characterize the internal geometry and near-nozzle flow of the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray G gasoline injector. In order to develop a complete picture of the near-nozzle flow, a standardized setup was shared between facilities. A wide range of techniques were employed, including both X-ray and visible-light diagnostics. The novel aspects of this work include both new experimental measurements, and a comparison of the results across different techniques and facilities. The breadth and depth of the data reveal phenomena which were not apparent from analysis of the individual data sets. We show that plume-to-plume variations in the mass fluxes from the holes can cause large-scale asymmetries in the entrainment field and spray structure. Both internal flow transients and small-scale geometric features can have an effect on the external flow. The sharp turning angle of the flow into the holes also causes an inward vectoring of the plumes relative to the hole drill angle, which increases with time due to entrainment of gas into a low-pressure region between the plumes. In conclusion, these factors increase the likelihood of spray collapse with longer injection durations.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Three sensor probes were used to perform simultaneous backflow measurements in intake runners corresponding to three of the six engine cylinders, and a fourth probe was installed in the intake manifold plenum for tracking dynamics introduced by an external exhaust gas recirculation mixer. Near-crank-angle resolved measurements (5 kHz, that is, 1.2 crank angle resolution at 1000 RPM) were performed during steady-state engine operation at various levels of external exhaust gas recirculation to measure the gas properties and penetration distance of the backflow into the intake runners on a cylinder- and cycle-basis.

"Efficiency and Emissions Characteristics of an HCCI Engine Fueled by Primary Reference Fuels","Yang, Ruinan; Hariharan, Deivanayagam; Zilg, Steven; Mamalis, Sotirios; Lawler, Benjamin","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; HCCI; Primary Reference Fuel; Efficiency; Emissions","Here, this article investigates the effects of various primary reference fuel (PRF) blends, compression ratios, and intake temperatures on the thermodynamics and performance of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion in a Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) engine. Combustion phasing was kept constant at a CA50 phasing of 5° after top dead center (aTDC) and the equivalence ratio was kept constant at 0.3. Meanwhile, the compression ratio varied from 8:1 to 15:1 as the PRF blends ranged from pure n-heptane to nearly pure isooctane. The intake temperature was used to match CA50 phasing. In addition to the experimental results, a GT-Power model was constructed to simulate the experimental engine and the model was validated against the experimental data. The GT-Power model and simulation results were used to help analyze the energy flows and thermodynamic conditions tested in the experiment. The results indicate that an increase of compression ratio causes higher thermal efficiency and fuel conversion efficiency; however, at the same compression ratio, an increase in PRF number results in lower efficiency due to the required increase in intake temperature and the associated decrease in charge density. While the efficiency does increase with compression ratio, the results show that the effect of increased expansion work is partially offset by higher heat transfer losses and lower ratios of specific heats at higher compression ratios. The results indicate that the maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) in HCCI significantly increases with compression ratio. Combustion efficiency shows a strong trend with peak temperature regardless of the PRF number or compression ratio, indicating that the CO-to-CO2 conversion is independent of the parent fuel chemistry in the case of the PRFs, whereas the unburned hydrocarbon emissions showed the opposite trend, depending mostly on the parent fuel’s autoignition tendency.","SAE International","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technologies Office (EE-3V)","","United States","2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SAE International Journal of Engines (Online); Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: SAE World Congress 2018, Detroit, MI (United States), 10-12 Apr 2018","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 993-1006","","","EE0007216","Journal ID: ISSN 1946-3944","10.4271/2018-01-1255","","2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","1607701","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1607701","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1607701","SAE International Journal of Engines (Online)","6","11"

This paper explores the opportunity for cooperative and integrated vehicle and intersection control for energy efficiency (CIVIC-E<sup>2</sup>) to contribute to a more sustainable transportation system. We propose a two-level approach that jointly optimizes the traffic signal timing and vehicles' approach speed, with the objective being to minimize total energy consumption for all vehicles passing through an isolated intersection. More specifically, at the intersection level, a dynamic programming algorithm is designed to find the optimal signal timing by explicitly considering the arrival time and energy profile of each vehicle. At the vehicle level, a model predictive control strategy is adopted to ensure that vehicles pass through the intersection in a timely fashion. Our simulation study has shown that the proposed CIVIC-E<sup>2</sup> system can significantly improve intersection performance under various traffic conditions. Furthermore, compared with conventional fixed-time and actuated signal control strategies, the proposed algorithm can reduce energy consumption and queue length by up to 31% and 95%, respectively.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Catalytic Steam and Partial Oxidation Reforming of Liquid Fuels for Application in Improving the Efficiency of Internal Combustion Engines","Brookshear, Daniel William; Pihl, Josh A.; Szybist, James P.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; partial oxidation reforming; steam reforming; thermochemical recuperation","Here, this study investigated the potential for catalytically reforming liquid fuels in a simulated exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) mixture loop for the purpose of generating reformate that could be used to increase stoichiometric combustion engine efficiency. The experiments were performed on a simulated exhaust flow reactor using a Rh/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> reformer catalyst, and the fuels evaluated included iso-octane, ethanol, and gasoline. Both steam reforming and partial oxidation reforming were examined as routes for the production of reformate. Steam reforming was determined to be an ineffective option for reforming in an EGR loop, because of the high exhaust temperatures (in excess of 700 °C) required to produce adequate concentrations of reformate, regardless of fuel. However, partial oxidation reforming is capable of producing hydrogen concentrations as high as 10%–16%, depending on fuel and operating conditions in the simulated EGR gas mixture. Meanwhile, measurements of total fuel enthalpy retention were shown to have favorable energetics under a range of conditions, although a tradeoff between fuel enthalpy retention and reformate production was observed. Of the three fuels evaluated, iso-octane exhibited the best overall performance, followed by ethanol and then gasoline. Overall, it was found that partial oxidation reforming of liquid fuels in a simulated EGR mixture over the Rh/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalyst demonstrated sufficiently high reformate yields and favorable energetics to warrant further evaluation in the EGR system of a stoichiometric combustion engine.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A new service cost allocation mechanism is proposed to award PEVs based on the amount of service they provided, while considering compensations for delayed-charging and reduction of battery lifetime due to participation of the service. The GIDP transforms the optimal dispatch problem from a high-dimensional space into a one-dimensional space while preserving the solution optimality. When solving the transformed problem in real-time, the global optimality of the GIDP solution can be guaranteed by mathematically proved “indexability”. Because the GIDP index can be calculated upon the PEV’s arrival and used for the entire decision making process till its departure, the computational burden is minimized and the complexity of the aggregator dispatch process is significantly reduced. Finally, simulation results are used to evaluate the proposed GIDP, and to demonstrate the potential profitability from providing frequency regulation service by using PEVs.","IEEE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Motivated by the backpressure routing, in this paper, we propose a delay-based traffic signal control algorithm in transportation networks. We prove that this delay-based control achieves optimal throughput performance, same as the queue-based traffic signal control in the literature. However, a vehicle at a lane whose queue length remains very small may be excessively delayed under the queue-based signal control. Our delay-based backpressure control can deal with the excessive delays and achieve better fairness with respect to delay while still guaranteeing throughput optimality. Moreover, a general weighted control scheme combining the queue-based and delay-based schemes is also investigated, to provide a more flexible control according to the quality of service requirements.

The sulfur tolerance and hydrothermal stability of the dual-catalyst aftertreatment system comprising a reduction catalyst (palladium supported on sulfated zirconia- Pd/SZ) and an oxidation catalyst (cobalt oxide supported on ceria- CoO<sub>x</sub>/CeO<sub>2</sub>) for NOx reduction under lean-burn conditions has been tested under simulated engine exhaust conditions. Alumina-incorporated Pd/SZ (Pd/SZ(Alumina)) reduction catalyst as part of the dual catalyst bed demonstrated superior sulfur tolerance in the presence of 5 ppm SO<sub>2</sub> in the feed. The ratio of the reduction to oxidation catalyst was also seen to affect the hydrothermal stability under wet conditions with SO<sub>2</sub> in the reaction medium. The effect of hydrocarbon and water concentration in the reaction mixture on the sulfur tolerance of the dual-catalyst bed was studied. Increasing the reaction temperature from 450°C to 500°C demonstrated very stable NO<sub>x</sub> conversion and improved CH<sub>4</sub> conversions when the dual-catalyst bed was kept on-stream for 40 h<sup>-1</sup>.

Abdul; Ukkusuri, Satish V.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Dynamic time warping; emissions; EPA-MOVES; link driving schedule","We present that EPA-MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) is often integrated with traffic simulators to assess emission levels of large-scale urban networks with signalized intersections. High variations in speed profiles exist in the context of congested urban networks with signalized intersections. The traditional average-speed-based emission estimation technique with EPA-MOVES provides faster execution while underestimates the emissions in most cases because of ignoring the speed variation at congested networks with signalized intersections. In contrast, the atomic second-by-second speed profile (i.e., the trajectory of each vehicle)-based technique provides accurate emissions at the cost of excessive computational power and time. We addressed this issue by developing a novel method to determine the link-driving-schedules (LDSs) for the EPA-MOVES tool. Our research developed a hierarchical clustering technique with dynamic time warping similarity measures (HC-DTW) to find the LDS for EPA-MOVES that is capable of producing emission estimates better than the average-speed-based technique with execution time faster than the atomic speed profile approach. We applied the HC-DTW on a sample data from a signalized corridor and found that HC-DTW can significantly reduce computational time without compromising the accuracy. The developed technique in this research can substantially contribute to the EPA-MOVES-based emission estimation process for large-scale urban transportation network by reducing the computational time with reasonably accurate estimates. This method is highly appropriate for transportation networks with higher variation in speed such as signalized intersections. Lastly, experimental results show error difference ranging from 2% to 8% for most pollutants except PM<sub>10</sub>.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Impact of hydrogen refueling configurations and market parameters on the refueling cost of hydrogen","Reddi, Krishna; Elgowainy, Amgad; Rustagi, Neha; Gupta, Erika","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Cost contribution; Hydrogen refueling station; Refueling costs; Refueling station; Design configuration; Levelized cost; Capacity utilization; Techno-economic analysis; HDSAM","The cost of hydrogen in early fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) markets is dominated by the cost of refueling stations, mainly due to the high cost of refueling equipment, small station capacities, lack of economies of scale, and low utilization of the installed refueling capacity. Using the hydrogen delivery scenario analysis model (HDSAM), this study estimates the impacts of these factors on the refueling cost for different refueling technologies and configurations, and quantifies the potential reduction in future hydrogen refueling cost compared to today’s cost in the United States. The current hydrogen refueling station levelized cost, for a 200 kg/day dispensing capacity, is in the range of 6–8 dollars/kg H<sub>2</sub> when supplied with gaseous hydrogen, and 8–9 dollars/kg H<sub>2</sub> for stations supplied with liquid hydrogen. After adding the cost of hydrogen production, packaging, and transportation to the station’s levelized cost, the current cost of hydrogen at dispensers for FCEVs in California is in the range of 13–15 dollars/kg H<sub>2</sub>. The refueling station capacity utilization strongly influences the hydrogen refueling cost. The underutilization of station capacity in early FCEV markets, such as in California, results in a levelized station cost that is approximately 40% higher than it would be in a scenario where the station had been fully utilized since it began operating. In future mature hydrogen FCEV markets, with a large demand for hydrogen, the refueling station’s levelized cost can be reduced to 2 dollars/kg H<sub>2</sub> as a result of improved capacity utilization and reduced equipment cost via learning and economies of scale.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Importance of turbulence-chemistry interactions at low temperature engine conditions","Kundu, Prithwish; Ameen, Muhsin M.; Som, Sibendu","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; low temperature combustion; ECN spray A; flamelets; LES","The role of turbulence-chemistry interaction in autoignition and flame stabilization is investigated for spray flames at low temperature combustion (LTC) conditions by performing high-fidelity three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A recently developed Tabulated Flamelet Model (TFM) is coupled with a large eddy simulation (LES) framework and validated across a range of Engine Combustion Network (ECN) ambient temperature conditions for n-dodecane fuel. High resolution grids with 0.0625 mm minimum cell size and 25 million total cell count are implemented using adaptive mesh refinement over the spray and combustion regions. Simulations with these grids and multiple LES realizations, with a 103 species n-dodecane mechanism show good agreement with experimental data for all the ambient conditions investigated. This modeling approach with the computational cost advantage of tabulated chemistry is then extended towards understanding the auto-ignition and flame stabilization at an ambient temperature of 750 K. These low temperature conditions lead to substantially higher ignition delays and flame liftoff lengths, and significantly leaner combustion compared to conventional high temperature diesel combustion. These conditions also require the simulations to span significantly larger temporal and spatial dimensions thereby increasing the computational cost. The TFM approach is able to capture autoignition and flame liftoff length at the low temperature conditions. Significant differences with respect to mixing, species formation and flame stabilization are observed under low temperature compared to conventional diesel combustion. At higher ambient temperatures, formation of formaldehyde is observed in the rich region (phi > 1) followed by the formation of OH in the stoichiometric regions. Under low temperature conditions, formaldehyde is observed to form at leaner regions followed by the onset of OH formation in significantly lean regions of the flame. Qualitative differences between species formation and transient flame development for the high and low temperature conditions are presented. The two stage ignition process is further investigated by studying the species formation in mixture fraction space by solving 1D flamelet equations for different scalar dissipation rates and homogeneous reactor assumption. Results show that scalar dissipation causes these radicals to diffuse within the mixture fraction space. As a result, this significantly enhances ignition and plays a dominant role at such low temperature conditions which cannot be captured by the homogeneous reaction assumption based model.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The quality of outsourced probe data on freeways has led many departments of transportation to consider such data for arterial performance monitoring. From April 2013 through June of 2014, the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Transportation Technology gathered travel times from several arterial corridors within the mid-Atlantic region using Bluetooth traffic monitoring (BTM) equipment, and compared these travel times with the data reported to the I95 Vehicle Probe Project (VPP) from an outsourced probe data vendor. The analysis consisted of several methodologies: (1) a traditional analysis that used precision and bias speed metrics; (2) a slowdown analysis that quantified the percentage of significant traffic disruptions accurately captured in the VPP data; (3) a sampled distribution method that uses overlay methods to enhance and analyze recurring congestion patterns. (4) Last, the BTM and VPP data from each 24-hour period of data collection were reviewed by the research team to assess the extent to which VPP captured the nature of the traffic flow. Based on the analysis, probe data is recommended only on arterial roadways with signal densities (measured in signals per mile) up to one, and it should be tested and used with caution for signal densities between one and two, and is not recommended when signal density exceeds two.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Reduced Effectiveness of EGR to Mitigate Knock at High Loads in Boosted SI Engines","Szybist, James P.; Wagnon, Scott W.; Splitter, Derek A.; Pitz, William J.; Mehl, Marco","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); knock; turbochargers; spark ignition engines","Numerous studies have demonstrated that exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can attenuate knock propensity in spark ignition (SI) engines at naturally aspirated or lightly boosted conditions. In this paper, we investigate the role of cooled EGR under higher load conditions with multiple fuel compositions, where highly retarded combustion phasing typical of modern SI engines was used. It was found that under these conditions, EGR attenuation of knock is greatly reduced, where EGR doesn’t allow significant combustion phasing advance as it does under lighter load conditions. Detailed combustion analysis shows that when EGR is added, the polytropic coefficient increases causing the compressive pressure and temperature to increase. At sufficiently highly boosted conditions, the increase in polytropic coefficient and additional trapped mass from EGR can sufficiently reduce fuel ignition delay to overcome knock attenuation effects. Kinetic modeling demonstrates that the effectiveness of EGR to mitigate knock is highly dependent on the pressure-temperature condition. Experiments at 2000 rpm have confirmed reduced fuel ignition delay under highly boosted conditions relevant to modern downsized boosted SI engines, where in-cylinder pressure is higher and the temperature is cooler. Finally, at these conditions, charge reactivity increases compared to naturally aspirated conditions, and attenuation of knock by EGR is reduced.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Comparison of the greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from the SF-BREEZE high-speed fuel-cell ferry with a diesel ferry","Klebanoff, Leonard E.; Pratt, Joseph William; Leffers, C. M.; Sonerholm, K. T.; Escher, T.; Burgard, J.; Ghosh, S.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Hydrogen; PEM fuel cell; GHG emissions; Ferry emissions; Criteria pollutant emissions","A theoretical comparison is made of the “well to waves” (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions from the SF-BREEZE high-speed hydrogen PEM fuel cell ferry and the VALLEJO ferry powered by traditional diesel engine technology but constrained to Tier 4 emissions standards. The emissions were calculated for a common maritime mission, the current ferry route between Vallejo CA and San Francisco CA. Calculations are made of the energy required for the SF-BREEZE and VALLEJO to perform the mission route profile. The SF-BREEZE requires 10.1% more fuel energy than the VALLEJO, primarily due to the SF-BREEZE being heavier. Estimates are made for the SF-BREEZE GHG emissions associated with five LH2 fuel production pathways including renewable and non-renewable (fossil-fuel based) methods. Estimates are also made for GHG emissions associated with fossil-diesel production and delivery as well as those for biodiesel, which can be considered a renewable “drop-in” fuel replacement for conventional diesel fuel. We find that the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE using non-renewable LH<sub>2</sub> are significantly higher than for the Tier 4 diesel-fueled VALLEJO on a per passenger basis. However, using renewable LH<sub>2</sub>, the GHG emissions for the SF-BREEZE ferry are reduced 75.8% compared to the diesel-fueled VALLEJO operating at Tier 4 emissions standards. We also compare the criteria pollutant emissions (NO<sub>x</sub>, HC, PM<sub>10</sub>) for the SF-BREEZE to that of the VALLEJO held to Tier 4 emissions standards fueled by diesel fuel or biodiesel. Hydrogen PEM fuel cell technology dramatically reduces NO<sub>x</sub> and HC emissions below the most advanced Tier 4 criteria pollutant emissions requirements regardless of whether the LH<sub>2</sub> is made by NG reforming or via water electrolysis using 70% renewable energy. Renewable LH<sub>2</sub> made with greater than 84% renewable process energy is needed to also drop the SF-BREEZE PM<sub>10</sub> emissions below that of Tier 4 for high-speed fuel cell ferry transportation. Overall, the results show that operating a hydrogen fuel cell ferry on nearly 100% renewable hydrogen provides the dramatic reduction in GHG and criteria pollutant emissions commensurate with the problems of global climate change and maritime air pollution worldwide.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"A two-stage stochastic optimization model for scheduling electric vehicle charging loads to relieve distribution-system constraints","Wu, Fei; Sioshansi, Ramteen","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Electric vehicle; Vehicle charging; Charging control; Stochastic optimization; Sample-average approximation","Electric vehicles (EVs) hold promise to improve the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of transportation. However, widespread EV use can impose significant stress on electricity-distribution systems due to their added charging loads. This paper proposes a centralized EV charging-control model, which schedules the charging of EVs that have flexibility. This flexibility stems from EVs that are parked at the charging station for a longer duration of time than is needed to fully recharge the battery. The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. The model captures the use of distributed energy resources and uncertainties around EV arrival times and charging demands upon arrival, non-EV loads on the distribution system, energy prices, and availability of energy from the distributed energy resources. We use a Monte Carlo-based sample-average approximation technique and an L-shaped method to solve the resulting optimization problem efficiently. We also apply a sequential sampling technique to dynamically determine the optimal size of the randomly sampled scenario tree to give a solution with a desired quality at minimal computational cost. Here, we demonstrate the use of our model on a Central-Ohio-based case study. We show the benefits of the model in reducing charging costs, negative impacts on the distribution system, and unserved EV-charging demand compared to simpler heuristics. Lastly, we also conduct sensitivity analyses, to show how the model performs and the resulting costs and load profiles when the design of the station or EV-usage parameters are changed.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of International Affairs (IA); ational Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2017-05-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research, Part B: Methodological; Journal Volume: 102; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 55-82","","","PI0000012; 1029337","Journal ID: ISSN 0191-2615; PII: S0191261516305343","10.1016/j.trb.2017.05.002","","2021-07-23T00:00:00Z","1362132","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1362132","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1362132","Transportation Research, Part B: Methodological","C","102"
"Impact of hydrogen SAE J2601 fueling methods on fueling time of light-duty fuel cell electric vehicles","Reddi, Krishna; Elgowainy, Amgad; Rustagi, Neha; Gupta, Erika","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; Fueling time; Hydrogen fueling protocols; Light-duty fuel cell electric vehicles; MC Formula Method; SAE J2601","Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) that can provide drivers a similar experience to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), in terms of fueling time and performance (i.e. power and driving range). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed fueling protocol J2601 for light-duty HFCEVs to ensure safe vehicle fills while maximizing fueling performance. This study employs a physical model that simulates and compares the fueling performance of two fueling methods, known as the “lookup table” method and the “MC formula” method, within the SAE J2601 protocol. Both the fueling methods provide fast fueling of HFCEVs within minutes, but the MC formula method takes advantage of active measurement of precooling temperature to dynamically control the fueling process, and thereby provides faster vehicle fills. Here, the MC formula method greatly reduces fueling time compared to the lookup table method at higher ambient temperatures, as well as when the precooling temperature falls on the colder side of the expected temperature window for all station types. Although the SAE J2601 lookup table method is the currently implemented standard for refueling hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the MC formula method provides significant fueling time advantages in certain conditions; these warrant its implementation in future hydrogen refueling stations for better customer satisfaction with fueling experience of HFCEVs.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Analytic study of the conditions required for longitudinal stability of dual-wing aircraft","Andrews, Stephen Arthur; Perez, Ruben E.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 42 ENGINEERING; unconventional aircraft; stability and control; aerodynamics; dual-wing; nonplanar wing","Recent studies of new, fuel-efficient transport aircraft have considered designs, which make use of two principal lifting surfaces to provide the required lift as well as trim and static stability. Such designs include open tandem-wings as well as closed joined and box-wings. As a group, these aircraft can be termed dual-wing designs. Our study developed a new analytic model, which takes into account the downwash from the two main wings and is sensitive to three important design variables: the relative areas of each wing, the streamwise separation of the wings, and the center of gravity position. This model was used to better understand trends in the dual-wing geometry on the stability, maneuverability, and lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft. Dual-wing aircraft have been shown to have reduced the induced drag compared to the conventional designs. In addition, further drag reductions can be realized as the horizontal tail can be removed if the dual-wings have sufficient streamwise stagger to provide the moments necessary for trim and longitudinal stability. As both wings in a dual-wing system carry a significant fraction of the total lift, trends in such designs that led to longitudinal stability can differ from those of the conventional aircraft and have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Results from the analytic model showed that the longitudinal stability required either a reduction of the fore wing area or shifting the center of gravity forward from the midpoint of both wings' aerodynamic centers. Additionally, for wing configurations of approximately equal fore and aft wing areas, increasing the separation between the two wings decreased the stability of the aircraft. The source of this unusual behavior was the asymmetric distribution of downwash upstream and downstream of the wing. These relationships between dual-wing geometry and stability will provide initial guidance on the conceptual design of dual-wing aircraft and aid in the understanding of the results of more complex studies of such designs, furthering the development of future transport aircraft.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"A stochastic flow-capturing model to optimize the location of fast-charging stations with uncertain electric vehicle flows","Wu, Fei; Sioshansi, Ramteen","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; electric vehicles; infrastructure location; stochastic; optimization","Here, we develop a model to optimize the location of public fast charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs). A difficulty in planning the placement of charging stations is uncertainty in where EV charging demands appear. For this reason, we use a stochastic flow-capturing location model (SFCLM). A sample-average approximation method and an averaged two-replication procedure are used to solve the problem and estimate the solution quality. We demonstrate the use of the SFCLM using a Central-Ohio based case study. We find that most of the stations built are concentrated around the urban core of the region. As the number of stations built increases, some appear on the outskirts of the region to provide an extended charging network. We find that the sets of optimal charging station locations as a function of the number of stations built are approximately nested. We demonstrate the benefits of the charging-station network in terms of how many EVs are able to complete their daily trips by charging midday—six public charging stations allow at least 60% of EVs that would otherwise not be able to complete their daily tours without the stations to do so. We finally compare the SFCLM to a deterministic model, in which EV flows are set equal to their expected values. We show that if a limited number of charging stations are to be built, the SFCLM outperforms the deterministic model. As the number of stations to be built increases, the SFCLM and deterministic model select very similar station locations.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of International Affairs (IA)","","United States","2017-05-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transportation Research.

We show several examples of recent security incidents involving UAVs in France, USA, and United Arab Emirates. Further, the potential threats to nuclear facilities and measures to prevent them are evaluated. The importance of measures for detection, delay, and response (neutralization) of UAVs at nuclear facilities are discussed. An overview of existing technologies along with their strength and weaknesses are shown.

"Ion-damage-free planarization or shallow angle sectioning of solar cells for mapping grain orientation and nanoscale photovoltaic properties","Kutes, Yasemin; Luria, Justin; Sun, Yu; Moore, Andrew; Aguirre, Brandon A.; Cruz-Campa, Jose L.; Aindow, Mark; Zubia, David; Huey, Bryan D.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 77 NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY","Ion beam milling is the most common modern method for preparing specific features for microscopic analysis, even though concomitant ion implantation and amorphization remain persistent challenges, particularly as they often modify materials properties of interest. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), on the other hand, can mechanically mill specific nanoscale regions in plan-view without chemical or high energy ion damage, due to its resolution, directionality, and fine load control. As an example, AFM-nanomilling (AFM-NM) is implemented for top-down planarization of polycrystalline CdTe thin film solar cells, with a resulting decrease in the root mean square (RMS) roughness by an order of magnitude, even better than for a low incidence FIB polished surface. Subsequently AFM-based property maps reveal a substantially stronger contrast, in this case of the short-circuit current or open circuit voltage during light exposure. Furthermore, electron back scattering diffraction (EBSD) imaging also becomes possible upon AFM-NM, enabling direct correlations between the local materials properties and the polycrystalline microstructure. Smooth shallow-angle cross-sections are demonstrated as well, based on targeted oblique milling. As expected, this reveals a gradual decrease in the average short-circuit current and maximum power as the underlying CdS and electrode layers are approached, but a relatively consistent open-circuit voltage through the diminishing thickness of the CdTe absorber. AFM-based nanomilling is therefore a powerful tool for material characterization, uniquely providing ion-damage free, selective area, planar smoothing or low-angle sectioning of specimens while preserving their functionality. This then enables novel, co-located advanced AFM measurements, EBSD analysis, and investigations by related techniques that are otherwise hindered by surface morphology or surface damage.","IOP Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

We implemented the algorithm in a network of 18 signalized intersections and compare the performance of RMART with fixed, adaptive, and variants of the RL schemes. Results show significant improvement in system performance for RMART algorithm with information sharing over both traditional fixed signal timing plans and real time adaptive control schemes. Additionally, the comparison with reinforcement learning algorithms including Q learning and SARSA indicate that RMART performs better at higher congestion levels. Further, a multi-reward structure is proposed that dynamically adjusts the reward function with varying congestion states at the intersection.

"Socially optimal replacement of conventional with electric vehicles for the US household fleet","Kontou, Eleftheria; Yin, Yafeng; Lin, Zhenhong; He, Fang","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; vehicle replacement; battery electric vehicles (BEVs); internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs); charging density; all-electric driving range; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","In this study, a framework is proposed for minimizing the societal cost of replacing gas-powered household passenger cars with battery electric ones (BEVs). The societal cost consists of operational costs of heterogeneous driving patterns' cars, the government investments for charging deployment, and monetized environmental externalities. The optimization framework determines the timeframe needed for conventional vehicles to be replaced with BEVs. It also determines the BEVs driving range during the planning timeframe, as well as the density of public chargers deployed on a linear transportation network over time. We leverage datasets that represent U.S. household driving patterns, as well as the automobile and the energy markets, to apply the model. Results indicate that it takes 8 years for 80% of our conventional vehicle sample to be replaced with electric vehicles, under the base case scenario. The socially optimal all-electric driving range is 204 miles, with chargers placed every 172 miles on a linear corridor. All of the public chargers should be deployed at the beginning of the planning horizon to achieve greater savings over the years. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the timeframe for the socially optimal conversion of 80% of the sample varies from 6 to 12 years. The optimal decision variables are sensitive to battery pack and vehicle body cost, gasoline cost, the discount rate, and conventional vehicles' fuel economy. In conclusion, faster conventional vehicle replacement is achieved when the gasoline cost increases, electricity cost decreases, and battery packs become cheaper over the years.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Quantifying autonomous vehicles national fuel consumption impacts: A data-rich approach","Chen, Yuche; Gonder, Jeffrey; Young, Stanley; Wood, Eric","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel consumption; autonomous vehicles; data-rich energy modeling","Autonomous vehicles are drawing significant attention from governments, manufacturers and consumers. Experts predict them to be the primary means of transportation by the middle of this century. Recent literature shows that vehicle automation has the potential to alter traffic patterns, vehicle ownership, and land use, which may affect fuel consumption from the transportation sector. In this paper, we developed a data-rich analytical framework to quantify system-wide fuel impacts of automation in the United States by integrating (1) a dynamic vehicle sales, stock, and usage model, (2) an historical transportation network-level vehicle miles traveled (VMT)/vehicle activity database, and (3) estimates of automation's impacts on fuel efficiency and travel demand. The vehicle model considers dynamics in vehicle fleet turnover and fuel efficiency improvements of conventional and advanced vehicle fleet. The network activity database contains VMT, free-flow speeds, and historical speeds of road links that can help us accurately identify fuel-savings opportunities of automation. Based on the model setup and assumptions, we found that the impacts of automation on fuel consumption are quite wide-ranging - with the potential to reduce fuel consumption by 45% in our 'Optimistic' case or increase it by 30% in our 'Pessimistic' case. Second, implementing automation on urban roads could potentially result in larger fuel savings compared with highway automation because of the driving features of urban roads. Lastly, through scenario analysis, we showed that the proposed framework can be used for refined assessments as better data on vehicle-level fuel efficiency and travel demand impacts of automation become available.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Full vehicle testing was conducted on chassis dynamometers over the US Environmental Protection Agency Federal Test Procedure, Highway Fuel Economy Test and US06 using RCCI combustion with commercially available gasoline and ultra-low sulphur diesel. Fuel economy and emissions data were recorded over the specified test cycles. Testing revealed that engine-out emissions were similar to steady-state dynamometer engine testing. However, tailpipe-out emissions saw a reduction of HC and CO during the HWFET of 98.5%. Fuel economy was lower than expected due to the higher drivetrain losses of the series hybrid drivetrain. Finally, simulated changes to the drivetrain showed that it may be possible to increase fuel economy significantly, while meeting EPA emissions standards.","Inderscience","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

By employing both scenario and parametric analysis for policy driven injection of public charging stations we find the following: (1) For large deployments of public chargers, DC fast chargers are more effective than level 2 chargers at increasing BEV sales, increasing electrified mileage, and lowering GHG emissions, even if only one DC fast charging station can be built for every ten level 2 charging stations. (2) A national initiative to build DC fast charging infrastructure will see diminishing returns on investment at approximately 30,000 stations. (3) Some infrastructure deployment costs can be defrayed by passing them back to electric vehicle consumers, but once those costs to the consumer reach the equivalent of approximately 12¢/kWh for all miles driven, almost all gains to BEV sales and GHG emissions reductions from infrastructure construction are lost.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Availability and Maintenance Modeling for GIS Equipment Served in High-Speed Railway Under Incomplete Maintenance","Wang, Qi; He, Zhengyou; Lin, Sheng; Liu, Yilu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; high-speed railway (HSR); traction power supply system (TPSS); gas-insulated substation (GIS); failure model; availability; incomplete maintenance; maintenance strategy","Gas-insulated substation (GIS) equipment served in the traction power-supply system (TPSS) of the high-speed railway (HSR) suffers from extremely severe traction load conditions during its lifetime. In this paper, three major issues related to the actual field maintenance operations of GIS equipment in TPSS are addressed: 1) s-dependent degradation and shock process; 2) both spatial and temporal failure thresholds of shocks; and 3) incomplete maintenance (i.e., nonignorable maintenance time). To model the deterioration and failure process of GIS equipment, the hard failure model and the soft failure model are proposed. The characteristic function is utilized to bridge the s-dependent degradation and shock process in the soft failure model, while the extreme shock model (with spatial threshold) and δ-shock model (with temporal threshold) are introduced in the hard failure model. Furthermore, the index of availability, which combines both reliability and maintainability, is derived under the incomplete maintenance consideration. Based on the balance of availability and maintenance cost, the maintenance strategy with periodic inspections for GIS equipment in the long-run time span is developed. In conclusion, optimizations of three decision parameters (i.e., inspection period, extreme shock threshold, and δ-shock threshold) are implemented to achieve the best performance (with high availability and low maintenance cost) of the maintenance strategy.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this work, the effects of fuel laminar flame speed on both lean and EGR dilute spark ignition combustion stability were examined. Fuels blends of pure components (iso-octane, n-heptane, toluene, ethanol, and methanol) were derived at two levels of laminar flame speed. Each fuel blend was tested in a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine under both lean-out and EGR dilution sweeps until the coefficient of variance of indicated mean effective pressure increased above thresholds of 3% and 5%. The relative importance of fuel laminar flame speed to changes to engine design parameters (spark ignition energy, tumble ratio, and port vs. direct injection) was also assessed. Our results showed that fuel laminar flame speed can have as big an effect on lean or EGR dilute engine operation as engine design parameters, with the largest effects seen during EGR dilute operation and when changes were made to cylinder charge motion.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

The approach employs a model that separately tracks the impacts on efficiency due to differences in rate of heat addition, volume change, mass addition, and molecular weight change for a given combination of working fluid, heat release profile, and engine geometry. Comparative analysis between measured and modeled efficiencies illustrates fundamental sources of efficiency reductions or opportunities inherent to various combustion regimes. Engine operating regimes chosen for analysis include stoichiometric spark-ignited combustion and lean compression-ignited combustion including HCCI, SA-HCCI, RCCI, GCI, and CDC. Within each combustion regime, effects such as engine load, combustion duration, combustion phasing, combustion chamber geometry, fuel properties, and charge dilution are explored. Model findings illustrate that even in the absence of losses such as heat transfer or incomplete combustion, the maximum possible thermal efficiency inherent to each operating strategy varies to a significant degree. Additionally, the experimentally measured losses are observed to be unique within a given operating strategy. The findings highlight the fact that in order to create a roadmap for future directions in ICE technologies, it is important to not only compare the absolute real-world efficiency of a given combustion strategy, but to also examine the measured efficiency in context of what is thermodynamically possible with the working fluid and boundary conditions prescribed by a strategy.","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The impacts of battery capacity combined with regular and ultrafast charging over different routes have been analyzed in terms of the ability to maintain city transit bus service reliability like conventional buses. These results show that ultrafast charging via frequent short-time boost charging events, for example at a designated bus stop after completing each circuit of an assigned route, can play a significant role in reducing the battery size and can eliminate the need for longer duration charging events that would cause schedule delays. Furthermore, the analysis presented shows that significant benefits can be realized by employing multiple battery configurations and flexible battery swapping practices in electric buses. These flexible design and use options will allow electric buses to service routes of varying city driving patterns and can therefore enable meaningful reductions to the cost of the vehicle and battery while ensuring service that is as reliable as conventional buses.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Nanostructure and burning mode of light-duty diesel particulate with conventional diesel, biodiesel, and intermediate blends","Strzelec, Andrea; Vander Wal, Randy L.; Lewis, Samuel A.; Toops, Todd J.; Daw, C. Stuart","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","The nanostructure of diesel particulates has been shown to impact its oxidation rate and burnout trajectory. Additionally, this nanostructure can evolve during the oxidation process, furthering its influence on the burnout process. For this paper, exhaust particulates were generated on a light-duty diesel engine with conventional diesel fuel, biodiesel, and intermediate blends of the two at a single load-speed point. Despite the singular engine platform and operating point, the different fuels created particulates with varied nanostructure, thereby greatly expanding the window for observing nanostructure evolution and oxidation. The physical and chemical properties of the particulates in the nascent state and at partial oxidation states were measured in a laboratory reactor and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as a function of the degree of oxidation in O<sub>2</sub>. X-ray photoacoustic spectroscopy analysis, thermal desorption, and solvent extraction of the nascent particulate samples reveal a significant organic content in the biodiesel-derived particulates, likely accounting for differences in the nanostructure. This study reports the nanoscale structural changes in the particulate with biofuel blend level and during O<sub>2</sub> oxidation as observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and quantitated by fringe analysis and Brunnauer–Emmet–Teller total surface area measurements. It was observed that initial fuel-related differences in the lamella lengths, spacing, and curvature disappear when the particulate reaches approximately 50% burnout. Specifically, the initial ordered, fullerenic, and amorphous nanostructures converge during the oxidation process and the surface areas of these particulates appear to grow through these complex changes in internal particle structure. The specific surface area, measured at several points along the burnout trajectory, did not match the shrinking core projection and in contrast suggested that internal porosity was increasing. Thus, the appropriate burnout model for these particulates is significantly different from the standard shrinking core assumption, which does not account for any internal structure. Finally, an alternative burnout model is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image analysis.","SAGE Publications","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"RCCI Combustion Regime Transitions in a Single-Cylinder Optical Engine and a Multi-Cylinder Metal Engine","Roberts, Gregory; Rousselle, Christine Mounaim; Musculus, Mark; Wissink, Martin; Curran, Scott; Eagle, Ethan","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION","We present that Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) is an approach to increase engine efficiency and lower engine-out emissions by using in-cylinder stratification of fuels with differing reactivity (i.e., autoignition characteristics) to control combustion phasing. Stratification can be altered by varying the injection timing of the high-reactivity fuel, causing transitions across multiple regimes of combustion. When injection is sufficiently early, combustion approaches a highly-premixed autoignition regime, and when it is sufficiently late it approaches more mixing-controlled, diesel-like conditions. Engine performance, emissions, and control authority over combustion phasing with injection timing are most favorable in between, within the RCCI regime.To study charge preparation phenomena that dictate regime transitions, two different optical diagnostics are applied in a single-cylinder heavy-duty optical engine, and conventional engine diagnostics are applied in a multi-cylinder, light-duty all-metal engine. Both engines are operated with iso-octane and n-heptane as the low- and high-reactivity fuels, respectively. The iso-octane fuel fraction delivers 80% of the total fuel energy, the global equivalence ratio is 0.35, and no exhaust gas recirculation is used. In the optical engine, single-shot, band-pass infrared (IR) imaging of emission near 3.3 microns measures thermal C-H stretch-band emission of hot fuel vapor and intermediate combustion products, providing qualitative information about the fuel-vapor distribution and ignition locations during low-temperature heat release. Additionally, high-speed 7.2 kHz visible-light imaging of natural luminosity, optimized to detect chemiluminescence, indicates the spatial and temporal evolution of high-temperature heat release and combustion. Similar combustion regimes are observed for both engine platforms, allowing an opportunity for optical engine data to provide insight into fundamental phenomena affecting regime ranges and transitions in production engines. Key findings from imaging diagnostics indicate that at the late-injection limit of RCCI control authority, low-temperature ignition occurs when clearly identifiable jet structures are still intact, and during high-temperature combustion there is prevalent and persistent soot incandescence representative of locally mixing-limited (i.e., fuel-rich) combustion. Finally, at the early-injection limit of RCCI control, observed stratification during low-temperature ignition is subtle; however, high-temperature combustion still occurs sequentially from the bowl rim radially inwards.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

(ORCID:0000000235504423); Splitter, Derek A.","02 PETROLEUM; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; LTHR; ITHR; octane; knock; octane sensitivity; boost; octane index; low temperature heat release; intermediate heat release; negative temperature coefficient","The octane sensitivity (S), defined as the difference between the Research Octane Number (RON) and the Motor Octane Number (MON), is of increasing interest in spark ignition (SI) engines because of its relevance to knock resistance at boosted high load conditions. In this study, three fuels with nearly constant RON (99.2-100) and varying S (S = 0, 6.5, and 12) are operated at the knock limited spark advance (KLSA) at nominal engine loads of 10, 15, and 20 bar IMEP in a single cylinder SI engine with side-mount direct injection fueling, at λ =1 stoichiometry. At each load condition, the intake manifold temperature is swept from 35 °C to 95 °C to alter the temperature and pressure history of the charge. Results show that at the 10 bar IMEP condition, knock resistance is inversely proportional to fuel S where the S=0 fuel is the most knock resist, but as load increases the trend reverses and knock resistance becomes proportional to fuel S, and the S=12 fuel is the most knock resistant. The reversal of knock resistance as a function of S with load it is attributed to changing fuel ignition delay, as bulk gas intermediate temperature heat release (ITHR) is observed for the S = 0 several crank angles prior to the spark command and ITHR magnitude is a function of increasing intake temperature. As intake temperature continued to increase, the S=0 fuel transitioned from ITHR to low-temperature heat release (LTHR) prior to the spark event. At the highest load and intake temperature, 95 C, the S=0 fuel exhibits distinct LTHR and negative temperature coefficient (NTC), and the intermediate S value fuel (S=6.5) exhibited distinct ITHR behavior several crank angles prior to the spark command. However, for the tested conditions, the S=12 fuel exhibits neither ITHR nor LTHR. To understand the measured trends, chemical kinetic modeling is used to elucidate the fuel specific dependencies on in-cylinder temperature and pressure history. Lastly, the bulk gas composition change that occurs for fuels and conditions exhibiting ITHR and LTHR is analyzed in the modeling, including their implications on flame speed and combustion stability at late phasing. Furthermore, the combined findings illustrate the commonality and utility of fuel S, ITHR, LTHR, and NTC across a wide range of conditions, and the associated implications of fuel S in highly boosted modern GDI SI engines relative to the RON and MON tests.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Experiments were conducted in a constant pressure flow vessel, whereby a customized single-hole common-rail diesel injector is used to introduce n-heptane fuel into a coflow of low-speed ambient air at two different test conditions. Only the quasi-steady period of the fuel spray is considered, and multiple injections are performed to acquire statistically significant data at an image acquisition rate of 20 kHz. An algorithm to identify the liquid boundary using intensity recorded by the RSD images is presented. The results are compared against measurements obtained by the Mie scattering technique. Our results demonstrate that the RSD can be a powerful optical diagnostics technique to simultaneously quantify both the vapor and liquid regions in the high-pressure fuel sprays.","Optical Society of America","","Univ. of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC)","","United States","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Optics; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 30","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 8385","","","EE0007301","Journal ID: ISSN 1559-128X; APOPAI","10.1364/AO.56.008385","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1429110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1429110","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1429110","Applied Optics","30","56"

This article addresses a problem where a group of heterogeneous aerial or ground vehicles with different motion constraints located at distinct depots visit a set of targets. The vehicles also may be equipped with different sensors, and therefore, a target may not be visited by any vehicle. The objective is to find an optimal path for each vehicle starting and ending at its respective depot such that each target is visited at least once by some vehicle, the vehicle–target constraints are satisfied, and the sum of the length of the paths for all the vehicles is minimized. Two variants of this problem are formulated (one for ground vehicles and another for aerial vehicles) as mixed-integer linear programs and a branchand- cut algorithm is developed to compute an optimal solution to each of the variants. Computational results show that optimal solutions for problems involving 100 targets and 5 vehicles can be obtained within 300 seconds on average, further corroborating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Recently, advances in large-scale additive manufacturing have provided the means to bridge hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation and preproduction mule chassis evaluation. This paper details the accelerated development of a printed range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, by paralleling hardware-in-the-loop development of the powertrain with rapid chassis prototyping using big area additive manufacturing (BAAM). BAAM's ability to accelerate the mule vehicle development from computer-aided design to vehicle build is explored. The use of a hardware-in-the-loop laboratory is described as it is applied to the design of a range-extended electric powertrain to be installed in a printed prototype vehicle. The integration of the powertrain and the opportunities and challenges it presents are described in this work. A comparison of offline simulation, HIL and chassis rolls results is presented to validate the development process. Chassis dynamometer results for battery electric and range extender operation are analyzed to show the benefits of the architecture.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Data-driven fuel consumption estimation: A multivariate adaptive regression spline approach","Chen, Yuche; Zhu, Lei; Gonder, Jeffrey; Young, Stanley; Walkowicz, Kevin","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; data-driven analytics; fuel consumption estimation; multivariate adaptive regression spline; eco-routing","Providing guidance and information to drivers to help them make fuel-efficient route choices remains an important and effective strategy in the near term to reduce fuel consumption from the transportation sector. One key component in implementing this strategy is a fuel-consumption estimation model. In this paper, we developed a mesoscopic fuel consumption estimation model that can be implemented into an eco-routing system. Our proposed model presents a framework that utilizes large-scale, real-world driving data, clusters road links by free-flow speed and fits one statistical model for each of cluster. This model includes predicting variables that were rarely or never considered before, such as free-flow speed and number of lanes. We applied the model to a real-world driving data set based on a global positioning system travel survey in the Philadelphia-Camden-Trenton metropolitan area. Results from the statistical analyses indicate that the independent variables we chose influence the fuel consumption rates of vehicles. But the magnitude and direction of the influences are dependent on the type of road links, specifically free-flow speeds of links. Here, a statistical diagnostic is conducted to ensure the validity of the models and results. Although the real-world driving data we used to develop statistical relationships are specific to one region, the framework we developed can be easily adjusted and used to explore the fuel consumption relationship in other regions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fuel Consumption Sensitivity of Conventional and Hybrid Electric Light-Duty Gasoline Vehicles to Driving Style","Thomas, John; Huff, Shean; West, Brian; Chambon, Paul","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; automotive; regenerative braking; fuel economy; vehicle drivers; hybrid electric vehicles","Aggressive driving is a very important topic for many reasons, one of which is higher energy used per unit distance traveled, potentially accompanied by an elevated production of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Examining a large data set of self-reported fuel economy (FE) values revealed that the dispersion of FE values is quite large and is larger for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) than for conventional gasoline vehicles. This occurred despite the fact that the city and highway FE ratings for HEVs are generally much closer in value than for conventional gasoline vehicles. A study was undertaken to better understand this and better quantify the effects of aggressive driving, including reviewing past aggressive driving studies, developing and exercising a new vehicle energy model, and conducting a related experimental investigation. The vehicle energy model focused on the limitations of regenerative braking in combination with varying levels of driving-style aggressiveness to show that this could account for greater FE variation in an HEV compared to a similar conventional vehicle. A closely matched pair of gasoline-fueled sedans, one an HEV and the other having a conventional powertrain, was chosen for both modeling and chassis dynamometer experimental comparisons. Results indicate that the regenerative braking limitations could be a main contributor to the greater HEV FE variation under the range of drive cycles considered. Finally, the complete body of results gives insight into the range of fuel use penalties that results from aggressive driving and why the variation can be larger on a percent basis for an HEV compared to a similar conventional vehicle, while the absolute fuel use penalty for aggressive driving is generally larger for conventional vehicles than HEVs.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The PHEV drivers and the government were stakeholders who might have preferred different charging control strategies. For the former, a proposed controlled charging scheme minimized the operational cost during PHEV charge-depleting and sustaining modes. For the latter, the research minimized monetized carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation for the PHEVs charging, as well as tailpipe emissions for the portion of PHEV trips fueled by gasoline. Hourly driving patterns and electricity data were leveraged. Both were representative of each of the eight North American Electric Reliability Corporation regions to examine the results of the proposed schemes. The model accounted for drivers' activity patterns and charging availability spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The optimal charging profiles confirmed the differing nature of the objectives of PHEV drivers and the government; cost-effective charge should occur early in the morning, while ecofriendly charge should be late in the afternoon. Each control's trade-offs between operation cost and emission savings are discussed for each North American Electric Reliability Corporation region. The availability of workplace and public charging was found to affect the optimal charging profiles greatly. Charging control is more efficient for drivers and government when PHEVs have greater electric range.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the market acceptance of PEVs in the future remains largely uncertain from today's perspective. By integrating a consumer choice model based on nested multinomial logit and Monte Carlo simulation, this study analyzes the uncertainty of PEV market penetration using Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that the future market for PEVs is highly uncertain and there is a substantial risk of low penetration in the early and midterm market. Top factors contributing to market share variability are price sensitivities, energy cost, range limitation, and charging availability. The results also illustrate the potential effect of public policies in promoting PEVs through investment in battery technology and infrastructure deployment. Here, continued improvement of battery technologies and deployment of charging infrastructure alone do not necessarily reduce the spread of market share distributions, but may shift distributions toward right, i.e., increase the probability of having great market success.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study an autonomous Sensor Fish device was deployed at Arrowrock Dam, Cougar Dam, and Detroit Dam to evaluate the hydraulic conditions and physical stresses that fish experienced when passing through these Francis turbines. Pressure data was used to identify the location of the Sensor Fish and to calculate the nadir pressure and the magnitude and the rate of change in pressure during turbine passage. Acceleration data was used to identify events (collisions or shear) Sensor Fish experienced and to categorize the severity level (severe, medium, and slight) of each event. The results showed that Sensor Fish experienced severe events mostly in the stay vane/wicket gate region and the runner region. In the stay vane/wicket gate region, almost all severe events were collisions. In the runner region, Sensor fish experienced both severe collisions and severe shear events. Sensor Fish data at three wicket gate opening treatments at Cougar Dam indicated that the wicket gate opening of the Francis turbine can affect the hydraulic conditions in the turbine runner region. Fewer Sensor Fish experienced severe collisions in the turbine runner region at the peak efficiency than at the minimum opening and the maximum opening treatments. Comparisons between the Francis turbines at the three dams and the AHT Kaplan turbine at Wanapum Dam showed that higher percentage of Sensor Fish experienced severe events in the runner region when passing through Francis turbines than the AHT Kaplan turbine. The nadir pressures of the Francis turbines were lower than those of the AHT Kaplan turbine at Wanapum Dam. Both the magnitude and the rate of change in pressure were higher in Francis turbines than in the AHT Kaplan turbine at Wanapum Dam in the runner region. This study can be used to guide future laboratory studies of fish passing through Francis turbine and help the design of more fish-friendly turbines for new hydroelectric dams or the rehabilitations of existing dams.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) has developed several nuclear propulsion rockets since 1950. Especially Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA) program focused on long term missions in NASA. Planned/unplanned transients on nuclear thermal rockets have to be investigated for these rockets to be sure that they can be utilized for long term missions. This work demonstrates the modelling of nuclear propulsion rocket. By using this new model based on RELAP5 system code, corrosion induced blockages on radiation heat transfer has been investigated for the Pewee I rocket. The blockage locations in the coolant system have been defined based on the experimental data which is available in the literature to use in the computational models. To capture the 3 dimensional (3D) heat transfer modes in the reactor core of Pewee I, a detailed 3D system model has been developed to identify specifically the effect of corrosion on the radiation heat transfer. It was concluded that the pressure drop across the peripheral fuel element coolant holes was also larger than other channels. In addition, it was noticed that radiation heat transfer rate for the channels undergoing blockages increases when the radiation heat transfer rate in their neighbor channels decrease. The temperature of the peripheral fuel elements will gradually get closer to the melting point of Uranium Carbide, especially when the coolant channels undergo the most severe blockage.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 7 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1451-1454","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3209090798","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050413","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

It is also of interest for use as an Helicon Injected IEC Rocket, or HIIPER. In both cases the use of the external plasma source allows a lower pressure in the IEC chamber, reducing inefficiency due to ion charge exchange losses. As a neutron source, the IEC grids serve to recirculate the deuterium ions such that fusion collisions can occur. For HIIPER asymmetry in the IEC grids forms a jet-like exhaust of accelerated plasma, producing a force. In both cases the IEC grid is designed to extract ions from the external radio frequency (RF) plasma generating stage run in the helicon mode. Because electrons have been measured in glow discharge mode for this grid design, the HIIPER exhaust plasma is potentially a neutralized plasma flow. This is a benefit over ion and Hall thrusters, which require electron generating cathodes to neutralize the accelerated ion exhaust. An additional benefit of this setup is that separating the plasma generating and plasma-accelerating stages is beneficial for space mission planning.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 7 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 343-344","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V2934087803","","","2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","23047418","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23047418","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"

Design of the powertrain boost converter is challenging because the converter must be rated at high peak power, while efficiency at medium-to-light load is critical for the vehicle system performance. By addressing only some of the loss mechanisms, previously proposed efficiency improvement approaches offer limited improvements in size, cost, and efficiency tradeoffs. This article shows how all dominant loss mechanisms in automotive powertrain applications can be mitigated using a new boost composite converter approach. In the composite dc-dc architecture, the loss mechanisms associated with indirect power conversion are addressed explicitly, resulting in fundamental efficiency improvements over wide ranges of operating conditions. Several composite converter topologies are presented and compared to state-of-the-art boost converter technologies. It is found that the selected boost composite converter results in a decrease in the total loss by a factor of 2-4 for typical drive cycles. Furthermore, the total system capacitor power rating and energy rating are substantially reduced, which implies potentials for significant reductions in system size and cost.","IEEE","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 98-116","","","EE0006921","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2016.2533347","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1429088","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1429088","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1429088","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","32"

"Guest Editorial Special Issue on Wireless Charging Systems","Onar, Omer C.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Special issues and sections; Wireless power transfer; Inductive charging; Electric vehicles","Wireless power transfer is a safe and convenient method for electric vehicle (EV) charging. And, if designed properly, it can be highly efficient. Applications cover a wide range of power transfer levels from less than a kilowatt to a few hundreds of kilowatts with transfer distances from a few millimeters to a few hundreds of millimeters. Applications also cover stationary, dynamic (in-motion), or quasi dynamic wireless charging systems. Safety is inherent in wireless power transfer systems due to the large airgap separation between the source and load sides, and users do not have to touch any cables, connectors, or plugs at all. With the recent advancements in automation, parking aid systems can be integrated and the wireless charging process can be a simple “park and go” approach without requiring any input from the driver.When applied in motion, wireless charging can be the ultimate end of game in transportation electrification, providing reduced battery size and cost with unlimited range for EVs. This approach is also known as ”charge-on-the-go” or “roadway powered vehicle” concept. While the connected and automated vehicles can self-drive and self-park, they currently cannot self-charge. Furthermore, wireless charging is a key enabling technology for the widespread development and adoption of connected and automated vehicle technology for the future of smart mobility.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, Ignition remains as the main limiting factor in achieving further performance improvements in these engines. Addressing this concern, while incorporating various recent advances in optics and laser technologies, laser igniters were designed and developed through numerous iterations. Final designs incorporated water-cooled, passively Q-switched, Nd:YAG micro-lasers that were optimized for stable operation under harsh engine conditions. Subsequently, the micro-lasers were installed in the individual cylinders of a lean-burn, 350 kW, inline 6-cylinder, open-chamber, spark ignited engine and tests were conducted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world’s first demonstration of a laser ignited multi-cylinder natural gas engine. The engine was operated at high-load (298 kW) and rated speed (1800 rpm) conditions. Ignition timing sweeps and excess-air ratio (λ) sweeps were performed while keeping the NOx emissions below the USEPA regulated value (BSNOx < 1.34 g/kW-hr), and while maintaining ignition stability at industry acceptable values (COV_IMEP <5 %). Through such engine tests, the relative merits of (i) standard electrical ignition system, and (ii) laser ignition system were determined. In conclusion, a rigorous combustion data analysis was performed and the main reasons leading to improved performance in the case of laser ignition were identified.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

"Lube oil-dependent ash chemistry on soot oxidation reactivity in a gasoline direct-injection engine","Choi, Seungmok; Seong, Heeje","42 ENGINEERING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine; Gasoline particulate filter (GPF); Soot oxidation reactivity; Lube oil additives; Ash","Gasoline particulate filters (GPF) are considered an enabling technology to meet stringent particulate matter (PM) regulations for gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engines, which are known to produce significant PM emissions. While ash loading in filters has been recognized to be detrimental in filter performance by increasing back pressure, increased ash fractions in soot were observed to enhance soot oxidation. In this study, GDI soot samples derived from different gasoline/lube oil blends were evaluated to identify potential promoting factors when formulated lube oils were dosed into gasoline fuel. Ca-derived ash enhanced soot oxidation remarkably, while P- and ZDDP-derived ash deteriorated soot oxidation. It is apparent that the promoting effect of lube oil-derived ash is due mainly to the Ca component that is the most abundant among additive components in lube oil. Bulk and surface analyses of these ash compounds indicate that Ca-derived ash would be complex compounds, while the contribution of CaSO<sub>4</sub>, which is one of the most abundant ash compounds from diesel engines, is almost negligible. For the validation of the ash promoting impact in filters, the regeneration experiments were compared for a TWC-coated GPF in a GDI engine before and after ash loading was performed. The pressure drop of the ash-loaded GPF decreased noticeably in the initial regeneration stage and it increased gradually, whereas that of no ash-loaded GPF increased gradually without any reduction. So, it is concluded that the ash layer in the GPF assisted soot oxidation in the early regeneration stage when it was in close contact with soot.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Simulations were conducted with a compressible Eulerian flow solver modeling liquid, vapor, and non-condensable gas phases with a diffuse interface. Variable rate generation and condensation of fuel vapor were captured using the homogeneous relaxation model (HRM). The non-flashing (spray G) and flashing (spray G2) conditions specified by the Engine Combustion Network were modeled using the nominal spray G nozzle geometry and transient needle lift and wobble were based upon ensemble averaged x-ray imaging preformed at Argonne National Lab. The minimum needle lift simulated was 5 μm and dynamic mesh motion was achieved with Laplacian smoothing. The results were qualitatively validated against experimental imaging and the experimental rate of injection profile was captured accurately using pressure boundary conditions and needle motion to actu- ate the injection. Needle wobble was found to have no measurable effect on the flow. Low needle lift is shown to result in vapor generation as fuel rushes past the needle. In conclusion, the internal injector flow is shown to contain many transient and interacting vortices which cause perturbations in the spray angle, fluctuations in the mass flux, and frequently result in string flash-boiling.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Technological growth of fuel efficiency in european automobile market 1975–2015","Hu, Kejia; Chen, Yuche","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; fuel consumption; technology development; new cars","This paper looks at the technological growth of new car fleet fuel efficiency in the European Union between 1975 and 2015. According to the analysis results, from1975 to 2006 the fuel efficiency technology improvements were largely offset by vehicles' increased weight, engine size, and consumer amenities such as acceleration capacity. After 2006, downsizing in weight and engine capacity was observed in new car fleet, while fuel consumption decreased by 32% between 2006 and 2015. We adopt a statistical method and find that from 1975 to 2015, a 1% increase in weight would result in 0.3 to 0.5% increments in fuel consumption per 100 km, and a 1% reduction in 0-100 km/h acceleration time would increase fuel consumption by about 0.3%. Impacts of other attributes on fuel consumption are also assessed. To meet the European Union's 2021 fuel consumption target, downsizing of cars, as well as at least maintaining fuel efficiency technology growth trend observed between 2005 and 2015, are needed. Lastly, government policies on controlling improvement in acceleration performance or promoting alternative fuel vehicles are also important to achieve European Union 2021 target.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Prechamber equipped laser ignition for improved performance in natural gas engines","Almansour, Bader; Vasu, Subith; Gupta, Sreenath B.; Wang, Qing; Van Leeuwen, Robert; Ghosh, Chuni","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Cogeneration; Gas engine; Laser ignition; Natural gas; Unscavenged prechamber","Lean-burn operation of stationary natural gas engines offers lower NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and improved efficiency. A proven pathway to extend lean-burn operation has been to use laser ignition instead of standard spark ignition. However, under lean conditions, flame speed reduces thereby offsetting any efficiency gains resulting from the higher ratio of specific heats, γ. The reduced flame speeds, in turn, can be compensated with the use of a prechamber to result in volumetric ignition, and thereby lead to faster combustion. In this study, the optimal geometry of PCLI was identified through several tests in a single-cylinder engine as a compromise between autoignition, NO<sub>x</sub> and soot formation within the prechamber. Subsequently, tests were conducted in a single-cylinder natural gas engine comparing the performance of three ignition systems: standard electrical spark ignition (SI), single-point laser ignition (LI), and prechamber equipped laser ignition (PCLI). Out of the three, the performance of PCLI was far superior compared to the other two. Efficiency gain of 2.1% points could be achieved while complying with EPA regulation (BSNO<sub>x</sub> < 1.34 kW-hr) and the industry standard for ignition stability (COV_IMEP < 5%). Finally, test results and data analysis are presented identifying the combustion mechanisms leading to the improved performance.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

Furthermore, the diagnostic is based on absorption spectroscopy and includes an H<sub>2</sub>O absorption system (utilizing a 1.39 m distributed feedback (DFB) diode laser) for measuring gas temperature, pressure, and H<sub>2</sub>O concentration, and a CO<sub>2</sub> absorption system (utilizing a 2.7 m DFB laser) for measuring CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The various lasers, optical components and detectors were housed in an instrument box, and the 1.39- m and 2.7- m lasers were guided to and from the engine-mounted probes via optical fibers and hollow waveguides, respectively. The 5kHz measurement bandwidth allows for near-crank angle resolved measurements, with a resolution of 1.2 crank angle degrees at 1000 RPM. Our use of compact stainless steel measurement probes enables simultaneous multi-point measurements at various locations on the engine with minimal changes to the base engine hardware; in addition to resolving large-scale spatial variations via simultaneous multi-probe measurements, local spatial gradients can be resolved by translating individual probes. Along with details of various sensor design features and performance, we also demonstrate validation of the spectral parameters of the associated CO<sub>2</sub> absorption transitions using both a multi-pass heated cell and the sensor probes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The vehicle performs source seeking despite not having any position information about itself or the source, able only to sense a noise corrupted scalar value whose extremum coincides with the unknown source location. In order to control the angular velocity, rather than the angular heading directly, a controller is developed such that the closed loop system exhibits multiple time scales and requires an analysis approach expanding the previous work of Kurzweil, Jarnik, Sussmann, and Liu, utilizing weak limits. We provide analytic proof of stability and demonstrate how this simple scheme can be extended to include position-independent source seeking, tracking, and collision avoidance of groups on autonomous vehicles in GPS-denied environments, based only on a measure of distance to an obstacle, which is an especially important feature for an autonomous agent.","Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Investigation of Iso-octane Ignition and Validation of a Multizone Modeling Method in an Ignition Quality Tester","Osecky, Eric M.; Bogin, Gregory E.; Villano, Stephanie M.; Ratcliff, Matthew A.; Luecke, Jon; Zigler, Bradley T.; Dean, Anthony M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; iso-octane; ignition quality; validation","An ignition quality tester was used to characterize the autoignition delay times of iso-octane. The experimental data were characterized between temperatures of 653 and 996 K, pressures of 1.0 and 1.5 MPa, and global equivalence ratios of 0.7 and 1.05. A clear negative temperature coefficient behavior was seen at both pressures in the experimental data. These data were used to characterize the effectiveness of three modeling methods: a single-zone homogeneous batch reactor, a multizone engine model, and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. A detailed 874 species iso-octane ignition mechanism (Mehl, M.; Curran, H. J.; Pitz, W. J.; Westbrook, C. K.Chemical kinetic modeling of component mixtures relevant to gasoline. Proceedings of the European Combustion Meeting; Vienna, Austria, April 14-17, 2009) was reduced to 89 species for use in these models, and the predictions of the reduced mechanism were consistent with ignition delay times predicted by the detailed chemical mechanism across a broad range of temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. The CFD model was also run without chemistry to characterize the extent of mixing of fuel and air in the chamber. The calculations predicted that the main part of the combustion chamber was fairly well-mixed at longer times (> ~30 ms), suggesting that the simpler models might be applicable in this quasi-homogeneous region. The multizone predictions, where the combustion chamber was divided into 20 zones of temperature and equivalence ratio, were quite close to the coupled CFD-kinetics results, but the calculation time was ~11 times faster than the coupled CFD-kinetics model. Although the coupled CFD-kinetics model captured the observed negative temperature coefficient behavior and pressure dependence, discrepancies remain between the predictions and the observed ignition time delays, suggesting improvements are still needed in the kinetic mechanism and/or the CFD model. This approach suggests a combined modeling approach, wherein the CFD calculations (without chemistry) can be used to examine the sensitivity of various model inputs to in-cylinder temperature and equivalence ratios. In conclusion, these values can be used as inputs to the multizone model to examine the impact on ignition delay. Additionally, the speed of the multizone model also makes it feasible to quickly test more detailed kinetic mechanisms for comparison to experimental data and sensitivity analysis.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We have extended our physics-based model of MIF and FRVs for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to electrified vehicles (EVs) including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We illustrate the utility of the model by calculating MIFs and FRVs for 37 EVs and 13 ICEVs. BEVs have much smaller MIF and FRVs, both in the range 0.04-0.07 L<sub>e</sub>/(100 km 100 kg), than those for ICEVs which are in the ranges 0.19-0.32 and 0.16-0.22 L/(100 km 100 kg), respectively. The MIF and FRVs for HEVs and PHEVs mostly lie between those for ICEVs and BEVs. Powertrain resizing increases the FRVs for ICEVs, HEVs and PHEVs. Lightweighting EVs is less effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions than lightweighting ICEVs, however the benefits differ substantially for different vehicle models. The physics-based approach outlined here enables model specific assessments for ICEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs required to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing the life-cycle benefits of lightweighting the light-duty vehicle fleet.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Magna/Vehma International Inc., Troy, MI (United States); Ford Motor Company, Detroit, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2016-08-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 50; Journal Issue: 20","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11226-11233","","","EE0005574","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X","10.1021/acs.est.6b02059","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1424998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1424998","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1424998","Environmental Science and Technology","20","50"

For truck applications, which are currently responsible for nearly three-quarters of the total U.S. freight energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, platooning has been identified as an early feature for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) that could provide significant fuel savings and improved traffic safety and efficiency without radical design or technology changes compared to existing vehicles. A statistical analysis was performed based on a large collection of real-world U.S. truck usage data to estimate the fraction of total miles that are technically suitable for platooning. In particular, our analysis focuses on estimating 'platoonable' mileage based on overall highway vehicle use and prolonged high-velocity traveling, and established that about 65% of the total miles driven by combination trucks from this data sample could be driven in platoon formation, leading to a 4% reduction in total truck fuel consumption. This technical potential for 'platoonable' miles in the United States provides an upper bound for scenario analysis considering fleet willingness and convenience to platoon as an estimate of overall benefits of early adoption of connected and automated vehicle technologies. A benefit analysis is proposed to assess the overall potential for energy savings and emissions mitigation by widespread implementation of highway platooning for trucks.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Both series and parallel configurations for the hybrid case were studied. The simulation results indicated that series hybrid buses have the greatest overall advantage in fuel economy. The series and parallel hybrid buses were predicted to produce similar carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon tailpipe emissions but were also predicted to have reduced tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides compared with the conventional bus in higher speed cycles. For the New York bus cycle, which has the lowest average speed among the cycles evaluated, the series bus tailpipe emissions were somewhat higher than they were for the conventional bus; the parallel hybrid bus had significantly lower tailpipe emissions. All three bus power trains were found to require periodic active diesel particulate filter regeneration to maintain control of particulate matter. Finally, plug-in operation of series hybrid buses appears to offer significant fuel economy benefits and is easily employed because of the relatively large battery capacity that is typical of the series hybrid configuration.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These flames provide an opportunity to understand turbulence-flame interactions for oxygenated fuels and to develop predictive models for these interactions using a canonical burner geometry. The development of accurate models for DME/air flames would establish a foundation for studies of more complex oxygenated fuels. The flames are stabilized on a piloted jet burner similar to that of the partially-premixed methane/air jet flames that have been studied extensively within the context of the TNF Workshop. This series of six jet flames spans jet exit Reynolds numbers, <i>Re<sub>D</sub></i>, from 29,300 to 73,300 and stoichiometric mixture fractions, ξ<sub>st</sub>, from 0.35 to 0.60. Flame conditions range from very low probability of localized extinction to a high probability of localized extinction and subsequent re-ignition. Measurements in the flames are compared at downstream locations from 5 to 25 diameters above the nozzle exit. Mean and fluctuating velocity components are measured using stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV). Simultaneous laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) imaging of OH and CH<sub>2</sub>O provides insights into the distribution of these intermediate species in partially-premixed DME/air flames.

The model exploits the existing OpenSMOKE++ computational suite to handle detailed kinetic mechanisms, providing reliable predictions of the in-cylinder auto-ignition processes. All the elements with a significant impact on the combustion performances and emissions, like turbulence, heat and mass exchanges, crevices, residual burned gases, thermal and feed stratification are taken into account. Compared to other computational approaches, this model improves the description of mixture stratification phenomena by coupling a wall heat transfer model derived from CFD application with a proper turbulence model. Furthermore, the calibration of this multi-zone model requires only three parameters, which can be derived from a non-reactive CFD simulation: these adaptive variables depend only on the engine geometry and remain fixed across a wide range of operating conditions, allowing the prediction of auto-ignition, pressure traces and pollutants. This computational framework enables the use of detail kinetic mechanisms, as well as Rate of Production Analysis (RoPA) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to investigate the complex chemistry involved in the auto-ignition and the pollutants formation processes. In the final sections of the paper, these capabilities are demonstrated through the comparison with experimental data.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Parallel methodology to capture cyclic variability in motored engines","Ameen, Muhsin M.; Yang, Xiaofeng; Kuo, Tang-Wei; Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Numerical prediction of of cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) in SI engines is extremely challenging for two key reasons: (i) high-fidelity methods such as large eddy simulation (LES) are require to accurately capture the in-cylinder turbulent flowfield, and (ii) CCV is experienced over long timescales and hence the simulations need to be performed for hundreds of consecutive cycles. In this study, a new methodology is proposed to dissociate this long time-scale problem into several shorter time-scale problems, which can considerably reduce the computational time without sacrificing the fidelity of the simulations. The strategy is to perform multiple single-cycle simulations in parallel by effectively perturbing the simulation parameters such as the initial and boundary conditions. It is shown that by perturbing the initial velocity field effectively based on the intensity of the in-cylinder turbulence, the mean and variance of the in-cylinder flowfield is captured reasonably well. Adding perturbations in the initial pressure field and the boundary pressure improves the predictions. It is shown that this new approach is able to give accurate predictions of the flowfield statistics in less than one-tenth of time required for the conventional approach of simulating consecutive engine cycles.","SAGE","","Argonne National Lab.

Planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) can be used for non-intrusive, in situ measurement of swirl-plane velocity fields through a transparent piston. In order to keep the flow unchanged from all-metal engine operation, the geometry of the transparent piston must adapt the production-intent metal piston geometry. As a result, a temporally- and spatially-variant optical distortion is introduced to the particle images.

"Effect of post injections on mixture preparation and unburned hydrocarbon emissions in a heavy-duty diesel engine","O'Connor, Jacqueline; Musculus, Mark P. B.; Pickett, Lyle M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; low-temperature combustion; unburned hydrocarbon emissions; post injections; heavy-duty diesel","This work explores the mechanisms by which a post injection can reduce unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions in heavy-duty diesel engines operating at low-temperature combustion conditions. Post injections, small, close-coupled injections of fuel after the main injection, have been shown to reduce UHC in the authors’ previous work. In this work, we analyze optical data from laser-induced fluorescence of both CH<sub>2</sub>O and OH and use chemical reactor modeling to better understand the mechanism by which post injections reduce UHC emissions. The results indicate that post-injection efficacy, or the extent to which a post injection reduces UHC emissions, is a strong function of the cylinder pressure variation during the post injection. However, the data and analysis indicate that the pressure and temperature rise from the post injection combustion cannot solely explain the UHC reduction measured by both engine-out and optical diagnostics. In conclusion, the fluid-mechanic, thermal, and chemical interaction of the post injection with the main-injection mixture is a key part of UHC reduction; the starting action of the post jet and the subsequent entrainment of surrounding gases are likely both important processes in reducing UHC with a post injection.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"The role of spray-enhanced swirl flow for combustion stabilization in a stratified-charge DISI engine","Zeng, Wei; Sjöberg, Magnus; Reuss, David L.; Hu, Zongjie","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Spray-guided stratified-charge DISI engine; Combustion stabilization; Swirl flow and swirl-spray interaction; Flame propagation; High-speed PIV; Flame natural luminosity imaging","Implementing spray-guided stratified-charge direct-injection spark-ignited (DISI) engines is inhibited by the occurrence of misfire and partial burns. Engine-performance tests demonstrate that increasing engine speed induces combustion instability, but this deterioration can be prevented by generating swirling flow during the intake stroke. In-cylinder pressure-based heat-release analysis reveals that the appearance of poor-burn cycles is not solely dependent on the variability of early flame-kernel growth. Moreover, cycles can experience burning-rate regression during later combustion stages and may or may not recover before the end of the cycle. Thermodynamic analysis and optical diagnostics are used here to clarify why swirl improves the combustion repeatability from cycle to cycle. The fluid dynamics of swirl/spray interaction was previously demonstrated using high-speed PIV measurements of in-cylinder motored flow. It was found that the sprays of the multi-hole injector redistribute the intake-generated swirl flow momentum, thereby creating a better-centered higher angular-momentum vortex with reduced variability. The engine operation with high swirl was found to have significant improvement in cycle-to-cycle variations of both flow pattern and flow momentum. This paper is an extension of the previous work. Here, PIV measurements and flame imaging are applied to fired operation for studying how the swirl flow affects variability of ignition and subsequent combustion phases. PIV results for fired operation are consistent with the measurements made of motored flow. They demonstrate that the spark-plasma motion is highly correlated with the direction of the gas flow in the vicinity of the spark-plug gap. Without swirl, the plasma is randomly stretched towards either side of the spark plug, causing variability in the ignition of the two spray plumes that are straddling the spark plug. Conversely, swirl flow always convects the spark plasma towards one spray plume, causing a more repeatable ignition. The swirl decreases local RMS velocity, consistent with an observed reduction of early-burn variability. Broadband flame imaging demonstrates that with swirl, the flame consistently propagates in multiple directions to consume fuel–air mixtures within the piston bowl. In contrast, operation without swirl displays higher variability of flame-spread patterns, occasionally causing the appearance of partial-burn cycles.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

The Government of India has set a goal of deploying 6-7 million hybrid and PEVs on Indian roads by the year 2020. The uptake of PEVs will depend on, among other factors like high cost, how effectively range anxiety is mitigated through the deployment of adequate electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) throughout a region. The Indian Government therefore views EVCS deployment as a central part of their electric mobility mission. The plug-in electric vehicle infrastructure (PEVI) model - an agent-based simulation modeling platform - was used to explore the cost-effective siting of EVCS throughout the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, India. At 1% penetration in the passenger car fleet, or ~10 000 battery electric vehicles (BEVs), charging services can be provided to drivers for an investment of $4.4 M (or $ 440/BEV) by siting 2764 chargers throughout the NCT of Delhi with an emphasis on the more densely populated and frequented regions of the city. The majority of chargers sited by this analysis were low power, Level 1 chargers, which have the added benefit of being simpler to deploy than higher power alternatives. The amount of public infrastructure needed depends on the access that drivers have to EVCS at home, with 83% more charging capacity required to provide the same level of service to a population of drivers without home chargers compared to a scenario with home chargers. Results also depend on the battery capacity of the BEVs adopted, with approximately 60% more charging capacity needed to achieve the same level of service when vehicles are assumed to have 57 km versus 96 km of range.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

An innovative model formulation is developed to represent heterogeneous consumer groups with varying preferences for vehicle novelty, range, refueling/recharging availability, and variety. The formulation is then implemented in the transport module of MESSAGE-Transport, a global IAM, although it also has the generic flexibility to be applied in energy-economy models with varying set-ups. Comparison of conventional and behaviorally-realistic model runs with respect to vehicle purchase decisions shows that consumer preferences may slow down the transition to alternative fuel (low-carbon) vehicles. Consequently, stronger price-based incentives and/or non-price based measures may be needed to transform the global fleet of passenger vehicles, at least in the initial market phases of novel alternatives. Otherwise, the mitigation burden borne by other transport sub-sectors and other energy sectors could be higher than previously estimated. Moreover, capturing behavioral features of energy consumers in global IAMs increases their usefulness to policy makers by allowing a more realistic assessment of a more diverse suite of policies.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Homogeneous Relaxation Model has been adopted in many recent numerical studies for predicting cavitation and flash boiling. The Homogeneous Relaxation Model is assessed in this study. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters has been documented to infer the driving factors for the flash-boiling predictions. The model parameters have been varied over a range and the differences in predictions of the extent of flashing have been studied. Apart from flashing in the near nozzle regions, mild cavitation is also predicted inside the gasoline injectors. The variation in the predicted time scales through the model parameters for predicting these two different thermodynamic phenomena (cavitation, flash) have been elaborated in this study. Turbulence model effects have also been investigated by comparing predictions from the standard and Re-Normalization Group (RNG) k-ε turbulence models.","Begell House","","Argonne National Lab.

"Analysis of the Effects of Connected–Automated Vehicle Technologies on Travel Demand","Auld, Joshua; Sokolov, Vadim; Stephens, Thomas S.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Connected–automated vehicle (CAV) technologies are likely to have significant effects not only on how vehicles operate in the transportation system, but also on how individuals behave and use their vehicles. While many CAV technologies—such as connected adaptive cruise control and ecosignals—have the potential to increase network throughput and efficiency, many of these same technologies have a secondary effect of reducing driver burden, which can drive changes in travel behavior. Such changes in travel behavior—in effect, lowering the cost of driving—have the potential to increase greatly the utilization of the transportation system with concurrent negative externalities, such as congestion, energy use, and emissions, working against the positive effects on the transportation system resulting from increased capacity. To date, few studies have analyzed the potential effects on CAV technologies from a systems perspective; studies often focus on gains and losses to an individual vehicle, at a single intersection, or along a corridor. However, travel demand and traffic flow constitute a complex, adaptive, nonlinear system. Therefore, in this study, an advanced transportation systems simulation model—POLARIS—was used. POLARIS includes cosimulation of travel behavior and traffic flow to study the potential effects of several CAV technologies at the regional level. Various technology penetration levels and changes in travel time sensitivity have been analyzed to determine a potential range of effects on vehicle miles traveled from various CAV technologies.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Argonne National Lab.

In the present work, an oil-miscible phosphorous-containing ionic liquid (IL), trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate ([P<sub>66614</sub>][DEHP]), is evaluated for its impact on three-way catalysts (TWC) and benchmarked against the industry standard zinc-dialkyl-dithio-phosphate (ZDDP). The TWCs are aged in different scenarios: neat gasoline (no-additive, or NA), gasoline+ZDDP, and gasoline+IL. The aged samples, along with the as received TWC, are characterized through various analytical techniques including catalyst reactivity evaluation in a bench-flow reactor. The temperatures of 50% conversion (T50) for the ZDDP-aged TWCs increased by 30, 24, and 25 °C for NO, CO, and C3H6, respectively, compared to the no-additive case. Although the IL-aged TWC also increased in T50 for CO and C3H6, it was notably less than ZDDP, 7 and 9 °C, respectively. Additionally, the IL-aged samples had higher water-gas-shift reactivity and oxygen storage capacity than the ZDDP-aged TWC. Characterization of the aged samples indicated the predominant presence of CePO<sub>4</sub> in the ZDDP-aged TWC aged by ZDDP, while its formation was retarded in the case of IL where higher levels of AlPO<sub>4</sub> is observed. Furthermore, the results in this work indicate that the phosphonium-phosphate IL potentially has less adverse impact on TWC than ZDDP.","MDPI","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One effective solution to reducing emissions of mono-nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) is exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), which has been widely implemented in modern vehicles. However, cylinder-to-cylinder and cycle-to-cycle variations in the charge-gas uniformity can be a major barrier to optimum EGR implementation on multi-cylinder engines, and can limit performance, stability, and efficiency. Precise knowledge and fine control over the EGR system is thus crucial, particularly for optimizing advanced engine concepts such as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI). An absorption-based laser diagnostic was developed to study spatiotemporal charge-gas distributions in an IC engine intake manifold in real-time. The laser was tuned to an absorption band of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a standard exhaust-gas marker, near 2.7 µm. The sensor was capable of probing four separate measurement locations simultaneously, and independently analyzing EGR fraction at speeds of 5 kHz (1.2 crank-angle degree (CAD) at 1 k RPM) or faster with high accuracy. Lastly, the probes were used to study spatiotemporal EGR non-uniformities in the intake manifold and ultimately promote the development of more efficient and higher performance engines.","Society for Applied Spectroscopy","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Volatility characterization of nanoparticles from single and dual-fuel low temperature combustion in compression ignition engines","Lucachick, Glenn; Curran, Scott; Storey, John Morse; Prikhodko, Vitaly Y.; Northrop, William F.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Our work explores the volatility of particles produced from two diesel low temperature combustion (LTC) modes proposed for high-efficiency compression ignition engines. It also explores mechanisms of particulate formation and growth upon dilution in the near-tailpipe environment. Moreover, the number distribution of exhaust particles from low- and mid-load dual-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and single-fuel premixed charge compression ignition (PPCI) modes were experimentally studied over a gradient of dilution temperature. Particle volatility of select particle diameters was investigated using volatility tandem differential mobility analysis (V-TDMA). Evaporation rates for exhaust particles were compared with V-TDMA results for candidate pure n-alkanes to identify species with similar volatility characteristics. The results show that LTC particles are mostly comprised of material with volatility similar to engine oil alkanes. V-TDMA results were used as inputs to an aerosol condensation and evaporation model to support the finding that smaller particles in the distribution are comprised of lower volatility material than large particles under primary dilution conditions. Although the results show that saturation levels are high enough to drive condensation of alkanes onto existing particles under the dilution conditions investigated, they are not high We conclude that observed particles from LTC operation must grow from low concentrations of highly non-volatile compounds present in the exhaust.","American Association for Aerosol Research","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Size-resolved mass and number concentrations were obtained from several engine operating conditions. The resultant mass-mobility relationships showed weak dependence on the operating condition. An integrated particle size distribution (IPSD) method was used estimate the PM mass concentration in the exhaust stream from the SIDI engine and a heavy duty diesel (HDD) engine. The average estimated mass concentration between all conditions was ~77****** % of the gravimetric measurements performed on Teflon filters. Despite the relatively low elemental carbon fraction (~0.4 to 0.7), the IPSD mass for stoichiometric SIDI exhaust was ~83±38 % of the gravimetric measurement. Identical cordierite filter samples with properties representative of diesel particulate filters were sequentially loaded with PM from the different SIDI engine operating conditions, in order of increasing PM mass concentration. Simultaneous particle size distribution measurements upstream and downstream of the filter sample were used to evaluate filter performance evolution and the instantaneous trapped mass within the filter for two different filter face velocities. The evolution of filtration performance for the different samples was sensitive only to trapped mass, despite using PM from a wide range of operating conditions. Higher filtration velocity resulted in a more rapid shift in the most penetrating particle size towards smaller mobility diameters.","SAGE","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Study of soot production for double injections of n-dodecane in CI engine-like conditions","Moiz, Ahmed Abdul; Ameen, Muhsin M.; Lee, Seong-Young (ORCID:000000025970370X); Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Soot production mechanism in multiple injections is complex since it involves its dependence on turbulent interactions of constituting injections and their combustion progress. A concise study was performed in a constant-volume combustion vessel by considering a double injection scheme of 0.3 ms pilot injection, 0.5 ms dwell time and 1.2 ms main injection (nomenclature: 0.3/0.5/12 ms) with n-dodecane as fuel and replicating the thermodynamic operating condition of a compression ignition (CI) engine. Experimental ambient temperature variations of 900 K and 800 K were performed at 15% ambient oxygen level. Simultaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence (PUP) of formaldehyde and schlieren imaging techniques were employed to analyze the ignition and flame characteristics experimentally. These studies revealed almost similar heat release rates for a double injection at 900 K and 800 K ambient gas temperatures due to combustion of a longer main injection which is enhanced by pilot combustion event A lower soot production for 800 K ambient condition over 900 K case was observed, which was concluded to be due to its higher lift-off length which would allow for a leaner combustion of fuel-air mixtures. Numerical simulations were performed using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach by extensively validating the 900 K double injection condition with respect to non-reacting vapor penetration profiles of both injections, reacting jet heat release rate and spatial as well as temporal (qualitative) soot production. As part of LES work, a dwell time variation of 0.65 ms (0.3/0.65/1.2 ms) was performed to reveal the sensitivity of soot production to variations in dwell time. It was observed numerically that marginally higher quasi steady lift-off length of the 0.3/0.65/1.2 ms injection causes increased entrainment of surrounding oxygen into the flame region. This leads to combustion of slightly leaner fuel-air mixture and hence relatively less soot when compared to a 0.3/0.5/1.2 ms injection. (C) 2016 The Combustion Institute.

"Evaluation of Knock Behavior for Natural Gas - Gasoline Blends in a Light Duty Spark Ignited Engine","Pamminger, Michael; Sevik, James; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Wallner, Thomas; Wooldridge, Steven; Boyer, Brad; Hall, Carrie M.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","The compression ratio is a strong lever to increase the efficiency of an internal combustion engine. However, among others, it is limited by the knock resistance of the fuel used. Natural gas shows a higher knock resistance compared to gasoline, which makes it very attractive for use in internal combustion engines. The current paper describes the knock behavior of two gasoline fuels, and specific incylinder blend ratios with one of the gasoline fuels and natural gas. The engine used for these investigations is a single cylinder research engine for light duty application which is equipped with two separate fuel systems. Both fuels can be used simultaneously which allows for gasoline to be injected into the intake port and natural gas to be injected directly into the cylinder to overcome the power density loss usually connected with port fuel injection of natural gas. Adding natural gas at wide open throttle helps to reduce knock mitigating measures and increases the efficiency and power density compared to the other gasoline type fuels with lower knock resistance. The used methods, knock intensity and number of pressure waves, do not show significant differences in knock behavior for the natural gas - gasoline blends compared to the gasoline type fuels. A knock integral was used to describe the knock onset location of the fuels tested. Two different approaches were used to determine the experimental knock onset and were compared to the knock onset delivered by the knock integral (chemical knock onset). The gasoline type fuels show good agreement between chemical and experimental knock onset. However, the natural gas -gasoline blends show higher discrepancies comparing chemical and experimental knock onset.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

The analysis identified historical timeframes, trends, and illustrated how three factors: consumer preferences, technical capabilities, and regulatory legislation, affect personal mobility. Data showed that throughout history these three factors have a complex and time sensitive interplay. Long term trends in the data were identified where interaction and evolution between all three factors was observed. Transportation efficiency per unit power (gal/ton-mi/hp) was found to be a good metric to integrate technical, societal, and regulatory effects into the evolutional pathway of personal mobility.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning–based real-time EMS for PHEVs to address the trade-off between real-time performance and optimal energy savings. The proposed model can optimize the power-split control in real time while learning the optimal decisions from historical driving cycles. Here, a case study on a real-world commute trip shows that about a 12% fuel saving can be achieved without considering charging opportunities; further, an 8% fuel saving can be achieved when charging opportunities are considered, compared with the standard binary mode control strategy.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the DNS, a pseudo turbulent mixing layer of dimethyl ether (DME) at 400 K and air at 900 K is simulated at a pressure of 40 atmospheres. At these conditions, DME exhibits a two-stage ignition and resides within the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime of ignition delay times, similar to diesel fuel. The analysis reveals a complex ignition process with several novel features. Autoignition occurs as a distributed, two-stage event. The high-temperature stage of ignition establishes edge flames that have a hybrid premixed/autoignition flame structure similar to that previously observed for lifted laminar flames at similar thermochemical conditions. In conclusion, a combustion mode analysis based on key radical species illustrates the multi-stage and multi-mode nature of the ignition process and highlights the substantial modelling challenge presented by diesel combustion.","Elsevier","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"Ammonia Generation and Utilization in a Passive SCR (TWC+SCR) System on Lean Gasoline Engine","Prikhodko, Vitaly Y.; James E. Parks, II; Pihl, Josh A.; Toops, Todd J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Lean gasoline engines offer greater fuel economy than the common stoichiometric gasoline engine, but the current three way catalyst (TWC) on stoichiometric engines is unable to control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in oxidizing exhaust. For these lean gasoline engines, lean NOX emission control is required to meet existing Tier 2 and upcoming Tier 3 emission regulations set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). While urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) has proven effective in controlling NOX from diesel engines, the urea storage and delivery components can add significant size and cost. As such, onboard NH<sub>3</sub> production via a passive SCR approach is of interest. In a passive SCR system, NH<sub>3</sub> is generated over a close-coupled TWC during periodic slightly rich engine operation and subsequently stored on an underfloor SCR catalyst. Upon switching to lean operation, NOX passes through the TWC and is reduced by the stored NH<sub>3</sub> on the SCR catalyst. In this work, a passive SCR system was evaluated on a 2.0-liter BMW lean burn gasoline direct injection engine to assess NH<sub>3</sub> generation over a Pd-only TWC and utilization over a Cu-based SCR catalyst. System NOX reduction efficiency and fuel efficiency improvement compared to stoichiometric engine operation were measured. A feedback control strategy based on cumulative NH<sub>3</sub> produced by the TWC during rich operation and NOX emissions during lean operation was implemented on the engine to control lean/rich cycle timing. At an SCR average inlet temperature of 350 °C, an NH<sub>3</sub>:NOX ratio of 1.15:1 (achieved through longer rich cycle timing) resulted in 99.7 % NOX conversion. Increasing NH<sub>3</sub> generation further resulted in even higher NOX conversion; however, tailpipe NH<sub>3</sub> emissions resulted. At higher underfloor temperatures, NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation over the SCR limited NH<sub>3</sub> availability for NOX reduction. At the engine conditions studied, greater than 99 % NOX conversion was achieved with passive SCR while delivering fuel efficiency benefits ranging between 6-11 % compared with stoichiometric operation.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The liquid spray was treated with a traditional Lagrangian method and the gas-phase reaction was modeled using a δ function combustion model. A 103-species skeletal mechanism was used for the n-dodecane chemical kinetic model. Significantly different flame structures and ignition processes are observed for the LES compared to those of Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) predictions. The LES data suggests that the first ignition initiates in a lean mixture and propagates to a rich mixture, and the main ignition happens in the rich mixture, preferably less than 0.14 in mixture fraction space. LES was observed to have multiple ignition spots in the mixing layer simultaneously while the main ignition initiates in a clearly asymmetric fashion. The temporal flame development also indicates the flame stabilization mechanism is auto-ignition controlled. Soot predictions by LES present much better agreement with experiments compared to RANS, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Multiple realizations for LES were performed to understand the realization to realization variation and to establish best practices for ensemble-averaging diesel spray flames. The relevance index analysis suggests that an average of 5 and 6 realizations can reach 99% of similarity to the target average of 16 realizations on the mixture fraction and temperature fields, respectively. In conclusion, more realizations are necessary for the hydroxide (OH) and soot mass fractions due to their high fluctuations.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

The high price of Pt creates a major cost barrier for large-scale implementation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) represent attractive low-cost alternatives. However, a significantly lower turnover frequency at the individual catalytic site renders the traditional carbon-supported NPMCs inadequate in reaching the desired performance afforded by Pt. Unconventional catalyst design aiming at maximizing the active site density at much improved mass and charge transports is essential for the next-generation NPMC. We report here a method of preparing highly efficient, nanofibrous NPMC for cathodic oxygen reduction reaction by electrospinning a polymer solution containing ferrous organometallics and zeolitic imidazolate framework followed by thermal activation. The catalyst offers a carbon nanonetwork architecture made of microporous nanofibers decorated by uniformly distributed high-density active sites. In a single-cell test, the membrane electrode containing such a catalyst delivered unprecedented volumetric activities of 3.3 A∙cm<sup>-3</sup> at 0.9 V or 450 A∙cm<sup>-3</sup> extrapolated at 0.8 V, representing the highest reported value in the literature.

But, insufficient mixing between fresh air and exhaust gas can lead to cycle-to-cycle and cylinder-to-cylinder nonuniform charge gas mixtures of a multi-cylinder engine, which can in turn reduce engine performance and efficiency. Furthermore, a sensor packaged into a compact probe was designed, built and applied to measure spatiotemporal EGR distributions in the intake manifold of an operating engine. The probe promotes the development of more efficient and higher-performance engines by resolving high-speed in situ CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at various locations in the intake manifold.

"Extending Lean and Exhaust Gas Recirculation-Dilute Operating Limits of a Modern Gasoline Direct-Injection Engine Using a Low-Energy Transient Plasma Ignition System","Sevik, James; Wallner, Thomas; Pamminger, Michael; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Singleton, Dan; Sanders, Jason","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Combustion; Engines; Experimental; Fuels and combustion; Internal Combustion Engines; Thermodynamics","The efficiency improvement and emissions reduction potential of lean and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)-dilute operation of spark-ignition gasoline engines is well understood and documented. However, dilute operation is generally limited by deteriorating combustion stability with increasing inert gas levels. The combustion stability decreases due to reduced mixture flame speeds resulting in significantly increased combustion initiation periods and burn durations. A study was designed and executed to evaluate the potential to extend lean and EGR-dilute limits using a low-energy transient plasma ignition system. The low-energy transient plasma was generated by nanosecond pulses and its performance compared to a conventional transistorized coil ignition (TCI) system operated on an automotive, gasoline direct-injection (GDI) single-cylinder research engine. The experimental assessment was focused on steady-state experiments at the part load condition of 1500 rpm 5.6 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), where dilution tolerance is particularly critical to improving efficiency and emission performance. Experimental results suggest that the energy delivery process of the low-energy transient plasma ignition system significantly improves part load dilution tolerance by reducing the early flame development period. Statistical analysis of relevant combustion metrics was performed in order to further investigate the effects of the advanced ignition system on combustion stability. Results confirm that at select operating conditions EGR tolerance and lean limit could be improved by as much as 20% (from 22.7 to 27.1% EGR) and nearly 10% (from λ = 1.55 to 1.7) with the low-energy transient plasma ignition system.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

"History v. Simulation: An Analysis of the Drivers of Alternative Energy Vehicle Sales","Levinson, Rebecca Sobel; Manley, Dawn K.; West, Todd H.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Simulations of the US light duty vehicle stock help policy makers, investors, and auto manufacturers make informed decisions to influence the future of the stock and its associated green house gas emissions. Such simulations require an underlying framework that captures the key elements of consumer purchasing decisions, which can be uncertain. This uncertainty in a simulation’s logic is usually convolved with uncertainty in the underlying assumptions about the futures of energy prices and technology innovation and availability. By comparing simulated alternative energy vehicle (AEV) sales to historical sales data, one can assess the simulation’s ability to capture the dynamics of consumer choice, independent of many of those underlying uncertainties, thereby determining the factors that most strongly impact sales. The market for diesel vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and to a lesser extent plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles, has now matured sufficiently to make such a study possible. In this work, we measure the results of the Sandia ParaChoice model under a variety of input assumptions against historical sales data. Here, we observe that (1) the underlying simulation logic is sound, capturing key drivers of consumer choice, (2) AEV model availability has a significant impact on sales, and (3) AEV consumers are very likely aware of purchasing incentives and factoring those incentives into their purchasing decisions.","SAE International","","Sandia National Lab.

However, the magnitude of vehicle use phase fuel savings potential is comparatively several orders of magnitude higher than the marginal increase in cradle-to-gate energy.

These data include 1-Hz global positioning system location and SAE J1939 high-speed controller area network information. Researchers processed the data through NREL's Drive-Cycle Rapid Investigation, Visualization, and Evaluation tool to examine vehicle kinematic and dynamic patterns across the spectrum of operations. Using the k-medoids clustering method, a repeatable and quantitative process for multi-mode drive cycle segmentation, the analysis led to the creation of multiple drive cycles representing four distinct modes of operation that can be used independently or in combination. These drive cycles are statistically representative of real-world operation of port drayage vehicles. When combined with modeling and simulation tools, these representative test cycles allow advanced vehicle or systems developers to efficiently and accurately evaluate vehicle technology performance requirements to reduce cost and development time while ultimately leading to the commercialization of advanced technologies that meet the performance requirements of the port drayage vocation. The drive cycles, which are suitable for chassis dynamometer testing, were compared to several existing test cycles.

"Socially optimal electric driving range of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","Kontou, Eleftheria; Yin, Yafeng; Lin, Zhenhong","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV); optimal all-electric driving range; minimum","Our study determines the optimal electric driving range of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that minimizes the daily cost borne by the society when using this technology. An optimization framework is developed and applied to datasets representing the US market. Results indicate that the optimal range is 16 miles with an average social cost of 3.19 per day when exclusively charging at home, compared to 3.27 per day of driving a conventional vehicle. The optimal range is found to be sensitive to the cost of battery packs and the price of gasoline. Moreover, when workplace charging is available, the optimal electric driving range surprisingly increases from 16 to 22 miles, as larger batteries would allow drivers to better take advantage of the charging opportunities to achieve longer electrified travel distances, yielding social cost savings. If workplace charging is available, the optimal density is to deploy a workplace charger for every 3.66 vehicles. Finally, the diversification of the battery size, i.e., introducing a pair and triple of electric driving ranges to the market, could further decrease the average societal cost per PHEV by 7.45% and 11.5% respectively.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Understanding fuel anti-knock performances in modern SI engines using fundamental HCCI experiments","Yang, Yi; Dec, John E.; Sjoberg, Magnus; Ji, Chunsheng","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; knock propensity; HCCI; turbocharging; DISI; ethanol","Modern spark-ignition (SI) engine technologies have considerably changed in-cylinder conditions under which fuel autoignition and engine knock take place. In this paper, fundamental HCCI engine experiments are proposed as a means for characterizing the impact of these technologies on the knock propensity of different fuels. In particular, the impacts of turbocharging, direct injection (DI), and downspeeding on operation with ethanol and gasoline are investigated to demonstrate this approach. Results reported earlier for ethanol and gasoline on HCCI combustion are revisited with the new perspective of how their autoignition characteristics fit into the anti-knock requirement in modern SI engines. For example, the weak sensitivity to pressure boost demonstrated by ethanol in HCCI autoignition can be used to explain the strong knock resistance of ethanol fuels for turbocharged SI engines. Further, ethanol's high sensitivity to charge temperature makes charge cooling, which can be produced by fuel vaporization via direct injection or by piston expansion via spark-timing retard, very effective for inhibiting knock. On the other hand, gasoline autoignition shows a higher sensitivity to pressure, so only very low pressure boost can be applied before knock occurs. Gasoline also demonstrates low temperature sensitivity, so it is unable to make as effective use of the charge cooling produced by fuel vaporization or spark retard. These arguments comprehensively explain literature results on ethanol's substantially better anti-knock performance over gasoline in modern turbocharged DISI engines. Fundamental HCCI experiments such as these can thus be used as a diagnostic and predictive tool for knock-limited SI engine performance for various fuels. As a result, examples are presented where HCCI experiments are used to identify biofuel compounds with good potential for modern SI-engine applications.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Use of Adaptive Injection Strategies to Increase the Full Load Limit of RCCI Operation","Hanson, Reed; Ickes, Andrew; Wallner, Thomas","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Dual-fuel combustion using port-injection of low reactivity fuel combined with direct injection (DI) of a higher reactivity fuel, otherwise known as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), has been shown as a method to achieve low-temperature combustion with moderate peak pressure rise rates, low engine-out soot and NOx emissions, and high indicated thermal efficiency. A key requirement for extending to high-load operation is moderating the reactivity of the premixed charge prior to the diesel injection. One way to accomplish this is to use a very low reactivity fuel such as natural gas. In this work, experimental testing was conducted on a 13 l multicylinder heavy-duty diesel engine modified to operate using RCCI combustion with port injection of natural gas and DI of diesel fuel. Engine testing was conducted at an engine speed of 1200 rpm over a wide variety of loads and injection conditions. The impact on dual-fuel engine performance and emissions with respect to varying the fuel injection parameters is quantified within this study. The injection strategies used in the work were found to affect the combustion process in similar ways to both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and RCCI combustion for phasing control and emissions performance. As the load is increased, the port fuel injection (PFI) quantity was reduced to keep peak cylinder pressure (PCP) and maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR) under the imposed limits. Overall, the peak load using the new injection strategy was shown to reach 22 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) with a peak brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 47.6%.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

"Application of High Performance Computing for Simulating Cycle-to-Cycle Variation in Dual-Fuel Combustion Engines","Jupudi, Ravichandra S.; Finney, Charles E.A.; Primus, Roy; Wijeyakulasuriya, Sameera; Klingbeil, Adam E.; Tamma, Bhaskar; Stoyanov, Miroslav K.","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Dual fuel engines","Interest in operational cost reduction is driving engine manufacturers to consider lower-cost fuel substitution in heavy-duty diesel engines. These dual-fuel (DF) engines could be operated either in diesel-only mode or operated with premixed natural gas (NG) ignited by a pilot flame of compression-ignited direct-injected diesel fuel. One promising application is that of large-bore, medium-speed engines such as those used in locomotives. With realistic natural gas substitution levels in the fleet of locomotives currently in service, such fuel substitution could result in billions of dollars of savings annually in the US alone. However, under certain conditions, dual-fuel operation can result in increased cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) during combustion, resulting in variations in cylinder pressure and work extraction. In certain situations, the CCV of dual-fuel operation can be notably higher than that of diesel-only combustion under similar operating conditions. Excessive CCV can limit the NG substitution rate and operating range of a dual-fuel engine by increasing emissions and reducing engine stability, reliability and fuel efficiency via incomplete natural-gas combustion. Running multiple engine cycles in series to simulate CCV can be quite time consuming. Hence innovative modelling techniques and large computing resources are needed to investigate the factors affecting CCV in dual-fuel engines. This paper discusses the use of the High Performance Computing resource Titan, at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to investigate cycle-to-cycle combustion variability of a dual-fuel engine. The CONVERGE CFD software was used to simulate multiple, parallel single cycles of dual-fuel combustion with perturbed operating parameters and boundary conditions. These perturbations are imposed according to a sparse grids sampling of the parameter space. The sampling scheme chosen is similar to a design of experiments method but uses functions designed to minimize the number of samples required to achieve a desired degree of accuracy. The perturbed input parameters were connected to engine performance output over a large parameter space. Additionally, the same methodology was used to perform a set of diesel-only simulations at similar operating conditions to assess the numerical capability of capturing relatively low combustion variation. Lastly, this technique is expected to be useful to understand and predict combustion stability limits (knock and misfire) which are important for designing dual-fuel engines with improved operability and reliability.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

"Influence of Injector Location on Part-Load Performance Characteristics of Natural Gas Direct-Injection in a Spark Ignition Engine","Sevik, James; Pamminger, Michael; Wallner, Thomas; Scarcelli, Riccardo; Boyer, Brad; Wooldridge, Steven; Hall, Carrie; Miers, Scott","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Interest in natural gas as an alternative fuel source to petroleum fuels for light-duty vehicle applications has increased due to its domestic availability and stable price compared to gasoline. With its higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, natural gas has the potential to reduce engine out carbon dioxide emissions, which has shown to be a strong greenhouse gas contributor. For part-load conditions, the lower flame speeds of natural gas can lead to an increased duration in the inflammation process with traditional port-injection. Direct-injection of natural gas can increase in-cylinder turbulence and has the potential to reduce problems typically associated with port-injection of natural gas, such as lower flame speeds and poor dilution tolerance. A study was designed and executed to investigate the effects of direct-injection of natural gas at part-load conditions. Steady-state tests were performed on a single-cylinder research engine representative of current gasoline direct-injection engines. Tests were performed with direct-injection in the central and side location. The start of injection was varied under stoichiometric conditions in order to study the effects on the mixture formation process. In addition, exhaust gas recirculation was introduced at select conditions in order to investigate the dilution tolerance. Relevant combustion metrics were then analyzed for each scenario. Experimental results suggest that regardless of the injector location, varying the start of injection has a strong impact on the mixture formation process. Delaying the start of injection from 300 to 120°CA BTDC can reduce the early flame development process by nearly 15°CA. While injecting into the cylinder after the intake valves have closed has shown to produce the fastest combustion process, this does not necessarily lead to the highest efficiency, due to increases in pumping and wall heat losses. When comparing the two injection configurations, the side location shows the best performance in terms of combustion metrics and efficiencies. For both systems, part-load dilution tolerance is affected by the injection timing, due to the induced turbulence from the gaseous injection event. CFD simulation results have shown that there is a fundamental difference in how the two injection locations affect the mixture formation process. Delayed injection timing increases the turbulence level in the cylinder at the time of the spark, but reduces the available time for proper mixing. Side injection delivers a gaseous jet that interacts more effectively with the intake induced flow field, and this improves the engine performance in terms of efficiency.","SAE International","","Argonne National Lab.

Pure biodiesel contains up to 5 ppm Na + K and 5 ppm Ca + Mg metals, which have the potential to degrade diesel emissions control systems. This study aims to address these concerns, identify deactivation mechanisms, and determine if a lower limit is needed. Accelerated aging of a production exhaust system was conducted on an engine test stand over 1,001 hr using B20 doped with 14 ppm Na. During the study, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions exceeded the engine certification limit of 0.33 g/bhp-hr before the 435,000-mile requirement. Replacing aged diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), diesel particulate filter (DPF), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices with new degreened parts showed that each device contributed equally to the NOx increase. Following this systems-based evaluation, a detailed investigation of the individual components was completed. Na was determined to have minimal impact on DOC activity. For this system, it is estimated that B20-Na resulted in 50% more ash into the DPF. However, the Na did not diffuse into the cordierite DPF nor degrade its mechanical properties. The SCR degradation was found to be caused by a small amount of precious group metals contamination that increased ammonia oxidation, and lowered NOx reduction. Therefore, it was determined that the primary effect of Na in this study is through increased ash in the DPF rather than deactivation of the catalytic activity.","SAE International","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Leaner Lifted-Flame Combustion Enabled by the Use of an Oxygenated Fuel in an Optical CI Engine","Gehmlich, Ryan K.; Dumitrescu, Cosmin E.; Wang, Yefu; Mueller, Charles J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Leaner lifted-flame combustion (LLFC) is a mixing-controlled combustion strategy for compression-ignition engines that does not produce soot because the equivalence ratio at the lift-off length, Φ(H), is less than or equal to approximately two. In addition to preventing soot formation, LLFC can simultaneously control emissions of nitrogen oxides because it is tolerant to the use of exhaust-gas recirculation for lowering in-cylinder temperatures. LLFC can be achieved through the use of oxygenated fuels and enhanced fuel/charge-gas mixing upstream of the lift-off length. Enhanced mixing can be obtained via higher injection pressures, smaller injector orifice diameters, lower intake-manifold and coolant temperatures, and/or more retarded injection timings. This study focuses on the effects of an oxygenated fuel blend (T50) made up of 50% by volume tri-propylene glycol mono-methyl ether with a #2 ULSD emissions-certification fuel (CFA), compared against baseline testing of the CFA fuel without the oxygenate. Experimental measurements include crank-angle resolved natural luminosity (NL) and chemiluminescence (CL) imaging diagnostics. EGR is simulated by adding nitrogen and carbon dioxide to the intake charge to produce a 16% intake-oxygen mole fraction (XO2), and results are compared against cases with no charge dilution (i.e., 21% XO2). Initial experiments with a two-hole tip achieved soot-free LLFC at low loads with the T50 fuel, 240 MPa injection pressure, 50 °C intake-manifold temperature (IMT), 95 °C coolant temperature, and -5 crank-angle degree (CAD) after top-dead-center (ATDC) start of combustion (SOC) timing. The strategy was extended to more moderate loads by employing a 6-hole injector tip, where lowering the IMT to 30 °C, reducing the coolant temperature to 85 °C, and retarding the SOC timing to +5 CAD ATDC resulted in sustained LLFC at both 21% and 16% XO2 at up to 6.2 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure (gIMEP) with T50. The achievement of LLFC was confirmed by independent soot measurements using a smoke meter, spatially integrated natural luminosity from the NL diagnostics, and laser-induced incandescence for measuring soot volume fraction in the exhaust stream. In contrast to the results with T50, LLFC was not achieved under any of the test conditions with CFA. Combustion was stable under LLFC conditions, with a coefficient of variation of gIMEP less than 1.5%. Nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon emissions were also lowered by up to 25% each for LLFC with T50 relative to using the same operating conditions with CFA. Combustion noise was similarly reduced by 4-6 dBA, and ringing intensity by 60-80%, for LLFC with T50.","SAE International","","Sandia National Lab.

The burning mode was evaluated using the same reactor system for flowing BET specific surface area measurements and HR-TEM with fringe analysis to evaluate the nanostructure of the nascent and partially oxidized particulates. The low activation energy measured, specific surface area progression with extent of oxidation, HR-TEM images and difference plots of fringe length and tortuosity paint a consistent picture of higher reactivity for NO<sub>2</sub>, which reacts indiscriminately immediately upon contact with the surface, leading to the Zone I or shrinking core type oxidation. In comparison, O<sub>2</sub> oxidation is shown to have relatively lower reactivity, preferentially attacking highly curved lamella, which are more reactive due to bond strain, and short lamella, which have a higher proportion of more reactive edge sites. Furthermore, this preferential oxidation leads to Zone II type oxidation, where solid phase diffusion of oxygen via pores contributes significantly to slowing the overall oxidation rate, by comparison.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Defined as the proportion of distance traveled in the electric mode, the utility factor (UF) depends mostly on the battery capacity, but also on many other factors, such as travel pattern and recharging pattern. Conventionally, the UFs are calculated based on the daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) by assuming motorists leave home in the morning with a full battery, and no charge occurs before returning home in the evening. Such an assumption, however, ignores the impact of the heterogeneity in both travel and charging behavior, such as going back home more than once in a day, the impact of available charging time, and the price of gasoline. In addition, the conventional UFs are based on the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data, which are one-day travel data of each sample vehicle. A motorist's daily distance variation is ignored. This paper employs the GPS-based longitudinal travel data (covering 3-18 months) collected from 403 vehicles in the Seattle metropolitan area to investigate how such travel and charging behavior affects UFs. To do this, for each vehicle, we organized trips to a series of home and work related tours. The UFs based on the DVMT are found close to those based on home-to-home tours. However, it is seen that the workplace charge opportunities significantly increase UFs if the CD range is no more than 40 miles.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Quantifying EV battery end-of-life through analysis of travel needs with vehicle powertrain models","Saxena, Samveg (ORCID:000000024266410X); Le Floch, Caroline; MacDonald, Jason; Moura, Scott","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","Electric vehicles enable clean and efficient transportation; however, concerns about range anxiety and battery degradation hinder EV adoption. The common definition for battery end-of-life is when 70-80% of original energy capacity remain;, however, little analysis is available to support this retirement threshold. By applying detailed physics-based models of EVs with data on how drivers use their cars, we show that EV batteries continue to meet daily travel needs of drivers well beyond capacity fade of 80% remaining energy storage capacity. Further, we show that EV batteries with substantial energy capacity fade continue to provide sufficient buffer charge for unexpected trips with long distances. We show that enabling charging in more locations, even if only with 120 V wall outlets, prolongs useful life of EV batteries. Battery power fade is also examined and we show EVs meet performance requirements even down to 30% remaining power capacity. Our findings show that defining battery retirement at 70-80% remaining capacity is inaccurate. Battery retirement should instead be governed by when batteries no longer satisfy daily travel needs of a driver. Using this alternative retirement metric, we present results on the fraction of EV batteries that may be retired with different levels of energy capacity fade.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Atomization and dense-fluid breakup regimes in liquid rocket engines","Oefelein, Joseph; Dahms, Rainer Norbert Uwe","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Until recently, modern theory has lacked a fundamentally based model to predict the operating pressures where classical sprays transition to dense-fluid mixing with diminished surface tension. In this paper, such a model is presented to quantify this transition for liquid-oxygen–hydrogen and n-decane–gaseous-oxygen injection processes. The analysis reveals that respective molecular interfaces break down not necessarily because of vanishing surface tension forces but instead because of the combination of broadened interfaces and a reduction in mean free molecular path. When this occurs, the interfacial structure itself enters the continuum regime, where transport processes rather than intermolecular forces dominate. Using this model, regime diagrams for the respective systems are constructed that show the range of operating pressures and temperatures where this transition occurs. The analysis also reveals the conditions where classical spray dynamics persists even at high supercritical pressures. As a result, it demonstrates that, depending on the composition and temperature of the injected fluids, the injection process can exhibit either classical spray atomization, dense-fluid diffusion-dominated mixing, or supercritical mixing phenomena at chamber pressures encountered in state-of-the-art liquid rocket engines.","","","Sandia National Lab.

"Investigation of a tripropylene-glycol monomethyl ether and diesel blend for soot-free combustion in an optical direct-injection diesel engine","Dumitrescu, Cosmin E.; Mueller, Charles J.; Kurtz, Eric","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 42 ENGINEERING; Diesel; Soot-free combustion; Oxygenate; LLFC","Natural luminosity and chemiluminescence imaging diagnostics were employed to investigate if a 50/50 blend by volume of tripropylene-glycol monomethyl ether (TPGME) and ultra-low sulfur #2 diesel certification fuel (CF) could enable leaner-lifted flame combustion (LLFC), a non-sooting mode of mixing-controlled combustion associated with equivalence ratios below approximately 2. The experiments were performed in a singlecylinder heavy-duty optical compression-ignition engine at three injection pressures and three dilution levels. Results indicate that TPGME addition effectively eliminated engine-out smoke emissions by curtailing soot production and/or increasing soot oxidation during and after the end of fuel injection. TPGME greatly reduced soot luminosity when compared with neat CF, but did not enable LLFC because the equivalence ratios at the lift-off length, $\phi$(H), never reached the non-sooting limit. Nevertheless, this study showed that TPGME addition has the potential to enable LLFC under different experimental conditions that would further decrease $\phi$(H) to ~ 2 and below. Concerning other engine-out emissions, injection pressure influenced the effects of TPGME addition on NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Finally, HC and CO emissions were higher compared to baseline fuel likely due to the lower net heat of combustion of TPGME and the need to limit fuel-injection duration for valid optical measurements.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Oxidation characteristics of gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine soot: Catalytic effects of ash and modified kinetic correlation","Choi, Seungmok; Seong, Heeje","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Ash; Gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engine; Reaction kinetics; Soot oxidation reactivity; Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)","In this paper, experimental analyses are conducted into the GDI soot oxidation characteristics as dependent on engine operating conditions. Soot is sampled at various engine operating conditions of a commercial 2.4 L GDI engine with a naturally aspirated, homogeneous, and stoichiometric operation strategy. The oxidation reactivity, ash composition, and carbon nanostructure of the GDI soot samples are analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Based on the analyses, a global GDI soot oxidation mechanism is proposed which includes the effects of soluble organic fractions (SOF)/weakly bonded carbon (WBC), and three types of ash on GDI soot oxidation. The results show that GDI soot contains an order of magnitude higher ash fraction than does conventional diesel soot, and oxidation reactivity is significantly enhanced by the catalytic effects of ash, as a function of ash content in soot. A modified empirical kinetic correlation for GDI soot oxidation is suggested on the basis of the results, and the modified kinetic correlation predicts the GDI soot oxidation rate accurately for various engine operation points at wide ranges of soot conversion and temperature without modifying kinetic parameters. The kinetic parameters are determined from isothermal and non-isothermal thremogravimetric analysis (TGA) soot oxidation tests; the methods are elucidated in detail.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Invited Review: A review of deterministic effects in cyclic variability of internal combustion engines","Finney, Charles E.; Kaul, Brian C.; Daw, C. Stuart; Wagner, Robert M.; Edwards, K. Dean; Green, Johney B.","42 ENGINEERING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; Cyclic variability; dilute combustion; nonlinear dynamics; complex systems","Here we review developments in the understanding of cycle to cycle variability in internal combustion engines, with a focus on spark-ignited and premixed combustion conditions. Much of the research on cyclic variability has focused on stochastic aspects, that is, features that can be modeled as inherently random with no short term predictability. In some cases, models of this type appear to work very well at describing experimental observations, but the lack of predictability limits control options. Also, even when the statistical properties of the stochastic variations are known, it can be very difficult to discern their underlying physical causes and thus mitigate them. Some recent studies have demonstrated that under some conditions, cyclic combustion variations can have a relatively high degree of low dimensional deterministic structure, which implies some degree of predictability and potential for real time control. These deterministic effects are typically more pronounced near critical stability limits (e.g. near tipping points associated with ignition or flame propagation) such during highly dilute fueling or near the onset of homogeneous charge compression ignition. We review recent progress in experimental and analytical characterization of cyclic variability where low dimensional, deterministic effects have been observed. We describe some theories about the sources of these dynamical features and discuss prospects for interactive control and improved engine designs. In conclusion, taken as a whole, the research summarized here implies that the deterministic component of cyclic variability will become a pivotal issue (and potential opportunity) as engine manufacturers strive to meet aggressive emissions and fuel economy regulations in the coming decades.","SAGE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Reaction-space analysis of homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion with varying levels of fuel stratification under positive and negative valve overlap conditions","Kodavasal, Janardhan; Lavoie, George A.; Assanis, Dennis N.; Martz, Jason B.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; CFD; HCCI; NO; NVO; PFI; PVO; direct injection; reactivity stratification; homogeneous charge compression ignition; port fuel injection; negative valve overlap; positive valve overlap; computational fluid dynamics","Full-cycle computational fluid dynamics simulations with gasoline chemical kinetics were performed to determine the impact of breathing and fuel injection strategies on thermal and compositional stratification, combustion and emissions during homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion. The simulations examined positive valve overlap and negative valve overlap strategies, along with fueling by port fuel injection and direct injection. The resulting charge mass distributions were analyzed prior to ignition using ignition delay as a reactivity metric. The reactivity stratification arising from differences in the distributions of fuel–oxygen equivalence ratio (Φ<sub>FO</sub>), oxygen molar fraction (χ<sub>O2</sub>) and temperature (T) was determined for three parametric studies. In the first study, the reactivity stratification and burn duration for positive valve overlap valve events with port fuel injection and early direct injection were nearly identical and were dominated by wall-driven thermal stratification. nitrogen oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were negligible for both injection strategies. In the second study, which examined negative valve overlap valve events with direct injection and port fuel injection, reactivity stratification increased for direct injection as the Φ<sub>FO</sub> and T distributions associated with direct fuel injection into the hot residual gas were positively correlated; however, the latent heat absorbed from the hot residual gas by the evaporating direct injection fuel jet reduced the overall thermal and reactivity stratification. These stratification effects were offsetting, resulting in similar reactivity stratification and burn durations for the two injection strategies. The higher local burned gas temperatures with direct injection resulted in an order of magnitude increase in NO, while incomplete combustion of locally over-lean regions led to a sevenfold increase in CO emissions compared to port fuel injection. The final study evaluated positive valve overlap and negative valve overlap valve events with direct injection. Furthermore, relative to positive valve overlap, the negative valve overlap condition had a wider reactivity stratification, a longer burn duration and higher NO and CO emissions associated with reduced fuel–air mixing.","SAGE","","Argonne National Lab.

Additional analysis is performed to determine the influence of variations in the ratio of specific heat capacities (γ) and the effective expansion ratio, related to the combustion-phasing retard (CA50), on the energy split.

"The contribution of lubricant to the formation of particulate matter with reactivity controlled compression ignition in light-duty diesel engines","Storey, John Morse; Curran, Scott; Dempsey, Adam B.; Lewis, Sr., Samuel Arthur; Reitz, Rolf; Walker, N. Ryan; Wright, Chris","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; reactivity controlled compression ignition; particulate matter; low temperature combustion","Reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) has been shown in single- and multi-cylinder engine research to achieve high thermal efficiencies with ultra-low NO<sub>X</sub> and soot emissions. The nature of the particulate matter (PM) produced by RCCI operation has been shown in recent research to be different than that of conventional diesel combustion and even diesel low-temperature combustion. Previous research has shown that the PM from RCCI operation contains a large amount of organic material that is volatile and semi-volatile. However, it is unclear if the organic compounds are stemming from fuel or lubricant oil. The PM emissions from dual-fuel RCCI were investigated in this study using two engine platforms, with an emphasis on the potential contribution of lubricant. Both engine platforms used the same base General Motors (GM) 1.9-L diesel engine geometry. The first study was conducted on a single-cylinder research engine with primary reference fuels (PRFs), n-heptane, and iso-octane. The second study was conducted on a four-cylinder GM 1.9-L ZDTH engine which was modified with a port fuel injection (PFI) system while maintaining the stock direct injection fuel system. Multi-cylinder RCCI experiments were run with PFI gasoline and direct injection of 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) mixed with gasoline at 5 % EHN by volume. In addition, comparison cases of conventional diesel combustion (CDC) were performed. Particulate size distributions were measured, and PM filter samples were collected for analysis of lube oil components. Triplicate PM filter samples (i.e., three individual filter samples) for both gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS; organic) analysis and X-ray fluorescence (XRF; metals) were obtained at each operating point and queued for analysis of both organic species and lubricant metals. Here, the results give a clear indication that lubricants do not contribute significantly to the formation of RCCI PM.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

The driving cycle was obtained by measurement during normal driving conditions. The results indicated that both parallel and dual-mode hybrid powertrains were capable of improving fuel economy by 7% to 8%. But there was no significant fuel economy benefit for the series hybrid truck because of internal inefficiencies in energy exchange. When reduced aerodynamic drag and tire rolling resistance were combined with hybridization, there was a synergistic fuel economy benefit for appropriate hybrids that increased the fuel economy benefit to more than 15%. Long-haul hybrid trucks with reduced aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance offered lower peak engine loads, better kinetic energy recovery, and reduced average engine power demand. Therefore, it is expected that hybridization with load reduction technologies offers important potential fuel energy savings for future long-haul trucks.","National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Characterization of Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) Using Premixed Gasoline and Direct-Injected Gasoline with a Cetane Improver on a Multi-Cylinder Engine","Dempsey, Adam B.; Curran, Scott; Reitz, Rolf D.","42 ENGINEERING; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; gasoline; dual fuel engines; combustion and combustion processes","The focus of the present paper was to characterize Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) using a single-fuel approach of gasoline and gasoline mixed with a commercially available cetane improver on a multi-cylinder engine. RCCI was achieved by port-injecting a certification grade 96 research octane gasoline and direct-injecting the same gasoline mixed with various levels of a cetane improver, 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN). The EHN volume percentages investigated in the direct-injected fuel were 10, 5, and 2.5%. The combustion phasing controllability and emissions of the different fueling combinations were characterized at 2300 rpm and 4.2 bar brake mean effective pressure over a variety of parametric investigations including direct injection timing, premixed gasoline percentage, and intake temperature. Comparisons were made to gasoline/diesel RCCI operation on the same engine platform at nominally the same operating condition. The experiments were conducted on a modern four cylinder light-duty diesel engine that was modified with a port-fuel injection system while maintaining the stock direct injection fuel system. The pistons were modified for highly premixed operation and feature an open shallow bowl design. The results indicate that the authority to control the combustion phasing through the fuel delivery strategy (e.g., direct injection timing or premixed gasoline percentage) is not a strong function of the EHN concentration in the direct-injected fuel. It was also observed that NOx emissions are a strong function of the global EHN concentration in-cylinder and the combustion phasing. Finally, in general, NOx emissions are significantly elevated for gasoline/gasoline+EHN operation compared with gasoline/diesel RCCI operation at a given operating condition.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The reactivity-controlled compression ignition concept has an advantage over many advanced combustion strategies in that the fuel reactivity can be tailored to the engine speed and load, allowing stable low-temperature combustion to be extended over more of the light-duty drive cycle load range. In this paper, a multi-mode reactivity-controlled compression ignition strategy is employed where the engine switches from reactivity-controlled compression ignition to conventional diesel combustion when speed and load demand are outside of the experimentally determined reactivity-controlled compression ignition range. The potential for reactivity-controlled compression ignition to reduce drive cycle fuel economy and emissions is not clearly understood and is explored here by simulating the fuel economy and emissions for a multi-mode reactivity-controlled compression ignition–enabled vehicle operating over a variety of US drive cycles using experimental engine maps for multi-mode reactivity-controlled compression ignition, conventional diesel combustion, and a 2009 port-fuel injected gasoline engine. Drive cycle simulations are completed assuming a conventional mid-size passenger vehicle with an automatic transmission.

"Feasibility of observing small differences in friction mean effective pressure between different lubricating oil formations using small, single-cylinder motored engine rig","Rohr, William F.; Nguyen, Ke; Bunting, Bruce G.; Qu, Jun","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 42 ENGINEERING; friction test methods; diesel engine oils; diesel engines; FMEP; automotive","Here, the feasibility of using a motored single-cylinder 517 cc diesel engine to observe small frictional differences between oil formulations is investigated. Friction mean effective pressure (FMEP) is measured and compared for an SAE 10W-30 and an SAE 5W-20 oil in three stages of production: base oil, commercial oil without a friction and wear reducing additive, and fully formulated commercial oil. In addition, a commercial SAE 5W-30 engine oil is investigated. Friction mean effective pressure is plotted versus oil dynamic viscosity to compare the lubricant FMEP at a given viscosity. Linear regressions and average friction mean effective pressure are used as a secondary means of comparing FMEP for the various oil formulations. Differences between the oils are observed with the base oil having higher friction at a given viscosity but a lower average FMEP due to the temperature distribution of the test and lower viscosities reached by the base oil. The commercial oil is shown to have both a higher FMEP at a given viscosity and a higher average FMEP than the commercial oil without a friction and wear reducing additive. The increase in friction for the oil without a friction and wear reduction additive indicates that the operational regime of the engine may be out of the bounds of the optimal regime for the additive or that the additive is more optimized for wear reduction. Results show that it is feasible to observe small differences in FMEP between lubricating oil formulations using a small, single-cylinder motored engine.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Direct Numerical Simulations of Autoignition in Stratified Dimethyl-ether (DME)/Air Turbulent Mixtures","Bansal, Gaurav; Mascarenhas, Ajith; Chen, Jacqueline H.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; low temperature combustion engines; thermal and compositional stratification; autoignition; direct numerical simulation","In our paper, two- and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) of autoignition phenomena in stratified dimethyl-ether (DME)/air turbulent mixtures are performed. A reduced DME oxidation mechanism, which was obtained using rigorous mathematical reduction and stiffness removal procedure from a detailed DME mechanism with 55 species, is used in the present DNS. The reduced DME mechanism consists of 30 chemical species. This study investigates the fundamental aspects of turbulence-mixing-autoignition interaction occurring in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine environments. A homogeneous isotropic turbulence spectrum is used to initialize the velocity field in the domain. Moreover, the computational configuration corresponds to a constant volume combustion vessel with inert mass source terms added to the governing equations to mimic the pressure rise due to piston motion, as present in practical engines. DME autoignition is found to be a complex three-staged process; each stage corresponds to a distinct chemical kinetic pathway. The distinct role of turbulence and reaction in generating scalar gradients and hence promoting molecular transport processes are investigated. Then, by applying numerical diagnostic techniques, the different heat release modes present in the igniting mixture are identified. In particular, the contribution of homogeneous autoignition, spontaneous ignition front propagation, and premixed deflagration towards the total heat release are quantified.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through simulation and compared with the solution derived with dynamic programming using the average cost criterion. Finally, both solutions achieved the same cumulative fuel consumption demonstrating that the online Pareto control policy is an optimal control policy.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Crystallinity of tellurium capping and epitaxy of ferromagnetic topological insulator films on SrTiO<sub>3</sub>","Park, Jihwey; Soh, Yeong-Ah; Aeppli, Gabriel; Feng, Xiao; Ou, Yunbo; He, Ke; Xue, Qi-Kun","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; surfaces, interfaces and thin films; topological insulators","Thin films of topological insulators are often capped with an insulating layer since topological insulators are known to be fragile to degradation. However, capping can hinder the observation of novel transport properties of the surface states. To understand the influence of capping on the surface states, it is crucial to understand the crystal structure and the atomic arrangement at the interfaces. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to establish the crystal structure of magnetic topological insulator Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> (CBST) films grown on SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (1 1 1) substrates with and without a Te capping layer. We find that both the film and capping layer are single crystal and that the crystal quality of the film is independent of the presence of the capping layer, but that x-rays cause sublimation of the CBST film, which is prevented by the capping layer. Our findings show that the different transport properties of capped films cannot be attributed to a lower crystal quality but to a more subtle effect such as a different electronic structure at the interface with the capping layer. Our results on the crystal structure and atomic arrangements of the topological heterostructure will enable modelling the electronic structure and design of topological heterostructures.","Nature Publishing Group","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Drive Cycle Powertrain Efficiencies and Trends Derived from EPA Vehicle Dynamometer Results","Thomas, John","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; fuel economy; fuel consumption; vehicle efficiency","Vehicle manufacturers among others are putting great emphasis on improving fuel economy (FE) of light-duty vehicles in the U.S. market, with significant FE gains being realized in recent years. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data indicates that the aggregate FE of vehicles produced for the U.S. market has improved by over 20% from model year (MY) 2005 to 2013. This steep climb in FE includes changes in vehicle choice, improvements in engine and transmission technology, and reducing aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and parasitic losses. The powertrain related improvements focus on optimizing in-use efficiency of the transmission and engine as a system, and may make use of what is termed downsizing and/or downspeeding. This study explores quantifying recent improvements in powertrain efficiency, viewed separately from other vehicle alterations and attributes (noting that most vehicle changes are not completely independent). A methodology is outlined to estimate powertrain efficiency for the U.S city and highway cycle tests using data from the EPA vehicle database. Comparisons of common conventional gasoline powertrains for similar MY 2005 and 2013 vehicles are presented, along with results for late-model hybrid electric vehicles, the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt and other selected vehicles.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Optimizing and Diversifying Electric Vehicle Driving Range for U.S. Drivers","Lin, Zhenhong","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; electric vehicle; range anxiety; optimal design; transportation energy; alternative fuel infrastructure","Properly determining the driving range is critical for accurately predicting the sales and social benefits of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study proposes a framework for optimizing the driving range by minimizing the sum of battery price, electricity cost, and range limitation cost referred to as the ""range-related cost"" as a measurement of range anxiety. The objective function is linked to policy-relevant parameters, including battery cost and price markup, battery utilization, charging infrastructure availability, vehicle efficiency, electricity and gasoline prices, household vehicle ownership, daily driving patterns, discount rate, and perceived vehicle lifetime. Qualitative discussion of the framework and its empirical application to a sample (N=36664) representing new car drivers in the United States is included. The quantitative results strongly suggest that ranges of less than 100 miles are likely to be more popular in the BEV market for a long period of time. The average optimal range among U.S. drivers is found to be largely inelastic. Still, battery cost reduction significantly drives BEV demand toward longer ranges, whereas improvement in the charging infrastructure is found to significantly drive BEV demand toward shorter ranges. In conclusion, the bias of a single-range assumption and the effects of range optimization and diversification in reducing such biases are both found to be significant.","INFORMS","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Effect of Premixed Fuel Preparation for Partially Premixed Combustion with a Low Octane Gasoline on a Light-Duty Multi-Cylinder Compression Ignition Engine","Dempsey, Adam B.; Curran, Scott; Wagner, Robert M.; Cannella, William C.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Gasoline compression ignition concepts with the majority of the fuel being introduced early in the cycle are known as partially premixed combustion (PPC). Previous research on single- and multi-cylinder engines has shown that PPC has the potential for high thermal efficiency with low NOx and soot emissions. A variety of fuel injection strategies has been proposed in the literature. These injection strategies aim to create a partially stratified charge to simultaneously reduce NOx and soot emissions while maintaining some level of control over the combustion process through the fuel delivery system. The impact of the direct injection strategy to create a premixed charge of fuel and air has not previously been explored, and its impact on engine efficiency and emissions is not well understood. This paper explores the effect of sweeping the direct injected pilot timing from -91° to -324° ATDC, which is just after the exhaust valve closes for the engine used in this study. During the sweep, the pilot injection consistently contained 65% of the total fuel (based on command duration ratio), and the main injection timing was adjusted slightly to maintain combustion phasing near top dead center. A modern four cylinder, 1.9 L diesel engine with a variable geometry turbocharger, high pressure common rail injection system, wide included angle injectors, and variable swirl actuation was used in this study. The pistons were modified to an open bowl configuration suitable for highly premixed combustion modes. The stock diesel injection system was unmodified, and the gasoline fuel was doped with a lubricity additive to protect the high pressure fuel pump and the injectors. The study was conducted at a fixed speed/load condition of 2000 rpm and 4.0 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP). The pilot injection timing sweep was conducted at different intake manifold pressures, swirl levels, and fuel injection GTP-15-1067, Dempsey 2 pressures. The gasoline used in this study has relatively high fuel reactivity with a research octane number of 68. The results of this experimental campaign indicate that the highest brake thermal efficiency and lowest emissions are achieved simultaneously with the earliest pilot injection timings (i.e., during the intake stroke).","ASME","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Multicomponent Blend as a Diesel Fuel Surrogate for Compression Ignition Engine Applications","Pei, Yuanjiang; Mehl, Marco; Liu, Wei; Lu, Tianfeng; Pitz, William J.; Som, Sibendu","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","A mixture of n-dodecane and m-xylene is investigated as a diesel fuel surrogate for compression ignition engine applications. Compared to neat n-dodecane, this binary mixture is more representative of diesel fuel because it contains an alkyl-benzene which represents an important chemical class present in diesel fuels. A detailed multi-component mechanism for n-dodecane and m-xylene was developed by combining a previously developed n-dodecane mechanism with a recently developed mechanism for xylenes. The xylene mechanism is shown to reproduce experimental ignition data from a rapid compression machine and shock tube, speciation data from the jet stirred reactor and flame speed data. This combined mechanism was validated by comparing predictions from the model with experimental data for ignition in shock tubes and for reactivity in a flow reactor. The combined mechanism, consisting of 2885 species and 11754 reactions, was reduced to a skeletal mechanism consisting 163 species and 887 reactions for 3D diesel engine simulations. The mechanism reduction was performed using directed relation graph (DRG) with expert knowledge (DRG-X) and DRG-aided sensitivity analysis (DRGASA) at a fixed fuel composition of 77% of n-dodecane and 23% m-xylene by volume. The sample space for the reduction covered pressure of 1 – 80 bar, equivalence ratio of 0.5 – 2.0, and initial temperature of 700 – 1600 K for ignition. The skeletal mechanism was compared with the detailed mechanism for ignition and flow reactor predictions. Finally, the skeletal mechanism was validated against a spray flame dataset under diesel engine conditions documented on the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) website. These multi-dimensional simulations were performed using a Representative Interactive Flame (RIF) turbulent combustion model. Encouraging results were obtained compared to the experiments with regards to the predictions of ignition delay and lift-off length at different ambient temperatures.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

The role of the resolved strain rate has been investigated in a posterior LES study of GE lean premixed dry low NOx emissions LM6000 gas turbine combustor model. A novel approach which is based on the coupling of the lineareddy model with a one-dimensional counter-flow solver has been applied to obtain the parameterizations of the resolved premixed flame properties in terms of the reactive progress variable, the local strain rate measure, and local Reynolds and Karlovitz numbers. The strain rate effects have been analyzed by comparing LES statistics for several models of the turbulent flame speed, i.e, with and without accounting for the local strain rate effects, with available experimental data. The sensitivity of the simulation results to the inflow velocity conditions as well as the grid resolution have been also studied. Overall, the results suggest the necessity to represent the strain rate effects accurately in order to improve LES modeling of the turbulent flame speed.","European Research Community on Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (ERCOFTAC)","","Combustion Research and Flow Technology, Inc., Huntsville, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2015-03-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Flow, Turbulence and Combustion; Journal Volume: 94; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 731-765","","","SC0004465; AC02-05CH11231","Journal ID: ISSN 1386-6184","10.1007/s10494-015-9594-4","","2016-03-24T00:00:00Z","1167511","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1167511","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1167511","Flow, Turbulence and Combustion","4","94"

The method falls into the general category of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian methods; it is based on a fixed mesh that is locally adapted in the immediate vicinity of the moving interfaces and reverts to its original shape once the moving interfaces go past the elements. The moving interfaces are defined by separate sets of marker points so that the global mesh is independent of interface movement and the possibility of mesh entanglement is eliminated. The results is a fully robust formulation capable of calculating on domains of complex geometry with moving boundaries or devises that can also have a complex geometry without danger of the mesh becoming unsuitable due to its continuous deformation thus eliminating the need for repeated re-meshing and interpolation. Moreover, the boundary conditions on the interfaces are imposed exactly. This work is intended to support the internal combustion engines simulator KIVA developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. The model's capabilities are illustrated through application to incompressible flows in different geometrical settings that show the robustness and flexibility of the technique to perform simulations involving moving boundaries in a three-dimensional domain.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

The analysis focuses on the competition between traditional diesel trucks, natural gas vehicles (NGVs), and ultra-efficient powertrains. Underlying the study is a vehicle choice and stock model of the U.S. heavy-duty vehicle market. Moreover, the model is segmented by vehicle class, body type, powertrain, fleet size, and operational type. We find that conventional diesel trucks will dominate the market through 2050, but NGVs could have significant market penetration depending on key technological and economic uncertainties. Compressed natural gas trucks conducting urban trips in fleets that can support private infrastructure are economically viable now and will continue to gain market share. Ultra-efficient diesel trucks, exemplified by the U.S. Department of Energy's SuperTruck program, are the preferred alternative in the long haul segment, but could compete with liquefied natural gas (LNG) trucks if the fuel price differential between LNG and diesel increases. However, the greatest impact in reducing petroleum consumption and pollutant emissions is had by investing in efficiency technologies that benefit all powertrains, especially the conventional diesels that comprise the majority of the stock, instead of incentivizing specific alternatives.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"A Distributed Framework for Coordinated Heavy-Duty Vehicle Platooning","Larson, Jeffrey; Liang, Kuo-Yun; Johansson, Karl H.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) traveling in single file with small intervehicle distances experience reduced aerodynamic drag and, therefore, have improved fuel economy. In this paper, we attempt to maximize the amount of fuel saved by coordinating platoon formation using a distributed network of controllers. These virtual controllers, placed at major intersections in a road network, help coordinate the velocity of approaching vehicles so they arrive at the junction simultaneously and can therefore platoon. This control is initiated only if the cost of forming the platoon is smaller than the savings incurred from platooning. In a large-scale simulation of the German Autobahn network, we observe that savings surpassing 5% when only a few thousand vehicles participate in the system. These results are corroborated by an analysis of real-world HDV data that show significant platooning opportunities currently exist, suggesting that a slightly invasive network of distributed controllers, such as the one proposed in this paper, can yield considerable savings.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

"A quasi-dimensional model for SI engines fueled with gasoline–alcohol blends: Knock modeling","Sileghem, L.; Wallner, T.; Verhelst, S.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","As knock is one of the main factors limiting the efficiency of spark-ignition engines, the introduction of alcohol blends could help to mitigate knock concerns due to the elevated knock resistance of these blends. A model that can accurately predict their autoignition behavior would be of great value to engine designers. The current work aims to develop such a model for alcohol–gasoline blends. First, a mixing rule for the autoignition delay time of alcohol–gasoline blends is proposed. Subsequently, this mixing rule is used together with an autoignition delay time correlation of gasoline and an autoignition delay time cor-relation of methanol in a knock integral model that is implemented in a two-zone engine code. The pre-dictive performance of the resulting model is validated through comparison against experimental measurements on a CFR engine for a range of gasoline–methanol blends. The knock limited spark advance, the knock intensity, the knock onset crank angle and the value of the knock integral at the experimental knock onset have been simulated and compared to the experimental values derived from in-cylinder pressure measurements.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

It describes a working system for recycling, using lead–acid battery recycling as a model. Recycling of automotive lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is more complicated and not yet established because few end-of-life batteries will need recycling for another decade. There is thus the opportunity now to obviate some of the technical, economic, and institutional roadblocks that might arise.

"Comparative Study of Hybrid Powertrains on Fuel Saving, Emissions, and Component Energy Loss in HD Trucks","Gao, Zhiming; Finney, Charles; Daw, Charles; LaClair, Tim J.; Smith, David","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","We compared parallel and series hybrid powertrains on fuel economy, component energy loss, and emissions control in Class 8 trucks over both city and highway driving. A comprehensive set of component models describing battery energy, engine fuel efficiency, emissions control, and power demand interactions for heavy duty (HD) hybrids has been integrated with parallel and series hybrid Class 8 trucks in order to identify the technical barriers of these hybrid powertrain technologies. The results show that series hybrid is absolutely negative for fuel economy benefit of long-haul trucks due to an efficiency penalty associated with the dual-step conversions of energy (i.e. mechanical to electric to mechanical). The current parallel hybrid technology combined with 50% auxiliary load reduction could elevate 5-7% fuel economy of long-haul trucks, but a profound improvement of long-haul truck fuel economy requires additional innovative technologies for reducing aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance losses. The simulated emissions control indicates that hybrid trucks reduce more CO and HC emissions than conventional trucks. The simulated results further indicate that the catalyzed DPF played an important role in CO oxidations. Limited NH<sub>3</sub> emissions could be slipped from the Urea SCR, but the average NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are below 20 ppm. Meanwhile our estimations show 1.5-1.9% of equivalent fuel-cost penalty due to urea consumption in the simulated SCR cases.","SAE International","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Response Surface Energy Modeling of an Electric Vehicle over a Reduced Composite Drive Cycle","Jehlik, Forrest; LaClair, Tim J.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Response surface methodology (RSM) techniques were applied to develop a predictive model of electric vehicle (EV) energy consumption over the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standardized drive cycles. The model is based on measurements from a synthetic composite drive cycle. The synthetic drive cycle is a minimized statistical composite of the standardized urban (UDDS), highway (HWFET), and US06 cycles. The composite synthetic drive cycle is 20 minutes in length thereby reducing testing time of the three standard EPA cycles by over 55%. Vehicle speed and acceleration were used as model inputs for a third order least squared regression model predicting vehicle battery power output as a function of the drive cycle. The approach reduced three cycles and 46 minutes of drive time to a single test of 20 minutes. Application of response surface modeling to the synthetic drive cycle is shown to predict energy consumption of the three EPA cycles within 2.6% of the actual measured values. Additionally, the response model may be used to predict energy consumption of any cycle within the speed/acceleration envelope of the synthetic cycle. This technique results in reducing test time, which additionally provides a model that may be used to expand the analysis and understanding of the vehicle under consideration.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Namely, if available in large enough numbers, EVs can be used as a distributed energy resource (DER) and their presence can influence optimal DER investment and scheduling decisions in microgrids. In this work, a novel EV fleet aggregator model is introduced in a stochastic formulation of DER-CAM [1], an optimization tool used to address DER investment and scheduling problems. This is used to assess the impact of EV interconnections on optimal DER solutions considering uncertainty in EV driving schedules. Optimization results indicate that EVs can have a significant impact on DER investments, particularly if considering short payback periods. Furthermore, results suggest that uncertainty in driving schedules carries little significance to total energy costs, which is corroborated by results obtained using the stochastic formulation of the problem.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Because diesel fuels typically consist of hundreds of compounds, it is difficult to conclusively determine the effects of fuel composition on combustion properties. Surrogate fuels, being simpler representations of these practical fuels, are of interest because they can provide a better understanding of fundamental fuel-composition and property effects on combustion and emissions-formation processes in internal-combustion engines. In addition, the application of surrogate fuels in numerical simulations with accurate vaporization, mixing, and combustion models could revolutionize future engine designs by enabling computational optimization for evolving real fuels. Dependable computational design would not only improve engine function, it would do so at significant cost savings relative to current optimization strategies that rely on physical testing of hardware prototypes. The approach in this study utilized the state-of-the-art techniques of {sup 13}C and {sup 1}H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the advanced distillation curve to characterize fuel composition and volatility, respectively. The ignition quality was quantified by the derived cetane number. Two well-characterized, ultra-low-sulfur No.2 diesel reference fuels produced from refinery streams were used as target fuels: a 2007 emissions certification fuel and a Coordinating Research Council (CRC) Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines (FACE) diesel fuel. A surrogate was created for each target fuel by blending eight pure compounds. The known carbon bond types within the pure compounds, as well as models for the ignition qualities and volatilities of their mixtures, were used in a multiproperty regression algorithm to determine optimal surrogate formulations. The predicted and measured surrogate-fuel properties were quantitatively compared to the measured target-fuel properties, and good agreement was found.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The vehicles ranged in model year from 1984 to 2007 and included one Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV). Emission and fuel consumption measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicate over the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving cycle using a chassis dynamometer for four fuels in each of seven vehicles. The test fuels included a CARB phase 2 certification fuel with 11% MTBE content, a CARB phase 3 certification fuel with a 5.7% ethanol content, and E10, E20, E50, and E85 fuels. In most cases, THC and NMHC emissions were lower with the ethanol blends, while the use of E85 resulted in increases of THC and NMHC for the FFV. CO emissions were lower with ethanol blends for all vehicles and significantly decreased for earlier model vehicles. Results for NOx emissions were mixed, with some older vehicles showing increases with increasing ethanol level, while other vehicles showed either no impact or a slight, but not statistically significant, decrease. CO2 emissions did not show any significant trends. Fuel economy showed decreasing trends with increasing ethanol content in later model vehicles. There was also a consistent trend of increasing acetaldehyde emissions with increasing ethanol level, but other carbonyls did not show strong trends. The use of E85 resulted in significantly higher formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions than the specification fuels or other ethanol blends. BTEX and 1,3-butadiene emissions were lower with ethanol blends compared to the CARB 2 fuel, and were almost undetectable from the E85 fuel. The largest contribution to total carbonyls and other toxics was during the cold-start phase of FTP.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The relative ratio of the pulses is varied for DMCd and DEZn to achieve different compositions over the spectrum from pure CdS to pure ZnS. Overall, the cadmium content in the films is higher than would be expected both as a function of pulse ratio and of temperature based on the growth rates of the binary films. At 150 °C pure ZnS shows almost pure cubic nature; however, the wurtzite content increases with the presence of cadmium until the film is approximately 10% wurtzite for pure CdS. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high resolution confirms the coexistence of zincblende and wurtzite within grains due to the presence of stacking faults. The roughness of the films is a function of the composition, and the band gap and index of refraction can be finely tuned with composition.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

We find that First Law efficiency can deviate by as much as nine percentage points between fuels while Second Law efficiency exhibits a much smaller degree of variability. We also find that First and Second Law efficiency can be nearly the same for some fuels (methane and ethane) but differ substantially for other fuels (hydrogen and ethanol). The differences in First and Second Law efficiency are due to differences in LHV and exergy for a given fuel. In order to explain First Law efficiency differences between fuels as well as the differences between LHV and exergy, we introduce a new term: the molar expansion ratio (MER), defined as the ratio of product moles to reactant moles for complete stoichiometric combustion. We find that the MER is a useful expression for providing a physical explanation for fuel-specific efficiency differences as well as differences between First and Second Law efficiency. First and Second Law efficiency are affected by a number of other fuel-specific thermochemical properties, such as the ratio of specific heat and dissociation of combustion products.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Investigation of the Effects of Biodiesel-based Na on Emissions Control Components","Brookshear, D.

The emissions control components investigated were a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), a Cu-zeolite-based NH{sub 3}-SCR (selective catalytic reduction) catalyst, and a diesel particulate filter (DPF). Both light-duty vehicle, DOC-SCR-DPF, and heavy-duty vehicle, DOC-DPF-SCR, emissions control configurations were employed. The accelerated Na aging is achieved by introducing elevated Na levels in the fuel, to represent full useful life exposure, and periodically increasing the exhaust temperature to replicate DPF regeneration. To assess the validity of the implemented accelerated Na aging protocol, engine-aged lean NO{sub x} traps (LNTs), DOCs and DPFs are also evaluated. To fully characterize the impact on the catalytic activity the LNT, DOC and SCR catalysts were evaluated using a bench flow reactor. The evaluation of the aged DOC samples and LNT show little to no deactivation as a result of Na contamination. However, the SCR in the light-duty configuration (DOC-SCR-DPF) was severely affected by Na contamination, especially when NO was the only fed NO{sub x} source. In the heavy-duty configuration (DOC-DPF-SCR), no impact is observed in the SCR NO{sub x} reduction activity. Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) reveals that Na contamination on the LNT, DOC, and SCR samples is present throughout the length of the catalysts with a higher concentration on the washcoat surface. In both the long-term engine-aged DPF and the accelerated Na-aged DPFs, there is significant Na ash present in the upstream channels; however, in the engine-aged sample lube oil-based ash is the predominant constituent.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Application of a Tractive Energy Analysis to Quantify the Benefits of Advanced Efficiency Technologies Using Characteristic Drive Cycle Data","LaClair, Tim J","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; EFFICIENCY; ENERGY ANALYSIS; EVALUATION; FUEL CONSUMPTION; IMPLEMENTATION; tractive energy; fuel economy; truck; combination vehicle; vehicle efficiency technologies","Accurately predicting the fuel savings that can be achieved with the implementation of various technologies developed for fuel efficiency can be very challenging, particularly when considering combinations of technologies. Differences in the usage of highway vehicles can strongly influence the benefits realized with any given technology, which makes generalizations about fuel savings inappropriate for different vehicle applications. A model has been developed to estimate the potential for reducing fuel consumption when advanced efficiency technologies, or combinations of these technologies, are employed on highway vehicles, particularly medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The approach is based on a tractive energy analysis applied to drive cycles representative of the vehicle usage, and the analysis specifically accounts for individual energy loss factors that characterize the technologies of interest. This tractive energy evaluation is demonstrated by analyzing measured drive cycles from a long-haul trucking fleet and the results of an assessment of the fuel savings potential for combinations of technologies are presented. The results of this research will enable more reliable estimates of the fuel savings benefits that can be realized with particular technologies and technology combinations for individual trucking applications so that decision makers can make informed investment decisions for the implementation of advanced efficiency technologies.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Using vehicle activity data obtained from the GPS-tracking household travel survey in Austin, Texas, gasoline and electricity consumptions of PHEVs in real world driving context are estimated. Driver s within-day recharging behavior, constrained by travel activities and public charger network, is modeled as a boundedly rational decision and incorporated in the energy use estimation. The key findings from the Austin dataset include: (1) public charging infrastructure makes PHEV a competitive vehicle choice for consumers without a home charger; (2) providing sufficient public charging service is expected to significantly reduce petroleum consumption of PHEVs; and (3) public charging opportunities offer greater benefits for PHEVs with a smaller battery pack, as within-day recharges compensate battery capacity.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Market-oriented Optimal Range for PHEV (MOR-PHEV) model is developed to optimize the PHEV electric range for each of 36,664 sampled individuals representing U.S. new vehicle drivers. The optimization objective is the minimization of the sum of costs on battery, gasoline, electricity and refueling hassle. Assuming no battery subsidy, the empirical results suggest that: 1) the optimal PHEV electric range approximates two thirds of one s typical daily driving distance in the near term, defined as $450/kWh battery delivered price and $4/gallon gasoline price. 2) PHEVs are not ready to directly compete with HEVs at today s situation, defined by the $600/kWh battery delivered price and the $3-$4/gallon gasoline price, but can do so in the near term. 3) PHEV10s will be favored by the market over longer-range PHEVs in the near term, but longer-range PHEVs can dominate the PHEV market if gasoline prices reach as high as $5-$6 per gallon and/or battery delivered prices reach as low as $150-$300/kWh. 4) PHEVs can become much more attractive against HEVs in the near term if the electric range can be extended by only 10% with multiple charges per day, possible with improved charging infrastructure or adapted charging behavior. 5) the impact of a $100/kWh decrease in battery delivered prices on the competiveness of PHEVs against HEVs can be offset by about $1.25/gallon decrease in gasoline prices, or about 7/kWh increase in electricity prices. This also means that the impact of a $1/gallon decrease in gasoline prices can be offset by about 5/kWh decrease in electricity prices.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The possible role of improved recharge availability in developing the BEV-PHEV market and the priorities that different charging options should receive from the government require better understanding. This study reviews the charging issue and conceptualizes it into three interactions between the charge network and the travel network. With travel data from 3,755 drivers in the National Household Travel Survey, this paper estimates the distribution among U.S. consumers of (a) PHEV fuel-saving benefits by different recharge availability improvements, (b) range anxiety by different BEV ranges, and (c) willingness to pay for workplace and public charging in addition to home recharging. With the Oak Ridge National Laboratory MA3T model, the impact of three recharge improvements is quantified by the resulting increase in BEV-PHEV sales. Compared with workplace and public recharging improvements, home recharging improvement appears to have a greater impact on BEV-PHEV sales. The impact of improved recharging availability is shown to be amplified by a faster reduction in battery cost.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Subsequently, the NO{sub x} reduction performance of the exposed catalysts was evaluated on a laboratory bench-reactor fed with simulated exhaust. The Fe-zeolite NO{sub x} conversion efficiency was significantly degraded, especially at low temperatures (&lt;250 C), after the catalyst was exposed to the engine exhaust. The degradation of the Fe-zeolite performance was similar for both combustion modes. The Cu-zeolite was much more resistant to hydrocarbon (HC) fouling than the Fe-zeolite catalyst. In the case of the Cu-zeolite, PCCI exhaust had a more significant impact than the exhaust from conventional combustion on the NO{sub x} conversion efficiency. For all cases, the clean catalyst performance was recovered after heating to 600 C. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the HCs adsorbed to the catalyst surface provided insights into the observed NO{sub x} reduction performance trends.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A stand-alone battery system might not be sufficient to satisfy peak power demand and transient load variations in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV). Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased. Utilizing ultracapacitor results in effective capturing of the braking energy, especially in sudden braking conditions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"HCCI Load Expansion Opportunities Using a Fully Variable HVA Research Engine to Guide Developments of a Production Intent Cam-Based VVA Engine: The Low Load Limit","Weall, Adam J; Szybist, James P; Edwards, Kevin Dean; Foster, Matthew; Confer, Keith; Moore, Wayne","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; COMBUSTION; CONFIGURATION; DEACTIVATION; EFFICIENCY; ELEVATORS; ENGINES; FUEL-AIR RATIO; GEOMETRY; HYDRAULICS; OPENINGS; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTION; RESPIRATION; STABILITY; VALVES; HCCI; efficiency; advanced combustion; NVO","While the potential emissions and efficiency benefits of HCCI combustion are well known, realizing the potentials on a production intent engine presents numerous challenges. In this study we focus on identifying challenges and opportunities associated with a production intent cam-based variable valve actuation (VVA) system on a multi-cylinder engine in comparison to a fully flexible, naturally aspirated, hydraulic valve actuation (HVA) system on a single-cylinder engine, with both platforms sharing the same GDI fueling system and engine geometry. The multi-cylinder production intent VVA system uses a 2-step cam technology with wide authority cam phasing, allowing adjustments to be made to the negative valve overlap (NVO) duration but not the valve opening durations. On the single cylinder HVA engine, the valve opening duration and lift are variable in addition to the NVO duration. The content of this paper is limited to the low-medium operating load region at 2000rpm. Using different injection strategies, including the NVO pilot injection approach, the single-cylinder engine is operated over a load range from 160-390 kPa net IMEP at 2000 rpm. Changes to valve opening duration on the single-cylinder HVA engine illustrate opportunities for load expansion and efficiency improvement at certain conditions. For instance, the low load limit can be extended on the HVA engine by reducing breathing and operating closer to a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (AFR) by using valve deactivation. The naturally aspirated engine used here without external EGR confirmed that as operating load increases the emissions of NOx increases due to combustion temperature. NOx emissions are found to be one limitation to the maximum load limitation, the other being high pressure rise rate. It is found that the configuration of the production intent cam-based system represents a good compromise between valve lift and duration in the low to medium load region. Changing the extent of charge motion and breathing via valve deactivation prove beneficial at moderating the pressure rise rate and combustion stability and extending the low load limit at 2000rpm on the HVA engine. It also confirms that strategies using a pilot fuel injection are beneficial at low operating loads but that as operating load is increased, the benefits of multiple injection diminish to the point where a single injection offers the best performance.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Lube oil dilution was measured by gas chromatography (GC) following ASTM method D3524 to measure diesel content, by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry following a modified ASTM method D7371 to measure biodiesel content, and by a newly developed back-flush GC method that simultaneously measures both diesel and biodiesel. Heavy-duty (HD) engine testing was conducted on a 2008 6.7L Cummins ISB equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and diesel particle filter (DPF). Stage one of engine testing consisted of 10 consecutive repeats of a forced DPF regeneration event. This continuous operation with late in-cylinder fuel injection served as a method to accelerate lube-oil dilution. Stage two consisted of 16 hours of normal engine operation over a transient test cycle, which created an opportunity for any accumulated fuel in the oil sump to evaporate. Light duty (LD) vehicle testing was conducted on a 2010 VW Jetta equipped with DOC, DPF and a NOx storage catalyst (NSC). Vehicle testing comprised approximately 4,000 miles of operation on a mileage-accumulation dynamometer (MAD) using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Highway Fuel Economy Cycle because of the relatively low engine oil and exhaust temperatures, and high DPF regeneration frequency of this cycle relative to other cycles examined. Comparison of the lube oil dilution analysis methods suggests that D3524 does not measure dilution by biodiesel. The new back-flush GC method provided analysis for both diesel and biodiesel, in a shorter time and with lower detection limit. Thus all lube oil dilution results in this paper are based on this method. Analysis of the HD lube-oil samples showed only 1.5% to 1.6% fuel dilution for both fuels during continuous operation under DPF regeneration events. During the second stage of HD testing, the ULSD lube-oil dilution levels fell from 1.5% to 0.8%, while for B20, lube-oil dilution levels fell from 1.6% to 1.0%, but the fuel in the oil was 36% biodiesel. For the LD vehicle tests, the frequency of DPF regeneration events was observed to be the same for both ULSD and B20. No significant difference between the two fuels' estimated soot loading was detected by the engine control unit (ECU), although a 23% slower rate of increase in differential pressure across DPF was observed with B20. It appears that the ECU estimated soot loading is based on the engine map, not taking advantage of the lower engine-out particulate matter from the use of biodiesel. After 4,000 miles of LD vehicle operation with ULSD, fuel dilution in the lube-oil samples showed total dilution levels of 4.1% diesel. After 4,000 miles of operation with B20, total fuel in oil dilution levels were 6.7% consisting of 3.6% diesel fuel and 3.1% biodiesel. Extrapolation to the 10,000-mile oil drain interval with B20 suggests that the total fuel content in the oil could reach 12%, compared to 5% for operation on ULSD. Analysis of the oil samples also included measurement of total acid number, total base number, viscosity, soot, metals and wear scar; however, little difference in these parameters was noted.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two stages of degradation were observed in the life cycle under this aging regime. In the first stage, we conclude that loss of lithium inventory was the cause of capacity fade. As a result of such parasitic loss, the cell further suffered from loss of active materials in the second stage, in which the positive electrode kinetics was hampered and the capacity loss accelerated.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"An x-ray absorption spectroscopic study of the electronic structure and bonding of rare-earth orthoferrites","Hayes, J R; Grosvenor, A P","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; ABSORPTION; ANTIFERROMAGNETISM; ATOMS; BOND ANGLE; BONDING; CATALYTIC CONVERTERS; ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE; ELECTRONS; FUEL CELLS; MAGNETIC PROPERTIES; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES; SENSORS; SPECTRA; SPECTROSCOPY; STORAGE","Rare-earth orthoferrites, REFeO{sub 3} (RE=rare earth; Y), are tremendously adaptable compounds that are being investigated for use in a wide variety of applications including gas sensors, vehicle catalytic converters, and solid-oxide fuel cells. They also exhibit interesting magnetic properties such as high-temperature antiferromagnetism, making them useful for data storage applications. The compounds adopt a distorted perovskite-type structure where the tilt angle of the octahedra increases (Fe-O-Fe bond angle decreases) as the size of the rare-earth atom decreases. Despite intensive study of the physical properties of these compounds, very few studies have investigated how the bonding and electronic structure of these systems change with substitution of the RE. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is a technique well-suited for such a study, and, in view of this, Fe L-, Fe K- and O K-edge spectra from a series of REFeO{sub 3} compounds (RE=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ho, Yb, Y) have been collected, and are presented here. Fe L-edge spectra show that Fe is octahedrally coordinated and that the Fe-centered octahedra do not appear to distort with changes in the identity of the RE. The Fe K-edge spectra contain an intersite hybrid peak, which is an ill-studied feature that is attributed to non-local transitions of 1s electrons to 3d states on the next-nearest-neighbor atom that are hybridized with 4p states on the absorbing atom through O 2p states. In this study, it is shown that the intensity of this feature is strongly dependent on the Fe-O-Fe bond angle; the lower the Fe-O-Fe bond angle, the less intense the intersite hybrid peak is.","","","Argonne National Lab.

With that in mind, it has been proposed that vehicular particulate matter (PM) emissions should be regulated based on particle number in addition to particle mass. One aspect of this project is to study different sample handling methods for number based aerosol measurements, specifically, two different methods for removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). One method is a thermodenuder (TD) and the other is an evaporative chamber/diluter (EvCh). These sample handling methods have been implemented in an engine test cell with a spark ignited direct injection (SIDI) engine. The engine was designed for stoichiometric, homogeneous combustion. SIDI is of particular interest for improved fuel efficiency compared to other SI engines, however, the efficiency benefit comes with greater PM emissions and may therefore be subject to the proposed number based PM regulation. Another aspect of this project is to characterize PM from this engine in terms of particle number and composition","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Overall, 5,801 workers were involved in radiation activities, including 2,232 who were monitored for intakes of radionuclides, and 41,169 workers were engaged in rocket testing or other non-radiation activities. The worker population is unique in that lifetime occupational doses from all places of employment were sought, updated and incorporated into the analyses. Further, radiation doses from intakes of 14 different radionuclides were calculated for 16 organs or tissues using biokinetic models of the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP). Because only negligible exposures were received by the 247 workers monitored for radiation activities after 1999, the mean dose from external radiation remained essentially the same at 13.5 mSv (maximum 1 Sv) as reported previously, as did the mean lung dose from external and internal radiation combined at 19.0 mSv (maximum 3.6 Sv). An additional 9 years of follow-up, from December 31,1999 through 2008, increased the person-years of observation for the radiation workers by 21.7% to 196,674 (mean 33.9 years) and the number of cancer deaths by 50% to 684. Analyses included external comparisons with the general population and the computation of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and internal comparisons using proportional hazards models and the computation of relative risks (RRs). A low SMR for all causes of death (SMR 0.82; 95% CI 0.78-0.85) continued to indicate that the Rocketdyne radiation workers were healthier than the general population and were less likely to die. The SMRs for all cancers taken together (SMR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.95), lung cancer (SMR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-1.00) and leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (SMR 1.04; 95% 0.67-1.53) were not significantly elevated. Cox regression analyses revealed no significant dose-response trends for any cancer. For all cancers excluding leukemia, the RR at 100 mSv was estimated as 0.98 (95% CI 0.82-1.17), and for all leukemia other than CLL it was 1.06 (95% CI 0.50-2.23). Uranium was the primary radionuclide contributing to internal exposures, but no significant increases in lung and kidney disease were seen. The extended follow-up reinforces the findings in the previous study in failing to observe a detectable increase in cancer deaths associated with radiation, but strong conclusions still cannot be drawn because of small numbers and relatively low career doses. Larger combined studies of early workers in the United States using similar methodologies are warranted to refine and clarify radiation risks after protracted exposures.","","","Oak Ridge Inst. for Science and Education (ORISE), Oak Ridge, TN (United States)","USDOE Office of Health, Safety, and Security (HSS)","","United States","2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Radiation Research; Journal Volume: 176; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: 244-258","","11-OEWH-1904","DE-AC05-06OR23100","Journal ID: ISSN 0033-7587; RAREAE; TRN: US201124%%477","10.1667/RR2487.1","","2011-12-29T00:00:00Z","1030817","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1030817","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1030817","Radiation Research","2","176"

We use a unit commitment model of the Texas power system to simulate system operations with different-sized PHEV fleets that do and do not provide V2G services, to estimate the value of those services. We demonstrate that a PHEV fleet can provide benefits to the system, mainly through the provision of ancillary services, reducing the need to reserve conventional generator capacity. Moreover, our analysis shows that PHEV owners are made better off by providing V2G services and we demonstrate that these benefits can reduce the time it takes to recover the higher upfront capital cost of a PHEV when compared to other vehicle types.","International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) - with an efficiency higher than that of internal combustion engines, light weight, low operating temperature, and fast-start-up capability - are strong candidates for automotive applications. Transportation applications could be especially important in shaping up the new energy economy since they may entail a substantial decrease in the adverse environmental effects linked to the use of fossil fuels and prolong their availability. The largest portion of the cost of PEMFCs reflects the large amount of Pt needed in the cathode's catalytic layer due to the low catalytic activity of Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Recently, considerable advances have been made in fuel cell electrocatalysis yielding improved electrocatalysts, and increasing our understanding of the kinetics of the ORR in combination with significant advances in theoretical treatments. Some of these studies involved: (1) alloying Pt to synthesize bi-metallic catalysts, (2) core-shell nanoparticles catalysts, (3) the role of size, structure, and shape of nanoparticles, and (4) de-alloying of bimetallic alloys. However, a complete understanding of the ORR kinetics on Pt, the best single element catalyst, and of its low efficiency, is yet to be achieved. These problems, compounded with the high Pt content in current cathode catalysts, and with their gradual loss of performance under operating conditions, still hamper commercialization of fuel cells. In order to minimize the amount of noble metal electrocatalysts and maximize their utilization, while achieving high catalytic activity, numerous synthetic approaches have been attempted. The electrocatalysts were prepared using vacuum deposition methods, wet chemistry methods, or electrodeposition techniques. Electrodeposition in particular has several attractive features with respect to the application in catalyst synthesis such as simplicity of operation and ease of control of the deposition conditions. In this article we describe the application of metal electrodeposition in the synthesis of a new type of electrocatalysts comprising a Pt monolayer (Pt{sub ML}) on metal or alloy nanoparticles. The concept of Pt{sub ML} electrocatalysts offers a possible solution to the impasse caused by a slow ORR kinetics and the consequent large Pt content of conventional electrocatalysts. A Pt{sub ML} shell on a nanoparticle substrate core ensures that every Pt atom is available for catalytic activity; in other words, a Pt{sub ML} achieves the ultimate reduction in Pt loading and complete Pt utilization. Also, through geometric and electronic interaction with the substrate a Pt{sub ML} can change its electronic properties and be more active and durable than pure-Pt electrocatalysts.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Four PHEV charging scenarios are simulated for the Illinois power system: (1) unconstrained charging, (2) 3-hour delayed constrained charging, (3) smart charging, and (4) smart charging with DR. The PHEV charging is assumed to be optimally controlled by the system operator in the latter two scenarios, along with load shifting and shaving enabled by DR programs. The simulation results show that optimally dispatching the PHEV charging load can significantly reduce the total operating cost of the system. With DR programs in place, the operating cost can be further reduced.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The fuel industry relies on phenotypic cultivation-based contaminant identification, which may lack accuracy and neglect difficult-to-culture taxa. By the use of industry practice aerobic cultivation, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and strain genotyping, a collection of 152 unique contaminant isolates from 54 fuel samples was assembled, and a dominance of Pseudomonas (21%), Burkholderia (7%), and Bacillus (7%) was demonstrated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 15 samples revealed Proteobacteria and Firmicutes to be the most abundant phyla. When 16S rRNA V6 gene pyrosequencing of four selected fuel samples (indicated by 'JW') was performed, Betaproteobacteria (42.8%) and Gammaproteobacteria (30.6%) formed the largest proportion of reads; the most abundant genera were Marinobacter (15.4%; JW57), Achromobacter (41.6%; JW63), Burkholderia (80.7%; JW76), and Halomonas (66.2%; JW78), all of which were also observed by DGGE. However, the Clostridia (38.5%) and Deltaproteobacteria (11.1%) identified by pyrosequencing in sample JW57 were not observed by DGGE or aerobic culture. Genotyping revealed three instances where identical strains were found: (i) a Pseudomonas sp. strain recovered from 2 different diesel fuel tanks at a single industrial site; (ii) a Mangroveibacter sp. strain isolated from 3 biodiesel tanks at a single refinery site; and (iii) a Burkholderia vietnamiensis strain present in two unrelated automotive diesel samples. Overall, aerobic cultivation of fuel contaminants recovered isolates broadly representative of the phyla and classes present but lacked accuracy by overrepresenting members of certain groups such as Pseudomonas.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The purpose of the life prediction framework is to account aging effect caused by cyclic loadings on fatigue strength of gas turbine engines structural components which are usually designed for very long life. Previous studies indicate the total strain energy dissipated during a monotonic fracture process and a cyclic process is a material property that can be determined by measuring the area underneath the monotonic true stress-strain curve and the sum of the area within each hysteresis loop in the cyclic process, respectively. The energy-based fatigue life prediction framework consists of the following entities: (1) development of a testing procedure to achieve plastic energy dissipation per life cycle and (2) incorporation of an energy-based fatigue life calculation scheme to determine the remaining fatigue life of in-service gas turbine materials. The accuracy of the remaining fatigue life prediction method was verified by comparison between model approximation and experimental results of Aluminum 6061-T6. The comparison shows promising agreement, thus validating the capability of the framework to produce accurate fatigue life prediction.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The two-zone combustionmodel is derived from a previously published multi-zone model, but it has been further simplified toincrease computational speed by a factor of over 100. The results demonstrate that this simplified modelis still able to track key aspects of the combustion trajectory responsible for NOx and soot production. Inparticular, the two-zone model in combination with highly simplified global kinetics correctly predictsthe importance of including oxygen mass fraction (in addition to equivalence ratio and temperature)in lowering emissions from high-efficiency clean combustion. The methodology also provides a convenient framework for extracting information directly from in-cylinder pressure measurements. This feature is likely to be useful for on-board combustion diagnostics and controls. Because of the possibilityfor simulating large numbers of engine cycles in a short time, models of this type can provide insight into multi-cycle and transient combustion behavior not readily accessible to more computationally intensive models. Also the representation of the combustion trajectory in 3D space corresponding to equivalence ratio, flame temperature, and oxygen fraction provides new insight into optimal combustionmanagement.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, issues such as low NOx conversion at low temperature conditions still exist due to various factors, including incomplete urea thermolysis, inhibition of SCR reactions by hydrocarbons and H2O. We have observed a noticeable reduction in the standard SCR reaction efficiency at low temperature with increasing water content. We observed a similar effect when hydrocarbons are present in the stream. This effect is absent under fast SCR conditions where NO ~ NO2 in the feed gas. As a first step in understanding the effects of such inhibition on SCR reaction steps, kinetic models that predict the inhibition behavior of H2O and hydrocarbons on NO oxidation are presented in the paper. A one-dimensional SCR model was developed based on conservation of species equations and was coded as a C-language S-function and implemented in Matlab/Simulink environment. NO oxidation and NO2 dissociation kinetics were defined as a function of the respective adsorbate’s storage in the Fe-zeolite SCR catalyst. The corresponding kinetic models were then validated on temperature ramp tests that showed good match with the test data. Such inhibition models will improve the accuracy of model based control design for integrated DPF-SCR aftertreatment systems.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Interpretation of Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Diesel Exhaust Photooxidation in an Environmental Chamber","Nakao, Shunsuke; Shrivastava, ManishKumar B; Nguyen, Anh; Jung, Hee-Jung; Cocker, David R","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; AEROSOLS; AGING; DIESEL ENGINES; FRACTALS; OXIDATION; PARTICULATES; SMOG","Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from diesel exhaust in a smog chamber was investigated. Particle volume measurement based on mobility diameter is shown to underestimate SOA formation from diesel exhaust due to the external void space of agglomerate particles, in which case mass-based measurement technique is necessary. Rapid determination of particle effective density as a function of particle mass was performed by an Aerosol Particle Mass analyzer – Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (APM-SMPS) to obtain particle mass concentration and fractal dimension. Continuous aging of aerosol was observed in terms of atomic ratio (O/C), from 0.05 to 0.25 in 12 hours, underscoring the importance of multi-generational oxidation of low-volatile organic vapors emitted from diesel engine as the significant source of oxygenated SOA. Experimental conditions possibly have strong impacts on physical evolution of diesel particulates in a smog chamber. Higher particle effective densities were observed when raw exhaust was injected into a full bag as opposed to filling a bag with diluted exhaust using an ejector diluter. When longer transfer line was used for injecting diesel exhaust into the smog chamber, rapid particle coagulation was observed, leading to increasing particle volume concentration in dark while its mass concentration is decreasing.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

These processes control the fuel-air mixing, which in turn is critical for the combustion process. Previous studies by us highlighted the differences in the physical and chemical properties of petrodiesel and biodiesel, which significantly altered the inner-nozzle flow and spray structure. The current study is another step in this direction to gain a fundamental understanding on the influence of fuel properties on the combustion and emission characteristics of the compression ignition engine. n-Heptane and methyl butanoate were selected as surrogates for diesel and biodiesel fuels, respectively, because the chemical kinetic pathways were well-understood. Liquid length and flame lift-off length for diesel and biodiesel fuels were validated against data available in the literature. Liquid lengths were always higher for biodiesel because of its higher heat of vaporization, which resulted in increased interplay between spray and combustion processes under all conditions investigated. Ambient air entrainment was also lower for biodiesel mainly because of slower atomization and breakup. The mechanism for flame stabilization is further analyzed by estimating the turbulent burning velocity for both of the fuels. This analysis revealed that neither flame propagation nor isolated ignition kernels upstream and detached from high-temperature regions can be the mechanism for flame stabilization. Flame propagation speeds were observed to be similar for both fuels. Biodiesel predicted lower soot concentrations, which were also reflected in reduced C{sub 2}H{sub 2} mole fractions. Although prompt NO{sub x} was higher for biodiesel, total NO{sub x} was lower because of reduced thermal NO{sub x}. The ignition delay and NO{sub x} emissions predicted by these simulations do not agree with trends reported in the literature; hence, this study highlights the need for better fuel surrogates for diesel and biodiesel fuels.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Unfortunately, steady-state engine behavior is often significantly different from actual behavior under realistic driving conditions. This is particularly true for vehicles (e.g., electric hybrids) that undergo repeated engine shutdown and restart. We propose a methodology for estimating transient engine exhaust properties based on corrections to steady-state maps. We have implemented our methodology in the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) and use this implementation to demonstrate good agreement with experimental measurements for both a light-duty diesel and a flex-fuel gasoline/ethanol engine. We also recommend specific procedures for setting key parameters required by our methodology and suggest possible directions for further improvements.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Modern engines employ micro-orifices with different orifice designs. It is critical to characterize the effects of various designs on engine performance and emissions. In this study, a recently developed primary breakup model (KH-ACT), which accounts for the effects of cavitation and turbulence generated inside the injector nozzle is incorporated into a CFD software CONVERGE for comprehensive engine simulations. The effects of orifice geometry on inner nozzle flow, spray, and combustion processes are examined by coupling the injector flow and spray simulations. Results indicate that conicity and hydrogrinding reduce cavitation and turbulence inside the nozzle orifice, which slows down primary breakup, increasing spray penetration, and reducing dispersion. Consequently, with conical and hydroground nozzles, the vaporization rate and fuel air mixing are reduced, and ignition occurs further downstream. The flame lift-off lengths are the highest and lowest for the hydroground and conical nozzles, respectively. This can be related to the rate of fuel injection, which is higher for the hydroground nozzle, leading to richer mixtures and lower flame base speeds. A modified flame index is employed to resolve the flame structure, which indicates a dual combustion mode. For the conical nozzle, the relative role of rich premixed combustion is enhanced and that of diffusion combustion reduced compared to the other two nozzles. In contrast, for the hydroground nozzle, the role of rich premixed combustion is reduced and that of non-premixed combustion is enhanced. Consequently, the amount of soot produced is the highest for the conical nozzle, while the amount of NOx produced is the highest for the hydroground nozzle, indicating the classical tradeoff between them.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Particle size, surfactant concentration, and the type of base fluid were varied. In general, nanosuspensions can last much longer than micron suspensions, and ethanol-based fuels were found to achieve much better suspension than n-decane-based fuels. Five distinctive stages (preheating and ignition, classical combustion, microexplosion, surfactant flame, and aluminum droplet flame) were identified for an n-decane/nano-Al droplet, while only the first three stages occurred for an n-decane/micron-Al droplet. For the same solid loading rate and surfactant concentration, the disruption and microexplosion behavior of the micron suspension occurred later with much stronger intensity. The intense droplet fragmentation was accompanied by shell rupture, which caused a massive explosion of particles, and most of them were burned during this event. On the contrary, for the nanosuspension, combustion of the large agglomerate at the later stage requires a longer time and is less complete because of formation of an oxide shell on the surface. This difference is mainly due to the different structure and characteristics of particle agglomerates formed during the early stage, which is a spherical, porous, and more-uniformly distributed aggregate for the nanosuspension, but it is a densely packed and impermeable shell for the micron suspension. A theoretical analysis was then conducted to understand the effect of particle size on particle collision mechanism and aggregation rate. The results show that for nanosuspensions, particle collision and aggregation are dominated by the random Brownian motion. For micron suspensions, however, they are dominated by fluid motion such as droplet surface regression, droplet expansion resulting from bubble formation, and internal circulation. And the Brownian motion is the least important. This theoretical analysis explains the different characteristics of the particle agglomerates, which are responsible for the different microexplosion behaviors that were observed in the experiments.

Attempting numerical simulations of combustion of real fuels with all of the hydrocarbon species included is highly unrealistic. Thus, a surrogate model approach is generally adopted, which involves choosing a few representative hydrocarbon species whose overall behavior mimics the characteristics of the target fuel. The present study proposes surrogate models for the ninefuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE) that have been developed for studying low-emission, high-efficiency advanced diesel engine concepts. The surrogate compositions for the fuels are arrived at by simulating their distillation profiles to within a maximum absolute error of ~4% using a discrete multi-component (DMC) fuel model that has been incorporated in the multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, KIVA-ERC-CHEMKIN. The simulated surrogate compositions cover the range and measured concentrations of the various hydrocarbon classes present in the fuels. The fidelity of the surrogate fuel models is judged on the basis of matching their specific gravity, lower heating value, hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, cetane number, and cetane index with the measured data for all nine FACE fuels.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The study presented here evaluates available protection strategies to identify bottlenecks limiting the scale of near-Earth object that could be deflected, using cutting-edge and near-future technologies. It discusses the use of a nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) as a propulsion device for delivery of thermonuclear payloads to deflect or destroy a long-period comet on a collision course with Earth. A ‘worst plausible scenario’ for the available warning time (10 months) and comet approach trajectory are determined, and empirical data are used to make an estimate of the payload necessary to deflect such a comet. Optimizing the tradeoff between early interception and large deflection payload establishes the ideal trajectory for an interception mission to follow. The study also examines the potential for multiple rocket launch dates. Comparison of propulsion technologies for this mission shows that NTR outperforms other options substantially. The discussion concludes with an estimate of the comet size (5 km) that could be deflected usingNTRpropulsion, given current launch capabilities.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The use of high concentration aerosols (e.g., {proportional_to}0.1 mL{sub fuel}/L{sub gas}, {proportional_to}1 x 10{sup 9} droplets/L{sub gas} for stoichiometric fuel loading at ambient conditions) can result in droplet-droplet interactions which lead to significant gas-phase fuel saturation and evaporative cooling during the volumetric compression process. In addition, localized stratification (i.e., on the droplet scale) of the fuel vapor and of temperature can lead to non-homogeneous reaction and heat release processes - features which could prevent adequate segregation of the underlying chemical kinetic rates from rates of physical transport. These characteristics are dependent on many factors including physical parameters such as overall fuel loading and initial droplet size relative to the compression rate, as well as fuel and diluent properties such as the boiling curve, vaporization enthalpy, heat capacity, and mass and thermal diffusivities. This study investigates the physical issues, especially fuel saturation and evaporative cooling effects, using a spherically-symmetric, single-droplet wet compression model. n-Dodecane is used as the fuel with the gas containing 21% O{sub 2} and 79% N{sub 2}. An overall compression time and compression ratio of 15.3 ms and 13.4 are used, respectively. It is found that smaller droplets (d{sub 0}{proportional_to} 2-3 {mu}m) are more affected by 'far-field' saturation and cooling effects, while larger droplets (d{sub 0}{proportional_to} 14 {mu}m) result in greater localized stratification of the gas-phase due to the larger diffusion distances for heat and mass transport. Vaporization of larger droplets is more affected by the volumetric compression process since evaporation requires more time to be completed even at the same overall fuel loading. All of the cases explored here yield greater compositional stratification than thermal stratification due to the high Lewis numbers of the fuel-air mixtures (Le{sub g} {proportional_to} 3.8).

Starting from an existing reduced mechanism for primary reference fuel (PRF) oxidation, further improvement was made by including additional reactions and by optimizing reaction rate constants of selected reactions. Using a similar approach to that used to develop the reduced PRF mechanism, reduced mechanisms for the oxidation of n-tetradecane, toluene, cyclohexane, dimethyl ether (DME), ethanol, and methyl butanoate (MB) were built and combined with the PRF mechanism to form a multi-surrogate fuel chemistry (MultiChem) mechanism. The final version of the MultiChem mechanism consists of 113 species and 487 reactions. Validation of the present MultiChem mechanism was performed with ignition delay time measurements from shock tube tests and predictions by comprehensive mechanisms available in the literature. A combustion model was developed to simulate engine combustion with multi-component fuels using the present MultiChem mechanism, and the model was applied to simulate HCCI and DI engine combustion. The results show that the present multi-component combustion model gives reliable performance for combustion predictions, as well as computational efficiency improvements through the use of reduced mechanism for multi-dimensional CFD simulations.

To cast light on the underlying mechanism, the current study aims to separate flame lift-off effects of the chemical ignition delay from those of other fuel properties under diesel conditions. Flame lift-off was measured in an optical diesel engine by high-speed video imaging of OH-chemiluminescence. Fuel and ambient-gas properties were varied during the experiment. Only a weak correlation was found between ignition delay and lift-off length. The data indicate that this correlation is due to a common, stronger correlation with the ambient oxygen concentration. The chemical ignition delay and the fuel type had similar, weak effects on the lift-off length. A recently proposed mechanism for lift-off stabilization was used to interpret the results. It assumes that reactants approaching the lift-off position of the jet are mixed with high-temperature products found along the edges of the flame, which trigger autoignition. In this picture, the fuel effect is most likely due to differences in the amount of mixing with high-temperature products that is required for autoignition. In the current experiment, all lift-off effects seem to arise from variations in the reactant and product temperatures, induced by fuel and ambient properties.

An established stochastic reactor model (SRM) previously used to examine homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion has been extended by spark initiation, flame propagation and flame termination sub-models in order to simulate combustion in SI engines. The model contains a detailed chemical mechanism but relatively short computation times are achieved. The flame front is assumed to be spherical and centred at the spark location, and a pent roof and piston bowl geometry are accounted for. The model is validated by simulating the pressure profile and emissions from an iso-octane fuelled single cylinder research engine that showed low CCV. The effects of key parameters are investigated. Experimental results that show cycle to cycle fluctuations in a four-cylinder naturally aspirated gasoline fuelled SI engine are presented. The model is then coupled with GT-Power, a one-dimensional engine simulation tool, which is used to simulate the breathing events during a multi-cycle simulation. This allows an investigation of the cyclic fluctuations in peak pressure. The source and magnitude of nitric oxide (NO) emissions produced by different cycles are then investigated. It was found that faster burning cycles result in increased NO emissions compared with cycles that have a slower rate of combustion and that more is produced in the early stages of combustion compared with later in the cycle. The majority of NO was produced via the thermal mechanism just after combustion begins.

The aim of this plot is to provide a more compact and suited form to implement in engine simulation models and to interpolate data from turbocharger test bench. The new map is based on the use of conservative parameters as turbocharger power and turbine mass flow to describe the turbine performance in all VGT positions. The curves obtained are accurately fitted with quadratic polynomials and simple interpolation techniques give reliable results. Two turbochargers characterized in an steady flow rig were used for illustrating the representation. After being implemented in a turbocharger submodel, the results obtained with the model have been compared with success against turbine performance evaluated in engine tests cells. A practical application in turbocharger matching is also provided to show how this new map can be directly employed in engine design.

CAI operation was achieved with the use of the negative valve overlap (NVO) technique and internal exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR). Experiments were performed at single injection and split injection, where some amount of fuel was injected close to top dead centre (TDC) during NVO interval, and the second injection was applied with variable timing. Additionally, combustion at variable fuel-rail pressure was examined. Investigation showed that at fuel injection into recompressed exhaust fuel reforming took place. This process was identified via an analysis of the exhaust-fuel mixture composition after NVO interval. It was found that at single fuel injection in NVO phase, its advance determined the heat release rate and auto-ignition timing, and had a strong influence on NO{sub X} emission. However, a delay of single injection to intake stroke resulted in deterioration of cycle-to-cycle variability. Application of split injection showed benefits of this strategy versus single injection. Examinations of different fuel mass split ratios and variable second injection timing resulted in further optimisation of mixture formation. At equal share of the fuel mass injected in the first injection during NVO and in the second injection at the beginning of compression, the lowest emission level and cyclic variability improvement were observed.

This study compares reduction potentials that might be achieved in 2060 for several advanced options including biofuels, hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), assuming that technical and cost reduction targets are met and necessary fueling infrastructures are built. The study quantifies the extent of the reductions that can be achieved through increasing engine efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels separately. Decarbonizing the fuels is essential for achieving large reductions in GHG emissions, and the study quantifies the reductions that can be achieved over a range of fuel carbon intensities. Although renewables will play a vital role, some combination of coal gasification with carbon capture and sequestration, and/or nuclear energy will likely be needed to enable very large reductions in carbon intensities for hydrogen and electricity. Biomass supply constraints do not allow major carbon emission reductions from biofuels alone; the value of biomass is that it can be combined with other solutions to help achieve significant results. Compared with gasoline, natural gas provides 20% reduction in GHG emissions in internal combustion engines and up to 50% reduction when used as a feedstock for producing hydrogen or electricity, making it a good transition fuel for electric propulsion drive trains. The material in this paper can be useful information to many other countries, including developing countries because of a common factor: the difficulty of finding sustainable, low-carbon, cost-competitive substitutes for petroleum fuels.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Wavelet analysis of the time series, combined with conventional statistics and multifractal analysis, revealed previously undocumented features in the combustion variability as the shift occurred. In the spark-ignition combustion mode, the heat-release variations were very small in amplitude and exhibited more persistent low-frequency oscillations with intermittent high-frequency bursts. In the HCCI combustion mode, the amplitude of the heat-release variations again was small and involved mainly low-frequency oscillations. At intermediate states between SI and HCCI, a wide range of very large-amplitude oscillations occurred, including both persistent low-frequency periodicities and intermittent high-frequency bursts. It appears from these results that real-time wavelet decomposition of engine cylinder pressure measurements may be useful for on-board tracking of SI HCCI combustion regime shifts.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Desired signal to noise ratio can be achieved in a material system with high conductivity. From previous studies it is established that 6 atomic percent samarium doping is the optimum concentration for thin film samaria doped ceria to achieve high ionic conductivity. In this study, the conductivity of the 6 atomic percent samaria doped ceria thin film is measured as a function of the sensing film thickness. Hysteresis and dynamic response of this sensing platform is tested for a range of oxygen pressures from 0.001 Torr to 100 Torr for temperatures above 673 K. An attempt has been made to understand the physics behind the thickness dependent conductivity behavior of this sensing platform by developing a hypothetical operating model and through COMSOL simulations.

The densities of size-classified particles were determined by measurements with a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and an aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM). Particle masses of the different size classes were evaluated with a proposed DMA-APM response function for aggregates. Our results indicate that the effective densities of PCCI and conventional diesel particles were approximately the same for 50 and 100 nm electrical mobility diameters (0.9 and 0.6 g/cc, respectively), but the PCCI particle effective density (0.4 g/cc) was less than the conventional (0.5 g/cc) for 150 nm. The lowest effective particle densities were observed for exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) levels somewhat less than that required for PCCI operation. The inherent densities of conventional particles in the 50 and 100 nm size classes were 1.22 and 1.77 g/cc, which is in good agreement with Park et al. (2004). PCCI inherent particle densities for these same size classes were higher (1.27 and 2.10 g/cc), suggesting that there may have been additional adsorbed liquid hydrocarbons. For 150 nm particles, the inherent densities were nearly the same for PCCI and conventional particles at 2.20 g/cc. We expect that the lower effective density of PCCI particles may improve particulate emissions control with diesel particulate filters (DPFs). The presence of liquid hydrocarbons may also promote oxidation in DPFs.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Despite this distinct advantage, DI fueling often increases particle emissions such that SI exhaust may be subject to future particle emissions regulations. Challenges in controlling particle emissions arise as engines encounter varied fuel composition such as intermediate ethanol blends. Furthermore, modern engines are operated using unconventional breathing strategies with advanced cam-based variable valve actuation systems. In this study, we investigate particle emissions from a multi-cylinder DI engine operated with three different breathing strategies, fueling strategies and fuels. The breathing strategies are conventional throttled operation, early intake valve closing (EIVC) and late intake valve closing (LIVC); the fueling strategies are single injection DI (sDI), multi-injection DI (mDI), and PFI; and the fuels are emissions certification gasoline, E20 and E85. The results indicate the dominant factor influencing particle number concentration emissions for the sDI and mDI strategies is the fuel injection timing. Overly advanced injection timing results in particle formation due to fuel spray impingement on the piston, and overly retarded injection timing results in particle formation due to poor fuel and air mixing. In addition, fuel type has a significant effect on particle emissions for the DI fueling strategies. Gasoline and E20 fuels generate comparable levels of particle emissions, but E85 produces dramatically lower particle number concentration. The particle emissions for E85 are near the detection limit for the FSN instrument, and particle number emissions are one to two orders of magnitude lower for E85 relative to gasoline and E20. We found PFI fueling produces very low levels of particle emissions under all conditions and is much less sensitive to engine breathing strategy and fuel type than the DI fueling strategies. The particle number-size distributions for PFI fueling are of the same order for all of the breathing strategies and fuel types and are one to two orders lower than for the sDI fuel injection strategy with gasoline and E20. Remarkably, the particle emissions for E85 under the sDI fueling strategy are similar to particle emissions with a PFI fueling strategy. Thus by using E85, the efficiency and power advantages of DI fueling can be gained without generating high particle emissions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

For this purpose an experimental investigation of thermoelectrics in contact with clean and fouled heat exchangers of different materials is performed. The thermoelectric devices are tested on a bench-scale thermoelectric heat recovery apparatus that simulates automotive exhaust. The thermoelectric apparatus consists of a series of thermoelectric generators contacting a hot-side and a cold-side heat exchanger. The thermoelectric devices are tested with two different hot-side heat exchanger materials, stainless steel and aluminum, and at a range of simulated exhaust gas flowrates (40 to 150 slpm), exhaust gas temperatures (240 C and 280 C), and coolant-side temperatures (40 C and 80 C). It is observed that for higher exhaust gas flowrates, thermoelectric power output increases while overall system efficiency decreases. Degradation of the effectiveness of the EGR-type heat exchangers over a period of driving is also simulated by exposing the heat exchangers to diesel engine exhaust under thermophoretic conditions to form a deposit layer. For the fouled EGR-type heat exchangers, power output and system efficiency is observed to be significantly lower for all conditions tested. The study found, however, that heat exchanger material is the dominant factor in the ability of the system to convert heat to electricity with thermoelectric generators. This finding is thought to be unique to the heat exchangers used for this study, and not a universal trend for all system configurations.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, little experimental or computational work has been performed on the dynamics of fuel injectors. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to measure the three-dimensional geometry of the injector nozzle, and to track changes in that geometry as the needle opens and closes in real time. This has enabled the dynamics of the injector to be compared with the dynamics of the spray, and allows computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to use realistic time-dependent flow passage geometries. In this study, X-ray phase-enhanced imaging has been used to perform time-resolved imaging of the needle seat area in several common-rail diesel injection nozzles. The fuel distributions of the sprays emitted by these injectors were also studied with fast X-ray radiography. Correlations between eccentric motions of the injector needle valve and oscillations in the fuel density as it emerges from the nozzle are examined. CFD modeling is used to interpret the effect of needle motion on fuel flow.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The present study describes a method for predicting the ignition behavior of blends of n-heptane and methyl butanoate, fuels whose blends have been used in the past as a surrogate for biodiesel. The autoignition is predicted using a multistep (8-step) model in order to reduce computational time and make this a viable tool for implementation into engine simulation codes. A detailed reaction mechanism for n-heptane-methyl butanoate blends was used as a basis for validating the multistep model results.

It can lead to macroscopic surface roughening and seizure. The occurrence of galling can be especially problematic in high-temperature applications like diesel engine exhaust gas recirculation system components and adjustable turbocharger vanes, because suitable lubricants may not be available, moisture desorption promotes increased adhesion, and the yield strength of metals decreases with temperature. Oxidation can counteract these effects to some extent by forming lubricative oxide films. Two methods to improve the galling resistance of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V were investigated: (a) applying an oxygen diffusion treatment, and (b) creating a metal-matrix composite with TiB2 using a high-intensity infrared heating source. A new, oscillating three-pin-on-flat, high-temperature test method was developed and used to characterize galling behavior relative to a cobalt-based alloy (Stellite 6B ). The magnitude of the oscillating torque, the surface roughness, and observations of surface damage were used as measures of galling resistance. Owing to the formation of lubricative oxide films, the galling resistance of the Ti-alloy at 485o C, even non-treated, was considerably better than it was at room temperature. The IR-formed composite displayed reduced surface damage and lower torque than the substrate titanium alloy.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

K.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; combustion; cylinders; diesel; diesel engines; methane; emissions","Different combustion strategies and fuel sources are needed to deal with increasing fuel efficiency demands and emission restrictions. One possible strategy is dual fueling using readily available resources. Propane and natural gas are readily available with the current infrastructure and biodiesel is growing in popularity as a renewable fuel. This paper presents experimental results from dual fuel combustion of methane (as a surrogate for natural gas) and propane as primary fuels with biodiesel pilots in a 1.9 liter, turbocharged, 4 cylinder diesel engine at 1800 rev/min. Experiments were performed with different percentage energy substitutions (PES) of propane and methane and at different brake mean effective pressures (BMEP/bmep). Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and emissions (NOx, HC, CO, CO2, O2 and smoke) were also measured. Maximum PES levels for B100-methane dual fuelling were limited to 70% at 2.5 bar bmep and 48% at 10 bar bmep, and corresponding values for B100-propane dual fuelling were 64% and 43%, respectively. Maximum PES was limited by misfire at 2.5 bar bmep and the onset of engine knock at 10 bar bmep. Dual fuel BTEs approached straight B100 values at 10 bar bmep while they were significantly lower than B100 values at 2.5 bar bmep.

And why do we think it's so important that this country, especially THIS part of the country, be leaders in the adoption of EVs? Is it that we all just happen to like driving polluting golf carts? The answer is that, like most everyone else, most of us here at PNNL drive to work every day, and like most people, we care about the cost of gasoline and the impact that burning imported oil has on the environment and on our foreign policy. The reality is that electric vehicles are simply more efficient, pollute much less, use locally-generated energy, and cost MUCH less to drive.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A comparison of injector flow and spray characteristics of biodiesel with petrodiesel.","Som, S; Longman, D E; Ramirez, A I; Aggarwal, S K","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; AERODYNAMICS; ATOMIZATION; BOILING; CAVITATION; COMBUSTION; COMPRESSION; CONES; EFFICIENCY; ENGINES; IGNITION; LOSS OF FLOW; NOZZLES; ORIFICES; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES; TURBULENCE; VAPOR PRESSURE; VAPORIZATION HEAT; VELOCITY; VISCOSITY","Performance and emission characteristics of compression ignition engines depend strongly on inner nozzle flow and spray behavior. These processes control the fuel air mixing, which in turn is critical for the combustion process. The differences in the physical properties of petrodiesel and biodiesel are expected to significantly alter the inner nozzle flow and spray structure and, thus, the performance and emission characteristics of the engine. In this study, the inner nozzle flow dynamics of these fuels are characterized by using the mixture-based cavitation model in FLUENT v6.3. Because of its lower vapor pressure, biodiesel was observed to cavitate less than petrodiesel. Higher viscosity of biodiesel resulted in loss of flow efficiency and reduction in injection velocity. Turbulence levels at the nozzle orifice exit were also lower for biodiesel. Using the recently developed KH-ACT model, which incorporates the effects of cavitation and turbulence in addition to aerodynamic breakup, the inner nozzle flow simulations are coupled with the spray simulations in a 'quasi-dynamic' fashion. Thus, the influence of inner nozzle flow differences on spray development of these fuels could be captured, in addition to the effects of their physical properties. Spray penetration was marginally higher for biodiesel, while cone angle was lower, which was attributed to its poor atomization characteristics. The computed liquid lengths of petrodiesel and biodiesel were compared with data from Sandia National Laboratories. Liquid lengths were higher for biodiesel due to its higher boiling temperature and heat of vaporization. Though the simulations captured this trend well, the liquid lengths were underpredicted, which was attributed to uncertainty about the properties of biodiesel used in the experiments. Parametric studies were performed to determine a single parameter that could be used to account for the observed differences in the fuel injection and spray behavior of petrodiesel and biodiesel; fuel temperature seems to be the best parameter to tune.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Particularly at low temperatures, fuel's high viscosity can prevent a pressure-swirl (or simplex) atomizer from sustaining a centrifugal-driven air core within the fuel injector. During disruption of the air core inside an injector, spray characteristics outside the nozzle reflect a highly unstable, nonlinear mode where air core length, Sauter mean diameter (SMD), cone angle, and discharge coefficient variability. To better understand injector performance, these characteristics of the pressure-swirl atomizer were experimentally investigated and data were correlated to Reynolds numbers (Re). Using a transparent acrylic nozzle, the air core length, SMD, cone angle, and discharge coefficient are observed as a function of Re. The critical Reynolds numbers that distinguish the transition from unstable mode to transitional mode and eventually to a stable mode are reported. The working fluids are diesel and a kerosene-based fuel, referred to as bunker-A.

A multi-component fuel synthesised from three pairs of components chosen to simulate light, medium and heavy fractions was seeded with one of three tracers, each chosen to co-evaporate with and thus follow one of the fractions, in order to account for differential volatility of such components in typical gasoline fuels. In order to make quantitative measurements of fuel-air ratio from PLIF images, initial calibration was by recording PLIF images of homogeneous fuel-air mixtures under similar conditions of in-cylinder temperature and pressure using a re-circulation loop and a motored engine. This calibration method was found to be affected by two significant factors. Firstly, calibration was affected by variation of signal collection efficiency arising from build-up of absorbing deposits on the windows during firing cycles, which are not present under motored conditions. Secondly, the effects of residual exhaust gas present in the firing engine were not accounted for using a calibration loop with a motored engine. In order to account for these factors a novel method of PLIF calibration is presented whereby 'bookend' calibration measurements for each tracer separately are performed under firing conditions, utilising injection into a large upstream heated plenum to promote the formation of homogeneous in-cylinder mixtures. These calibration datasets contain sufficient information to not only characterise the quantum efficiency of each tracer during a typical engine cycle, but also monitor imaging efficiency, and, importantly, account for the impact of exhaust gas residuals (EGR). By use of this method EGR is identified as a significant factor in quantitative PLIF for fuel mixing diagnostics in firing engines. The effects of cyclic variation in fuel concentration on burn rate are analysed for different fuel injection strategies. Finally, mixture distributions for late injection obtained using quantitative PLIF are compared to predictions of computational fluid dynamics calculations.

More specifically, the aim of this study was twofold: on one hand, to understand the effect of the multiple injection strategies on the indicated mean effective pressure; on the other hand, to contribute to the understanding of combustion stability characterized by the coefficient of variation of indicated mean effective pressure. The first objective was fulfilled by analyzing the rate of heat release obtained by in-cylinder pressure diagnosis. The results showed that the timing of the pilot injection closest to the main injection was the most influential parameter based on the behaviour of the rate of heat release (regardless of the multiple injection strategy applied). For the second objective, the combustion stability was found to be correlated with the combustion centroid angle. The results showed a trend between them and the existence of a range of centroid angles where the combustion stability is strong enough. In addition, it was also evident that convenient split injection allows shifting the centroid to such a zone and improves combustion stability after start.

This order corresponded with recent results in a pressurized flow reactor, where the preignition oxidation chemistry was monitored at temperatures of 600-800 K, 0.8 MPa pressure, and an equivalence ratio of 0.30, and where the preignition reactivity from highest to lowest was the 2:1:1, followed by the 1:1:1, and the JP-8.

The economic viability for such vehicles is contingent upon the availability of cost-effective batteries with high power and energy density. For initial commercial success, government subsidies will be highly instrumental in allowing PHEVs to gain a foothold. However, in the long-term, for electric vehicles to be commercially viable, the economics have to be self-sustaining. Towards the end of battery life in the vehicle, the energy capacity left in the battery is not sufficient to provide the designed range for the vehicle. Typically, the automotive manufacturers indicated the need for battery replacement when the remaining energy capacity reaches 70-80%. There is still sufficient power (kW) and energy capacity (kWh) left in the battery to support various grid ancillary services such as balancing, spinning reserve, load following services. As renewable energy penetration increases, the need for such balancing services is expected to increase. This work explores optimality for the replacement of transportation batteries to be subsequently used for grid services. This analysis maximizes the value of an electric vehicle battery to be used as a transportation battery (in its first life) and then as a resource for providing grid services (in its second life). The results are presented across a range of key parameters, such as depth of discharge (DOD), number of batteries used over the life of the vehicle, battery life in vehicle, battery state of health (SOH) at end of life in vehicle and ancillary services rate. The results provide valuable insights for the automotive industry into maximizing the utility and the value of the vehicle batteries in an effort to either reduce the selling price of EVs and PHEVs or maximize the profitability of the emerging electrification of transportation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Soot aggregates consist of 15-30 nm large individual particles exhibiting relatively mature internal nanostructures, however, far from being graphite. Ash aggregates largely accumulate at the outlet part of DPF1, while minor amounts are deposited directly on the channel walls all along the filter length. They consist of crystalline phases with individual particles of sizes down to the nanoscale range. Chemically, the ash consists mainly of Mg, S, Ca, Zn and P, elements encountered in lubricating oil additives. In the passenger car DPF2 (with fuel-borne additives), soot aggregates form an approximately 200-500 {mu}m thick, inhomogeneous porous cake consisting of several superposed layers corresponding to different soot generations. The largest part of the soot cake is composed of unburned, oriented soot aggregates left behind despite repeated regenerations, while a small part constitutes a loose layer with randomly oriented aggregates, which was deposited last and has not seen any regeneration. Fe-oxide particles of micro- to nano-scale sizes, originating from the fuel-borne additive, are often dispersed within the part of the soot cake composed of the unburned soot leftovers. The individual soot nanoparticles in DPF2 are approximately 15-40 nm large and generally less mature than in the truck DPF1. The presence of soot leftovers in DPF2 indicates that the addition of fuel-borne material does not fully compensate for the temperatures needed for complete soot removal. Ash in DPF2 is filling up more than half of the filter volume (at the downstream part) and is dominated by Fe-oxide aggregates, due to the Fe-based fuel-borne additive, but otherwise its chemical composition reflects compounds of lubricating oil additives.

The nanofluid prepared with calculated amount of oleic acid (surfactant) was tested to be stable for more than 80 days. The viscosity of the nanofluids is measured both as a function of alumina volume fraction and temperature between 10 and 50 C. While the pure base fluid display Newtonian behavior over the measured temperature, it transforms to a non-Newtonian fluid with addition of a small amount of alumina nanoparticles. Our results show that viscosity of the nanofluid increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration and decreases with increase in temperature. Most of the frequently used classical models severely under predict the measured viscosity. Volume fraction dependence of the nanofluid viscosity, however, is predicted fairly well on the basis of a recently reported theoretical model for nanofluids that takes into account the effect of Brownian motion of nanoparticles in the nanofluid. The temperature dependence of the viscosity of engine coolant based alumina nanofluids obeys the empirical correlation of the type: log ({mu}{sub nf}) = A exp(BT), proposed earlier by Namburu et al.

K.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; dual-fuel engines; low-temperature combustion; micropilot; natural gas; phenomenological model; pilot ignition; Shell ignition model","Detailed results from a multi-zone phenomenological simulation of partially premixed advanced-injection low-pilot-ignited natural-gas low-temperature combustion are presented with a focus on early injection timings (the beginning of (pilot) injection (BOI)) and very small diesel quantities (2-3 per cent of total fuel energy). Combining several aspects of diesel and spark ignition engine combustion models, the closed-cycle simulation accounted for diesel autoignition, diesel spray combustion, and natural-gas combustion by premixed turbulent flame propagation. The cylinder contents were divided into an unburned zone, several pilot fuel zones (or 'packets') that modelled diesel evaporation and ignition, a flame zone for natural-gas combustion, and a burned zone. The simulation predicted the onset of ignition, cylinder pressures, and heat release rate profiles satisfactorily over a wide range of BOIs (20-60° before top dead centre (before TDC)) but especially well at early BOIs. Strong coupling was observed between pilot spray combustion in the packets and premixed turbulent combustion in the flame zone and, therefore, the number of ignition centres (packets) profoundly affected flame combustion. The highest local peak temperatures (greater than 2000 K) were observed in the packets, while the flame zone was much cooler (about 1650 K), indicating that pilot diesel spray combustion is probably the dominant source of engine-out emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>). Further, the 60° before TDC BOI yielded the lowest average peak packet temperatures (about 1720 K) compared with the 20° before TDC BOI (about 2480 K) and 40° before TDC BOI (about 2700 K). These trends support experimental NO<sub>x</sub> trends, which showed the lowest NO<sub>x</sub> emissions for the 60°, 20°, and 40° before TDC BOIs in that order. Parametric studies showed that increasing the intake charge temperature, pilot quantity, and natural-gas equivalence ratio all led to higher peak heat release rates and hotter packets but the pilot quantity and intake temperature affected the potential for NO<sub>x</sub> formation to a greater extent.","SAGE","","Mississippi State Univ., Mississippi State, MS (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2010-09-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The model consists of the conservation equations for chemical species and energy in the bulk flow, energy of the solid walls, O2 storage and NOx storage (in the form of nitrites and nitrates). Nitrites and nitrates are formed by diffusion of NO and NO2, respectively, into sorbent particles (assumed to be hemi-spherical in shape) along with O2 and their formation rates are controlled by chemical kinetics as well as solid-phase diffusion rates of NOx species. The model also accounts for thermal aging and sulfation of LNTs. Empirical correlations are developed on the basis of published experimental data to capture these effects. These empirical correlations depend on total mileage for which the LNT has been in use, the mileage accumulated since the last desulfation event in addition to the freshly degreened catalyst characteristics. The model has been used in studies of vehicle systems (integration, performance etc.) including hybrid powertrain configurations. Since the engines in hybrid vehicles turn on and off multiple number of times during single drive cycles, the exhaust systems may encounter multiple cold start transients. Accurate modeling of catalyst warm-up and cooling is, therefore, very important to simulate LNT performance in such vehicles. For this purpose, the convective heat loss from the LNT to the ambient is modeled using a Nusselt number correlation that includes effects of both forced convection and natural convection (with later being important when vehicle is stationary). Using the model, the fuel penalty associated with operating LNTs on small diesel engine powered car during FTP drive cycles is estimated.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In particular, we report the rate constants for the reactions of HO{sub 2} with benzene and phenyl. The calculated reaction rate constant for the abstraction of H-C{sub 6}H{sub 5} by HO{sub 2} is found to be in good agreement with the limited experimental values. HO{sub 2} addition to benzene is found to be more important than direct abstraction. We show that the reactions of HO{sub 2} with the phenyl radical generate the propagating radical OH in a highly exoergic reaction. The results presented herein should be useful in modeling the oxidation of aromatic compounds at low temperatures.

Even though the formation of flame kernels in quiescent methane-air mixtures has been simulated numerically, the ignition mechanism has never been satisfactorily explained. This study investigated the spark ignition of methane-air mixtures through a numerical analysis using detailed chemical kinetics consisting of 53 species and 325 elementary reactions while considering the heat loss to the electrode. The simulation was used to investigate the quenching distance and the effects on the MIE of the electrode size, electrode gap distance, ignition duration, and equivalence ratio. The effect of the equivalence ratio on the ignition delay time was also examined. The simulated results showed the same trend as previous experimental results.

While the various phases of AlH{sub 3} have been investigated theoretically, there is a shortage of experimental studies corroborating the theoretical findings. In response to this, we present here an investigation of these compounds based primarily on two research areas in which there is the greatest scarcity of information in the literature, namely Raman and infrared (IR) absorption analysis. To the authors knowledge, this is the first report of experimental far-IR absorption results on these compounds. Two different samples prepared by broadly similar ethereal reactions of AlCl{sub 3} with LiAlH{sub 4} were analyzed. Both Raman and IR absorption measurements indicate that one sample is purely {gamma}-AlH{sub 3} and that the other is a mixture of {alpha}-, {beta}-, and {gamma}-AlH{sub 3} phases. X-ray diffraction confirms the spectroscopic findings, most notably for the {beta}-AlH{sub 3} phase, for which optical spectroscopic data are reported here for the first time.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

These show mixed results; sometimes spark is effective at controlling heat release timing, sometimes it only stabilizes combustion, and sometimes it has no effect at all. In order to help understand the spark assisted process we propose a multi-mode combustion diagram to delineate the regimes of spark ignition, flame propagation, compression ignition, knocking combustion and spark-assisted combustion, in terms of unburned and burned gas temperatures near top dead center. An analysis of existing experimental data suggests that the effectiveness of spark assist is best at higher and middle loads and decreases as load is reduced.

In the present study, we examine the effects of primary breakup modeling on the spray and combustion characteristics under diesel engine conditions. The commonly used KH model, which considers the aerodynamically induced breakup based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, is modified to include the effects of cavitation and turbulence generated inside the injector. The KH model and the new (KH-ACT) model are extensively evaluated by performing 3-D time-dependent simulations with detailed chemistry under diesel engine conditions. Results indicate that the inclusion of cavitation and turbulence enhances primary breakup, leading to smaller droplet sizes, decrease in liquid penetration, and increase in the radial dispersion of spray. Predictions are compared with measurements for non-evaporating and evaporating sprays, as well as with flame measurements. While both the models are able to reproduce the experimentally observed global spray and combustion characteristics, predictions using the KH-ACT model exhibit closer agreement with measurements in terms of liquid penetration, cone angle, spray axial velocity, and liquid mass distribution for non-evaporating sprays. Similarly, the KH-ACT model leads to better agreement with respect to the liquid length and vapor penetration distance for evaporating sprays, and with respect to the flame lift-off location for combusting sprays. The improved agreement is attributed to the ability of the new model to account for the effects of turbulence and cavitation generated inside the injector, which enhance the primary breakup. Results further indicate that the combustion under diesel engine conditions is characterized by a double-flame structure with a rich premixed reaction zone near the flame stabilization region and a non-premixed reaction zone further downstream. This flame structure is consistent with the Dec's model for diesel engine combustion (Dec, 1997), and well captured by a newly developed flame index based on the scalar product of CO and O{sub 2} mass fraction gradients.

Most previous methods studied soot oxidation with NO2 using offline methods such as thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). In this study, the online aerosol-technique of high-temperature oxidation tandem differential mobility analysis (HTO-TDMA) is used to study kinetics of soot oxidation with NO2 under N2 environment. This method has significant advantages over previous offline methods in reducing heat and mass transfer diffusion limitations to the soot surface. Soot particles are exposed to varying temperature and NO2 concentration inside the furnace resulting from thermal decomposition of NO2 to NO. This causes soot oxidation rates to vary throughout the furnace. In this study, variations in temperatures, NO2 concentrations and particle residence times are thoroughly accounted for the first time, and soot oxidation rates are derived. Soot oxidation rate is calculated as a function of Arrhenius rate constant Asoot, activation energy Esoot, and partial pressure of NO2 PNO2 within the furnace at temperatures ranging 500- 950 C. Results suggest Asoot and Esoot values for soot oxidation with NO2 of 1.68 nm K-0.5 s-1 (Nm-2)-n and 46.5 kJ mol-1 respectively. The activation energy for soot oxidation with NO2 is significantly lower than oxidation with air. However, ppm levels of NO2 cause soot oxidation at low temperatures suggesting NO2 is a stronger oxidant than O2. This study also shows that a semi-empirical approach with just a few kinetic parameters could represent varying soot oxidation rates in a diesel engine cylinder or on a diesel particulate filter. Further studies should be directed towards understanding synergistic effects of other oxidants as O2 and H2O in addition to NO2 using the HTO-TDMA method.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We use an electric power system model to explicitly evaluate the change in generator dispatches resulting from PHEV deployment in the Texas grid, and apply fixed and non-parametric estimates of generator emissions rates, to estimate the resulting changes in generation emissions. Here, we find that by using the flexibility of when vehicles may be charged, generator efficiency can be increased substantially. By changing generator dispatch, a PHEV fleet of up to 15% of light-duty vehicles can actually decrease net generator NO<sub>x</sub> emissions during the ozone season, despite the additional charging load. By adding V2G services, such as spinning reserves and energy storage, CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions can be reduced even further.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results are discussed to elucidate physical phenomena in the combustion chambers. Then, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to the acquired images. The coefficients of the orthogonal modes are then used for the analysis of cycle variability, along with data of dynamic in-cylinder pressure and rate of heat release. The advantage is that statistical analysis can be run on a small number of scalar coefficients rather than on the full data set of pixel luminosity values. Statistics of the POD coefficients provide information on cycle variations of the luminosity field. POD modes are then discriminated by means of normality tests, to separate the mean from the coherent and the incoherent parts of the fluctuation of the luminosity field, in a non-truncated representation of the data. The morphology of the fluctuation components can finally be reconstructed by grouping coherent and incoherent modes. The structure of the incoherent component of the fluctuation is consistent with the underlying turbulent field.

When using air as the oxidant, two oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratios of 13 and 19 are investigated. To achieve higher compressed temperatures for fuel lean mixtures (equivalence ratio of {proportional_to}0.42), argon dilution is also used and the corresponding oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio is 84.9. For the conditions studied, experimental results show two-stage ignition characteristics for both Jet-A and JP-8. Variations of both the first-stage and overall ignition delays with compressed temperature, compressed pressure, and equivalence ratio are reported and correlated. It is noted that the negative temperature coefficient phenomenon becomes more prominent at relatively lower pressures. Furthermore, the first-stage-ignition delay is found to be less sensitive to changes in equivalence ratio and primarily dependent on temperature.

Rape seed methyl ester was used and tests with several injection pressures were performed. OH and HCO radical were detected and their evolutions were analyzed during the whole combustion. Moreover, soot concentration was measured by means the two colour pyrometry method. The reduction of particulate emission with biodiesel as compared to the diesel fuel was noted. Moreover, this effect resulted higher increasing the injection pressure. In the case of RME the oxidation of soot depends mainly from O{sub 2} content of fuel and OH is responsible of the NO formation in the chamber as it was observed for NO{sub x} exhaust emission. Moreover, it was investigated the evolution of HCO and CO into the cylinder. HCO was detected at the start of combustion. During the combustion, HCO oxidizes due to the increasing temperature and it produces CO. Both fuels have similar trend, the highest concentrations are detected for low injection pressure.

Phase Doppler Anemometry was also used to measure droplet sizes in the core of one of the spray plumes, 25 mm below the injector tip. To study the effect of fuel properties on vaporisation and mixture preparation under realistic operating conditions, a separate set of experiments was carried out in a direct-injection spark-ignition optical engine. The engine was run at 1500 RPM under cold and fully warmed-up conditions (20 C and 90 C) at part load and full load (0.5 and 1.0 bar intake pressure). Floodlit laser Mie-scattering images of the sprays on two orthogonal planes corresponding to the swirl and tumble planes of in-cylinder flow motion were acquired to study the full injection event and post-injection mixing stage. These were used to make comparisons with the static chamber sprays and to quantify the liquid-to-vapour phase evaporation process for both fuels by calculating the projected 'footprint' of the sprays at different conditions. Analysis of the macroscopic structure and turbulent primary break-up properties of the sprays was undertaken in light of jet exit conditions described in terms of non-dimensional numbers. The effects on stoichiometric combustion were investigated by imaging the natural flame chemiluminescence through the engine's piston crown (swirl plane) and by post-processing to derive flame growth rates and trajectories of flame motion.

We use an electric power system model to explicitly evaluate the change in generator dispatches resulting from PHEV deployment in the Texas grid, and apply fixed and non-parametric estimates of generator emissions rates, to estimate the resulting changes in generation emissions. We find that by using the flexibility of when vehicles may be charged, generator efficiency can be increased substantially. By changing generator dispatch, a PHEV fleet of up to 15% of light-duty vehicles can actually decrease net generator NO{sub x} emissions during the ozone season, despite the additional charging load.

"Investigation of nozzle flow and cavitation characteristics in a diesel injector.","Som, S; Ramirez, A; Aggarwal, S; El-Hannouny, E; Longman, D; Energy Systems; Univ. of Illinois","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; BOUNDARY CONDITIONS; CAVITATION; DIESEL ENGINES; DIESEL FUELS; ELEVATORS; MIXTURES; NOZZLES; ORIFICES; PRESSURE GRADIENTS; SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; TWO-PHASE FLOW; VELOCITY","Cavitation and turbulence inside a diesel injector play a critical role in primary spray breakup and development processes. The study of cavitation in realistic injectors is challenging, both theoretically and experimentally, since the associated two-phase flow field is turbulent and highly complex, characterized by large pressure gradients and small orifice geometries. We report herein a computational investigation of the internal nozzle flow and cavitation characteristics in a diesel injector. A mixture based model in FLUENT V6.2 software is employed for simulations. In addition, a new criterion for cavitation inception based on the total stress is implemented, and its effectiveness in predicting cavitation is evaluated. Results indicate that under realistic diesel engine conditions, cavitation patterns inside the orifice are influenced by the new cavitation criterion. Simulations are validated using the available two-phase nozzle flow data and the rate of injection measurements at various injection pressures (800-1600 bar) from the present study. The computational model is then used to characterize the effects of important injector parameters on the internal nozzle flow and cavitation behavior, as well as on flow properties at the nozzle exit. The parameters include injection pressure, needle lift position, and fuel type. The propensity of cavitation for different on-fleet diesel fuels is compared with that for n-dodecane, a diesel fuel surrogate. Results indicate that the cavitation characteristics of n-dodecane are significantly different from those of the other three fuels investigated. The effect of needle movement on cavitation is investigated by performing simulations at different needle lift positions. Cavitation patterns are seen to shift dramatically as the needle lift position is changed during an injection event. The region of significant cavitation shifts from top of the orifice to bottom of the orifice as the needle position is changed from fully open (0.275 mm) to nearly closed (0.1 mm), and this behavior can be attributed to the effect of needle position on flow patterns upstream of the orifice. The results demonstrate the capability of the cavitation model to predict cavitating nozzle flows in realistic diesel injectors and provide boundary conditions, in terms of vapor fraction, velocity, and turbulence parameters at the nozzle exit, which can be coupled with the primary breakup simulation.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In this paper, segments from a commercial piston/cylinder system were tribologically tested using reciprocating motion. The tribological contact consisted of aluminium alloy piston segments, either uncoated, coated with a graphite/resin coating, or an amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C : H) coating, in contact with gray cast iron liner segments. Tests were conducted in commercial synthetic motor oils and base stocks at temperatures up to 120 C with a 2 cm stroke length at reciprocating speeds up to 0.15 m s{sup -1}. The friction dependence of these piston skirt and cylinder liner materials was studied as a function of load, sliding speed and temperature. Specifically, an increase in the sliding speed led to a decrease in the friction coefficient below approximately 70 C, while above this temperature, an increase in sliding speed led to an increase in the friction coefficient. The presence of a coating played an important role. It was found that the graphite/resin coating wore quickly, preventing the formation of a beneficial tribochemical film, while the a-C : H coating exhibited a low friction coefficient and provided significant improvement over the uncoated samples. The effect of additives in the oils was also studied. The tribological behaviour of the interface was explained based on viscosity effects and subsequent changes in the lubrication regime, formation of chemical and tribochemical films.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Based on the evaluation, a new equation for the liquid film thickness inside the swirl injectors was introduced. A direct photography using two real scale transparent nozzles and a pulsed light source was employed to measure the liquid film thickness inside the swirl injectors. The error in the liquid film thickness measurement, generated from different refractive indices among transparent nozzle, fuel and air, was estimated and corrected based on the geometric optics. Two injectors which have different nozzle diameter and nozzle length were applied to introduce a more general empirical equation for the liquid film thickness inside the pressure swirl injectors. The results showed that the liquid film thickness remains constant at the injection pressures for direct injection gasoline engines while the ratio of nozzle length to nozzle diameter (L/D) shows significant effect on the liquid film thickness. The previously introduced analytical and empirical equations for relatively low injection pressure swirl injectors overestimated the effect of injection pressure at the operating range of high pressure swirl injectors and, in addition, the effect of L/D ratio and swirler geometry was rarely considered. A new empirical equation was suggested based on the experimental results by taking into account the effects of fuel properties, nozzle diameter, nozzle length and swirler geometry.

One of the most important processes affecting these parameters is heat transfer from the in-cylinder gas to the surrounding walls, as this mechanism has a direct influence on the combustion process. Regarding the different walls (liner, cylinder head and piston surfaces), heat flow to the piston is especially important, as it is essential to avoid excessively high temperatures that could result in material damage and/or oil cracking. With this purpose different cooling strategies are used, among which the improvement of the piston cooling system by using oil galleries is preferred. In this work, the heat flow through the oil gallery in a Diesel piston was investigated on a dedicated test bench. This bench consists of a controlled heat source and a piston oil cooling system in which different test conditions were evaluated in order to obtain a correlation for the film coefficient associated with piston oil cooling. These experimental results were then incorporated into a lumped model for engine heat transfer. Finally, in order to evaluate the accuracy of this model and the effects of the correlation for oil gallery coefficient on engine heat flows, results obtained on a conventional engine test bench equipped with a Diesel engine, in which two piston temperatures had been measured, were used. The results show an improvement in piston temperature predictions when compared with those obtained using a previously reported expression for the calculation of the oil film coefficient.

Also these phenomena influence the cylinder pressure and temperature and the charge amount during a cycle. The study and validation of a sub-model for these phenomena in the absence of engine combustion deducts all effects arisen from the combustion event. During the current study, blowby sub-model and gas flow through crevices under motoring conditions has been noticed using a volume-orifice theory and the experimental results measured from a research engine. Blowby geometric parameters, consisting of a few critical cross-section areas (orifice areas) and volumes (top land and inter-ring crevice volumes), were measured in ambient temperature and corrected for hot running conditions. The cylinder pressure during cycle was measured by a piezoelectric pressure transducer and the low pressure parts of the cycle were measured using a piezoresistive pressure transducer for referencing purposes. The obtained results show a very good agreement between experimentally measured pressure data and model output for three compression ratios of 7.6, 10.2, 12.4 and three engine speeds of 750, 1500 and 2000 rpm, so that the maximum deviation was almost 5%. The model predicted that the maximum mass loss increased with increase of compression ratio and decreased with increase of engine speed. Also the peak mass loss position happened within the range of 3-9 CA after top dead center. After occurrence of the maximum loss, a reverse flow from the top land crevice into the cylinder was predicted in the model.

The novelty of the engine lies in the cylinder head that contains multiple check valves that control scavenging airflow into the cylinder from a supercharged air plenum. When the cylinder pressure drops below the intake plenum pressure during the expansion stroke, air flows into the cylinder through the check valves. During compression the cylinder pressure increases to a level above the intake plenum pressure and the check valves close preventing back-flow into the intake plenum. The engine head design provides asymmetrical intake valve timing without the use of poppet valves and the associated valve-train. In combination with an external Roots-type supercharger that supplies the plenum and exhaust ports at the bottom of the cylinder wall, the novel head provides top-down uniflow air scavenging. Motoring tests indicated that the check valves seal and the peak pressure is governed by the compression ratio. The only drawback observed is that valve closing is delayed as the engine speed increases. In order to investigate the valve dynamics, additional tests were performed in an optically-accessible cold flow test rig that enabled the direct measurement of valve opening and closing time under various conditions.

The horizontal airflow direction was perpendicular to the vertical axis of the injection spray. The results show that, as air velocity increases, the film shape turns from a circle to an oblong. As wall temperature increases, the film area shrinks. Film thickness decreases as wall temperature or air velocity increases. The boiling point of the fuel is an important temperature to affect the film area and the film thickness. Film center moves more far away in the downstream direction as air velocity increases. For a certain air velocity, film center moves less far away as wall temperature increases.

A Ag-based, fast regenerable SO2 absorbent has been developed and will be described. Over a temperature range of 300oC to 550oC, it absorbs almost all of the SO2 in the simulated exhaust gases during the lean cycles and can be fully regenerated by the short rich cycles at the same temperature. Its composition has been optimized as 1 wt% Pt-5wt%Ag-SiO2, and the preferred silica source for the supporting material has been identified as inert Cabosil fumed silica. The thermal instability of Ag2O under fuel-lean conditions at 230oC and above makes it possible to fast regenerate the sulfur-loaded absorbent during the following fuel-rich cycles. Pt catalyst helps reducing Ag2SO4 during rich cycles at low temperatures. And the chemically inert fumed SiO2 support gives the absorbent long term stability. This absorbent shows great potential to work under the same lean-rich cycling conditions as those imposed on the NOx traps, and thus, can protect the downstream particulate filter and the NOx trap from sulfur poisoning.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

As such, the spatio-temporal distribution of formaldehyde is an informative parameter in the study of the ignition event in internal combustion engines, especially for new combustion modes like homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI). This paper presents quantitative data on the CH{sub 2}O distribution around diesel and n-heptane fuel sprays in the combustion chamber of a commercial heavy-duty diesel engine. Excitation of the 4{sub 0}{sup 1} band (355 nm) as well as the 4{sub 0}{sup 1}2{sub 0}{sup 1} band (339 nm) is applied. We use quantitative, spectrally resolved laser-induced fluorescence, calibrated by means of formalin seeding, to distinguish the contribution from CH{sub 2}O to the signal from those of other species formed early in the combustion. Typically, between 40% and 100% of the fluorescence in the wavelength range considered characteristic for formaldehyde is in fact due to other species, but the latter are also related to the early combustion. Numerical simulation of a homogeneous reactor of n-heptane and air yields concentrations that are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. Formaldehyde starts to be formed at about 2 CA (crank angle degrees) before the rise in main heat release. There appears to be a rather localised CH{sub 2}O formation zone relatively close to the injector, out of which formaldehyde is transported downstream by the fuel jet. Once the hot combustion sets in, formaldehyde quickly disappears.

The placement of the gate driver circuit next to the power switch is optimal for minimizing system complexity. Successful operation of the gate driver circuit in a harsh environment, especially with minimal or no heat sink and without liquid cooling, can increase the power-to-volume ratio as well as the power-to-weight ratio for power conversion modules such as a DC-DC converter, inverter etc. A silicon-on-insulator (SOI)-based high-voltage, high-temperature integrated circuit (IC) gate driver for SiC power FETs has been designed and fabricated using a commercially available 0.8-m, 2-poly and 3-metal bipolar-complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-double diffused metal oxide semiconductor (DMOS) process. The prototype circuit-s maximum gate drive supply can be 40-V with peak 2.3-A sourcing/sinking current driving capability. Owing to the wide driving range, this gate driver IC can be used to drive a wide variety of SiC FET switches (both normally OFF metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and normally ON junction field effect transistor (JFET)). The switching frequency is 20-kHz and the duty cycle can be varied from 0 to 100-. The circuit has been successfully tested with SiC power MOSFETs and JFETs without any heat sink and cooling mechanism.

However, these combustion strategies often generate higher carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. In addition, aldehydes and ketone emissions can increase in these modes. In this study, the engine-out emissions of a compression-ignition engine operating in a fuel reactivity- controlled PCCI combustion mode using in-cylinder blending of gasoline and diesel fuel have been characterized. The work was performed on a 1.9-liter, 4-cylinder diesel engine outfitted with a port fuel injection system to deliver gasoline to the engine. The engine was operated at 2300 rpm and 4.2 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) with the ratio of gasoline to diesel fuel that gave the highest engine efficiency and lowest emissions. Engine-out emissions for aldehydes, ketones and PM were compared with emissions from conventional diesel combustion. Sampling and analysis was carried out following micro-tunnel dilution of the exhaust. Particle geometric mean diameter, number-size distribution, and total number concentration were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). For the particle mass measurements, samples were collected on Teflon-coated quartz-fiber filters and analyzed gravimetrically. Gaseous aldehydes and ketones were sampled using dinitrophenylhydrazine-coated solid phase extraction cartridges and the extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). In addition, emissions after a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) were also measured to investigate the destruction of CO, HC and formaldehydes by the catalyst.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

One way to increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines is to run them 'lean,' in the presence of more air than needed to burn all of the fuel. It may seem strange that engines are usually designed to run with fuel and air at stoichiometric balance, or even fuel rich. However, the way emissions have been controlled with catalytic converters has required some unburned fuel in the exhaust, especially for controlling the nitrogen oxide pollutants NO and NO{sub 2} (called NO{sub x}). On page 1624 of this issue, Kim et al. (1) report encouraging results for catalysts that can process NO{sub x} in lean-burn engines. These perovskite oxide catalysts may help reduce or even eliminate the need for expensive and scarce platinum group metals (PGMs) in emission control catalysts.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Understanding the technical status, potential, and tradeoffs is necessary to properly allocate research and development (R&amp;D) funding. In this paper, levelized delivered hydrogen costs, pathway energy use, and well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use and emissions are reported for multiple hydrogen production, delivery, and distribution pathways. Technologies analyzed include both central and distributed reforming of natural gas and electrolysis of water, and central hydrogen production from biomass and coal. Delivery options analyzed include trucks carrying liquid hydrogen and pipelines carrying gaseous hydrogen. Projected costs, energy use, and emissions for current technologies (technology that has been developed to at least the bench-scale, extrapolated to commercial-scale) are reported. Results compare favorably with those for gasoline, diesel, and E85 used in current internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, gasoline hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and flexible fuel vehicles. Sensitivities of pathway cost, pathway energy use, WTW energy use, and WTW emissions to important primary parameters were examined as an aid in understanding the benefits of various options. Sensitivity studies on production process energy efficiency, total production process capital investment, feed stock cost, production facility operating capacity, electricity grid mix, hydrogen vehicle market penetration, distance from the hydrogen production facility to city gate, and other parameters are reported. The Hydrogen Macro-System Model (MSM) was used for this analysis. The MSM estimates the cost, energy use, and emissions trade offs of various hydrogen production, delivery, and distribution pathways under consideration. The MSM links the H2A Production Model, the Hydrogen Delivery Scenario Analysis Model (HDSAM), and the Greenhouse Gas, Regulated Emission, and Energy for Transportation (GREET) Model. The MSM utilizes the capabilities of each component model and ensures the use of consistent parameters between the models to enable analysis of full hydrogen production, delivery, and distribution pathways. To better understand spatial aspects of hydrogen pathways, the MSM is linked to the Hydrogen Demand and Resource Analysis Tool (HyDRA). The MSM is available to the public and enables users to analyze the pathways and complete sensitivity analyses.","New York, NY: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The control of elevated-temperature friction and wear is important for applications like internal combustion engines, aerospace propulsion systems, and metalworking equipment. The progression of interacting, often synergistic processes produces surface deformation, subsurface damage accumulation, the formation of tribolayers, and the creation of free particles. Reaction products, particularly oxides, play a primary role in debris formation and microstructural evolution. Chemical reactions are known to be influenced by the energetic state of the exposed surfaces, and that surface energy is in turn affected by localized deformation and fracture. At relatively low temperatures, work-hardening can occur beneath tribo-contacts, but exposure to high temperatures can modify the resultant defect density and grain structure to affect the mechanisms of re-oxidation. As research by others has shown, the rate of wear at elevated temperatures can either be enhanced or reduced, depending on contact conditions and nature of oxide layer formation. Furthermore, the thermodynamic driving force for certain chemical reactions is moderated by kinetics and microstructure. The role of deformation, oxidation, and tribo-corrosion in the elevated temperature tribology of metallic alloys will be exemplified by three examples involving sliding wear, single-point abrasion, and repetitive impact plus slip.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The oxidation reactivity of the samples was characterized in a laboratory reactor, and BET surface area measurements were made at several points during oxidation of the fixed carbon component of both types of particulate. The fixed carbon component of biodiesel particulate has a significantly higher surface area for the initial stages of oxidation, but the surface areas for the two particulates become similar as fixed carbon oxidation proceeds beyond 40%. When fixed carbon oxidation rates are normalized to total surface area, it is possible to describe the oxidation rates of the fixed carbon portion of both types of particulates with a single set of Arrhenius parameters. The measured surface area evolution during particle oxidation was found to be inconsistent with shrinking sphere oxidation. When the oxidation model for the fixed carbon was combined with a first-order model for the release and oxidation of volatiles, it was possible to obtain good agreement with the observed oxidation rates for both types of nascent (non-devolatilized) particulates. Additional studies are underway to confirm that intermediate fuel blends behave consistently with these limiting cases.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Prior to the awarding of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.S. Congress passed the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA 2007) which contained specific goals for the use of renewable fuels (36 billion gallons by 2022) and more efficient engines (55% peak efficiency for diesels by 2013.) The IPCC goals are longer term but extremely challenging; reduce all GHG emissions to 80% of 1990 base levels by 2050. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will play primary roles in meeting both the EISA and IPCC goals. DOE has increased fuel efficiency, through research on efficiency and enabling technologies as well as developing and promoting renewable fuels in research and demonstration activities. These activities ultimately will reduce GHG emissions from transportation, particularly fossil-derived CO2, through fuel savings.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

For ethanol and isooctane, the estimated second law efficiency increases for constant volume reforming are 9 and 11%, respectively. The second law efficiency improvements from TCR result primarily from the higher intrinsic exergy of the reformed fuel and pressure boost associated with the gas mole increase.

A single cylinder gasoline engine equipped with direct fuel injection and fully variable hydraulic valve actuation (HVA) is used for this experimental study. The HVA system enables negative valve overlap (NVO) valve timing for hot internal EGR. Spark-assist stabilizes combustion over a wide range of engine speeds and loads, and allows for stoichiometric operation at all conditions. Characteristics of both spark-ignited combustion and HCCI are present, with combustion analysis showing a distinctive spark ignited phase of combustion, followed by a much more rapid HCCI combustion phase. At high load, the maximum pressure rise rate is controlled by a combination of spark timing and retarding the intake valve closing angle. The latter reduces the effective compression ratio, and therefore the compressive temperatures, allowing the high load limit of the operating range to be expanded. The SA-HCCI operating strategy exhibits improved thermal efficiency at most operating conditions, with fuel consumption improvements up to 9% realized at light engine loads. The SA-HCCI operating strategy presented here does not provide an efficiency advantage at all operating points compared to SI combustion; a decrease was observed at the highest speed and at loads above 500 kPa net IMEP. At light engine loads the majority of the heat release takes place during the HCCI phase of the heat release, and as such the NOx emissions are very low and are similar to levels observed in pure HCCI. At higher loads, a larger portion of the heat release takes place during the spark ignited phase of combustion, which produces NOx emissions that are much higher than is typically associated with HCCI, but still represent a decrease from conventional SI combustion. By limiting the fuel/air mixture to stoichiometric conditions, the higher NOx emissions do not represent an implementation barrier to this strategy because compatibility is maintained with very effective conventional 3-way catalysts.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Cyclic aging is performed at SCR inlet temperatures of 650, 750 and 850 degrees C for up to 50 aging cycles. To assess the validity of the implemented accelerated thermal aging protocol, a field-aged SCR catalyst of similar formulation was also evaluated. The monoliths were cut into sections and evaluated for NO{sub x} performance in a bench-flow reactor. While the rear section of both the field-aged and the accelerated engine-aged SCR catalysts maintained high NO{sub x}conversion, 75-80% at 400 degrees C, the front section exhibited a drastic decrease to only 20-35% at 400 degrees C. This two-tiered deactivation was also observed for field-aged samples that were analyzed in this study. To understand the observed performance changes, thorough materials characterization was performed which revealed two primary degradation mechanisms. The first mechanism is a general Fe-zeolite deterioration which led to surface area losses, dealumination of the zeolite, and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} crystal growth. This degradation accelerated above 750 degrees C, and the effects were generally more severe in the front of the catalyst. The second deactivation mechanism is linked to trace levels of Pt that are suspected to be volatizing from the DOC and depositing on the front section of the SCR catalyst. Chemical evidence of this can be seen in the high levels of NH{sub 3} oxidation (80% conversion at 400 degrees C), which coincides with the decrease in performance.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In the present study, Rietveld refinement of variable-temperature XRD synchrotron data obtained for Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SSZ-16 is used to investigate the location of copper cations in the zeolite pores and the effect of temperature on these sites and on framework stability. The XRD patterns show that the thermal stability of SSZ-13 is increased significantly when copper is exchanged into the framework compared with the acid form of the zeolite, H-SSZ-13. Cu-SSZ-13 is also more thermally stable than Cu-SSZ-16. From the refined diffraction patterns, the atomic positions of atoms, copper locations and occupancies, and thermal displacement parameters were determined as a function of temperature for both zeolites.

For the particle mass measurements, filter samples were collected for gravimetric analysis with a partial flow sampling system, which sampled proportionally to the exhaust flow. Total number concentration and number-size distributions were measured by a condensation particle counter and scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. The results of the evaluation show that the number concentration emissions decreased as the DPF became loaded with soot. However after soot removal by regeneration, the number concentration emissions were approximately 20 times greater, which suggests the importance of the soot layer in helping to trap particles. Contrary to the number concentration results, particle mass emissions decreased from 6 1 mg/hp-hr before regeneration to 3 2 mg/hp-hr after regeneration. This indicates that nanoparticles with diameter less than 50 nm may have been emitted after regeneration since these particles contribute little to the total mass. Overall, average particle emission reductions of 95% by mass and 10,000-fold by number concentration after four years of use provided evidence of the durability of a field-aged DPF.

In the present study of a variety of premixtures, with different functional relationships, such gradients comprise fixed initial temperature gradients. The smaller is the ratio of the acoustic speed through the mixture to the localised velocity of the autoignitive front, the greater are the amplitude and frequency of the induced pressure wave. This might lead to damaging engine knock. At higher values of the ratio, the autoignition can be benign with only small over-pressures. This approach to the effects of autoignition is confirmed by its application to a variety of experimental studies involving: (i)Imposed temperature gradients in a rapid compression and expansion machine. (ii)Onset of knock in an engine with advancing spark timing. (iii)Development of autoignition at a single hot spot in an engine. (iv)Autoignition fronts initiated by several hot spots. There is much diversity in the effects that can be produced by different fuels in different ranges of temperature and pressure. Higher values of autoignitive propagation speeds lead to increasingly severe engine knock. Such effects cannot always be predicted from the Research and Motor octane numbers.

Taking a prominent place in these strategic plans is hydrogen as a future energy carrier. A number of manufacturers are now leasing demonstration vehicles to consumers using hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines (H{sub 2}ICEs) as well as fuel cell vehicles. Developing countries in particular are pushing for H{sub 2}ICEs (powering two- and three-wheelers as well as passenger cars and buses) to decrease local pollution at an affordable cost. This article offers a comprehensive overview of H{sub 2}ICEs. Topics that are discussed include fundamentals of the combustion of hydrogen, details on the different mixture formation strategies and their emissions characteristics, measures to convert existing vehicles, dedicated hydrogen engine features, a state of the art on increasing power output and efficiency while controlling emissions and modeling.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Although standard compressor flowcharts are used for the selection of those machines for a given application, on-engine conditions widely differ from steady flow conditions, thus affecting compressor behaviour and consequently surge phenomenon. In this paper the effect of pulsating flow is investigated by means of a steady gas-stand that has been modified to produce engine-like pulsating flow. The effect of pressure pulses' amplitude and frequency on the compressor surge line location has been checked. Results show that pulsating flow in the 40-67 Hz range (corresponding to characteristic pulsation when boosting an internal combustion engine) increases surge margin. This increased margin is similar for all the tested frequencies but depends on pulsation amplitude. In a further step, a non-steady compressor model is used for modelling the tests, thus allowing a deeper analysis of the involved phenomena. Model results widely agree with experimental results.

By XRD analysis, the catalyst was shown to be of spinel structure. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and Constant Temperature Oxidation (CTO) at 673 K show that the presence of O{sub 2} decreases the ignition temperature of soot, and it enhances the conversion of NO{sub x} to N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O. The kinetic features of soot oxidation in the TPO test are similar to that in the TG-DTA analysis. Analysis by Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Infrared Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) indicates that the nitrates formed from NO{sub x} adsorption and the C(O) intermediates from soot oxidation are the key precursors of the redox process between soot and NO{sub x} over surfaces of the BaAl{sub 2}O{sub 4} catalyst. Moreover, DRIFTS tests suggest that nitrates act as the principal oxidants for C(O) oxidation, through which nitrates are reduced to N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O. The O{sub 2} in the gas mixture presents a positive effect on the conversion of NO{sub x} to N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O by promoting the oxidation of nitrites into nitrates species.

It is also a candidate branched alkane representative in surrogate mixtures for diesel and jet fuels. Here new experiments and kinetic modeling results are presented for the autoignition of iso-cetane at elevated temperatures and pressures relevant to combustion in internal combustion engines. Ignition delay time measurements were made in reflected shock experiments in a heated shock tube for {phi} = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 iso-cetane/air mixtures at temperatures ranging from 879 to 1347 K and pressures from 8 to 47 atm. Ignition delay times were measured using electronically excited OH emission, monitored through the shock tube end wall, and piezoelectric pressure transducer measurements, made at side wall locations. A new kinetic mechanism for the description of the oxidation of iso-cetane is presented that is developed based on a previous mechanism for iso-octane. Computed results from the mechanism are found in good agreement with the experimental measurements. To our knowledge, the ignition time measurements for iso-cetane presented here are the first of their kind.

Three different diesel combustion modes are studied: conventional non-diluted high-temperature combustion (HTC) with either (1) short or (2) long ignition delay, and (3) highly diluted low-temperature combustion (LTC) with early fuel injection. For the short ignition delay HTC condition, the OH fluorescence images show that second-stage combustion occurs mainly on the fuel jet periphery in a thickness of about 1 mm. For the long ignition delay HTC condition, the second-stage combustion zone on the jet periphery is thicker (5-6 mm). For the early-injection LTC condition, the second-stage combustion is even thicker (20-25 mm) and occurs only in the down-stream regions of the jet. The relationship between OH concentration and OH-PLIF intensity over a range of equivalence ratios is estimated from quenching calculations using collider species concentrations predicted by chemical kinetics simulations of combustion. The calculations show that both OH concentration and OH-PLIF intensity peak near stoichiometric mixtures and fall by an order of magnitude or more for equivalence ratios less than 0.2-0.4 and greater than 1.4-1.6. Using the OH fluorescence quenching predictions together with OH-PLIF images, quantitative boundaries for mixing are established for the three engine combustion modes.

The combustion modeling combines an Eulerian model derived from the RANS AKTIM model that mimics the spark ignition and the Extended Coherent Flame Model (ECFM-LES) that describes the flame propagation. The motion of piston and valves is accounted for using an Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian (ALE) technique with body-fitted meshes. The computation covers nine consecutive complete four-stroke cycles following an initialization cycle. The obtained LES results are compared with experimental measurements. Although the number of computed cycles is fairly low, LES is shown to be able to reproduce both quantitatively and qualitatively the cyclic variability observed experimentally. The investigation of the possible causes of variability illustrates the unprecedented possibility LES offers for understanding cycle-to-cycle variations.

Conditions were chosen to ensure that all three flames were non-sooting, with identical temperature profiles and stoichiometric mixture fraction, through a judicious selection of feed stream composition and strain rate. The experimental dataset provides a glimpse of the pyrolysis and oxidation behavior of jet fuel in a diffusion flame. The jet fuel initial oxidation is consistent with anticipated chemical kinetic behavior, based on thermal decomposition of large alkanes to smaller and smaller fragments and the survival of ring-stabilized aromatics at higher temperatures. The 6-component surrogate captures the same trend correctly, but the agreement is not quantitative with respect to some of the aromatics such as benzene and toluene. Various alkanes, alkenes and aromatics among the jet fuel components are either only qualitatively characterized or could not be identified, because of the presence of many isomers and overlapping spectra in the chromatogram, leaving 80% of the carbon from the jet fuel unaccounted for in the early pyrolysis history of the parent fuel. Computationally, the one-dimensional code adopted a semi-detailed kinetic mechanism for the surrogate blend that is based on an existing hierarchically constructed kinetic model for alkanes and simple aromatics, extended to account for the presence of tetralin and methylcyclohexane as reference fuels. The computational results are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental ones for the surrogate behavior, with the greatest discrepancy in the concentrations of aromatics and ethylene.

The effects of initial droplet diameter, overall equivalence ratio {phi}{sub 0} and droplet residence time before reaching the flame front were examined. Increasing the residence time had an effect only for n-heptane, with virtually no evaporation occurring before the flame front for n-decane. The trends were only marginally correlated with the local gaseous equivalence ratio {phi}{sub eff} at the location of maximum heat release rate. {phi}{sub eff} could be as low as 0.4 (beyond the lean flammability limit), but the flame speed could still be 40% of the gaseous stoichiometric flame speed S{sub L,0}. For n-heptane, {phi}{sub eff} increased towards {phi}{sub 0} with smaller droplets while high flame speeds occurred when {phi}{sub eff} was near 1. This implied that the highest flame speed was achieved with small droplets for {phi}{sub 0} {&lt;=} 1 and with relatively large droplets for {phi}{sub 0} &gt; 1. In the latter case, the oxidiser was completely consumed in the reaction zone and droplets finished evaporating behind the flame where the fuel was pyrolysed. The resulting small species, mainly C{sub 2}H{sub 2}, C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and H{sub 2}, diffused back to the oxidation zone and enhanced the reaction rate there. Ultimately, this could result in flame speeds higher than S{sub L,0} even with {phi}{sub 0} = 4. For n-decane, the same trends were followed but smaller droplets were needed to reach the same {phi}{sub eff} due to the slow evaporation rate. Under low pressure and low temperature, the effects of pressure and temperature on {phi}{sub eff} and the flame speed were competitive and resulted in values close to the ones at atmospheric conditions.

The scheme reduces a globally valid full mechanism to a locally, instantaneously applicable smaller mechanism. Previously we demonstrated its applicability to homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) problems with n-heptane [L. Liang, J.G. Stevens, J.T. Farrell, Proc. Combust. Inst. 32 (2009) 527-534]. In this work we demonstrate the broader utility of the DAC scheme through the simulation of HCCI and shock tube ignition delay times (IDT) for three gasoline surrogates, including two- and three-component blends of primary reference fuels (PRF) and toluene reference fuels (TRF). Both a detailed 1099-species mechanism and a skeletal 150-species mechanism are investigated as the full mechanism to explore the impact of fuel complexity on the DAC scheme. For all conditions studied, pressure and key species profiles calculated using the DAC scheme are in excellent agreement with the results obtained using the full mechanisms. For the HCCI calculations using the 1099- and 150-species mechanisms, the DAC scheme achieves 70- and 15-fold CPU time reductions, respectively. For the IDT problems, corresponding speed-up factors of 10 and two are obtained. Practical guidance is provided for choosing the search-initiating species set, selecting the threshold, and implementing the DAC scheme in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework.

The resistance to deactivation and carbon formation were examined by the CPOX of a mixture of 5 wt% 1-methylnaphthalene + 1000 ppmw dibenzothiophene in n-tetradecane. The results were compared to a commercial Rh/ã-Al2O3 catalyst. In the presence of these contaminants, the activity of the LSRZ was only kinetically inhibited, which is thought to be attributable to the oxygen-ion conductivity that results from Sr substitution into the pyrochlore structure. Rh/ã-Al2O3 was deactivated, likely due to significant carbon accumulation on/near the Rh metal","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Catalysis Today; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1-2; Conference: 234th ACS National Meeting, Boston, MA, August 19-21, 2007","","Medium: X; Size: p. 121-126","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-257; NETL-TPR-2178","","Journal ID: ISSN 0920-5861; TRN: US200819%%270","10.1016/j.cattod.2008.05.014","","2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","937586","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/937586","","Catalysis Today","1-2","145"
"Towards a detailed soot model for internal combustion engines","Mosbach, Sebastian; Celnik, Matthew S; Raj, Abhijeet; Kraft, Markus; Zhang, Hongzhi R; Kubo, Shuichi; Kim, Kyoung-Oh","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; SOOT; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS; DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS; SYNTHESIS; HEPTANE; PYRENE; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; COMBUSTION KINETICS; MONTE CARLO METHOD; SIMULATION; CONVECTION; TURBULENCE; PARTICLE SIZE; SURFACE AREA; COUPLING; GASES; HEAT; PARTICULATES; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; MASS NUMBER; STOCHASTIC PROCESSES; COMPRESSION; TIME DEPENDENCE; IGNITION; MASS; MIXING; MORPHOLOGY; PRECURSOR","In this work, we present a detailed model for the formation of soot in internal combustion engines describing not only bulk quantities such as soot mass, number density, volume fraction, and surface area but also the morphology and chemical composition of soot aggregates. The new model is based on the Stochastic Reactor Model (SRM) engine code, which uses detailed chemistry and takes into account convective heat transfer and turbulent mixing, and the soot formation is accounted for by SWEEP, a population balance solver based on a Monte Carlo method. In order to couple the gas-phase to the particulate phase, a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism describing the combustion of Primary Reference Fuels (PRFs) is extended to include small Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as pyrene, which function as soot precursor species for particle inception in the soot model. Apart from providing averaged quantities as functions of crank angle like soot mass, volume fraction, aggregate diameter, and the number of primary particles per aggregate for example, the integrated model also gives detailed information such as aggregate and primary particle size distribution functions. In addition, specifics about aggregate structure and composition, including C/H ratio and PAH ring count distributions, and images similar to those produced with Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs), can be obtained. The new model is applied to simulate an n-heptane fuelled Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine which is operated at an equivalence ratio of 1.93. In-cylinder pressure and heat release predictions show satisfactory agreement with measurements. Furthermore, simulated aggregate size distributions as well as their time evolution are found to qualitatively agree with those obtained experimentally through snatch sampling. It is also observed both in the experiment as well as in the simulation that aggregates in the trapped residual gases play a vital role in the soot formation process.

"Premixed ignition behavior of C{sub 9} fatty acid esters: A motored engine study","Zhang, Yu; Yang, Yi; Boehman, Andre L","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS; COMBUSTION; DIESEL FUELS; PRESSURE RANGE KILO PA; AUTOIGNITION; HEAT; ENGINES; TEMPERATURE RANGE 0400-1000 K; BIOFUELS; QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; COMBUSTION PROPERTIES; COMPRESSION RATIO; ACTIVATION ENERGY; INHIBITION; Low-temperature heat release; High- temperature heat release; Low-temperature oxidation; Motored engine","An experimental study on the premixed ignition behavior of C{sub 9} fatty acid esters has been conducted in a motored CFR engine. For each test fuel, the engine compression ratio was gradually increased from the lowest point (4.43) to the point where significant high temperature heat release (HTHR) was observed. The engine exhaust was sampled and analyzed through GC-FID/TCD and GC-MS. Combustion analysis showed that the four C{sub 9} fatty acid esters tested in this study exhibited evidently different ignition behavior. The magnitude of low temperature heat release (LTHR) follows the order, ethyl nonanoate &gt; methyl nonanoate &gt;&gt; methyl 2-nonenoate &gt; methyl 3-nonenoate. The lower oxidation reactivity for the unsaturated fatty acid esters in the low temperature regime can be explained by the reduced amount of six- or seven-membered transition state rings formed during the oxidation of the unsaturated esters due to the presence of a double bond in the aliphatic chain of the esters. The inhibition effect of the double bond on the low temperature oxidation reactivity of fatty acid esters becomes more pronounced as the double bond moves toward the central position of the aliphatic chain. GC-MS analysis of exhaust condensate collected under the engine conditions where only LTHR occurred showed that the alkyl chain of the saturated fatty acid esters participated in typical paraffin-like low temperature oxidation sequences. In contrast, for unsaturated fatty acid esters, the autoignition can undergo olefin ignition pathways. For all test compounds, the ester functional group remains largely intact during the early stage of oxidation.

"A chemical kinetically based ignition delay correlation for iso-octane covering a wide range of conditions including the NTC region","Goldsborough, S Scott","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; OCTANE; PRESSURE RANGE MEGA PA 10-100; ISO; TEMPERATURE RANGE 0400-1000 K; CORRELATIONS; IGNITION; ACTIVATION ENERGY; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS; EXPERIMENTAL DATA; POLYNOMIALS; TEMPERATURE RANGE 1000-4000 K; OXYGEN; SIMULATION; TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT; HEAT; PRESSURE DEPENDENCE; DESIGN; ENGINES; PERFORMANCE; TIME DELAY; PRESSURE RANGE KILO PA; Iso-octane; Ignition delay","An ignition delay correlation has been developed for iso-octane based on the functional behavior exhibited by a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism. The correlation employs a traditional Arrhenius-based, power law formulation, {tau}=A{phi}{sup {alpha}}p{sup {beta}}{chi}{sub O{sub 2}}{sup {gamma}} x exp ({lambda}), including dependencies for equivalence ratio ({phi}), pressure (p) and oxygen percentage ({chi}{sub O2}). However the exponents for these parameters, {alpha}, {beta}, and {gamma}, respectively, are expressed as third-order polynomials with respect to temperature in order to capture changes in functionality seen across different regimes. At very low temperatures {alpha}, {beta}, and {gamma} are forced to a constant value, as seen within the mechanism. The activation energy term, {lambda}, is written as a combination of two quadratic expressions so that the behavior in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region can be captured. A pressure-dependent term is also included in the expression for {lambda} in order to reduce the activation energy at higher pressures in the NTC region due to increased low temperature reactivity, and the appearance of cool flame, or low temperature heat release (LTHR). The resulting expression contains 37 constants. The new correlation is applicable over a wide range of conditions and can be used for data comparisons and mechanism evaluation, as well as systems-level engineering simulations. In this work experimental data from rapid compression machines (RCM) and shock tubes (ST) are compared through normalizing features of the correlation, and the performance of a detailed kinetic mechanism is evaluated based on the functional behavior of the {alpha}, {beta}, {gamma} and {lambda} parameters. Six hundred and sixty-one (661) data points have been used to fit the 37 constants of the expression where the experimental conditions cover {phi}=0.2-2.0, p=1-60atm, {chi}{sub O{sub 2}} and T=650-2000 K. Data normalized through the correlation indicate a standard deviation of {+-}4%. Departures from the correlation can be attributed to an incomplete description of the functional dependencies, some inconsistencies with regard to diluent composition, experimental uncertainties, and facility-influenced phenomena. The experimental points have also been simulated using the LLNL detailed iso-octane mechanism, where the computed ignition delay times have been fit to the new correlation. Agreement and differences between the correlated experimental and simulation {alpha}, {beta}, {gamma} and {lambda} functions are highlighted, where it is noted that there is a substantial discrepancy concerning the increased low temperature chemistry at high pressure. Implications for future engine design are discussed.

"Flame structure of wall-impinging diesel fuel sprays injected by group-hole nozzles","Gao, Jian; Moon, Seoksu; Nishida, Keiya; Matsumoto, Yuhei; Zhang, Yuyin","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; DIESEL FUELS; DIESEL ENGINES; COMBUSTION; NOZZLES; FLAMES; SPRAYS; AIR; WALLS; ASYMMETRY; CHEMILUMINESCENCE; ORIFICES; SOOT; COMBUSTION CHAMBERS; IGNITION; MIXING; TIME DELAY; COMBUSTION PROPERTIES; SIMULATION; STOICHIOMETRY; FEASIBILITY STUDIES; Group-hole nozzle; Flame structure; Wall-impinging spray","This paper describes an investigation of the flame structure of wall-impinging diesel sprays injected by group-hole nozzles in a constant-volume combustion vessel at experimental conditions typical of a diesel engine. The particular emphasis was on the effect of the included angle between two orifices (0-15 deg. in current study) on the flame structure and combustion characteristics under various simulated engine load conditions. The laser absorption scattering (LAS) technique was applied to analyze the spray and mixture properties. Direct flame imaging and OH chemiluminescence imaging were utilized to quantify the ignition delay, flame geometrical parameters, and OH chemiluminescence intensity. The images show that the asymmetric flame structure emerges in wall-impinging group-hole nozzle sprays as larger included angle and higher engine load conditions are applied, which is consistent with the spray shape observed by LAS. Compared to the base nozzle, group-hole nozzles with large included angles yield higher overall OH chemiluminescence intensity, wider flame area, and greater proportion of high OH intensity, implying the better fuel/air mixing and improved combustion characteristics. The advantages of group-hole nozzle are more pronounced under high load conditions. Based on the results, the feasibility of group-hole nozzle for practical direct injection diesel engines is also discussed. It is concluded that the asymmetric flame structure of a group-hole nozzle spray is favorable to reduce soot formation over wide engine loads. However, the hole configuration of the group-hole nozzle should be carefully considered so as to achieve proper air utilization in the combustion chamber. Stoichiometric diesel combustion is another promising application of group-hole nozzle.

Spray cooling has been identified as a potential solution that can dissipate 150-200 W/cm2 while maintaining the chiptemperature below 125degC. This paper explores the viability and implementation of this cooling scheme. First, commercial coolants are assessed for their suitability to this application in terms of thermal, environmental, and safety concerns and material compatibility. In this assessment, HFE-7100 is identified as the optimum coolant in all performance categories. Next, spray models are used todetermine the HFE-7100 spray conditions that meet such stringent heat dissipation requirements.

Results show that sustained propagation is always possible for mixtures whose Lewis number is less than unity, as long as a flame can be initially established. However, for mixtures whose Lewis number is greater than unity, sustained propagation depends on whether the initially ignited flame can attain a minimum radius. This minimum radius was determined for mixtures of different equivalence ratios and pressures, and was found to agree moderately well with the theoretically predicted critical radius beyond which there is no solution for the adiabatic, quasi-steady propagation of the spherical flame. The essential roles of pressure, detailed chemistry, and the need to use local values in the quantitative evaluation of the flame response parameters are emphasized.

The addition of nitroalkanes was found to suppress the Motor Octane Number to a much greater extent than the Research Octane Number. In other words addition of nitroalkanes increases the octane sensitivity of gasoline. Density Functional Theory was used to model the equilibrium thermodynamics and the barrier heights for reactions leading to the break-up of nitroethane. These results were used to develop a chemical kinetic scheme for nitroalkanes combined with a surrogate gasoline (for which a mechanism has been developed previously). Finally the chemical kinetic simulations were combined with a quasi-dimensional engine model in order to predict autoignition in octane rating tests. Our results suggest that the chemical origin of octane sensitivity in gasoline/nitroalkane blends cannot be fully explained on the conventional basis of the extent to which NTC behaviour is absent. Instead we have shown that the contribution of the two pathways leading to autoignition in gasoline containing nitroalkanes becomes much more significant under the more severe conditions of the Motor Octane method than the Research Octane method.

The images, which show significant effects of hydrogen on local flame quenching, are discussed in terms of a turbulent premixed combustion regime and nondimensional parameters such as Karlovitz number. Pressure was found to thin the OH region, but only had a secondary effect on overall flame shape compared with the effects of hydrogen addition, which was found to decrease local quenching and shorten the turbulent flame brush.

The pure components in the surrogate fuels consisted of n-heptane, isooctane, toluene, ethanol and diisobutylene and fuel sensitivities (RON-MON) in the fuel blends ranged from two to nine. The operating conditions for the engine were p{sub in}=0.1 and 0.2 MPa, T{sub in}=80 and 250 C, {phi}=0.25 in air and engine speed 1200 rpm. A semidetailed chemical kinetic model (142 species and 672 reactions) for gasoline surrogate fuels, validated against ignition data from experiments conducted in shock tubes for gasoline surrogate fuel blends at 1.0{&lt;=} p{&lt;=}5.0MPa, 700{&lt;=} T{&lt;=}1200 K and {phi}=1.0, was successfully used to qualitatively predict the HCCI experiments using a single zone modeling approach. The fuel blends that had higher fuel sensitivity were more resistant to autoignition for low intake temperature and high intake pressure and less resistant to autoignition for high intake temperature and low intake pressure. A sensitivity analysis shows that at high intake temperature the chemistry of the fuels ethanol, toluene and diisobutylene helps to advance ignition. This is consistent with the trend that fuels with the least Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) behavior show the highest octane sensitivity, and become less resistant to autoignition at high intake temperatures. For high intake pressure the sensitivity analysis shows that fuels in the fuel blend with no NTC behavior consume OH radicals and acts as a radical scavenger for the fuels with NTC behavior. This is consistent with the observed trend of an increase in RON and fuel sensitivity. With data from shock tube experiments in the literature and HCCI modeling in this work, a correlation between the reciprocal pressure exponent on the ignition delay to the fuel sensitivity and volume percentage of single-stage ignition fuel in the fuel blend was found. Higher fuel sensitivity and single-stage fuel content generally gives a lower value of the pressure exponent. This helps to explain the results obtained while boosting the intake pressure in the HCCI engine.

Diesel particulate filters are presently the most efficient means to reduce these emissions. These filters typically trap particles in two basic modes: at the beginning of the exposure cycle the particles are captured in the filter holes, and at longer times the particles form a ""cake"" on which particles are trapped. Eventually the ""cake"" removed by oxidation and the cycle is repeated. We have investigated the properties and behavior of two commonly used filters: silicon carbide (SiC) and cordierite (DuraTrap® RC) by exposing them to nearly-spherical ammonium sulfate particles. We show that the transition from deep bed filtration to ""cake"" filtration can easily be identified by recording the change in pressure across the filters as a function of exposure. We investigated performance of these filters as a function of flow rate and particle size. The filters trap small and large particles more efficiently than particles that are ~80 to 200 nm in aerodynamic diameter.

Focus of this study is the evolution of nanoparticles as a function of height above burner (HAB) and of the C/O ratio of the unburned gases. It was found that especially particles of the cluster type exhibit a sharp concentration drop by more than two orders of magnitude within a narrow C/O window which is close to the sooting threshold. Using DMA a decline by two orders of magnitude was found. These results suggest that at best only small concentrations of nanoparticles should be formed significantly below the sooting threshold. As these conditions prevail in a homogeneously charged IC engine no or only very small nanoparticle emissions are expected in the exhaust gas. This was indeed found for a small Otto engine driving a power generator unit. Using flame nanoparticle profiles as standard, absolute concentrations for their emissions could be deduced. These data were supported by additional DMA measurements. The calibration using TOC did not completely match the one based on the condensation particle counter of the DMA apparatus.

Instantaneous velocity fields were analyzed to yield ensemble-averaged velocities and Reynolds stresses, and the ensemble-averages were used to determine maximum velocity and exit flow angle as a function of blade position for various speeds and pressure ratios. The results show that the flow exits the supercharger as a high-speed jet that not only varies in the parallel plane but also in the perpendicular plane, generating a complex three-dimensional flow. The flow varies in the magnitude and the angle at which it leaves the supercharger with the change in blade position and follows a periodic behavior. The maximum velocity at which the flow exits the supercharger also follows a periodic behavior with a variation of 25-30% observed for all the cases. In the parallel plane, the exit angles are periodic every 60 deg of blade rotation and vary by as much as 40 deg, whereas periodic behavior with every 120 deg of blade rotation and a variation of 60 deg is observed in the perpendicular plane. Variation in flow with blade position is also observed in the velocity and turbulence profiles, with periodic behavior with every 60 blade rotation. The velocity and velocity fluctuation profiles show that the unsteady nature of the flow is most significant close to the outlet, and these unsteady variations diminish 58 mm downstream of the outlet. An exit flow pattern of a figure 8 is generated as the flow leaves the blades with one complete blade rotation of 120 for all the cases, except 4000 rpm, pressure ratio 1.4, where the flow exits in a circular pattern.

This model has shown excellent capabilities for the numerical resolution of interfaces separating compressible fluids as well as wave propagation in compressible mixtures [A. Murrone, H.

The artificial heat exchange for multiphase shocks, Journal of Computational Physics 225(2) (2007) 2214–2248]. However, its numerical approximation poses some serious difficulties. Among them, the non-monotonic behavior of the sound speed causes inaccuracies in wave’s transmission across interfaces. Moreover, volume fraction variation across acoustic waves results in difficulties for the Riemann problem resolution, and in particular for the derivation of approximate solvers. Volume fraction positivity in the presence of shocks or strong expansion waves is another issue resulting in lack of robustness. To circumvent these difficulties, the pressure equilibrium assumption is relaxed and a pressure non-equilibrium model is developed. It results in a single velocity, non-conservative hyperbolic model with two energy equations involving relaxation terms. It fulfills the equation of state and energy conservation on both sides of interfaces and guarantees correct transmission of shocks across them. This formulation considerably simplifies numerical resolution. Following a strategy developed previously for another flow model [R. Saurel, R. Abgrall, A multiphase Godunov method for multifluid and multiphase flows, Journal of Computational Physics 150 (1999) 425–467], the hyperbolic part is first solved without relaxation terms with a simple, fast and robust algorithm, valid for unstructured meshes. Second, stiff relaxation terms are solved with a Newton method that also guarantees positivity and robustness. The algorithm and model are compared to exact solutions of the Euler equations as well as solutions of the five-equation model under extreme flow conditions, for interface computation and cavitating flows involving dynamics appearance of interfaces. In order to deal with correct dynamic of shock waves propagating through multiphase mixtures, the artificial heat exchange method of Petitpas et al. [F. Petitpas, E. Franquet, R. Saurel, O.

However, the silica layer that forms on these materials is susceptible to attack from water vapor present in combustion environments. To protect against this degradation, environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) have been developed to shield the underlying substrate and prevent degradation. Here we report on elastic and thermal properties, as well as internal stresses of candidate multilayer coatings, as measured in situ using microfocused high-energy X-rays in a transmission diffraction geometry. Doped aluminosilicate coatings were investigated for their stability on a SiC/SiC melt-infiltrated substrate. The coatings consisted of a Ba{sub 1-x}Sr{sub x}Al{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 8} topcoat with a mullite or mullite+SrAl{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 8} interlayer, and a silicon bond coat. A numerical model was used to compare the stress results with an ideal coating system. Experiments were carried out on as-sprayed and heat-treated samples in order to analyze the strain and phase evolution as a function of multilayer depth and temperature. The phase transformation of the topcoat promoted healing of cracks in the EBC and reduced stresses in the underlying layers and the addition of SAS to the interlayer reduced stresses in thermally cycled coatings, but did not stop cracks from forming.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Charged vehicles can run on the stored energy when needed. A recent study by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory concluded that some 73 percent of U.S. light vehicles can be supplied with the existing utility infrastructure in place, provided the charging was restricted to off-peak periods. That would reduce U.S. oil imports by 6.2 million barrels per day, roughly 52 percent of U.S. oil imports. The limiting factors increasingly appear to be on the utility side, for example, making sure that the vehicles are charged during off-peak hours at discounted prices.","","Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2008.12.019","","","","United States","2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

A simulation tool was utilized and the static air pressure at the centerline of the spray was measured to investigate the static pressure and flow structure inside the swirl spray. To investigate the effect of static air pressure on swirl spray development, a liquid film model was applied and the Mie-scattered images were captured. The simulation and experiment showed that recirculation vortex and air pressure drop inside the swirl spray were observable and the air pressure drop was greater at high injection pressure. At high fuel temperature, the air pressure at the nozzle exit showed higher value compared to the atmospheric pressure and then continuously decreased up to few millimeters distance from the nozzle exit. The pressure drop at high fuel temperatures was more than that of atmospheric temperature. This reduced air pressure was recovered to the atmospheric pressure at further downstream. The results from the liquid film model and macroscopic spray images showed that the air pressure started to affect the liquid film trajectory about 3 mm from the nozzle exit and this effect was sustained until the air pressure recovered to the atmospheric pressure. However, the entrained air motion and droplet size have more significant influence on the spray development after the most of the liquid sheet is broken-up and the spray loses its initial momentum.

The two-way-coupling allows for a computationally efficient modeling of HCCI combustion. The physical domain in the CFD code is subdivided into multiple zones based on three phase variables (fuel mixture fraction, dilution, and total enthalpy). Those phase variables are sufficient for the description of the thermodynamic state of each zone, assuming that each zone is at the same pressure. Each zone in the CFD code is represented by a corresponding zone in the zero-dimensional code. The zero-dimensional code solves the chemistry for each zone, and the heat release is fed back into the CFD code. The difficulty in facing this kind of methodology is to keep the thermodynamic state of each zone consistent between the CFD code and the zero-dimensional code after the initialization of the zones in the multi-zone code has taken place. The thermodynamic state of each zone (and thereby the phase variables) will change in time due to mixing and source terms (e.g., vaporization of fuel, wall heat transfer). The focus of this work lies on a consistent description of the mixing between the zones in phase space in the zero-dimensional code, based on the solution of the CFD code. Two mixing models with different degrees of accuracy, complexity, and numerical effort are described. The most elaborate mixing model (and an appropriate treatment of the source terms) keeps the thermodynamic state of the zones in the CFD code and the zero-dimensional code identical. The models are applied to a test case of HCCI combustion in an engine.

A one-dimensional (1D) spray model, which was previously validated for inert diesel sprays, is extended to reacting conditions. The main assumptions of the model are the mixing-controlled hypothesis and the validity of self-similarity for conservative properties. Validation is achieved by comparing model predictions with both CFD gas jet simulations and experimental diesel spray measurements. The 1D model provides valuable insight into the evolution of the flow within the spray (momentum and mass fluxes, tip penetration, etc.) when shifting from inert to reacting conditions. Results show that the transient diesel flame evolution is mainly governed by two combustion-induced effects, namely the reduction in local density and the increase in flame radial width.

This data was used to further validate a previously published detailed chemical kinetic mechanism, containing 139 species and 790 reversible reactions. It was found that this mechanism required a significant increase in the rate constant of the six-centered unimolecular elimination reaction which produces ethylene and propanoic acid in order to correctly reproduce the measured concentrations of propanoic acid. The revised mechanism was then used to re-simulate shock tube ignition delay data with good agreement observed.

Currently available power inverter systems for HEVs use a dc-dc boost converter to boost the battery voltage for a traditional three-phase inverter. The present HEV traction drive inverters have low power density, are expensive, and have low efficiency because they need a bulky inductor. A cascaded H-bridge multilevel boost inverter design for EV and HEV applications implemented without the use of inductors is proposed in this paper. Traditionally, each H-bridge needs a dc power supply. The proposed design uses a standard three-leg inverter (one leg for each phase) and an H-bridge in series with each inverter leg which uses a capacitor as the dc power source. A fundamental switching scheme is used to do modulation control and to produce a five-level phase voltage. Experiments show that the proposed dc-ac cascaded H-bridge multilevel boost inverter can output a boosted ac voltage without the use of inductors.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The various features of the original MMCCC circuit are best suited for a multibus system in future plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell-powered vehicles' drive train. The original MMCCC is capable of bidirectional power transfer using multilevel modular structure with capacitor-clamped topology. It has a nonisolated structure, and it offers very high efficiency even at partial loads. This circuit was modified to integrate single or multiple high-frequency transformers by using the intermediate voltage nodes of the converter. On the other hand, a special formation of the MMCCC can exhibit dc outputs offering limited isolation without using any isolation transformer. This modified version can produce a high conversion ratio from a limited number of components and has several useful applications in providing power to multiple low-voltage loads in a hybrid or electric automobile.

A cylinder pivoting on its side against a flat tilewas used as the testing geometry. All testswere performed at 600 C in air. The time-dependent torque response was recorded for each 60 min test to investigate trends in friction as surfaces roughened and debris deposits built up. Candidate materials included Stellite 6B, Pleuco 33 (a white cast iron), nitrided stainless steel Type 310, IDM 5399 (a high-silicon, molybdenum iron), and coatings of both Tribaloy T-400 and Stellite 3 on stainless steel. Measurements of the damaged areas on the scuffed tiles were used to calculate a specific normal load and plot it versus the roughness of the worn tiles to map experimental results in a way that indicated the severity of scuffing for each material combination. Data on the map were annotated to reflect visual observations of the extent of damage as well. Using this test method and the foregoing criteria, nitrided type 310 stainless steel against T-400 gave the best overall performance.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The measurements were made possible by a newly developed Diesel Exhaust Filtration Analysis (DEFA) system in which in-situ diesel exhaust filtration can be reproduced with in small cordierite wafer disks, which are essentially thin sections of a Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) wall. The different types of PM were generated from selected engine operating conditions of a single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine. Two filtration velocities 4 and 8 cm/s were used to investigate PM deep-bed filtration processes. The loaded wafers were then analyzed in a thermal mass analyzer that measures the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) as well as soot and sulfate fractions of the PM. In addition, the soot residing in the wall of the wafer was examined under an optical microscope illuminated with Ultraviolet light and an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (E-SEM) to determine the bulk soot penetration depth for each loading condition. It was found that higher filtration velocity results in higher wall loading with approximately the same penetration depth into the wall. PM characteristics impacted both wall loading and soot cake layer characteristics. Results from imaging analysis indicate that soot the penetration depth into the wall was affected more by PM size (which changes with engine operating conditions) rather than filtration velocity.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"UTILIZING WATER EMULSIFICATION TO REDUCE NOX AND PARTICULATE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BIODIESEL","Kass, Michael D; Lewis, Sr, Samuel Arthur; Lee, Doh-Won; Huff, Shean P; Storey, John Morse; Swartz, Matthew M; Wagner, Robert M","02 PETROLEUM; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; CHEMISTRY; COMBUSTION; DIESEL ENGINES; DOUBLE BONDS; EFFICIENCY; EMULSIFICATION; ESTERS; FUEL CONSUMPTION; OPACITY; PARTICULATES; PETROLEUM; SOOT; SULFUR; WATER","A key barrier limiting extended utilization of biodiesel is higher NOx emissions compared to petrodiesel fuels. The reason for this effect is unclear, but various researchers have attributed this phenomena to the higher liquid bulk modulus associated with biodiesel and the additional heat released during the breaking of C-C double bonds in the methyl ester groups. In this study water was incorporated into neat biodiesel (B100) as an emulsion in an attempt to lower NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions. A biodiesel emulsion containing 10wt% water was formulated and evaluated against an ultra-low sulfur petroleum diesel (ULSD) and neat biodiesel (B100) in a light-duty diesel engine operated at 1500RPM and at loads of 68Nm (50ft-lbs) and 102Nm (75ft-lbs). The influence of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was also examined. The incorporation of water was found to significantly lower the NOx emissions of B100, while maintaining fuel efficiency when operating at 0 and 27% EGR. The soot fraction of the particulates (as determined using an opacity meter) was much lower for the B100 and B100-water emulsion compared ULSD. In contrast, total PM mass (for the three fuel types) was unchanged for the 0% EGR condition but was significantly lower for the B100 and B100-emulsion during the 27% EGR condition compared to the ULSD fuel. Analysis of the emissions and heat release data indicate that water enhances air-fuel premixing to maintain fuel economy and lower soot formation. The exhaust chemistry of the biodiesel base fuels (B100 and water-emulsified B100) was found to be unique in that they contained measurable levels of methyl alkenoates, which were not found for the ULSD. These compounds were formed by the partial cracking of the methyl ester groups during combustion.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Measurements of sprays from two nozzles with different geometries, one extensively hydroground and the other largely non-hydroground, have been obtained to show how nozzles of different geometries respond to changes in ambient density and rail pressure. The spray penetration near the nozzle demonstrates little dependence on ambient density but a strong dependence on rail pressure. Comparison of these results with standard correlations in the literature show that, in the near-nozzle region examined in this study, the penetration is expected to show little dependence on ambient density. The spray width becomes much larger for both nozzles as the ambient density increases. Rescaling the axial position by the square root of the density ratio between the fuel and the ambient gas accounts for the trends in spray width with ambient density for both nozzles. The radiography data can also be examined to determine the relative trends in the steady-state, mass-averaged axial velocity of the spray. The velocity decays more rapidly with axial distance as the ambient density increases. Rescaling the axial position also accounts for the trend of velocity decay with ambient pressure.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"The Role of Phosphorus and Soot on the Deactivation of Diesel Oxidation Catalysts","Eaton, Scott J; Nguyen, Ke; Bunting, Bruce G; Toops, Todd J","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; DIESEL ENGINES; CATALYSTS; DEACTIVATION; SOOT; PHOSPHORUS; PLATINUM; CERIUM OXIDES; ALUMINIUM OXIDES; CARBON MONOXIDE; POLYCYCLIC SULFUR HETEROCYCLES; CATALYSIS; OXIDATION","The deactivation of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) by soot contamination and lube-oil derived phosphorus poisoning is investigated. Pt/CeO2/-Al2O3 DOCs aged using three different protocols developed by the authors and six high mileage field-returned DOCs of similar formulation are evaluated for THC and CO oxidation performance using a bench-flow reactor. Collectively, these catalysts exhibit a variety of phosphorus and soot morphologies contributing to performance deactivation. To isolate and examine the contribution of each deactivation mechanism, performance evaluations are carried out for each DOC ''as received'' and after removal of surface carbon in a high-temperature oxidizing environment. In such a manner the deactivation contribution of soot contamination is de-convoluted from that of phosphorus poisoning. It will be shown that this is accomplished while preserving phosphorus (and to a lesser degree sulfur, calcium and zinc) chemistries and concentrations within the washcoat. Washcoat contaminant information and materials changes are characterized using electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), BET surface area, oxygen storage capacity (OSC), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, from which the relative severity of each mechanism can be quantified. Results show that soot contamination from diesel exhaust severely degrades THC and CO oxidation performance by acting as a catalyst surface diffusion barrier. This results in a considerable increase of light-off temperatures. In contrast, phosphorus poisoning, which is considered a significant deactivation mechanism in three-way catalysts, is shown to have minimal effect on DOC oxidation performance for the conditions studied here. Material changes include the formation of both Ce(III-IV) and aluminum phosphates which do not significantly hinder the THC and CO oxidation in lean exhaust. In addition, thermal aging and sulfur poisoning are shown to produce minimal contributions to the overall deactivation. Consequently, performance of aged DOCs after soot removal is observed to be comparable to that of a fresh catalyst under our testing conditions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Thermal aging is carried out in a bench-flow reactor at nominal temperatures of 700, 800, 900, and 1000 C using an aging cycle consisting of a 130s lean-phase and a 50s rich-phase. After a prescribed number of lean/rich aging cycles, the NOx conversion of the aged LNT is evaluated at 200, 300, and 400 C. The NOx performance is obtained at a GHSV of 30,000 h-1 using an evaluation cycle consisting of a 60s lean-phase and 5s rich-phase. The effects of aging on the LNT washcoat are determined with EPMA, XRD, STEM/EDS, and BET. Aging at 700 and 800 C has a minimal effect on LNT performance and material properties. However, at aging temperatures of 900 and 1000 C reduction in surface area and sintering of PGM particles are observed and result in a drastic reduction in NOx conversion. Additionally, after aging at 900 C and 1000 C the NOx storage medium, BaCO3, is no longer visible in the XRD patterns, even though a Ba-phase identified by EPMA still exists in all aged samples. BaAl2O4 is not identified at any aging temperatures; possibly due to stabilization effects provided by washcoat additives present in this particular LNT.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Next-generation engines will likely operate at higher pressures, with greater amounts of dilution and utilize alternative fuels that exhibit a wide range of chemical and physical properties. Therefore, there is a significant role for high-fidelity simulations, direct numerical simulations (DNS), specifically designed to capture key turbulence-chemistry interactions in these relatively uncharted combustion regimes, and in particular, that can discriminate the effects of differences in fuel properties. In DNS, all of the relevant turbulence and flame scales are resolved numerically using high-order accurate numerical algorithms. As a consequence terascale DNS are computationally intensive, require massive amounts of computing power and generate tens of terabytes of data. Recent results from terascale DNS of turbulent flames are presented here, illustrating its role in elucidating flame stabilization mechanisms in a lifted turbulent hydrogen/air jet flame in a hot air coflow, and the flame structure of a fuel-lean turbulent premixed jet flame. Computing at this scale requires close collaborations between computer and combustion scientists to provide optimized scaleable algorithms and software for terascale simulations, efficient collective parallel I/O, tools for volume visualization of multiscale, multivariate data and automating the combustion workflow. The enabling computer science, applied to combustion science, is also required in many other terascale physics and engineering simulations. In particular, performance monitoring is used to identify the performance of key kernels in the DNS code, S3D and especially memory intensive loops in the code. Through the careful application of loop transformations, data reuse in cache is exploited thereby reducing memory bandwidth needs, and hence, improving S3D's nodal performance. To enhance collective parallel I/O in S3D, an MPI-I/O caching design is used to construct a two-stage write-behind method for improving the performance of write-only operations. The simulations generate tens of terabytes of data requiring analysis. Interactive exploration of the simulation data is enabled by multivariate time-varying volume visualization. The visualization highlights spatial and temporal correlations between multiple reactive scalar fields using an intuitive user interface based on parallel coordinates and time histogram. Finally, an automated combustion workflow is designed using Kepler to manage large-scale data movement, data morphing, and archival and to provide a graphical display of run-time diagnostics.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Iron aerogels and xerogels were synthesized by polycondensation of an ethanolic solution of iron(III) chloride hexahydrate with propylene oxide which acts as a proton scavenger for the initiation of hydrolysis and polycondensation. Potassium was incorporated in the iron aerogel and iron xerogel by adding aqueous K{sub 2}CO{sub 3} to the ethanolic solutions of the Fe(III) precursor prior to addition of propylene oxide. Fischer-Tropsch activities of the catalysts were tested in a fixed bed reactor at a pressure of 100 psi with a H{sub 2}:CO ratio of 2:1. Iron aerogels were found to be active for F-T synthesis, and their F-T activities increased on addition of a K containing promoter.

To examine the effect of ceria addition, experiments were also conducted using Pt/BaO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} to which Pt/CeO{sub 2} was added as a physical mixture in a 74:26 weight ratio. For the former catalyst, DRIFT spectra acquired during NO/O{sub 2} and NO{sub 2}/O{sub 2} storage indicated the formation of nitrite at 200 C during the initial stages of adsorption, while increasing the adsorption temperature appeared to facilitate the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. The ceria-containing catalyst afforded similar DRIFT spectra under these conditions, although the presence of cerium nitrates was observed at 200 and 300 C, consistent with NO{sub x} storage on the ceria phase. DRIFT spectra acquired during NO{sub x} reduction in CO and CO/H{sub 2} showed that Ba nitrate species remained on the surface of both catalysts at 450 C, whereas the use of H{sub 2}-only resulted in complete removal of stored NO{sub x}. The observation of Ba carbonates when CO was present suggests that the inferior reduction efficiency of CO may arise from the formation of a crust of BaCO{sub 3} on the Ba phase, which inhibits further NO{sub x} reduction. DRIFT spectra acquired during lean-rich cycling (6.5 min lean, 1.0 min rich) with CO/H{sub 2} as the rich phase reductants revealed that a significant concentration of nitrates remained on the catalysts at the end of the rich phase. This implies that a large fraction of nitrate is not decomposed during cycling and thus cannot participate in NO{sub x} abatement through storage and regeneration.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Probability density function treatment of turbulence/chemistry interactions during the ignition of a temperature-stratified mixture for application to HCCI engine modeling","Bisetti, Fabrizio; Chen, J -Y; Hawkes, Evatt R; Chen, Jacqueline H","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS; IGNITION; MIXING; SIMULATION; STRATIFICATION; HEAT; AIR; COMBUSTION; DIESEL ENGINES; HYDROGEN; TURBULENCE; HYDROXYL RADICALS; TEMPERATURE RANGE 1000-4000 K; SCALARS; MATHEMATICAL SOLUTIONS; TIME DEPENDENCE; COMPRESSION; MASS; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS; HCCI; Mixing models","Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine technology promises to reduce NO{sub x} and soot emissions while achieving high thermal efficiency. Temperature and mixture stratification are regarded as effective means of controlling the start of combustion and reducing the abrupt pressure rise at high loads. Probability density function methods are currently being pursued as a viable approach to modeling the effects of turbulent mixing and mixture stratification on HCCI ignition. In this paper we present an assessment of the merits of three widely used mixing models in reproducing the moments of reactive scalars during the ignition of a lean hydrogen/air mixture ({phi}=0.1, p=41atm, and T=1070 K) under increasing temperature stratification and subject to decaying turbulence. The results from the solution of the evolution equation for a spatially homogeneous joint PDF of the reactive scalars are compared with available direct numerical simulation (DNS) data [E.R. Hawkes, R. Sankaran, P.P. Pebay, J.H. Chen, Combust. Flame 145 (1-2) (2006) 145-159]. The mixing models are found able to quantitatively reproduce the time history of the heat release rate, first and second moments of temperature, and hydroxyl radical mass fraction from the DNS results. Most importantly, the dependence of the heat release rate on the extent of the initial temperature stratification in the charge is also well captured.

Past work showed that soot derived from oxygenated fuels such as biodiesel carries some surface oxygen functionality and thereby possesses higher reactivity than soot from conventional diesel fuel. In this work, results show that EGR exerts a strong influence on the physical properties of the soot which leads to enhanced oxidation rate. HRTEM images showed a dramatic difference between the burning modes of the soot generated under 0 and 20% EGR. The soot produced under 0% EGR strictly followed an external burning mode with no evidence of internal burning. In contrast, soot generated under 20% EGR exhibited dual burning modes: slow external burning and rapid internal burning. The results demonstrate clearly that highly reactive soot can be achieved by manipulating the physical properties of the soot via EGR.

Skeletal mechanisms for isooctane and n-heptane were added to a detailed toluene submechanism. The model shows generally good agreement with ignition delay times measured in a shock tube and a rapid compression machine and is sensitive to changes in temperature, pressure, and mixture strength. The addition of reactions involving the formation and destruction of benzylperoxide radical was crucial to modeling toluene shock tube data. Laminar burning velocities for benzene and toluene were well predicted by the model after some revision of the high-temperature chemistry. Moreover, laminar burning velocities of a real gasoline at 353 and 500 K could be predicted by the model using a toluene reference fuel as a surrogate. The model also captures the experimentally observed differences in combustion phasing of toluene/n-heptane mixtures, compared to a primary reference fuel of the same research octane number, in HCCI engines as the intake pressure and temperature are changed. For high intake pressures and low intake temperatures, a sensitivity analysis at the moment of maximum heat release rate shows that the consumption of phenoxy radicals is rate-limiting when a toluene/n-heptane fuel is used, which makes this fuel more resistant to autoignition than the primary reference fuel. Typical CPU times encountered in zero-dimensional calculations were on the order of seconds and minutes in laminar flame speed calculations. Cross reactions between benzylperoxy radicals and n-heptane improved the model predictions of shock tube experiments for {phi}=1.0 and temperatures lower than 800 K for an n-heptane/toluene fuel mixture, but cross reactions had no influence on HCCI simulations.

Starting from an existing reduced reaction mechanism for n-heptane oxidation, a new reduced n-heptane mechanism was generated by including an additional five species and their relevant reactions, by updating the reaction rate constants of several reactions pertaining to oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and by optimizing reaction rate constants of selected reactions. Using a similar approach, a reduced mechanism for iso-octane oxidation was built and combined with the n-heptane mechanism to form a PRF mechanism. The final version of the PRF mechanism consists of 41 species and 130 reactions. Validation of the present PRF mechanism was performed with measurements from shock tube tests, and HCCI and direct injection engine experiments available in the literature. The results show that the present PRF mechanism gives reliable performance for combustion predictions, as well as computational efficiency improvements for multidimensional CFD simulations.

This paper investigates the possibility of using gasoline in an HCCI engine and analyzes the autoignition of gasoline in such an engine. The compression ratio that has been used is 13.5, keeping the inlet temperature at 70 C, varying the equivalence ratio from 0.3 to 0.54, and the EGR (represented by N{sub 2}) ratio from 0 to 37 vol%. For comparison, a PRF95 and a surrogate containing 11 vol% n-heptane, 59 vol% iso-octane, and 30 vol% toluene are used. A previously validated kinetic surrogate mechanism is used to analyze the experiments and to yield possible explanations to kinetic phenomena. From this work, it seems quite possible to use the high octane-rated gasoline for autoignition purposes, even under lean inlet conditions. Furthermore, it appeared that gasoline and its surrogate, unlike PRF95, show a three-stage autoignition. Since the PRF95 does not contain toluene, it is suggested by the kinetic mechanism that the benzyl radical, issued from toluene, causes this so-defined ''obstructed preignition'' and delaying thereby the final ignition for gasoline and its surrogate. The results of the kinetic mechanism supporting this explanation are shown in this paper.

The BMW Hydrogen 7 Mono-Fuel demonstration vehicles are derived from the BMW Hydrogen 7 bi-fuel vehicles and based on a BMW 760iL. The mono-fuel as well as the bi-fuel vehicle(s) is equipped with cryogenic hydrogen on-board storage and a gaseous hydrogen port fuel injection system. The BMW Hydrogen 7 Mono-Fuel demonstration vehicles were tested for fuel economy as well as emissions on the Federal Test Procedure FTP-75 cold-start test as well as the highway test. The results show that these vehicles achieve emissions levels that are only a fraction of the Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV) standard for nitric oxide (NO{sub x}) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. For non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions the cycle-averaged emissions are actually 0 g/mile, which require the car to actively reduce emissions compared to the ambient concentration. The fuel economy numbers on the FTP-75 test were 3.7 kg of hydrogen per 100 km, which, on an energy basis, is equivalent to a gasoline fuel consumption of 17 miles per gallon (mpg). Fuel economy numbers for the highway cycle were determined to be 2.1 kg of hydrogen per 100 km or 30 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE). In addition to cycle-averaged emissions and fuel economy numbers, time-resolved (modal) emissions as well as air/fuel ratio data is analyzed to further investigate the root causes of the remaining emissions traces. The BMW Hydrogen 7 vehicles employ a switching strategy with lean engine operation at low engine loads and stoichiometric operation at high engine loads that avoids the NO{sub x} emissions critical operating regime with relative air/fuel ratios between 1 &lt; {lambda} &lt; 2. The switching between these operating modes was found to be a major source of the remaining NO{sub x} emissions. The emissions results collected during this period lead to the conclusion that the BMW Hydrogen 7 Mono-Fuel demonstration vehicles are likely the cleanest combustion engine vehicles ever tested at Argonne's APRF.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Measurements were performed for initial gas pressures between 1 and 3 MPa, injection pressures between 50 and 130 MPa and laser probe timings between 5 and 16 ms after start of fuel injection. In separate experiments and for the same cell operating conditions gas temperatures were deduced from spectrally resolved soot pyrometry measurements. Implementing the LII model of Kock et al. [Combust. Flame 147 (2006) 79-92] ensemble mean soot particle diameters were evaluated from least-squares fitting of theoretical cooling curves to experimental TiRe-LII signal transients. Since in the experiments the environmental gas temperature and the width of an assumed particle size distribution were not known, the effects of the initial choice of these parameters on retrieved particle diameters were investigated. It is shown that evaluated mean particle diameters are only slightly biased by the choice of typical size distribution widths and gas temperatures. For a fixed combustion phase mean particle diameters are not much affected by gas pressure, however they become smaller at high fuel injection pressure. At a mean chamber pressure of 1.39 MPa evaluated mean particle diameters increased by a factor of two for probe delays between 5 and 16 ms after start of injection irrespective of the choices of first-guess fitting variables, indicating a certain robustness of data analysis procedure.

The two-way-coupling allows for a computationally efficient modeling of HCCI combustion. The physical domain in the CFD code is subdivided into multiple zones based on three phase variables (fuel mixture fraction, dilution, and total enthalpy). Those phase variables are sufficient for the description of the thermodynamic state of each zone, assuming that each zone is at the same pressure. Each zone in the CFD code is represented by a corresponding zone in the zero-dimensional code. The zero-dimensional code solves the chemistry for each zone, and the heat release is fed back into the CFD code. The difficulty in facing this kind of methodology is to keep the thermodynamic state of each zone consistent between the CFD code and the zero-dimensional code after the initialization of the zones in the multi-zone code has taken place. The thermodynamic state of each zone (and thereby the phase variables) will change in time due to mixing and source terms (e.g., vaporization of fuel, wall heat transfer). The focus of this work lies on a consistent description of the mixing between the zones in phase space in the zero-dimensional code, based on the solution of the CFD code. Two mixing models with different degrees of accuracy, complexity, and numerical effort are described. The most elaborate mixing model (and an appropriate treatment of the source terms) keeps the thermodynamic state of the zones in the CFD code and the zero-dimensional code identical. The models are applied to a test case of HCCI combustion in an engine.

Experiments performed with EGR present some difficulties in interpreting results using only the diluting and thermal aspect of EGR. Lately, the chemical aspect of EGR is taken more into consideration, because this aspect causes a complex interaction with the dilution and thermal aspects of EGR. This paper studies the influence of EGR on the autoignition process and particularly the chemical aspect of EGR. The diluents present in EGR are simulated by N{sub 2} and CO{sub 2}, with dilution factors going from 0 to 46 vol%. For the chemically active species that could be present in EGR, the species CO, NO, and CH{sub 2}O are used. The initial concentration in the inlet mixture of CO and NO is varied between 0 and 170 ppm, while that of CH{sub 2}O alters between 0 and 1400 ppm. For the investigation of the effect of the chemical species on the autoignition, a fixed dilution factor of 23 vol% and a fixed EGR temperature of 70 C are maintained. The inlet temperature is held at 70 C, the equivalence ratios between 0.29 and 0.41, and the compression ratio at 10.2. The fuels used for the autoignition are n-heptane and PRF40. It appeared that CO, in the investigated domain, did not influence the ignition delays, while NO had two different effects. At concentrations up until 45 ppm, NO advanced the ignition delays for the PRF40 and at higher concentrations, the ignition delayed. The influence of NO on the autoignition of n-heptane seemed to be insignificant, probably due to the higher burn rate of n-heptane. CH{sub 2}O seemed to delay the ignition. The results suggested that especially the formation of OH radicals or their consumption by the chemical additives determines how the reactivity of the autoignition changed.

The US DOE Fuel Cell subprogram emphasizes polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells as replacements for internal combustion engines in light-duty vehicles to support the goal of reducing oil use in the transportation sector. PEM fuel cells are the focus for light-duty vehicles because they are capable of rapid start-up, demonstrate high operating efficiency, and can operate at low temperatures. The program also supports fuel cells for stationary power, portable power, and auxiliary power applications where earlier market entry would assist in the development of a fuel cell manufacturing and supplier base. The technical focus is on developing materials and components that enable fuel cells to achieve the fuel cell subprogram objectives, primarily related to system cost and durability. For transportation applications, the performance and cost of a fuel cell vehicle must be comparable or superior to today's gasoline vehicles to achieve widespread penetration into the market and achieve the desired reduction in petroleum consumption. By translating vehicle performance requirements into fuel cell system needs, DOE has defined technical targets for 2010 and 2015. These targets are based on competitiveness with current internal combustion engine vehicles in terms of vehicle performance and cost, while providing improvements in efficiency of a factor of 2.5 to 3. The overall system targets are: a 60% peak-efficient, durable, direct hydrogen fuel cell power system for transportation at a cost of $45/kW by 2010 and $30/kW by 2015. DOE's approach to achieving these technical and cost targets is to improve existing materials and to identify and qualify new materials.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Partial Oxidation of n-Tetradecane over 1 wt % Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Co0.4Mo0.6Cx Carbide Catalysts: A Comparative Study","Haynes, D J; Berry, D A; Shekhawat, Dushyant; Xiao, Tian-Cun; Green, M L.H.; Spivey, J J","30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; ADSORPTION HEAT; CARBIDES; CATALYSTS; DIESEL FUELS; FUEL CELLS; LIQUID FUELS; OXIDATION; SORPTIVE PROPERTIES; SULFUR; SYNTHESIS GAS","Catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) of liquid fuels is being widely studied as an option for producing a hydrogen-rich gas stream for fuel cells. However, deactivation of catalysts by carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning in this process is a key technical challenge. Here, the deactivation of Co0.4Mo0.6Cx has been compared to that of 1 wt % Pt/γ-Al2O3 in a fixed-bed catalytic reactor, using mixtures of n-tetradecane and either 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN) or dibenzothiophene (DBT) to simulate diesel fuel. The results show that Co0.4Mo0.6Cx is stable and active for the CPOX of n-tetradecane at 850 °C, 50000 scc/(gcat h), and an O/C ratio of 1.2. This catalyst produces slightly lower H2 and CO yields than Pt/γ-Al2O3, but still close to equilibrium values for 5 h. A low concentration of sulfur (50 ppmw as DBT) has little effect on either activity or selectivity for the carbide or Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. However, the presence of 1-MN or a high sulfur concentration (1000 ppmw as DBT) deactivates both catalysts, resulting in reaction products that are typical of gas-phase reactions in a blank reactor. The addition of 1-MN or 1000 ppmw DBT to n-tetradecane produces qualitatively similar results on both catalysts: H2 production decreases continuously in the presence of either 1-MN or DBT, and CO drops to a stationary level. This drop in synthesis gas yields corresponds to an increase in steam, CO2, and olefin yields, suggesting that the contaminants deactivate sites that are active for steam and dry reforming reactions downstream of the reactor inlet, where rapid oxidation takes place. Once the contaminants are removed, initial activity returns more quickly for the carbide than for Pt/γ-Al2O3.","American Chemical Society, Washington, DC","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2008-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 47; Journal Issue: 20","","Medium: X; Size: 7663-7671","","DOE/NETL-TPR-2010","DE-AC26-04NT41817 Subtask 41817.610.01.01","Journal ID: ISSN: 0888-5885; eISSN: 1520-5045; TRN: US200909%%117","10.1021/ie071295t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","947221","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/947221","","Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research","20","47"

An ethylene (C{sub 2}H{sub 4}) diffusion flame was formed around a cylindrical rod-burner with the surrounding air velocities of V{sub a} = 2.5, 5, and 10 cm/s, the oxygen concentration of 35%, and the burner wall temperature of 300 K. A laser extinction method was adopted to measure the distribution of soot volume fraction. The experiments determined the trace of maximum soot concentration together with the relative distance of the trace of flame. Results showed that the distance was about 2-5 mm. As the surrounding air velocity increased, the region of the soot particle distribution moved closer to the burner wall. The soot particles near the flame zone tended to move away from the flame zone because of the thermophoretic force and to concentrate at a certain narrow region inside the flame. Because of the simultaneous effects of convection and the thermophoresis, soot particles finally adhered to the burner wall. It has been found that there existed an optimal air velocity for the early deposition of soot on the furnace wall.

A methodology is established using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) to determine three-component velocity distributions up to 0.2 mm from the catalyst entrance face. In adverse conditions of strong out-of-plane velocity, PIV operating parameters are adjusted for maximum spatial correlation strength. The measurement distance to the catalyst is sufficiently small to observe radial flow spreading. A scaling analysis of the stagnation flow region provides a model for the flow uniformization as a function of the catalyst pressure drop.

Ignition and subsequent flame propagation, for both the transient plasma and traditional spark ignition, are observed with a high speed camera (2000 fps). The transient plasma is generated using a 70 ns FWHM, 60 kV, 800 mJ pulse. OH production was confirmed throughout the chamber volume; however, the mean number density was found to decay below 1.3 x 10{sup 14}cm{sup -3} near 100 {mu}s. Nonetheless, ignition induced by transient plasma was decidedly faster than by spark ignition. Using the high speed camera, ignition initiated by transient plasma was found to occur along the length of the anode at approximately 1 ms, leading to the formation of a wrinkled, cylindrically-shaped flame. Analysis of the flame front propagation rates shows that flames ignited by transient plasma propagate essentially at the speed consistent with well accepted literature values for the stoichiometric methane-air mixture. This supports the notion that residue plasma, if any, has little effect on flame propagation.

"Insights on postinjection-associated soot emissions in direct injection diesel engines","Arregle, Jean; Pastor, Jose V; Lopez, J Javier; Garcia, Antonio","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; DIESEL ENGINES; SOOT; COMBUSTION; INJECTION; EMISSION; VARIATIONS; MASS; MIXING; TIME DEPENDENCE; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; SYNTHESIS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; Soot emissions; Diesel combustion; Postinjection","A comprehensive study was carried out in order to better understand combustion behavior in a direct injection diesel engine when using postinjections. More specifically, the aim of the study is twofold: (1) to better understand the mechanism of a postinjection to reduce soot and (2) to improve the understanding of the contribution of the postinjection combustion on the total soot emissions by looking at the effect of the postinjection timing variation and the postinjection mass variation on the soot emissions associated with the postinjection. The study is focused only on far postinjections, and the explored operating conditions include the use of EGR. The first objective was fulfilled analyzing some results from a previous work adding only a few complementary results. Concerning the second objective, the basic idea behind the analysis performed is the search of appropriate parameters physically linked to the processes under analysis. These parameters are found based on the state-of-the-art of diesel combustion. For the effect of the postinjection timing, the physical parameter found was the temperature of the unburned gases at the end of injection, T{sub ug{sub E}}{sub oI}. It was checked that a threshold level of T{sub ug{sub E}}{sub oI} ({proportional_to}700 K for the cases explored here) exists below which soot is unable to be formed, independently of the postinjection size, and the amount of soot increases as the temperature increases beyond this threshold. For the effect of the postinjection size, the physical parameter that was found was DoI/ACT (the ratio between the actual duration of injection and the time necessary for mixing - the apparent combustion time). This parameter can quantify when the postinjection is able to produce soot (the threshold value is {proportional_to}0.37 for the cases explored here), and the amount of soot produced increases as this parameter increases beyond this threshold value. A function containing these two parameters has been fitted to the experimental soot emissions associated with the postinjection obtained in many engine operating conditions, and the appropriate quality of the fit demonstrates that these two parameters explain the main behaviors of the soot emissions associated with a postinjection.

Next-generation engines will likely operate at higher pressures, with greater amounts of dilution and utilize alternative fuels that exhibit a wide range of chemical and physical properties. Therefore, there is a significant role for high-fidelity simulations, direct numerical simulations (DNS), specifically designed to capture key turbulence-chemistry interactions in these relatively uncharted combustion regimes, and in particular, that can discriminate the effects of differences in fuel properties. In DNS, all of the relevant turbulence and flame scales are resolved numerically using high-order accurate numerical algorithms. As a consequence terascale DNS are computationally intensive, require massive amounts of computing power and generate tens of terabytes of data. Recent results from terascale DNS of turbulent flames are presented here, illustrating its role in elucidating flame stabilization mechanisms in a lifted turbulent hydrogen/air jet flame in a hot air co-flow, and the flame structure of a fuel-lean turbulent premixed jet flame. Computing at this scale requires close collaborations between computer and combustion scientists to provide optimized scaleable algorithms and software for terascale simulations, efficient collective parallel I/O, tools for volume visualization of multiscale, multivariate data and automating the combustion workflow. The enabling computer science, applied to combustion science, is also required in many other terascale physics and engineering simulations. In particular, performance monitoring is used to identify the performance of key kernels in the DNS code, S3D and especially memory intensive loops in the code. Through the careful application of loop transformations, data reuse in cache is exploited thereby reducing memory bandwidth needs, and hence, improving S3D's nodal performance. To enhance collective parallel I/O in S3D, an MPI-I/O caching design is used to construct a two-stage write-behind method for improving the performance of write-only operations. The simulations generate tens of terabytes of data requiring analysis. Interactive exploration of the simulation data is enabled by multivariate time-varying volume visualization. The visualization highlights spatial and temporal correlations between multiple reactive scalar fields using an intuitive user interface based on parallel coordinates and time histogram. Finally, an automated combustion workflow is designed using Kepler to manage large-scale data movement, data morphing, and archival and to provide a graphical display of run-time diagnostics.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2008-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Computational Science and Discovery, an Institute of Physics Journal.","","Medium: X; Size: 32 p.","","SAND2008-5547J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200906%%311","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","948316","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/948316","","Proposed for publication in Computational Science and Discovery, an Institute of Physics Journal.","",""

Traditional supported metal catalysts are easily poisoned by these species which adsorb strongly onto the electron-rich metal clusters. The use of noble metal and/or oxide based catalyst systems may offer higher activity and stability, but only if the metal can be bound into a thermally stable structure. To that end, Rh metal was substituted into the structure of a lanthanum zirconate (LZ) pyrochlore to give La2RhyZr(2 y)O(7-j,) (LRZ) to produce a strongly bound, well-dispersed metal which is active for CPOX. A second catalyst was prepared in which Sr was substituted for a portion of La in the LRZ structure, producing La(2 x)SrxRhyZr(2 y)O(7-j) (LSRZ). Each of these pyrochlore catalysts, including the unsubstituted LZ, were characterized and screened for activity in the CPOX of ntetradecane (TD), which is a surrogate for linear paraffins typical of diesel fuel. Results were compared to a commercial Rh/g-Al2O3 catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns of both the LZ and LRZ showed that each had the cubic unit-cell pyrochlore structure. However, substitution of Sr resulted in a binary perovskite-pyrochlore phase with a defect SrZrO3 phase. Hydrogen pulse chemisorption and temperature programmed reduction studies confirmed that Rh metal was substituted into the structure of the LRZ and LSRZ, and was reducible. Activity screening with the CPOX of TD showed that the Rh substituted in both LRZ and LSRZ is able to retain activity-producing essentially equilibrium synthesis gas yields, as was the Rh/g-Al2O3. Temperature programmed oxidation experiments performed after the CPOX of TD demonstrated that the amount of carbon was quantitatively similar for each catalyst (roughly 0.3 gcarbon/gcatalyst after each run), with the exception of LSRZ, which had significantly less carbon (0.17 gcarbon/gcatalyst). It is speculated that improved oxygen ion mobility in the LSRZ material, which resulted from Sr substitution, was responsible for the reduction in carbon formation on the surface.","Elsevier B.V.","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Catalysis Today; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3-4; Conference: A symposium organized by Division of Fuel Chemistry at the 234th American Chemical Society National Meeting, Boston, MA, Aug. 19-23, 2007","","Medium: X; Size: 206-213","","DOE/NETL-IR-2008-220; NETL-TPR-2011","DE-AC26-04NT41817","Journal ID: ISSN 0920-5861; TRN: US200815%%132","10.1016/j.cattod.2008.02.012","","2016-06-20T00:00:00Z","935137","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/935137","","Catalysis Today","3-4","136"

Numerous studies, both experimental and numerical, have reported that the reduction of particulate emissions depends on the molecular structure of the additives. In this paper, a structural group contribution approach is proposed to interpret experimental observations on the effect of oxygenated additives on the sooting propensities of hydrocarbon fuels. The statistically based method makes it possible to distinguish between chemical effects caused by the presence of oxygenated groups in the fuel mixture and mere dilution of the original fuel by the additive. The analysis was carried out on several experimental databases encompassing both premixed and nonpremixed configurations that include a new extensive set of smoke point measurements for mixtures of a given fuel with several oxygenated molecules. The current approach unifies the conclusions on the relative efficiency of the various oxygenated functionalities such as alcohols, esters, ethers, and carbonyl groups and provides a potential explanation for the seemingly contradictory trends exhibited by some raw experimental data.

Experimentally, a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine was used with DME, n-heptane, and n-decane. Arrhenius plots of the heat release rate in the HCCI experiments showed that rates of heat release with DME, n-heptane, and n-decane exhibited a certain activation energy that is identical to that of the H{sub 2}O{sub 2} decomposition reaction. The same feature was observed in diesel engine operation using ordinary diesel fuel with advanced ignition timing to make ignition occur after the end of fuel injection. These experimental results were reproduced in nondimensional simulations using kinetic mechanisms for DME, n-heptane, and n-decane, the last being developed by extending the n-heptane mechanism. Methanol addition, which suppresses low-temperature oxidation (LTO) and delays the ignition timing, had no effect on the activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius plot of heat release rate. Nevertheless, methanol addition lowered the heat release rates during the prethermal flame process. This is because H{sub 2}O{sub 2} formation during cool flame was reduced by adding methanol. The mechanism during the transition process from cool flame to thermal flame can be explained quantitatively using thermal explosion theory, in which the rate-determining reaction is H{sub 2}O{sub 2} decomposition, assuming that heat release in this period is caused by partial oxidation of DME and HCHO initiated with the reaction with OH produced though H{sub 2}O{sub 2} decomposition.

Transient stretch rates were varied using three different vortex strengths, and the size of the flame kernel at the start of the vortex interaction controlled by time delay between ignition and vortex generation. Vortex interactions with small ({proportional_to}5 mm radius) flame kernels were found to increase burning rates for lean ({phi}=0.64) flame kernels substantially. Burning rates for rich ({phi}=1.13) flames were decreased, with total flame kernel extinction occurring in extreme cases. These small flame kernel-vortex interactions are dominated by transient stretch effects and thermodiffusive stability, in agreement with premixed flame theory. However, vortex interactions with larger methane-air flame kernels ({proportional_to}30 mm radius) led to slight flame speed enhancements for both lean and rich flame kernels, with the flame-vortex process dominated by increased flamefront area generated by vortex-induced flame wrinkling.

"Influence of temperature inhomogeneities on knocking combustion","Poeschl, M; Sattelmayer, T","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; COMBUSTION; COMBUSTION KINETICS; AUTOIGNITION; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; COMPRESSION RATIO; TEMPERATURE RANGE 0273-0400 K; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; KNOCK CONTROL; EXPLOSIONS; FLAME PROPAGATION; RADICALS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; Knocking combustion","The use of a rapid compression and expansion machine (RCEM) provides the possibility of investigating the fundamental kinetic behavior of combustion. The aim of this work is the investigation of the influence of temperature inhomogeneities on the reaction kinetics of knocking combustion under well-known conditions without having random fluctuations. In the RCEM a clearly defined temperature distribution was generated that covers a large area and facilitates the investigation of the influence of a temperature gradient on knocking combustion. The paper deals with the analysis and characterization of the different phases of low-temperature kinetics during knocking as well as nonknocking combustion. Combustion was controlled by ignition timing, variation of the spark plug position, compression ratio, and temperature distribution. The results show the formation of a fast-propagating flame due to local and sequentially progressing autoignitions, which initiate a detonation as a consequence of pressure waves, which progress into an already reacting gas mixture enriched with intermediate species and radicals.

Calculations performed using realistic and temperature-dependent thermal and mass diffusivities indeed substantiate this influence. In particular, the calculated results agree with the literature experimental data, indicating that the gasification mechanism of multicomponent fuels is intermediate between diffusion and distillation limits. Investigation was also performed on gasification at elevated pressures, recognizing that the liquid boiling point and hence the attainable droplet temperature would increase with increasing pressure, causing further weakening of the liquid-phase diffusional resistance. This possibility was again verified through calculated results, suggesting further departure from diffusion limit toward distillation limit behavior for gasification at high pressures. The study also found that diffusional resistance is stronger for the lighter, gasoline-like fuels as compared to the heavier, diesel-like fuels because the former have overall lower boiling points, lower attainable droplet temperatures, and hence lower mass diffusivities in spite of their lower molecular weights.

The length and velocity scales chosen for the vortices are representative of those in the near fields of high-Reynolds-number jets such as those occurring in Diesel engines. The governing equations are solved with sixth-order spatial discretization and fourth-order time integration. Chemistry is modeled as an irreversible single-step reaction. Local extinction along the symmetry axis, followed by reignition, is observed. The extinction is characterized by strong unsteady effects, which are captured well by 1-D transient diffusion flamelet libraries, provided the time-history of the instantaneous scalar dissipation rate is taken into account. On the other hand, reignition is essentially a 2-D phenomenon involving flame-flame interactions, which are favored for smaller vortices and increasing flame curvature. The effects of unsteadiness and curvature on extinction and reignition are carefully assessed through parametric studies involving a range of vortex and flame characteristics. The interaction outcomes are summarized on Reynolds-Damkoehler number (Re-Da) diagrams, which show the combined effects of unsteadiness and curvature on extinction and reignition. The implications of the observed interaction outcomes for turbulent combustion modeling in the near fields of jet diffusion flames are discussed.

The results are applicable to a wide range of compact heat exchangers. For zero swirl, the total pressure loss agrees with established expressions for pressure loss in developing laminar flow in parallel channels with finite wall thickness. For positive swirl, the additional pressure loss due to oblique flow entry is correlated to the tangential velocity upstream of the catalyst, measured using laser-Doppler anemometry. The obtained oblique inlet pressure loss correlation can improve the accuracy of numerical calculations of the flow distribution in catalysts.

Two pistons of different crown shapes (flat-crown and slightly concave-crown pistons) are studied. The inception, establishment, and evolution of the tumbling vortical flow structures during the intake and compression strokes are clearly depicted. Quantitative strengths of the rotating vortical flow motions are presented by a dimensionless parameter, the tumble ratio, which can represent the mean angular velocity of the vortices in the target plane. The turbulence intensity of the in-cylinder flow is also calculated by using the measured time-varying velocity data. The results show that the flat-crown piston induces higher bulk-averaged tumble ratio and turbulence intensity than the slightly concave-crown piston does because the tumble ratio and turbulence generated by the flat-crown piston in the offset planes during the compression stroke are particularly large. The engine with the flat-crown piston also presents larger torque and power outputs and lower hydrocarbon emission than that with the slightly concave-crown piston. This might be caused by the enhanced combustion in the engine cylinder due to the stronger tumble ratio and turbulence intensity.

"Gradient effects on two-color soot optical pyrometry in a heavy-duty DI diesel engine","Musculus, Mark P.B.; Singh, Satbir; Reitz, Rolf D","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; COLOR; DIESEL ENGINES; SOOT; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; COMBUSTION; OPTICAL PYROMETERS; ERRORS; TEMPERATURE RANGE 1000-4000 K; FLUID MECHANICS; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS; Low-temperature combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Soot modeling; Error analysis","Two-color soot optical pyrometry is a widely used technique for measuring soot temperature and volume fraction in many practical combustion devices, but line-of-sight soot temperature and volume fraction gradients can introduce significant uncertainties in the measurements. For diesel engines, these uncertainties usually can only be estimated based on assumptions about the soot property gradients along the line of sight, because full three-dimensional transient diesel soot distribution data are not available. Such information is available, however, from multidimensional computer model simulations, which are phenomenologically based, and have been validated against available in-cylinder soot measurements and diesel engine exhaust soot emissions. Using the model-predicted in-cylinder soot distributions, uncertainties in diesel two-color pyrometry data are assessed, both for a conventional high-sooting, high-temperature combustion (HTC) operating condition, and for a low-sooting, low-temperature combustion (LTC) condition. The simulation results confirm that the two-color soot measurements are strongly biased toward the properties of the hot soot. For the HTC condition, line-of-sight gradients in soot temperature span 600 K, causing relatively large errors. The two-color temperature is 200 K higher than the soot-mass-averaged value, while the two-color volume fraction is 50% lower. For the LTC condition, the two-color measurement errors are half as large as for the HTC condition, because the model-predicted soot temperature gradients along the line of sight are half as large. By contrast, soot temperature and volume fraction gradients across the field of view introduce much smaller errors of less than 50 K in temperature and 20% in volume fraction.

This nozzle configuration provided the spray targeting necessary to contain the direct-injected diesel fuel within the piston bowl for injection timings as early as 70/mD before top dead center. Spray-visualization movies, acquired using a high-speed camera, show that impingement of liquid fuel on the piston surface can result when the in-cylinder temperature and density at the time of injection are sufficiently low. Seven single- and two-parameter sweeps around a 4.82-bar gross indicated mean effective pressure load point were performed to map the sensitivity of the combustion and emissions to variations in injection timing, injection pressure, equivalence ratio, simulated exhaust-gas recirculation, intake temperature, intake boost pressure, and load. High-speed movies of natural luminosity were acquired by viewing through a window in the cylinder wall and through a window in the piston to provide quasi-3D information about the combustion process. These movies revealed that advanced combustion phasing resulted in intense pool fires within the piston bowl, after the end of significant heat release. These pool fires are a result of fuel-films created when the injected fuel impinged on the piston surface. The emissions results showed a strong correlation with pool-fire activity. Smoke and NO/dx emissions rose steadily as pool-fire intensity increased, whereas HC and CO showed a dramatic increase with near-zero pool-fire activity.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in the Transactions of the Society of Automotive Engineers.","","Medium: X; Size: 26 p.","","SAND2008-2481J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200907%%220","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","948722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/948722","","Proposed for publication in the Transactions of the Society of Automotive Engineers.","",""

For both fuels tested, a No. 2 certificationdiesel and a low sulfur diesel (BP-15), high particle concentrationsand emission rates were mainly associated with heavyengine acceleration, high speed, and high torque during transientcycles. Averaged over the FTP transient cycle, the particle numberconcentration during tests with the certification fuel was 1.2e8/cm3,about four times the particle number concentration observed duringtests using the BP-15 fuel. The effect of each engine parameteron particle emissions was studied. During tests using BP-15, theparticle number emission rate was mainly controlled by the enginespeed and torque, whereas for Certification fuel, the engineacceleration also had a strong effect on number emission rates.The effects of active regenerations of a diesel NOx adsorber onparticle emissions were also characterized for two catalyst regenerationstrategies: Delayed Extended Main (DEM) and Post 80 injection(Post80). Particle volume concentrations observed duringDEM regenerations were much higher than those during Post80 regenerations, and the minimum air to fuel ratio achieved duringthe regenerations had little effect on particle emission for bothstrategies. This study provides valuable information for developingstrategies that minimize the particle formation during activeregenerations of NOx adsorbers.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The experimental work was focused on the measurement of compressor behaviour within the surge zone by means of a specifically designed facility. The presented model is based on the introduction of a fluid inertia term that accounts for the non quasi steady effects and the use of a compressor map extended to the surge and negative flows zone obtained from experimental tests. The compressor model was implemented in a one-dimensional gas-dynamic model. The comparison of the modelled and measured evolution of instantaneous pressure during deep surge operation shows good agreement. Furthermore, the model is also able to predict the amplitude and frequency of pressure pulses when the compressor operates in surge with different outlet duct lengths.

A five-leg inverter is employed in the drive system; three of the inverter legs are for a main traction motor, but only two are needed for a three-phase auxiliary motor by utilizing the neutral point of the traction motor. An integrated drive with reduced component count is therefore achieved by eliminating one inverter leg and its gate drivers. A modified current control scheme based on the rotor flux orientation principle is presented.

These will be necessary to accommodate existing 14-V loads as well as efficiently handle new heavy loads at the 42-V net and a traction drive on the HV bus. A low-cost DC-DC converter was proposed for connecting the three voltage nets. It minimizes the number of switches and their associated gate driver components by using two half-bridges and a high-frequency transformer. Another salient feature is that the half bridge on the 42-V bus is also utilized to provide the 14-V bus by operating at duty ratios around an atypical value of 1/3. Moreover, it makes use of the parasitic capacitance of the switches and the transformer leakage inductance for soft switching. The use of half bridges makes the topology well suited for interleaved multiphase modular configurations as a means to increase the power level because the capacitor legs can be shared. This paper presents simulation and experimental results on an interleaved two-phase arrangement rated at 4.5 kW. Also discussed are the benefits of operating with an atypical duty ratio on the transformer and a preferred multiphase configuration to minimize capacitor ripple currents.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Characterization of the functional groups of a wide selection of PM samples (woodsmoke, diesel soot, urban air PM) was carried out using the soft X-ray spectroscopy capabilities at the synchrotron radiation sources in Berkeley (ALS) and Brookhaven (NSLS). The spectra reveal that diesel exhaust particulate (DEP) matter is made up from a semigraphitic solid core and soluble organic matter, predominantly with carboxylic functional groups. Woodsmoke PM has no or a less prevalent, graphitic signature, instead it contains carbon-hydroxyl groups. Using these features to apportion the carbonaceous PM in ambient samples we estimate that the relative contribution of DEP to ambient PM in an urban area such as Lexington, KY and St. Louis, MO is 7% and 13.5%, respectively. These values are comparable to dispersion modeling data from nonurban and urban areas in California, and with elemental carbon measurements in urban locations such as Boston, MA, Rochester, NY, and Washington, DC.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

That implies that the quantity of liquid fuel from biomass and the carbon dioxide released in the production process strongly depend upon the energy source used in the conversion process. Each year, the United States could produce about 1.3 billion tons of renewable biomass for use as fuel. Burning it would release about as much energy as burning 10 million barrels of diesel fuel per day. If converted to ethanol, the biomass would have the energy value of about five million barrels of diesel fuel per day. The remainder of the energy would be used by the biomass-to-liquids conversion plant. If a nuclear reactor or other energy source provides the energy for the biomass-to-liquids plants, the equivalent of over 12 million barrels of diesel fuel can be produced per day. If our goal is to end oil imports and avoid greenhouse-gas releases, we must combine biomass and nuclear energy to maximize biofuels production.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The reduction process included flux analysis, ignition sensitivity analysis, and optimization of reaction rate constants under constant volume conditions. The current reduced mechanism consists of 41 species and 150 reactions and gives predictions in excellent agreement with those of the comprehensive mechanism. In order to validate the mechanism under biodiesel-fueled engine conditions, it was combined with another skeletal mechanism for n-heptane oxidation. This combined reaction mechanism, ERC-Bio, contains 53 species and 156 reactions, which can be used for diesel/biodiesel blend engine simulations.

Monolithic catalysts were prepared, corresponding to loadings of 0, 50 and 100 g CeO2/L, together with a catalyst containing 100 g/L of ceria-zirconia (Ce0.7Zr0.3O2). Loadings of the other main components (Pt, Rh and BaO) were held constant. Catalyst evaluation was performed on a bench flow reactor under simulated diesel exhaust conditions, employing NOx storage/reduction cycles. NOx storage efficiency in the temperature range 150-350 C was observed to increase with ceria loading, resulting in higher NOx conversion levels. At 150 C, high rich phase NOx slip was observed for all of the catalysts, resulting from an imbalance in the rates of nitrate decomposition and NOx reduction. Optimal NOx conversion was obtained in the range 250-350 C for all the catalysts, while at 450 C high rich phase NOx slip from the most highly loaded ceria-containing catalyst resulted in lower NOx conversion than for the ceria-free formulation. N2O was the major NOx reduction product at 150 C over all of the catalysts, although low NOx conversion levels limited the N2O yield. At higher temperatures N2 was the main product of NOx reduction, although NH3 formation was also observed. Selectivity to NH3 decreased with increasing ceria loading, indicating that NH3 is consumed by reaction with stored oxygen in the rear of the catalyst.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We then use the estimated mixture properties in computational simulations to gauge the extent to which combustion is modified when biodiesel is substituted for conventional diesel fuel. Our simulation studies included both regular diesel combustion (DI) and premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI). Preliminary results indicate that biodiesel ignition is significantly delayed due to slower liquid evaporation, with the effects being more pronounced for DI than PCCI. The lower vapor pressure and higher liquid heat capacity of biodiesel are two key contributors to this slower rate of evaporation. Other physical properties are more similar between the two fuels, and their impacts are not clearly evident in the present study. Future studies of diesel combustion sensitivity to both physical and chemical properties of biodiesel are suggested.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Accurate predictions of such heat transfer phenomena require high temperature thermal properties. However, a review of vessel and structural steel material properties in severe accident analysis codes reveals that the required high temperature material properties are extrapolated, with little if any, data above 700 ºC. To reduce uncertainties in predictions relying upon this extrapolated high temperature data, INL obtained data using laser-flash thermal diffusivity techniques for two metals used in LWR vessels: SA533B1 carbon steel, which is used to fabricate most US LWR reactor vessels; and SS304, which is used in LWR vessel piping, penetration tubes, and internal structures. This paper summarizes the new data, compares it to existing data in the literature, and provides recommended correlations for thermal properties based on this data.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Four single-component fuels with well-established kinetic models were chosen: n-heptane, iso-octane, ethanol, and toluene. These fuels were chosen because they span a wide range of fuel chemistries, and produce a wide compositions range of complete stoichiometric products (CSP). The simulated engine conditions combined a typical spark ignition engine compression ratio (11.34) and high intake charge temperatures (500-550 K) that are relevant to NVO HCCI. It was found that over the conditions investigated, all the fuels had overlapping start of combustion (SOC) phasing, despite the wide range in octane number (RON = 0 to 120). The effect of the EGR components CO2 and H2O was to suppress the compression temperature because of their higher heat capacities, which retarded SOC. For a concentration of O2 higher than the stoichiometric amount, or excess O2, there was an effect of advancing SOC for n-heptane, iso-octane, and toluene, but SOC for ethanol was not advanced. Low temperature heat release (LTHR) for n-heptane was also found to be highly dependent on excess O2, and mild endothermic reaction was observed for cases when excess O2 was not present.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Wavelength-agile absorption spectroscopy is an optical technique that measures broadband absorption spectra between 10kHz and 100 MHz. From these measured spectra, gas temperature and absorber concentration can be determined. The Fourier-domain mode-locking (FDML) laser is becoming recognized as one of the most robust and reliable wavelength-agile sources available. H2O concentration measurements during combustion events at crank angle resolved speeds are beneficial for a wide variety of applications, such as product improvements for industry, control and reliability checks for experimental researchers, and measures of fit for numerical simulations. The difficulties associated with measuring diesel exhaust compared to in-cylinder measurements are discussed. A full description of the experimental configuration and data processing is explained. Measurements of engine exhaust H2O transients with 10- s temporal resolution are presented for a range of engine conditions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Increasing FRP was shown to reduce the overall soot and total PM mass for four operating conditions. These conditions included two high speed conditions (2400 rpm at 540 and 270 Nm of torque) and two moderated speed conditions (1400 rpm at 488 and 325 Nm). The concentrations of CO2 and NOx increased with fuel rail pressure and this is attributed to improved fuel-air mixing. Interestingly, the level of unburned hydrocarbons remained constant (or increased slightly) with increased FRP. PM concentration was measured using an AVL smoke meter and scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS); and total PM was collected using standard gravimetric techniques. These results showed that the smoke number and particulate concentrations decrease with increasing FRP. However the decrease becomes more gradual as very high rail pressures. Additionally, the total PM decreased with increasing FRP; however, the soluble organic fraction (SOF) reaches a maximum after which it declines with higher rail pressure. The total PM was collected for the two 1400 rpm conditions downstream of the engine, diesel oxidation catalyst, and a urea-SCR catalyst. The results show that significant PM reduction occurs in the SCR catalyst even during high rates of urea dosage. Analysis of the PM indicates that residual SOF is burned up in the SCR catalyst.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Numerous experimental studies of the transition between conventional spark-ignited (SI) propagating-flame combustion and HCCI combustion in gasoline engines with spark assist have demonstrated a high degree of deterministic coupling between successive combustion events. Analysis of this coupling suggests that the transition between SI and HCCI can be described as a sequence of bifurcations in a low-dimensional dynamic map. In this paper, we describe methods for utilizing the deterministic relationship between cycles to extract global kinetic rate parameters that can be used to discriminate multiple distinct combustion states and develop a more quantitative understanding of the SI-HCCI transition. We demonstrate the application of these methods for indolene-containing fuels and point out an apparent HCCI mode switching not previously reported. Our results have specific implications for developing dynamic combustion models and feedback control strategies that utilize spark assist to expand the operating range of HCCI combustion.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

These additives provide effective wear protection and friction control on engine parts through formation of a glassy polyphosphate antiwear film. However, the deposition of phosphorus species on automotive catalytic converters from lubricants has been known for some time to have a detrimental effect of poisoning the catalysts. To mitigate the situation, the industry has been making every effort to find ZDDP-replacement additives that are friendly to catalysts. Toward this goal we have investigated a titanium additive chemistry as a ZDDP replacement. Fully formulated engine oils incorporating this additive component have been found to be effective in reducing wear and controlling friction in a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR), 4-ball bench wear, Sequence IIIG, and Sequence IVA engine tests. Surface analysis of the tested parts by Auger electron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have shown that Ti species have been incorporated into the wear tracks and can only be found on the wear tracks. We used synchrotron based near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) to investigate the chemical bonding mechanism of the Ti additive with the metal surface that affects the wear improvement mechanism. We postulate that Ti provides antiwear enhancement through inclusion in the metal/metal oxide structure of the ferrous surface by forming FeTiO3.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The mini-dilution tunnel studied had a 3.175 mm inside diameter tube discharging on the centerline of the tunnel where the diameter increases in a single step to 7.62 cm. The large diameter portion of the tunnel was 75 cm long. Most of the testing was performed at a flow rate of 15 l/min. The experimental investigation indicates that the flow field in the particular dilution tunnel tested has a persistent jet throughout its length, and this confined jet creates eddy recirculation zones which may cause the temperature and dilution histories of particles trapped in these eddies to be significantly different than particles which remain in the jet until extracted by the sample probe. Similarly, the location of the sample probe could also affect measured size distribution profiles, particularly if it were moved in or out of the path of the persistent jet. In addition to the simple tunnel geometry with a single abrupt expansion, a conical diffuser and a perforated plate were separately tested to investigate their effects on the tunnel fluid dynamics. The particular diffuser tested appeared to cause the jet to stall and therefore led to an even more unpredictable path for the fluid within. Limited testing with the perforated plate indicated that it increased the jet deceleration and laminarization, and therefore could lead to a more predictable flow path for aerosol sampled from the tunnel.

Even modest changes in fuel composition or operating conditions can lead to damaging vibrations in a combustor that was otherwise stable. For this reason, active control has been sought to stabilize combustors that must accommodate fuel variability, new operating conditions, etc. Active control of combustion dynamics has been demonstrated in a number of laboratories, single-nozzle test combustors, and even on a fielded engine. In most of these tests, active control was implemented with closed-loop feedback between the observed pressure signal and the phase and gain of imposed fuel perturbations. In contrast, a number of recent papers have shown that open-loop fuel perturbations can disrupt the feedback between acoustics and heat release that drives the oscillation. Compared to the closed-loop case, this approach has some advantages because it may not require high-fidelity fuel actuators, and could be easier to implement. This paper reports experimental tests of open-loop fuel perturbations to control combustion dynamics in a complete gas turbine engine. Results demonstrate the technique was very successful on the test engine and had minimal effect on pollutant emissions.","ASME International, New York, NY","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the ASME: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International Mechanical Engineering Conference, Anaheim, CA, November 13-19, 2004 (Proceedings paper # IMECE2004-59702)","","Medium: X; Size: 38-48","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-244","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN; 0742-4795; eISSN; 1528-8919; TRN: US200822%%391","10.1115/1.2204978","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","917418","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/917418","","Transactions of the ASME: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","129"

The velocity field and the mixture fraction distributions have been measured with laser Doppler velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of acetone, respectively. Successful and failed ignition events have been visualized by high-speed and OH PLIF imaging. The results show that the stability limits are much wider than the ignitability limits, but with swirl, they become closer. The mixture fraction distribution shows high sensitivity to any change in the fuel and air velocities, with the mixture inside the central recirculation zone (CRZ) tending to be relatively well-mixed and rich. Visualization of different spark realizations shows that successful ignition events manage to initiate a flame at the separation corner of the bluff body and that the direction of initial flame propagation depends more on the ignition location than on the flow conditions due to the convection of the flame kernel by the mean flow. With successful spark events inside the CRZ the flame expands in all directions, up to a certain point, when it starts forming the shape of the stable flame. The highest P{sub ign} was close to the CRZ boundaries with low P{sub ign} or no ignition inside CRZ when the mixture there was rich. Under conditions where the CRZ is not close to the rich flammability limit, P{sub ign} is substantial. Downstream of the CRZ, P{sub ign} is uniform but low due to the adverse velocity. The probability of just initiating a kernel is higher than P{sub ign}, especially, in the area above the CRZ. With swirl, the highest P{sub ign} is at the burner exit, with no ignition inside the CRZ because the mixture is too lean. The data highlight the difference between P{sub ign} and the probability of kernel initiation and the flammability factor F (the probability of finding a mixture within the nominal flammability limits) and emphasize that flame propagation in inhomogeneous mixtures must be captured by any model that aims to simulate ignition of nonpremixed flame burners.

Without secondary fuel injection, large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations were observed in the experiment. With constant injection of secondary fuel, the oscillation amplitude was reduced and with harmonic feedback injection, it was further reduced. In this process, the flame shape and the dynamic behavior of the flame were changed. To fill the gap of the experimental data and to understand the flame dynamics, large eddy simulations are carried out. The LES results show that the oscillation reduction is attributable to the roles of both the main flame and the secondary flame. The interaction of the main flame and the vortices is reduced when the injection is on; namely, heat fluctuation is reduced. The secondary flame helps the flame base stabilization and directly modulates the heat release in the feedback injection. The phase relations between the pressure, secondary heat release, and injection velocity are also shown. With these effects from the main and secondary flames combined, the oscillations are suppressed by secondary fuel injection. The present study indicates that LES can be a tool to understand flame dynamics with control.

One approach to favorably address these issues is to achieve homogeneous charge combustion and stratified charge combustion at lower peak temperatures with a variable compression ratio, a variable intake temperature and a trapped rate of the EGR using NVO (negative valve overlap). This experiment was attempted to investigate the origins of these lower temperature auto-ignition phenomena with SCCI and CAI using gasoline fuel. In case of SCCI, the combustion and emission characteristics of gasoline-fueled stratified-charge compression ignition (SCCI) engine according to intake temperature and compression ratio was examined. We investigated the effects of air-fuel ratio, residual EGR rate and injection timing on the CAI combustion area.

The scavenging flow consists of 16 round jets in close proximity of each other and the cylinder wall, developing from the top of the combustion chamber down towards the exhaust ports located along the wall at the bottom of the cylinder. Flow visualization of the scavenging flow was performed using a scaled fixed-piston water model and was used as a means of validating the URANS simulations themselves. The flow visualization experiments provided insight into the complex jet-jet and jet-wall interactions within the engine cylinder. These interactions were not as well predicted by the CFD simulations. In fact, the CFD simulations were found to significantly under-predict the turbulent mixing between the jets. This suggests that unsteady-RANS formulations are incapable of reproducing the large-scale and unsteady mixing structures associated with the vortex shedding between the closely-spaced jets.

Flame temperature profiles were measured by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of seeded NO. Two ethanol/oxygen/argon flames with stoichiometries of {phi}=1.00 and {phi}=2.57 were investigated at 50 mbar by EI-MBMS. Profiles of a variety of stable and radical species were measured as a function of height above the burner. The benzene profile in the fuel-rich ethanol flame was obtained by REMPI-MBMS. The same technique was used to determine the dependence of the benzene concentration on the ethanol/propene ratio in low-pressure flames with blended fuels (propene/ethanol/oxygen/argon). The C/O ratio of all blends was kept constant at C/O=0.773 or C/O=0.600. Ethanol addition ranged from 0 to 15% for flames with C/O=0.773, and from 0 to 100% for flames with C/O=0.600. In both data sets, a decrease of the benzene concentration with increasing ethanol percentage was observed. Qualitative information on some other aromatic species with higher mass was also obtained.

Sequential images were captured for each experiment. The results indicate the existence of two ignition regimes. In one domain, ignition is rapid, typically less than 76 {mu}s, and ignition occurs simultaneously throughout the test volume. In the other domain, reaction fronts form and propagate within the test volume prior to volumetric ignition. The data span equivalence ratios from {phi}=0.20 to 1.98, with inert/O{sub 2} gas ratios from 1.38 to 5.89, pressures from 8.7 to 16.6 atm, and temperatures from 903 to 1020 K. The transition between the two regimes is discussed in the context of the mixture composition and experimental conditions. The analysis shows that the fuel mole fraction is a key parameter dictating the boundary between the modes of ignition. Below a critical mole fraction limit, volumetric ignition is observed; above the critical limit, reaction fronts are consistently present prior to volumetric ignition. The ignition delay times for both ignition regimes are well reproduced using a homogeneous simulation with detailed reaction chemistry, when the state conditions are modified to account for the presence of the reaction fronts. The results are discussed in terms of proposed reaction chemistry, ignition theory, and previous studies of iso-octane ignition.

A chemistry mechanism with 33 species and 64 reactions was adopted to describe the chemical reactions. The Eulerian method is employed to solve the carrier-gas flow field and the Lagrangian method is used to track the liquid-fuel droplets. Two-way coupling interaction is considered through the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between the carrier-gas fluid and the liquid-fuel spray. The initial carrier-gas temperature was 1500 K. Six cases were simulated with different droplet radii (from 10 to 30 {mu}m) and two initial velocities (100 and 150 m/s). From the simulations, it was found that evaporative cooling and turbulence mixing play important roles in the ignition of liquid-fuel spray jets. Ignition first occurs at the edges of the jets where the fuel mixture is lean, and the scalar dissipation rate and the vorticity magnitude are very low. For smaller droplets, ignition occurs later than for larger droplets due to increased evaporative cooling. Higher initial droplet velocity enhances turbulence mixing and evaporative cooling. For smaller droplets, higher initial droplet velocity causes the ignition to occur earlier, whereas for larger droplets, higher initial droplet velocity delays the ignition time.

Simulations employ a comprehensive numerical model that uses detailed descriptions of transport and chemistry (GRI-2.11 mechanism) and includes radiation effects. It is demonstrated that a complete partially premixed regime, which extends from premixed flames to triple flames and then to double flames, can be simulated by suitably varying the equivalence ratios in the fuel-rich and fuel-lean streams, while maintaining the global equivalence ratio fixed. Both counterflow and coflow simulations show that NO{sub x} emissions decrease significantly from the premixed to the triple flame regime, and then increase from the triple to the double flame regime. Therefore, triple flames not only extend the rich and the lean flammability limits, but also exhibit superior NO{sub x} characteristics compared to the corresponding premixed flames and double flames, with thermal, prompt, NNH-intermediate, and N{sub 2}O-intermediate routes being the important contributors (in descending order) to NO{sub x} formation. Coflow and counterflow flames exhibit qualitatively similar NO{sub x} characteristics in the entire partially premixed regime and an optimum level of partial premixing that yields the lowest NO{sub x} emission. The quantitative differences in NO{sub x} emissions between the two configurations can be attributed to geometry-dependent effects. In particular, compared to counterflow flames, the coflow flames have significantly larger flame volume and therefore lower peak temperature and NO{sub x} emission index in the triple flame regime.

In order to investigate spray behavior, the spray velocity is obtained through the PIV method a useful optical diagnostics technology and the vorticity calculated from the spray velocity component. These results elucidated the relationship between vorticity and entropy which plays an important role in the diffusion process for early injection and the stratification process for late injection cases. In addition, the homogeneous diffusion rate of spray was quantified using the entropy analysis based on Boltzmann's statistical thermodynamics. Using these methods, it was found that the homogeneous mixture distribution is more effective as a momentum dissipation of surrounding air than that of the spray concentration to increase the injection timing. It is found that the homogenous diffusion rate increased as the injection timing moved to the early intake stroke process, and BTDC 60 was the most efficient injection timing for the stratified mixture formation during the compression stroke.

Four suppression additives, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), were used in the experiments. The effectiveness of inhibition of HCCI combustion with various additives was compared under the same equivalence ratio of total fuel and partial equivalence ratio of n-heptane. The experimental results show that the suppression effectiveness increases in the order MTBE &lt; isopropanol &lt;&lt; ethanol &lt; methanol. But ethanol is the best additive when the operating ranges, indicated thermal efficiency, and emissions are considered. For ethanol/n-heptane HCCI combustion, partial combustion may be observed when the mole ratio of ethanol to that of total fuel is larger than 0.20; misfires occur when the mole ratio of ethanol to that of total fuel larger than 0.25. Moreover, CO emissions strongly depend on the maximum combustion temperature, while HC emissions are mainly dominated by the mole ratio of ethanol to that of total fuel. To obtain chemical mechanistic informations relevant to the ignition behavior, detailed chemical kinetic analysis was conducted. The simulated results also confirmed the retarding of the ignition timing by ethanol addition. In addition, it can be found from the simulation that HCHO, CO, and C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH could not be oxidized completely and are maintained at high levels if the partial combustion or misfire occurs (for example, for leaner fuel/air mixture).

It has been demonstrated that, consistent with previous experimental results for hydrogen and acetylene, the increased scalar dissipation rate created by faster co-flowing air delays autoignition, as revealed by a disproportionate increase of ignition length with air velocity. The predicted mean and variance of the mixture fraction, the mixture fraction PDF and the conditional scalar dissipation rate are in good agreement with experimental results obtained with acetone-tracer PLIF. The first-order, spatially averaged CMC model reproduces the experimental trends quite well, despite the neglect of conditional fluctuations and spatial dependence of the conditional averages. This is attributed to the fact that for a significant period of time before autoignition the conditional scalar dissipation rate at the most reactive mixture fraction is much smaller than the critical value above which autoignition is precluded.

The emulsions were different in terms of concentration and size of the dispersed phase. The study was carried out in a single droplet combustion chamber. The size of droplets varied between 400 {mu}m and 1200 {mu}m. They were suspended to a bare thermocouple and, hence, their temperature during combustion was measured. High-speed digital shadowgraphy was used to follow droplets evolution. The main features of the droplet combustion were recognized. The general combustion behavior of emulsions is intermediate with respect to pure PO and commercial diesel oil. Emulsion droplets underwent strong swelling and microexplosion phenomena. However, under the investigated conditions, the microexplosions were ineffective in destroying droplets. The size distribution of the dispersed PO droplets in the range 3-10 {mu}m was not effective either for determining the overall thermal behavior or for the efficacy of the microexplosions. The homogeneous combustion phase resulted identical for emulsions and diesel oil despite the emulsions composition (i.e., concentration of oil, surfactant and co-surfactant, as well as the size of the oil droplets in the emulsion) and the different structure of the flame and also its time and spatial evolution.

The toluene submechanism added to the Lawrence Livermore Primary Reference Fuel (PRF) mechanism was developed using recent shock tube autoignition delay time data under conditions relevant to HCCI combustion. For two-component fuels the model was validated against recent high-pressure shock tube autoignition delay time data for a mixture consisting of 35% n-heptane and 65% toluene by liquid volume. Important features of the autoignition of the mixture proved to be cross-acceleration effects, where hydroperoxy radicals produced during n-heptane oxidation dramatically increased the oxidation rate of toluene compared to the case when toluene alone was oxidized. Rate constants for the reaction of benzyl and hydroperoxyl radicals previously used in the modeling of the oxidation of toluene alone were untenably high for modeling of the mixture. To model both systems it was found necessary to use a lower rate and introduce an additional branching route in the reaction between benzyl radicals and O{sub 2}. Good agreement between experiments and predictions was found when the model was validated against shock tube autoignition delay data for gasoline surrogate fuels consisting of mixtures of 63-69% isooctane, 14-20% toluene, and 17% n-heptane by liquid volume. Cross reactions such as hydrogen abstractions between toluene and alkyl and alkylperoxy radicals and between the PRF were introduced for completion of chemical description. They were only of small importance for modeling autoignition delays from shock tube experiments, even at low temperatures. A single-zone engine model was used to evaluate how well the validated mechanism could capture autoignition behavior of toluene reference fuels in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. The model could qualitatively predict the experiments, except in the case with boosted intake pressure, where the initial temperature had to be increased significantly in order to predict the point of autoignition.

Experiments were performed by delivering a premixed charge of vaporized fuel and air and increasing the compression ratio in a stepwise manner to increase the extent of reaction while monitoring the exhaust composition via Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and collecting condensable exhaust gas for subsequent gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Each fuel demonstrated a two-stage ignition process, with a low-temperature heat release (LTHR) event followed by the main combustion, or high-temperature heat release (HTHR). Among the three diesel-relevant fuels, the magnitude of LTHR was highest for GTL diesel, followed by methyl decanoate, and conventional diesel fuel last. FTIR analysis of the exhaust for n-heptane, the conventional diesel surrogate, and the GTL diesel surrogate revealed that LTHR produces high concentrations of aldehydes and CO while producing only negligible amounts of CO{sub 2}. Methyl decanoate differed from the other two-stage ignition fuels only in that there were significant amounts of CO{sub 2} produced during LTHR; this was the result of decarboxylation of the ester group, not the result of oxidation. GC/MS analysis of LTHR exhaust condensate for n-heptane revealed high concentrations of 2,5-heptanedione, a di-ketone that can be closely tied to species in existing autoignition models for n-heptane. GC/MS analysis of the LTHR condensate for conventional diesel fuel and GTL diesel fuel revealed a series of high molecular weight aldehydes and ketones, which were expected, as well as a series of organic acids, which are not commonly reported as products of combustion. The GC/MS analysis of the methyl decanoate exhaust condensate revealed that the aliphatic chain acts similarly to n-paraffins during LTHR, while the ester group remains intact. Thus, although the FTIR data revealed that decarboxylation occurs at significant levels for methyl decanoate, it was concluded that this occurs after the aliphatic chain has been largely consumed by other LTHR reactions.

"The fate of metal (Fe) during diesel combustion: Morphology, chemistry, and formation pathways of nanoparticles","Miller, Art; Ahlstrand, Gib; Kittelson, David; Zachariah, Michael","02 PETROLEUM; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; IRON; CARBON; DIESEL FUELS; PARTICULATES; COMBUSTION; NANOSTRUCTURES; DOPED MATERIALS; FERROCENE; SOOT; MORPHOLOGY; AGGLOMERATION","This report describes an investigation in which we used iron-doped diesel fuel to generate metal-bearing diesel particles and a subsequent analysis of the particles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). For this study, DPM was generated by a 1.5-L diesel engine and the fuel was doped with ferrocene to enhance the level of iron in the system. The exhaust particles were collected on TEM grids and analyzed using the Philips CM12 TEM/EDS instrument. Results show that when the iron-to-carbon (soot) ratio (Fe/C) in the engine is low, the exhaust particles have morphologies similar to those for the undoped case, but at a threshold Fe/C value of 0.013 (for this engine), homogeneously nucleated metallic nanoparticles are formed and begin agglomerating. The number and size of these nanoparticles increase with level of doping. Metal-bearing particles that span a wider size range are also formed. Agglomeration of metallic and carbon particles is observed in two distinct modes: attachment of iron primary particles (5-10 nm in diameter) to carbon agglomerates, and coagulation of iron agglomerates (20-200 nm in diameter) with carbon agglomerates. Results of this work imply that as new engine technologies reduce soot levels in the engine and/or levels of trace metals in the fuel are increased, the generation of metallic nanoparticles may ensue, creating a potential health concern.

One experimental method for the isolation of FD residue from radionuclide metals involves using solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers to remove the residues of interest. Due to their high affinity for organics, SPME fibers should have little affinity for most (radioactive) metals. The focus of this research was to develop an examination protocol that was applicable to safe work in facilities where high radiation doses are shielded from the workers (as in radioactive shielded cells or ''hot cells''). We also examined the affinity of stable radionuclide surrogate metals (Co, Ir, Re, Ni, Ba, Cs, Nb, Zr and Nd) for sorption by the SPME fibers. This was done under exposure conditions that favor the uptake of FD residues under conditions that will provide little contact between the SPME and the FD material (such as charred carpet or wood that contains commonly-used accelerants). Our results from mass spectrometric analyses indicate that SPME fibers show promise for use in the room temperature head space uptake of organic FD residue (namely, diesel fuel oil, kerosene, gasoline and paint thinner) with subsequent analysis by gas chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometric (MS) detection.

The chemical sensor is an ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) device used to detect a chemical marker in diesel fuel. The detection limit is the lowest concentration of the marker in diesel fuel that obtains the desired true-positive probability (TPP) and false-positive probability (FPP). A TPP of 0.90 and a FPP of 0.10 were selected as acceptable levels for the field sensor in this study. The detection limit under realistic operating conditions is found to be between to 2 to 4 ppm (w/w). The upper value is the detection limit under challenging conditions. The ROC-based detection limit is very reliable because it is determined from multiple and repetitive sensor analyses under realistic circumstances. ROC curves also clearly illustrate and gauge the effects data preprocessing and sampling environments have on the sensor’s detection limit.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Then it was extended to three dimensions so we could consider the geometrical features, which are critical in large cells for automotive applications. The three-dimensional model captures the shapes and dimensions of cell components and the spatial distributions of materials and temperatures, and is used to simulate oven tests, and to determine how a local hot spot can propagate through the cell. In simulations of oven abuse testing of cells with cobalt oxide cathode and graphite anode with standard LiPF6 electrolyte, the three-dimensional model predicts that thermal runaway will occur sooner or later than the lumped model, depending on the size of the cell. The model results showed that smaller cells reject heat faster than larger cells; this may prevent them from going into thermal runaway under identical abuse conditions. In simulations of local hot spots inside a large cylindrical cell, the three-dimensional model predicts that the reactions initially propagate in the azimuthal and longitudinal directions to form a hollow cylinder-shaped reaction zone.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Combustion experiments were performed in a single cylinder HCCI engine using blends of soy biodiesel in ultra low sulfur diesel, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 vol% and equivalence ratios ( ) from 0.38 to 0.48. Data from the engine tests included combustion analysis and exhaust composition analysis with standard gaseous emissions equipment. The engine utilized a custom port fuel injection strategy to provide highly premixed charges of fuel and air, making it possible to compare the results with single zone chemical kinetics simulations that were performed using CHEMKIN III, with a reaction set including 670 species and over 3000 reactions. The reaction mechanism incorporated equations for the combustion of a paraffinic fuel, n-heptane, and an oxygenated component, methyl butanoate, as well as reactions for the formation of NOx. The zero-dimensional model did a reasonably good job of predicting the HCCI combustion event, correctly predicting intake temperature effects on the phasing of both low temperature heat release (LTHR) and the main combustion event. It also did a good job of predicting the magnitude of LTHR. Differences between the simulation and experimental data included the dependence on biodiesel concentration and the duration of both LTHR and the main combustion event. The probable reasons for these differences are the changing derived cetane number (DCN) of the model fuel blend with biodiesel concentration, and the inability of the model to account for stratification of temperature and . The simulation also showed that concentrations of intermediate species produced during LTHR are dependent on the magnitude of LTHR, but otherwise the addition of biodiesel has no discernable effect.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

During an aging cycle, fuel is injected into the exhaust to achieve reproducible exotherms under lean and rich conditions with the average temperature approximating the target temperature. Aging is performed until the cycle-average NOx conversion measured at 400 C is approximately constant. Engine-based NOx conversion decreased by 42% after 60 cycles at 600 C, 36% after 76 cycles at 700 C and 57% after 46 cycles at 800 C. The catalyst samples were removed and characterized by XRD and using a microreactor that allowed controlled measurements of surface area, precious metal size, NOx storage, and reaction rates. Three aging mechanisms responsible for the deactivation of LNTs have been identified: (i) loss of dispersion of the precious metals, (ii) phase transitions in the washcoat materials, and (iii) loss of surface area of the storage component and support. These three mechanisms are accelerated when the aging temperature exceeds 850 C--the {gamma} to {delta} transition temperature of Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Normalization of rates of NO reacted at 400 C to total surface area demonstrates the biggest impact on performance stems from surface area losses rather than from precious metal sintering.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Scuffing, as a mode of failure, severely limits injector life, and new materials and processes are required to resist scuffing in these more stringent operating conditions. Consequently, there is a need to test the ability of candidate fuel system materials to resist scuffing in fuel-lubricated environments. This paper describes a pin-on-twin reciprocating wear test in which a cylindrical specimen slides, under load, across two fixed, parallel cylindrical specimens that are perpendicular to the axis of the upper sliding specimen. Cylinders of annealed AISI 52100 were tested dry and lubricated by Jet A fuel and on-highway no. 2 diesel fuel. The friction force was found to give a reliable real-time determination of the onset of scuffing as verified by the morphology of the wear scar. The scar width and surface roughness profiles either did not reliably detect the onset or were difficult to carry out with this geometry.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Experiments were conducted by performing CR sweeps at multiple intake temperatures using both unthrottled operation, and constant equivalence ratio conditions by throttling to compensate for varying air density. It was found that CR is effective at changing and controlling HCCI combustion phasing midpoint, denoted here as CA 50. Thermal efficiency was a strong function of CA 50, with overly advanced CA 50 leading to efficiency decreases. Increases in CR at a constant CA 50 for a given fuel composition did, in most cases, increase efficiency, but the relationship was weaker than the dependence of efficiency on CA 50. The increase in efficiency with higher CR was fuel-dependent, so that the fuels requiring a higher CR to achieve ignition did not gain a proportionate efficiency increase. For example, n-heptane achieved an indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of 38% at a CR of 9:1, whereas a 50 wt% blend of toluene with n-heptane required a CR of 12:1 to achieve the same ITE. A simple heat balance around the engine showed that higher toluene content fuels had higher cooling losses. The high toluene fuels exhibited higher rates of maximum pressure rise than the lower octane fuels. The increased cooling losses can be attributed to the higher pressure rise rates, which are a driving force for heat transfer.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Analysis to aid the design of such vehicles and predict their real-world performance and fuel displacement must consider the driving patterns the vehicles will typically encounter. This paper goes beyond consideration of standardized certification cycless by leveraging state-of-the-art travel survey techniques that use Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to obtain a large set of real-world drive cycles from the surveyed vehicle fleet. This study specifically extracts 24-h, second-by-second driving profiles from a set of 227 GPS-instrumented vehicles in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area. The performance of midsize conventional, hybrid electric, and PHEV models is then simulated over the 227 full-day driving profiles to assess fuel consumption and operating characteristics of these vehicle technologies over a set of real-world usage patterns. In comparison to standard cycles used for certification procedures, the travel survey duty cycles include significantly more aggressive acceleration and deceleration events across the velocity spectrum, which affect vehicle operation and efficiency. Even under these more aggressive operating conditions, PHEVs using a blended charge-depleting energy management strategy consume less than 50% of the petroleum used by similar conventional vehicles. Although true prediction of the widespread real-world use of these vehicles requires expansion of the vehicle sample size and a refined accounting for the possible interaction of several variables with the sampled driving profiles, this study demonstrates a cutting-edge use of available GPS travel survey data to analyze the (highly drive cycle-dependent) performance of advanced technology PHEVs. This demonstration highlights new opportunities for using innovative GPS travel survey techniques and sophisticated vehicle system simulation tools to guide vehicle design improvements and to maximize the benefits offered by energy efficiency technologies.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Engine autoignition: The relationship between octane numbers and autoignition delay times","Bradley, Derek; Head, R A","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 02 PETROLEUM; GASOLINE; IGNITION; COMBUSTION KINETICS; ANTIKNOCK RATINGS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; PRESSURE DEPENDENCE","The research octane (RON) and motor octane (MON) numbers, carefully measured in standardized tests, are the principal parameters for characterizing autoignition of gasoline in engines. Increasingly, engines operate under different conditions of temperature, pressure, and mixture strength from those in these tests. As a result, RON and MON values become an incomplete guide to the onset of knock, and the octane index (OI), an octane number under operational conditions, is often measured. Values of the OI were measured with different fuels in a controlled autoignition single-cylinder engine, at different initial temperatures and pressures, at the instant of 10% heat release. Fundamental understanding of engine autoignition was sought by finding the OIs of different non-primary reference fuels (non-PRFs) by identifying the corresponding PRFs that give 10% heat release under identical conditions. The autoignition delay times of the PRFs were obtained from the shock tube data, for different temperatures and pressures, of the Aachen group. It was sufficiently accurate to equate the delay time of a non-PRF to that of the corresponding PRF under the same conditions for 10% heat release. The PRFs exhibited a higher value of the inverse pressure exponent for the delay time than the non-PRFs. Together with different temperature dependencies, these gave autoignition delay times of non-PRFs that could be higher than those of their associated RONs. This tendency increased with pressure and decreased with temperature and was most marked with olefenic and toluenic fuels. This could result in values of the OI that were higher than the RON of the fuel. This is important because, for a number of evolutionary reasons, engine pressures are tending to increase and temperatures to decrease.

The concept considered here is to block 1.8% of the solar flux with a space sunshade orbited near the inner Lagrange point (L1), in-line between the Earth and sun. Following the work of J. Early [Early, JT (1989) J Br Interplanet Soc 42:567-569], transparent material would be used to deflect the sunlight, rather than to absorb it, to minimize the shift in balance out from L1 caused by radiation pressure. Three advances aimed at practical implementation are presented. First is an optical design for a very thin refractive screen with low reflectivity, leading to a total sunshade mass of {approx}20 million tons. Second is a concept aimed at reducing transportation cost to $50/kg by using electromatnetic acceleration to escape Earth's gravity, followed by ion propulsion. Third is an implementation of the sunshade as a cloud of many spacecraft, autonomously stabilized by modulating solar radiation pressure.

"Role of low-bandwidth open-loop control of combustion instability using a high-momentum air jet--mechanistic details","Uhm, Jong Ho; Acharya, Sumanta","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; OPEN-LOOP CONTROL; COMBUSTION INSTABILITY; AIR; JETS; MODULATION; HZ RANGE; OSCILLATIONS; COMBUSTORS; GAS TURBINES; PROPULSION SYSTEMS","Low-frequency modulation of a high-momentum air jet is shown to be effective in controlling combustion oscillations in a swirl-stabilized spray combustor. The oscillations in the combustor studied are dominated by a longitudinal acoustic mode (235 Hz) with a self-excited low-frequency (13 Hz) bulk mode (of the upstream cavity) superimposed. In this paper, the mechanisms leading to control using external low-frequency modulation of a high-momentum air jet are studied. It is shown that low-frequency modulation periodically alters the phase relation between pressure and heat release, and for unstable conditions, this periodic alteration of the phase leads to a reduction in pressure oscillations.

"Two-color time-resolved LII applied to soot particle sizing in the cylinder of a Diesel engine","Kock, Boris F; Tribalet, Benjamin; Schulz, Christof; Roth, Paul","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; SOOT; PARTICLE SIZE; DIESEL ENGINES; COMBUSTION CHAMBERS","Laser-induced incandescence with time-resolved detection (TR-LII) at two wavelengths was established and applied to the combustion chamber of a single-cylinder two-stroke Diesel engine. The optical system was calibrated by a black-body radiation source. TR-LII signals for different crank angles and varying engine operation conditions were measured. By fitting calculated TR-LII cooling curves to the measured signals, it was possible to determine the mean primary particle diameter and the geometric standard deviation of the in-cylinder particles for an assumed lognormal size distribution. At the beginning of the combustion process the resulting particle sizes increased with increasing crank angle (CA) according to particle formation. This was followed by a subsequent reduction of the particle sizes at later crank angles due to particle oxidation. In all examined cases the mean particle sizes increase with increasing engine load. For validation purposes, soot samples from the exhaust gas were taken onto transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids for different engine operating conditions and were analyzed by TEM. For the obtained loose agglomerated particle structures, the particle sizes at late crank angles measured by TR-LII are in excellent agreement with the TEM-determined mean primary particle sizes in the exhaust gas. Finally, soot volume fractions were determined from the maximum TR-LII signals via calibration by in-cylinder laser-extinction measurements.

"A computational study of an HCCI engine with direct injection during gas exchange","Su, Haiyun; Vikhansky, Alexander; Mosbach, Sebastian; Kraft, Markus; Bhave, Amit; Kim, Kyoung-Oh; Kobayashi, Tatsuo; Mauss, Fabian","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS; MONTE CARLO METHOD; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; OCTANE; PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS","We present a new probability density function (PDF)-based computational model to simulate a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with direct injection (DI) during gas exchange. This stochastic reactor model (SRM) accounts for the engine breathing process in addition to the closed-volume HCCI engine operation. A weighted-particle Monte Carlo method is used to solve the resulting PDF transport equation. While simulating the gas exchange, it is necessary to add a large number of stochastic particles to the ensemble due to the intake air and EGR streams as well as fuel injection, resulting in increased computational expense. Therefore, in this work we apply a down-sampling technique to reduce the number of stochastic particles, while conserving the statistical properties of the ensemble. In this method some of the most important statistical moments (e.g., concentration of the main chemical species and enthalpy) are conserved exactly, while other moments are conserved in a statistical sense. Detailed analysis demonstrates that the statistical error associated with the down-sampling algorithm is more sensitive to the number of particles than to the number of conserved species for the given operating conditions. For a full-cycle simulation this down-sampling procedure was observed to reduce the computational time by a factor of 8 as compared to the simulation without this strategy, while still maintaining the error within an acceptable limit. Following the detailed numerical investigation, the model, intended for volatile fuels only, is applied to simulate a two-stroke, naturally aspirated HCCI engine fueled with isooctane. The in-cylinder pressure and CO emissions predicted by the model agree reasonably well with the measured profiles. In addition, the new model is applied to estimate the influence of engine operating parameters such as the relative air-fuel ratio and early direct injection timing on HCCI combustion and emissions. The qualitative trends observed in the parametric variation study match well with experimental data in literature.

Flame-spread modes, burning behavior after the flame spread, and flame-spread rate were examined at different ambient temperatures. Experimental results showed that the appearance of flame-spread modes and the flame-spread rate were affected by the ambient temperature. The flame-spread rate increased with the ambient temperature. These facts are discussed based on the temperature effects on the droplet heating and the development of a flammable-mixture layer around the next droplet.

Experimental work was carried out in a new high-pressure combustion chamber described in a recent study [K.A. Thomson, O.L. Gulder, E.J. Weckman, R.A. Fraser, G.J. Smallwood, D.R. Snelling, Combust. Flame 140 (2005) 222-232]. Radially resolved soot volume fraction was experimentally measured using both spectral soot emission and line-of-sight attenuation techniques. Numerically, the elliptic governing equations were solved in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates using the finite volume method. Detailed gas-phase chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed in the numerical calculations. The soot model employed in this study accounts for soot nucleation and surface growth using a semiempirical acetylene-based global soot model with oxidation of soot by O{sub 2}, OH, and O taken into account. Radiative heat transfer was calculated using the discrete-ordinates method and a nine-band nongray radiative property model. Two soot surface growth submodels were investigated and the predicted pressure dependence of soot yield was compared with available experimental data. The experiment, the numerical model, and a simplified theoretical analysis found that the visible flame diameter decreases with pressure as P{sub a}{sup -0.5}. The flame-diameter-integrated soot volume fraction increases with pressure as P{sub a}{sup 1.3} between 5 and 20 atm. The assumption of a square root dependence of the soot surface growth rate on the soot particle surface area predicts the pressure dependence of soot yield in good agreement with the experimental observation. On the other hand, the assumption of linear dependence of the soot surface growth rate on the soot surface area predicts a much faster increase in the soot yield with pressure than that observed experimentally. Although pressure affects the gas-phase chemistry, the increased soot production with increasing pressure seems primarily due to enhanced mixture density and species concentrations in the pressure range investigated. The increased pressure causes enhanced air entrainment into the fuel stream around the burner rim, leading to accelerated fuel pyrolysis. In the pressure range of 20 to 40 atm both the model and experiment show a diminishing sensitivity of sooting propensity to pressure with a greater decrease in the predicted sensitivity of soot propensity to pressure than the experimental results.

A unique test rig was constructed in which their influence could be studied controlling all the important operational parameters of the engine. The air, fuel and EGR circuit of one cylinder of a four cylinder engine were separated to permit a precise control of flow rates and flow temperatures while the original coolant circuit, controlling the wall temperatures, was preserved. The installation demonstrates how a multi-cylinder production engine can be transformed to perform tests with single cylinder precision. For three operating points, representative for the European homologation cycle, tests were performed to assess the influence of the coolant- and air-temperature on engine operation. Raising the coolant and inlet charge temperature diminishes hydrocarbon emissions and increases NO{sub x} emissions. The effect of the inlet charge temperature is much more important than the effect of the coolant temperature. At low load the effects are more pronounced. The influence on the performance and the combustion process is limited.

The results here show that FBC-doped soot at low load is more likely to have enrichment of metal oxide on the outer periphery of the soot surface than FBC-doped soot at high load. From element microanalysis, a higher ratio of metal oxide to carbon was observed with FBC-doped soot at low load.

Spherule and aggregate size distributions, aggregate fractal dimensions and prefactors, and particle volume fractions were comprehensively characterized using this novel technique, which provided new, accurate, and relevant data on diesel particulates compared to the abundant past studies involving questionable mobility sizing measurements. In contrast to the narrow (Gaussian) distributions of spherule sizes, there were broad variations in aggregate sizes that were approximated by a lognormal probability function with a geometric standard deviation of about 1.8. Mean spherule diameters were in the range 20-35 nm, and mean aggregate gyration diameters of 0.16-0.35 {mu}m were always smaller than the PM2.5 standard. Average sizes of both spherules and aggregates mostly increased with the relative engine load or overall equivalence ratio, which disagreed with the trends and correlations suggested by a recent study. Independent of engine operating condition, aggregate fractal dimension was 1.77+/-0.14, a nearly universal property that contradicted with the broad range of past values reported for diesel engines based on mobility-based experiments. The aggregate fractal prefactor, which was also necessary to fully characterize the morphology of diesel soot, was found to be 1.9+/-0.5. In addition to this new contribution, sampling/TEM experiments were also implemented for the first time in a diesel engine to estimate particle volume fractions, which were crucial for the determination of available specific surface areas. The present method was more accurate than the laser attenuation method for the relatively low particle volume fractions of 0.001-0.1 ppm emitted by the diesel engine considered here.

This new alternative combustion process is mainly controlled by chemical kinetics in comparison with the conventional combustion in internal combustion engines. The optimization of the engine over the complete engine operation range requires an accurate analysis of the combustion process under all operating conditions; detailed modeling of the HCCI process is an opportunity to realize the engine optimization at lower cost. The combination of CFD computations with detailed chemistry leads to excessive computation times, and is not achievable with current computer capabilities. In this paper, a reduced chemical model for n-heptane is described, in view of its implementation into a CFD simulation code. In the first part, the reduction process to get to the 61-step mechanism is detailed and then the 26-step mechanism is described; this further reduction is carried out under various conditions that include a range of interest in engine applications. The third part is dedicated to extensive validation work in reference to the original detailed mechanism and two reduced mechanisms published in the literature, focusing on the prediction of ignition delay times under constant as well as variable volume conditions. A good and accurate reproduction of both ignition delay times and heat release can be reached with the 26-step model.

Laminar burning velocities and Markstein lengths were obtained at various ratios of hydrogen to natural gas (volume fraction from 0 to 100%) and equivalence ratios (f from 0.6 to 1.4). The influence of stretch rate on flame was also analyzed. The results show that, for lean mixture combustion, the flame radius increases with time but the increasing rate decreases with flame expansion for natural gas and for mixtures with low hydrogen fractions, while at high hydrogen fractions, there exists a linear correlation between flame radius and time. For rich mixture combustion, the flame radius shows a slowly increasing rate at early stages of flame propagation and a quickly increasing rate at late stages of flame propagation for natural gas and for mixtures with low hydrogen fractions, and there also exists a linear correlation between flame radius and time for mixtures with high hydrogen fractions. Combustion at stoichiometric mixture demonstrates the linear relationship between flame radius and time for natural gas-air, hydrogen-air, and natural gas-hydrogen-air flames. Laminar burning velocities increase exponentially with the increase of hydrogen fraction in mixtures, while the Markstein length decreases and flame instability increases with the increase of hydrogen fractions in mixture. For a fixed hydrogen fraction, the Markstein number shows an increase and flame stability increases with the increase of equivalence ratios. Based on the experimental data, a formula for calculating the laminar burning velocities of natural gas-hydrogen-air flames is proposed.

These include ion sensors, an optical spark plug and heat release analysis from the cylinder pressure. A detailed analysis of these measurements is presented, giving insight into the combustion process and into the energy release. The flame front shape and propagation in the combustion chamber are reconstructed and the flame speed is estimated. The laminar flame speed has been observed to increase linearly with the energy fraction of reformer gas in the fuel blend. From pure gasoline to pure reformer gas the laminar flame speed increases by a factor of 4.4. The relative increase in the turbulent flame speed is lower. These results confirm what can be observed from the heat release analysis, that reformer gas addition mainly shortens the first phase of the combustion process. Different reformer gas compositions were tested, varying the ratio of hydrogen to inert species. Finally, flame propagation and flame speed at EGR-burn limit and at lean-burn limit are investigated.

Heat release effects are determined from the comparison of nonreacting and reacting jet behavior, boundary conditions being identical in both cases. Experiments are performed in a wind tunnel specifically designed for this purpose. Planar laser induced fluorescence on OH radicals and on acetone (seeded in the hydrogen jet) are used to characterize the cartography of scalars, and laser Doppler velocimetry is used to characterize velocity profiles in the far field of the H{sub 2} jet. Results show significant effects of heat release on mixing and flow structure, indicating an overall reduction of mixing and entrainment in the reacting jet compared to the nonreacting jet. First, a change is observed in the orientation of coherent structures originating from Kelvin-Helmholtz type instabilities, and responsible for air entrainment within the jet, which appear 'flatter' in the jet flame. Then, the flame length is increased over what would be predicted from the intersection of the mean stoichiometric contour with the centerline of the nonreacting jet. And finally, the longitudinal average velocity decrease along the jet axis is quicker in the nonreacting jet, and nondimensional transverse velocity fluctuations are about half as high in the reacting jet as in the nonreacting jet, indicating a reduction of the turbulence intensity of the flow in this direction in the jet flame.

The acid sites were formed by NH4+ ion exchange and subsequent heat treatment of a NaY zeolite. The catalytic activities of these H+-modified NaY zeolites significantly increased with the number of acid sites. This NOx conversion increase was correlated with the decrease in the amount of unreacted NO2. The increase in the number of acid sites did not change the NO level, it stayed constant. Temperature programmed desorption following NO2 adsorption showed the appearance of a high temperature desorption peak at 453 K in addition to the main desorption feature of 343 K observed for the base Na-Y. The results of both the IR and TPD experiments revealed the formation of crotonaldehyde, resulting from condensation reaction of adsorbed acetaldehyde. Strong adsorptions of both NOx and hydrocarbon species are proposed to be responsible for the higher catalytic activity of H+-modified Na-Y zeolites in comparison to the base NaY material","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It is anticipated that the igniter in these engines will face with pressures as high as 50MPa and temperatures as high as 4000 K. Using the conventional ignition system, the required voltage and energy must be greatly increased (voltages in excess of 40 kV) to reliably ignite the air and fuel mixture under these conditions. Increasing the voltage and energy does not always improve ignitability but it does create greater reliability problem.

In addition, a flamelet combustion model based on the G equation combustion model was developed and implemented. To test the ignition and combustion models, they were applied to a homogeneous charge pancake-shaped-combustion-chamber engine, in which experimental heat flux data from probes in the engine head and cylinder liner were available. By comparing the flame arrival timings with the simulation predictions, the ignition and combustion models were validated. In addition, the models were also applied to a homogeneous charge propane-fueled SI engine. Good agreement with experimental cylinder pressures and NO{sub x} data was obtained as a function of ignition timing, engine speed, and EGR levels.

Numerical diagnostics are developed to analyze the mode of combustion and the dependence of overall ignition progress on initial mixture conditions. The roles of dissipation of heat and mass are divided conceptually into transport within ignition fronts and passive scalar dissipation, which modifies the statistics of the preignition temperature field. Transport within ignition fronts is analyzed by monitoring the propagation speed of ignition fronts using the displacement speed of a scalar that tracks the location of maximum heat release rate. The prevalence of deflagrative versus spontaneous ignition front propagation is found to depend on the local temperature gradient, and may be identified by the ratio of the instantaneous front speed to the laminar deflagration speed. The significance of passive scalar mixing is examined using a mixing timescale based on enthalpy fluctuations. Finally, the predictions of the multizone modeling strategy are compared with the DNS, and the results are explained using the diagnostics developed.

To study the effect of reaction chamber configuration on the resulting aerodynamics and temperature field, experiments are conducted and compared using a creviced piston and a flat piston under varying conditions. Results show that the flat piston design leads to significant mixing of the cold vortex with the hot core region, which causes alternate hot and cold regions inside the combustion chamber. At higher pressures, the effect of the vortex is reduced. The creviced piston head configuration is demonstrated to result in drastic reduction of the effect of the vortex. Experimental conditions are also simulated using the Star-CD computational fluid dynamics package. Computed results closely match with experimental observation. Numerical results indicate that with a flat piston design, gas velocity after compression is very high and the core region shrinks quickly due to rapid entrainment of cold gases. Whereas, for a creviced piston head design, gas velocity after compression is significantly lower and the core region remains unaffected for a long duration. As a consequence, for the flat piston, adiabatic core assumption can significantly overpredict the maximum temperature after the end of compression. For the creviced piston, the adiabatic core assumption is found to be valid even up to 100 ms after compression. This work therefore experimentally and numerically substantiates the importance of piston head design for achieving a homogeneous core region inside a rapid compression machine.

The paper investigates the locally occurring physico-chemical phenomena in an atmospheric pressure, diesel spray, stabilized cool flame reactor, utilizing a tabulated chemistry approach in conjunction with a two-phase, Eulerian-Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics code. Actual diesel oil physical properties are used to model spray evaporation in the two-phase simulations, whereas the corresponding chemistry is represented by n-heptane. A lookup table is constructed by performing a plethora of perfectly stirred reactor simulations, utilizing a semidetailed n-heptane oxidation chemical kinetics mechanism. The overall exothermicity of the preignition n-heptane oxidation chemistry and the fuel consumption rates are examined as a function of selected independent parameters, namely temperature, fuel concentration, and residence time; their influence on cool flame reactivity is thoroughly studied. It is shown that the tabulated chemistry approach allows accurate investigation of the chemical phenomena with low computational cost. The two-phase flow inside the stabilized cool flame reactor is simulated, utilizing the developed lookup table. Predictions are presented for a variety of test cases and are compared to available experimental data, with satisfactory agreement. Model validation tests indicate that prediction quality improves with increasing values of air temperature at the reactor's inlet.

An initially spherical laminar flame kernel is allowed to interact with the surrounding turbulent fluid motion to provide a propagating turbulent flame with a strong mean spherical curvature. The statistical behavior of the local displacement speed in response to strain and curvature is investigated in detail. The results demonstrate clearly that the mean curvature inherent to the flame kernel configuration has a significant influence on the propagation of the flame. It has been found that the mean density-weighted displacement speed rS{sub d} in the case of flame kernels varies significantly over the flame brush and remains different from r{sub 0}S{sub L} (where r{sub 0} is the reactant density and S{sub L} is laminar flame speed), unlike statistically planar flames. It is also shown that the magnitude of reaction progress variable gradient ||c| is negatively correlated with curvature in the case of flame kernels, in contrast to the weak correlation between ||c| and curvature in the case of planar flames. This correlation induces a net positive correlation between the combined reaction and normal diffusion components of displacement speed (S{sub r}+S{sub n}) and curvature in flame kernels, whereas the previous studies based on statistically planar flames did not observe any appreciable correlation between (S{sub r}+S{sub n}) and curvature.

"Comparison of iso-octane burning rates between single-phase and two-phase combustion for small droplets","Lawes, M; Lee, Y; Marquez, N","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; COMBUSTION; DROPLETS; OCTANE; AEROSOLS; VELOCITY; STABILITY","Two-phase combustion is a widespread mechanism of energy conversion that is of practical importance in gas turbines, diesel and spark ignition engines, furnaces, and hazardous environments. However, the exploration of important parameters in combustion systems of practical application is difficult, due to the multiplicity of dependent variables. In the present work, combustion rates of well-defined droplet suspensions of iso-octane have been measured using techniques employed for gaseous combustion. This required a full characterization of the aerosols produced in the combustion apparatus, which determined that the maximum droplet size produced was around 30 {mu}m. Comparisons of two-phase with single-phase laminar mixtures suggest that there were negligible differences in the burning velocity of an aerosol and a gaseous mixture at the same overall equivalence ratio and similar conditions for iso-octane. At high stretch rates, flames remained smooth and droplet enhancement was negligible. However, at lower rates of stretch, both gaseous and aerosol flames became unstable and cellular, and this cellularity, in some cases, increased the burning rate. The values of Markstein length measured for aerosol flames had trends similar to those for gaseous-phase mixtures (Markstein length decreased with equivalence ratio), but were lower than in gaseous combustion. The values of Markstein length in aerosol flames also decreased with liquid equivalence ratio and/or Sauter mean diameter. All this indicates a higher tendency to instabilities in aerosol flames compared to gaseous combustion. A qualitative explanation for the lower values of Markstein length in aerosol combustion is given. It is suggested in the present work that aerosol flames became unstable, and hence had faster burning rates, under conditions that would not result in unstable gaseous flames. Comparisons, qualitative and in terms of dimensionless groups, of two-phase with single-phase turbulent combustion also suggest no enhancement.

A composite kinetic analysis procedure was applied to evaluate the full kinetic triplet from nonisothermal kinetic data. First, the activation energy values were obtained from the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose isoconversional method. The values were 129 kJ|mol{sup -1} (Printex XE-2B) and 144 kJ|mol{sup -1} (Flammruss 101). The higher reactivity of Printex XE-2B material was attributed to its markedly greater surface area. The activation energy was found to depend slightly on conversion, suggesting that the combustion was a single-step process for both materials. Second, a comparison of the theoretical masterplots deduced by assuming various conversion models with the experimental masterplots obtained from the kinetic data allowed the selection of the appropriate conversion model of the process. Both materials were found to follow a mechanism based on surface nucleation with subsequent movement of the resulting surface, which was consistent with the penetration of oxygen through the porous structure of the solid samples. Also, the preexponential factors and exact kinetic exponents were evaluated on the basis of predetermined activation energies and conversion models.

It was found that (1) the diffusion rate of fuel into the boundary sublayer limits the catalytic surface reaction rate during combustion; (2) the results of the present flame quench model indicate that the flame quenches due to the heat loss to walls, and the depletion of fuel due to the catalyst coated on the combustion chamber walls does not affect flame quenching; (3) the catalysts coated on the combustion chamber surface do not contribute increased hydrocarbon emissions, but actually reduce them; (4) each catalyst has a specific surface temperature, at which the Damkoehler number for surface reaction is unity.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2004.11.007","","","","United States","2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

"Stabilization of turbulent lifted jet flames assisted by pulsed high voltage discharge","Criner, K; Cessou, A; Louiche, J; Vervisch, P","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 02 PETROLEUM; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; PROPANE; STABILIZATION; FLAMES; TURBULENCE; ELECTRIC DISCHARGES; PULSES; POWER RANGE 01-10 KW; HZ RANGE","To reduce fuel consumption or the pollutant emissions of combustion (furnaces, aircraft engines, turbo-reactors, etc.), attempts are made to obtain lean mixture combustion regimes. These lead to poor stability of the flame. Thus, it is particularly interesting to find new systems providing more flexibility in aiding flame stabilization than the usual processes (bluff-body, stabilizer, quarl, swirl, etc.). The objective is to enlarge the stability domain of flames while offering flexibility at a low energy cost. Evidence is presented that the stabilization of a turbulent partially premixed flame of more than 10 kW can be enhanced by pulsed high-voltage discharges with power consumption less than 0.1% of the power of the flame. The originality of this work is to demonstrate that very effective stabilization of turbulent flames is obtained when high-voltage pulses with very short rise times are used (a decrease by 300% in terms of liftoff height for a given exit jet velocity can be reached) and to provide measurements of minimum liftoff height obtained with discharge over a large range of the stability domain of the lifted jet flame.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.09.010","","","","United States","2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

The results show complex effects of ethane/propane on the ignition of methane, but a common trend observed with both hydrocarbons is an increased promotion effect for temperatures below 1100 K. A detailed kinetic mechanism was used to investigate the interaction between ethane/propane and the ignition chemistry of methane under the above conditions. It was found that at relatively low temperatures, the reactions between ethane/propane and methylperoxy (CH{sub 3}O{sub 2}) lead to an enhanced rate of formation of OH radicals in the initiation phase of the ignition. By systematically applying the quasi-steady-state assumptions to the intermediate species involved in the main reaction path identified, we have achieved an analytical description of the ignition process in the transitional temperature regime. The analytical solutions agree reasonably well with the detailed kinetic model and the experimental results for both ignition delay and concentrations of major intermediate species.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.06.013","","","","United States","2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

The common terminal of the two-phase motor is tied to the neutral point of the three-phase traction motor to eliminate the requirement of a third phase leg. Further cost savings are made possible by sharing the switching devices, dc bus filter capacitors, gate drive power supplies, and control circuit.

CF8C plus steel has improved high temperature tensile, creep, fatigue, and creep-fatigue properties compared with standard CF8C steel. Changes to the CF8C steel composition, including additions of Mn and N, result in changes to the solidification behaviour and final microstructure of the alloy, which directly relate to the improved mechanical properties. Additionally, CF8C plus is a relatively inexpensive steel which exhibits good castability. The mechanical properties of the alloy have generated significant interest for the production/design of cast components for diesel engine turbochargers and other exhaust components, natural gas reciprocating engines for distributed power, and turbine end covers and casings for land based turbines. In the present paper, the microstructural evolution of CF8C and CF8C plus are presented in more detail, and the mechanical properties of the alloys are compared with each other and other engineering alloys.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The catalysts retain the high surface area of the support, {approx}500 m{sup 2}/g, average pore size, and pore volume. Inclusion of aluminum into the SBA-15 did not significantly alter these parameters. XRD, XAFS, and Moessbauer spectroscopies were used to characterize the catalyst before and after being subjected to the reaction conditions. Prior to reaction, the iron was distributed among {alpha}-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}3, ferrihydrite, and minor {gamma}-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}. After reaction, the iron phases detected were nonmagnetic iron oxides, iron carbide, and metallic iron. The length of the induction period typically seen with iron-based F-T catalysts was strongly dependent on the amount of aluminum present in the catalyst. With no aluminum, the induction period lasted about 25 h, whereas the induction period decreased to less than 5 h with an Al:Si mass ratio of 0.010. A further increase in aluminum content lengthened the induction period, but always remained less than that without aluminum. Catalyst activity and product selectivity were also strongly dependent on aluminum content with the maximum diesel fuel fraction, C{sub 11+}, occurring with the Al:Si ratio of 0.010 and a CO conversion of 37%. The small concentration of aluminum may serve to increase the rate of iron carbide formation, whereas higher concentrations may begin to inhibit the rate.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The aim was to examine the sensitivity of the predictions to the operator splitting errors and to identify the extent to which spatial transport terms are important for spray autoignition problems. Despite the underlying simplifications, solution of the full CMC equations allows a single model to be used for the autoignition, flame propagation ('premixed mode'), and diffusion flame mode of diesel combustion, which makes CMC a good candidate model for practical engine calculations. It was found that (i) the conditional averages have significant spatial gradients before ignition and during the premixed mode and (ii) that the inclusion of physical-space transport affects the calculation of the autoignition delay time, both of which suggest that volume-averaged CMC approaches may be inappropriate for diesel-like problems. A balance of terms in the CMC equation before and after autoignition shows the relative magnitude of spatial transport and allows conjectures on the structure of the premixed phase of diesel combustion. Very good agreement with available experimental data is found concerning ignition delays and the effect of background air turbulence on them.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.08.022","","","","United States","2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

"Fractal approach to the evaluation of burning rates in the vicinity of the piston in a spark-ignition engine","Foucher, F; Mounaim-Rousselle, C","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; SPARK IGNITION ENGINES; COMBUSTION KINETICS; FRACTALS; METHANE; AIR; PISTONS; DISTANCE","The burning rate in the vicinity of a piston is estimated from a fractal analysis. The fractal parameters are determined from laser sheet tomography flame images for methane-air mixtures with three equivalence ratios (1, 0.9, 0.8) in a transparent spark-ignition engine. Two imaging configurations were used: five horizontal planes placed at different distances from the piston (0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 mm) and a vertical one passed through the center of the combustion chamber. The methodology proposed by Foucher et al. [F. Foucher, S. Burnel, C. Mounaim-Rousselle, Proc. Combust. Inst. 29 (2002) 751-757] allows the effect of cyclic variations to be avoided. The fractal formulation is modified to take into account the flame-piston distance and flame quenching. Far from the piston, evolution of the fractal dimension versus q{sup '}/S{sub L}{sup 0} is found to be in good agreement with literature results. Near the piston, the fractal dimension evolves significantly when the distance is about twice the integral length scale and tends toward 2, the fractal dimension of a laminar flame front. The quenching ratio parameter Q{sub R} is introduced to consider the quenching of the flame by the piston. Finally, the burning rate is determined as a function of the distance between the wall and the mean flame contour and compared to a flame density approach, and similar results are found.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.06.007","","","","United States","2005-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

"Thermo- and fluid dynamics characterization of spray cooling with pulsed sprays","Panao, M R.O.; Moreira, A L.N.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; SPARK IGNITION ENGINES; FLUID INJECTION; FUELS; DROPLETS; HYBRID SYSTEMS; HEAT FLUX; TRANSIENTS; INTERFACES","A fundamental study is reported here on the spray impingement of pulsed sprays on heated surfaces. The experiments consider simultaneous measurements of surface heat flux and droplet characteristics performed with a Phase Doppler Anemometer (velocity, size and flux) prior to impact, to provide a better insight into the interaction between thermal and fluid dynamic effects during the period of injection. The experimental conditions are relevant for engines at steady rotational speeds between 1800rpm and 3600rpm, which are of interest for hybrid configurations, where the IC engine is set to operate at maximum efficiency. The analysis addresses the effects of injection conditions (e.g., duration, frequency and pressure) on the thermodynamic behaviour of the surface. It is observed that the heat flux decreases when the pressure of injection increases, due to dynamic variations of the film induced by interaction with impacting droplets in the film evaporation regime. Results further suggest that, for the range of injection conditions found in real engines, the time variation of the heat transfer during injection depends more on the liquid mass flux than on droplet size and axial velocity. However, when the engine load increases, the mechanism by which heat is removed from the surface varies from thermally controlled to mass diffusion controlled, due to saturation of the atmosphere with gasoline vapour. The time resolved measurements are processed to quantify the critical points of the boiling curves, e.g., the critical heat flux (CHF) at the Nukiyama temperature and the minimum heat flux (MHF) at the Leidenfrost temperature. The dynamic characteristics of those curves are used as an approach to describe the heat transfer mechanisms in pulsed spray systems. It is suggested that multiple droplet interaction alters the thermal behaviour of the target in the sense that both, CHF and MHF, increase in regions of large droplet concentration and when the frequency of injection increases. However, load variations associated with times of injection in the range 5-10ms, do not produce significant alterations.

"The behavior of the skin-friction coefficient of a turbulent boundary layer flow over a flat plate with differently configured transverse square grooves","Wahidi, R; Chakroun, W; Al-Fahed, S","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; AIRCRAFT; SUBMARINES; FUEL CONSUMPTION; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; FRICTION; BOUNDARY LAYERS; TURBULENT FLOW; SURFACES; DRAG","Skin-friction coefficient of turbulent boundary layer flow over a smooth-wall with transverse square grooves was investigated. Four grooved-wall cases were investigated. The four grooved-wall configurations are single 5mm square grooved-wall, and 5mm square grooves spaced 10, 20 and 40 element widths apart in the streamwise direction. Laser-Doppler Anemometer (LDA) was used for the mean velocity and turbulence intensity measurements. The skin-friction coefficient determined from the velocity profile increases sharply just downstream of the groove. This overshoot is followed by an undershoot and then relaxation back to the smooth-wall value. This behavior is observed in most grooved-wall cases. Integrating the skin-friction coefficient in the streamwise direction indicates that there is an increase in the overall drag in all the grooved-wall cases.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.expthermflusci.2005.03.022","","","","United States","2005-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

The topology of soot– catalyst contact may change with progressive oxidation of the soot layer; hence, a technique capable of probing catalytic action via detailed kinetic analysis at different stages of oxidation is required to conclusively resolve this problem. A novel step–response technique was developed in this work as a methodological foundation for such study. Using this technique, various aspects of the oxidation process can be probed while consuming only differential amounts of carbon, and the impact of the reaction heat on the measured rates can be minimized. This technique was applied to soot oxidation by O2 and showed that, after decoupling effects due to the sample history, carbon oxidation by O2 in the absence of H2O can be well-described by an unmodified Arrhenius equation, with similar activation energy values for diesel and model soot samples (137 _ 8.7 and 132 _ 5.1 kJ/mol, respectively). The reaction order in O2 for these samples was found to be 0.61 _ 0.03 and 0.71 _ 0.03, respectively, and was remarkably independent of the temperature, suggesting that the fractional order is not due to mixed kinetic control. The reaction mechanism was also found to be independent of carbon conversion. The density of the reaction sites, however, appeared to increase with oxidation. This increase could not be accounted for by the changes in the specific surface area, either directly measured orderived from such simplified models as the shrinking-core formalism. The entire set of obtained experimental results can be described using a kinetically uncomplicated model in a broad range of temperatures, partial pressures of oxygen and degrees of soot oxidation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The modeling framework employs skeletal chemistry for n-heptane for ignition and combustion, and links acetylene chemistry to the soot nucleation process. The soot model is based on integration and modification of existing submodels for soot nucleation, agglomeration, oxidation, and surface growth. With the optimized modeling parameters, the simulations agree well with results of high-pressure shock tube studies of rich n-heptane mixtures, reproducing the trends for soot mass over a range of temperature and pressure conditions (T=1550-2050 K, P=20, 40, and 80 MPa). Engine simulation results for soot mass are in excellent agreement with diesel engine smoke number measurements over a range of injection timings (-11{sup o} ATDC-2.4{sup o} ATDC) and two exhaust gas recirculation levels (16 and 26-27%). The model results demonstrate that correct description of the soot formation, as well as the soot transport processes, is critical for achieving reliable predictive capabilities in engine simulations.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.04.007","","","","United States","2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1-2; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

To accelerate the stream to the needed velocity the stream mass is contained in a transit vehicle, launched at low velocity and hence low energy cost, and then sent on a trajectory with near encounters of the planets for gravitational assist. The mass arrives at Earth or wherever the propellant is needed at much higher velocity and kinetic energy, where it is released into an extended stream suitable for propulsion. The stream, moving at a relative velocity in the range of 10 to 30km/s, should be capable of both high thrust and high specific impulse. Means of limiting the transverse expansion of the stream during release and for the {approx}1000 seconds duration of impact are a critical requirement for practicality of the concept. The scheme could potentially lead to a virtually unlimited energy source. One can imagine using a portion of one stream to launch another, larger payload on a similar trajectory. This creates, in effect, an energy amplifier extracting energy from the orbital motions of the planets. The gain of the energy amplifier is only limited by the capacity to prepare mass in transit vehicles.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Here, we develop a thermodynamically consistent catalytic reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on Pt. First, we propose a modification of the bond index of the unity bond index-quadratic exponential potential (UBI-QEP) semiempirical framework for calculation of the activation energy of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type bimolecular surface reaction between co-adsorbed CO{sup *} and O{sup *}. Thermodynamic consistency is then ensured in the reaction mechanism by combining the semiempirical UBI-QEP theory, statistical mechanics, and constraint-based optimization against experimental data. Atmospheric pressure ignition and ultrahigh vacuum molecular beam experiments are selected as targets for optimization. The optimized mechanism is validated against redundant experiments, including temperature-programmed desorption, temperature-programmed reaction, and molecular beam experiments. Our microkinetic model is able to capture multiple types of data while being thermodynamically consistent over a wide range of conditions.","","Available from doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.01.019","","","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

It is difficult to reduce the NOx in the emission completely using catalysts or plasma alone because part of the NO is oxidized under an O{sub 2}-rich environment. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose a new aftertreatment system of NOx included in the exhaust gas of the combustion system using nonthermal plasma (NTP) desorption and reduction. In this system, exchangeable adsorbent columns are equipped. As an initial step to realize such kind of aftertreatment system, the basic characteristics of the N{sub 2} NTP desorption and NOx reduction were examined experimentally using a pulse corona NTP reactor. After several adsorption/desorption processes, the amount of NOx adsorbed becomes equal to that of the NOx desorbed, that is, all the NO, was desorbed in a single desorption process. It is confirmed that the NOx complete reduction using N{sub 2} NTP desorption is possible not only for a simulated exhaust gas but for a real diesel engine gas. The effective specific energy density can be decreased down to 22 Wh/m{sup 3}.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 891-899","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994; ITIACR; TRN: 001000080","10.1109/TIA.2005.851565","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20647571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20647571","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","4","41"

First, the static cross tension strength of an SPR joint is estimated using a lower bound limit load based strength estimator. Failure mode associated with the predicted failure strength can also be identified. It is shown that the cross tension strength of an SPR joint depends on the material and gage combinations, rivet design, die design and riveting direction. The analytical rivet strength estimator is then validated by experimental rivet strength measurements and failure mode observations from nine SPR joint populations with various material and gage combinations. Next, the estimator is used to optimize rivet strength. Two illustrative examples are presented in which rivet strength is improved by changing rivet length and riveting direction from the original manufacturing parameters.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the PTR-MS instrument as an analytical tool for diesel engine emissions abatement research. Measured sensitivities determined from gas standards were found to be between 30% and 100% greater than calculated sensitivities. A slight humidity dependent sensitivity was observed for non-polar species, implying that reactions with H+(H2O)2 were important for some organics. The mass spectra of diesel exhaust were complex but displayed a pattern of strong ion signals at 14n+1 (n=3..8) masses, with a relative ion abundance similar to that obtained from electron impact ionization of alkanes. Laboratory experiments verified that C8-C16 n-alkanes and C8-C13 1-alkenes react with H3O+ in dissociative proton transfer reaction resulting in alkyl cation ion products, primarily m/z 41, 43, 57, 71 and 85. Monitoring the sum of these ions signals may be useful for estimating alkane emissions from unburnt diesel fuel. Alkane fragmentation likely simplified the diesel exhaust mass spectrum and reduced potential mass interferences with isobaric aromatic compounds. It is shown that the relative abundances of VOCs changed as a function of engine load. Concentrations of aldehydes and ketones dominated those of aromatic species with formaldehyde and acetaldehyde estimated to be the most abundant VOCs in the PTR-MS mass spectrum at all engine loads. The relative abundances of benzene and toluene increased with engine load indicating their pyrogenic origin. The relative abundance of alkanes, aromatics, aldehydes, and alcohols was broadly consistent with literature publications of diesel exhaust analysis by gas chromatography. About 75% of the organic ion signal could be assigned. On line analysis of diesel exhaust using this technology may be valuable tool for diesel engine emission research.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States).

Optical ignition and initiation of explosives could thus far only be accomplished through lasers, (4) with specific characteristic of high power, pulse length, wavelength, and a small target area that greatly inhibit their applications. Our results have the implication that explosives with opto-thermally active SWNTs formulations are new ideal candidates for remote optical triggering of safety apparatus such as the firing of bolts on space shuttles rockets and aircraft exit doors, and for controlled burning of explosives as actuators.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The emphasis is on light- to medium-duty engine research. We first describe hydrogen-engine fundamentals by examining the engine-specific properties of hydrogen and surveying the existing literature. Here it will be shown that, due to low volumetric efficiencies and frequent preignition combustion events, the power densities of premixed or port-fuel-injected hydrogen engines are diminished relative to gasoline-fueled engines. Significant progress has been made in the development of advanced hydrogen engines with improved power densities. We discuss several examples and their salient features. Finally, we consider the overall progress made and provide suggestions for future work.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.","","Medium: X; Size: 36 p.","","SAND2005-3057J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US201004%%305","","","2010-03-08T00:00:00Z","971823","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/971823","","Proposed for publication in International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.","",""

The baseline system incorporated a desiccant dehumidifier, a heat exchanger, an indirect evaporative cooler, and a direct evaporative cooler. The desiccant unit was regenerated through heat recovery from a gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engine. The system offered sufficient sensible and latent cooling capacities for a wide range of climatic conditions, while allowing influx of outside air in excess of what is typically required for commercial buildings. Energy and water efficiencies of the desiccant cooling system were also evaluated and compared with those of a conventional system. The results of parametric assessments revealed the importance of using a heat exchanger for concurrent desiccant post cooling and regeneration air preheating. These functions resulted in enhancement of both the cooling performance and the thermal efficiency, which are essential for fuel utilization improvement. Two approaches for mixing of the return air and outside air were examined, and their impact on the system cooling performance and thermal efficiency was demonstrated. The scope of the parametric analyses also encompassed the impact of improving the indirect evaporative cooling effectiveness on the overall cooling system performance.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Instrumented stone impact tests were first carried out in controlled environment. Explicit finite element analyses were then used to simulate the interactions of the indentor and the glass layer during the impact event, and a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model was used to describe the constitutive behavior of glass. The experimentally measured strain histories for low velocity impact served as validation of the modeling procedures. Next, stair-stepping impact experiments were performed with two indentor sizes on two glass ply thickness, and the test results were used to calibrate the critical stress parameters used in the CDM constitutive model. The purpose of this study is to establish the modeling procedures and the CDM critical stress parameters under impact loading conditions. The modeling procedures and the CDM model will be used in our future studies to predict through-thickness damage evolution patterns for different laminated windshield designs in automotive applications.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

We have carried out the first experimental study using a detonation tube hung in a ballistic pendulum arrangement within a large pressure vessel in order to determine the effect that the environment has on the single-cycle impulse. The air pressure inside the vessel surrounding the detonation tube varied between 100 and 1.4 kPa while the initial pressure of the stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen mixture inside the tube varied between 100 and 30 kPa. The original impulse model (Wintenberger et al., Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 19, No. 1, 2002) was modified to predict the observed increase in impulse and blow down time as the environment pressure decreased below one atmosphere. Comparisons between the impulse from detonation tubes and ideal, steady flow rockets indicate incomplete expansion of the detonation tube exhaust, resulting in a 37% difference in impulse at a pressure ratio (ratio of pressure behind the Taylor wave to the environment pressure) of 100.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power.; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: 21 p.","","SAND2005-2136J","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: ISSN 0748-4658; JPPOEL; TRN: US201020%%118","","","2010-11-08T00:00:00Z","990082","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/990082","","Proposed for publication in AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power.","4","22"

The former are referred to as composite energetic materials (i.e., thermites, propellants, pyrotechnics) and the latter are deemed monomolecular energetic materials (i.e., explosives). Mass diffusion between the fuel and oxidizer is the rate controlling step for composite reactions while bond breaking and chemical kinetics control monomolecular reactions. Although composites have higher energy densities than monomolecular species, they release that energy over a longer period of time because diffusion controlled reactions are considerably slower than chemistry controlled reactions. Conversely, monomolecular species exhibit greater power due to more rapid kinetics than physically mixed energetics. Reducing the diffusion distance between fuel and oxidizer species within an energetic composite would enhance the reaction rate. Recent advances in nanotechnology have spurred the development of nano-scale fuel and oxidizer particles that can be combined into a composite and effectively reduce diffusion distances to nano-scale dimensions or less. These nanocomposites have the potential to deliver the best of both worlds: high energy density of the physically mixed composite with the high power of the monomolecular species. Toward this end, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) developed nano-particle synthesis techniques, based on sol-gel chemistry, for the production of thermite nanocomposites.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

These materials are based on MnO6 octahedra sharing faces and edges to form various tunnel structures (2x2, 2x3, 2x4, 3x3) differentiated by the number of octahedra on a side. The SO2 capacities of these materials, measured at 325 C with a feed containing 250 ppmv SO2 in air, are as high as 70wt% (wt/wt), remarkably higher than conventional metal oxide-based SO2 absorbents. Among the OMS materials the 2x2 member, cryptomelane, exhibits the highest capacity and adsorption rate. Its SO2 absorption behavior has been further characterized as a function of temperature, space velocity, and feed composition. The dominant pathway for SO2 absorption is through the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 by Mn4+ followed by SO3 reaction with Mn2+ to form MnSO4. Absorption can occur in the absence of gas phase oxygen, with a moderate loss in overall capacity. The inclusion of reducible gases NO and CO in the feed does not reduce SO2 capacity. The absorption capacity decreases at high space velocity and lower absorption temperature, indicating the important role of diffusion of sulfate from the surface to the bulk of the material in order to reach full capacity. A color change of cryptomelane from black to yellow-brown after SO2 absorption can be used as an indicator of absorption progress. Cryptomelane can be synthesized using MnSO4 as a reagent. Therefore, after full SO2 absorption the product MnSO4 can be re-used as raw material for a subsequent cryptomelane synthesis. Cryptomelane has a similarly high capacity toward SO3, therefore it can be used for removal of all SOx species generated from a variety of combustion sources. Cryptomelane may find application as a replaceable absorbent for the removal of SOx from diesel truck exhaust, protecting downstream emissions control devices such as particulate filters and NOx traps.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2005-01-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 5 Jan 2005","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 168-177","","PNNL-SA-42474","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: US200513%%171","10.1021/ie049111n","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15016362","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15016362","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","44"

The thermal resistance is typically provided by a 100--250 {mu}m thick layer of ceramic (most usually zirconia stabilized with an addition of 7--8 wt% of yttria), and this is deposited on to an approximately 50 {mu} thick, metallic bond coating that is intended to anchor the ceramic to the metallic surface, to provide some degree of mechanical compliance, and to act as a reservoir of protective scale-forming elements (Al) to protect the underlying superalloy from high-temperature corrosion. A feature of importance to the durability of thermal barrier coatings is the early establishment of a continuous, protective oxide layer (preferably {alpha}-alumina) at the bond coating-ceramic interface. Because zirconia is permeable to oxygen, this oxide layer continues to grow during service. Some superalloys are inherently resistant to high-temperature oxidation, so a separate bond coating may not be needed in those cases. Thermal barrier coatings have been in service in aeroengines for a number of years, and the use of this technology for increasing the durability and/or efficiency of industrial gas turbines is currently of significant interest. The data presented were taken from an investigation of routes to optimize bond coating performance, and the focus of the paper is on the influences of reactive elements and Pt on the oxidation behaviour of NiAl-based alloys determined in studies using cast versions of bond coating compositions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

E151 acts as the general acid/base during the catalytic mechanism of peptide hydrolysis. However, a glutamate residue is not the only residue capable of functioning as a general acid/base during catalysis for dinuclear metallohydrolases. Recent crystallographic characterization of the D-aminopeptidase from Bacillus subtilis (DppA) revealed a histidine residue that resides in an identical position to E151 in AAP. Because the active-site ligands for DppA and AAP are identical, AAP has been used as a model enzyme to understand the mechanistic role of H115 in DppA. Substitution of E151 with histidine resulted in an active AAP enzyme exhibiting a k{sub cat} value of 2.0 min{sup -1}, which is over 2000 times slower than r AAP (4380 min{sup -1}). ITC experiments revealed that Zn{sup II} binds 330 and 3 times more weakly to E151H-AAP compared to r-AAP. UV-vis and EPR spectra of Co{sup II}-loaded E151H-AAP indicated that the first metal ion resides in a hexacoordinate/pentacoordinate equilibrium environment, whereas the second metal ion is six-coordinate. pH dependence of the kinetic parameters k{sub cat} and K{sub m} for the hydrolysis of L-leucine p-nitroanilide (L-pNA) revealed a change in an ionization constant in the enzyme-substrate complex from 5.3 in r-AAP to 6.4 in E151H-AAP, consistent with E151 in AAP being the active-site general acid/base. Proton inventory studies at pH 8.50 indicate the transfer of one proton in the rate-limiting step of the reaction. Moreover, the X-ray crystal structure of [ZnZn(E151H-AAP)] has been solved to 1.9 {angstrom} resolution, and alteration of E151 to histidine does not introduce any major conformational changes to the overall protein structure or the dinuclear Zn{sup II} active site. Therefore, a histidine residue can function as the general acid/base in hydrolysis reactions of peptides and, through analogy of the role of E151 in AAP, H115 in DppA likely shuttles a proton to the leaving group of the substrate.","","","Brookhaven National Lab.

In this paper, we present the first experimental evidence that these extended low-Z solids are indeed high energy density materials via milligram-scale high-pressure synthesis, recovery and characterization of polymeric CO (p-CO). Our spectroscopic data reveal that p-CO is a random polymer made of lactonic entities and conjugated C=C with an energy content rivaling or exceeding that of HMX. Solid p-CO explosively decomposes to CO{sub 2} and glassy carbon and thus might be used as an advanced energetic material.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Confined high explosives are heated at a rate of 1 C per hour until an explosion is observed. The heating, ignition, and deflagration phases are modeled using an Arbitrarily Lagrangian-Eulerian code (ALE3D) that can handle a wide range of time scales that vary from a structural to a dynamic hydro time scale. During the pre-ignition phase, quasi-static mechanics and diffusive thermal transfer from a heat source to the HE are coupled with the finite chemical reactions that include both endothermic and exothermic processes. Once the HE ignites, a hydro dynamic calculation is performed as a burn front propagates through the HE. Two RDX-based explosives, C-4 and PBXN-109, are considered, whose chemical-thermal-mechanical models are constructed based on measurements of thermal and mechanical properties along with small scale thermal explosion measurements. The simulated dynamic response of HE confinement during the explosive phase is compared to measurements in large scale thermal explosion tests. The explosion temperatures for both HE's are predicted to within 5 C. Calculated and measured wall strains provide an indication of vessel pressurization during the heating phase and violence during the explosive phase. During the heating phase, simulated wall strains provide only an approximate representation of measured values indicating a better numerical treatment is needed to provide accurate results. The results also show that more numerical accuracy is needed for vessels with lesser confinement strength. For PBXN-109, the measured wall strains during the explosion are well represented by the ALE3D calculations.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Since sulfur oxides in the exhaust greatly reduce the performance of the aftertreatment system, a dedicated trap for removal of sulfur oxides has been considered. Most adsorbents are more effective in removing SO{sub 3} than SO{sub 2}; hence oxidation catalysts have been employed to maximize the concentration of SO{sub 3} in the effluent. Although SO{sub 2} concentrations are easily measured, SO3 is less easily quantified. As a result, the only figure of merit for the SOx trap performance has been total capacity, provided by post-characterization. In this paper we describe a chromatographic method for measurement of SO{sub 2} and SO{sub 3} adsorption in real time, which provides adsorbent performance data on breakthrough capacities and sulfur slip, especially important when operating at high space velocities. We also provide experimental measurements of break through capacities for SO{sub 2} and SO{sub 3} adsorption for some common metal oxide adsorbents using this analytical system.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2004-07-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: PBD: 21 Jul 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4452-4456","","PNNL-SA-40282","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; 9604; VT0403000; TRN: US200508%%364","10.1021/ie049944d","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15015104","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15015104","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","15","43"

When laser-extinction techniques are utilized in high-pressure combustion environments, however, a number of complications may be encountered that are not present in low-pressure environments. Several of these experimental difficulties were investigated in diesel engine environments, and solutions that facilitated acquisition of reliable laser-extinction data were demonstrated. Beam steering due to refractive index gradients within the combusting gases was observed, and a full-angle beam divergence of over 100 mrad was measured. A spatial-filtering scheme was employed to reduce the collection of forward-scattered light and background combustion luminosity while ensuring full collection of the steered beam. To further reject combustion luminosity, a narrow-bandpass laser-line filter was employed, after diffusing the transmitted light sufficiently to avoid the effects of significant spatial non-uniformities of the filter. As the windows were subjected to thermal and mechanical stresses, dynamic etaloning effects due to the photoelastic properties of synthetic fused silica were observed. Dynamic changes in the polarization of the exit beam were also observed, as stress-induced birefringence in the windows caused dynamic phase retardation of the transmitted beam. Although these photoelastic effects could not be eliminated, they were mitigated by introducing curvature to the wavefronts in the laser-extinction beam and using polarization-insensitive elements in the detection optics. Soot deposits on window surfaces were removed ablatively using a coaxial, high-energy, pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2004-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in Combustion and Flame.","","Medium: X; Size: 53 p.","","SAND2004-2808J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US200914%%118","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","952820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/952820","","Proposed for publication in Combustion and Flame.","",""

The results can be summarized as follows; (1) Although the power generation efficiencies of the gas engine and fuel cell are a little bit lower than the standard designated value, they are almost running at stable condition. (2) The collected heat energy is lower than the designated value. The heat release utilization, which is used for cooling and hot water, is fairly low. Considering the efficient use of energy, it is a key to have a good use of heat release when we introduce a district energy system.

The data show a rapid decline of ambient atmospheric BC between 1962 and the early 1990s that exceeds the decline in official estimates of BC emissions based only on amount of fuel use and mostly fixed emission factors. This provides empirical confirmation of the existence and large impact of a time-dependent ''technology factor'' that must multiply the rate of fossil fuel use. Current ambient BC amounts in Great Britain comparable to those in western and central Europe, with diesel engines being the principal present source. From comparison of BC and SO2 data we infer that current BC emission inventories understate true emissions in the U.K. by about a factor of two. The results imply that there is the potential for improved technology to achieve large reduction of global ambient BC.

The catalytic activity of the Y,FAU zeolite showed significant variations with both the nature of the charge compensating cation, and the method of catalyst preparation. Our results show that conventional multiple solution ion exchange is insufficient to prepare the most active catalyst for the given cationic form. The highest NOx conversion level was achieved over a Ba-Y,FAU which was prepared by a multiple ion exchange method, in which each solution ion exchange step was followed by a high temperature calcination. A systematic change in the catalytic activity was observed as a function of the charge density around the charge compensating cation. For both catalyst series (alkali and alkaline earth ion exchanged Y,FAU), the specific activity decreased with increasing electrostatic field around the charge compensating cation. The large difference in the NOx reduction activity at a given e/r ratio, however, may suggest different reaction mechanisms for the two sets of catalysts. Indeed, there is a noticeable difference in the product distribution (selectivity) for the alkali and alkaline earth series of catalysts. Our results also reveal that extreme care must be taken when catalytic activities are compared for seemingly similar materials. We found that two base zeolite materials with identical Si/Al ratios, obtained from the same manufacturer but from different synthesis batches show significantly different catalytic behavior.","","","Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL)","USDOE","","United States","2004-02-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Catalysis Today, 89(1-2):135-141","","Medium: X","","PNNL-SA-38276","AC05-76RL01830","6694; VT0401000","10.1016/j.cattod.2003.11.019","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15010458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15010458","","Catalysis Today, 89(1-2):135-141","",""

Steady-state experiments conducted at 473, 623, and 773K show that ordering of the catalysts impacts NOx conversion, and maximum efficiency is obtained when the zeolite material precedes the alumina. Optimal ordering results in greater than 80% conversion at 473K, and efficiencies greater than 95% were obtained at 623 and 773K under steady operation when propene was added as a reductant at C1:NOx= 12.

The {sup 14}C from the labeled DBM was then detected in engine-out particulate matter (PM), in-cylinder deposits, and CO{sub 2} emissions using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The results indicate that molecular structure plays an important role in determining whether a specific carbon atom either does or does not form soot. Chemical-kinetic modeling results indicate that structures that produce CO{sub 2} directly from the fuel are less effective at reducing soot than structures that produce CO before producing CO{sub 2}.

The allocation is needed in evaluating energy and emission effects of individual transportation fuels. Allocation methods used so far for petroleum-based fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]) are based primarily on mass, energy content, or market value shares of individual fuels from a given refinery. The aggregate approach at the refinery level is unable to account for the energy use and emission differences associated with producing individual fuels at the next sub-level: individual refining processes within a refinery. The approach ignores the fact that different refinery products go through different processes within a refinery. Allocation at the subprocess level (i.e., the refining process level) instead of at the aggregate process level (i.e., the refinery level) is advocated by the International Standard Organization. In this study, we seek a means of allocating total refinery energy use among various refinery products at the level of individual refinery processes. We present a petroleum refinery-process-based approach to allocating energy use in a petroleum refinery to petroleum refinery products according to mass, energy content, and market value share of final and intermediate petroleum products as they flow through refining processes within a refinery. The results from this study reveal that product-specific energy use based on the refinery process-level allocation differs considerably from that based on the refinery-level allocation. We calculated well-to-pump total energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for gasoline, diesel, LPG, and naphtha with the refinery process-based allocation approach. For gasoline, the efficiency estimated from the refinery-level allocation underestimates gasoline energy use, relative to the process-level based gasoline efficiency. For diesel fuel, the well-to-pump energy use for the process-level allocations with the mass- and energy-content-based weighting factors is smaller than that predicted with the refinery-level allocations. However, the process-level allocation with the market-value-based weighting factors has results very close to those obtained by using the refinery-level allocations. For LPG, the refinery-level allocation significantly overestimates LPG energy use. For naphtha, the refinery-level allocation overestimates naphtha energy use. The GHG emission patterns for each of the fuels are similar to those of energy use.We presented a refining-process-level-based method that can be used to allocate energy use of individual refining processes to refinery products. The process-level-based method captures process-dependent characteristics of fuel production within a petroleum refinery. The method starts with the mass and energy flow chart of a refinery, tracks energy use by individual refining processes, and distributes energy use of a given refining process to products from the process. In allocating energy use to refinery products, the allocation method could rely on product mass, product energy contents, or product market values as weighting factors. While the mass- and energy-content-based allocation methods provide an engineering perspective of energy allocation within a refinery, the market-value-ased allocation method provides an economic perspective. The results from this study show that energy allocations at the aggregate refinery level and at the refining process level could make a difference in evaluating the energy use and emissions associated with individual petroleum products. Furthermore, for the refining-process-level allocation method, use of mass -- energy content- or market value share-based weighting factors could lead to different results for diesel fuels, LPG, and naphtha. We suggest that, when possible, energy use allocations should be made at the lowest subprocess level -- a confirmation of the recommendation by the nternational Standard Organization for life cycle analyses.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Retention time variation from chromatogram-to-chromatogram has been a significant impediment against the use of chemometric techniques in the analysis of chromatographic data due to the inability of current multivariate techniques to correctly model information that shifts from variable to variable within a dataset. The algorithm developed is shown to increase the efficacy of pattern recognition methods applied to a set of diesel fuel chromatograms by retaining chemical selectivity while reducing chromatogram-to-chromatogram retention time variations and to do so on a time scale that makes analysis of large sets of chromatographic data practical.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An operating regime was identified in which particulates and NO{sub x} could be reduced simultaneously when the concentration of intake air oxygen, fueling rate, and injection timing were optimized. Using oxygen from an external source, particulates were reduced by approximately 60% and NO{sub x} emissions were reduced by 15--20% with the optimal operating strategy. Higher gross power, lower peak cylinder pressures, and lower brake-specific fuel consumption were also observed. Gross power was increased by about 15--20% at base peak combustion pressure, and gross brake-specific fuel consumption was decreased by 2--10% with load. The effect of achieving oxygen enrichment by means of an air separation membrane is beyond the scope of the current study.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Magnesium: Comparison of density functional theory calculations with electron and x-ray diffraction experiments","Friis, J.; Madsen, G. K. H.; Larsen, F. K.; Jiang, B.; Marthinsen, K.; Holmestad, R.","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Accurate experimental structure factors for Mg have been measured and compared with density functional theory ~DFT! to test some commonly used functionals and self-interaction correction ~SIC! schemes. Low order structure factors, free of extinction and on absolute scale, were measured accurately by quantitative convergent beam electron diffraction. In addition, a complete set of structure factors up to sinu/l51.6 Å21 was measured by x-ray diffraction at 10 K. The DFT calculations were performed using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave method. It was found that the agreement with experiment increases when going from the local density approximation ~LDA! to the generalized gradient approximation ~GGA! of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhofer and further to the GGA of Engel and Vosko. Applying the SIC of Perdew and Zunger to the core states for LDA does not improve the agreement with theory, while applying the SIC of Lundin and Eriksson results in a significantly improved agreement. This implies that the main source of error in the LDA functional comes from the description of the core densities. Using the functional which agrees best with experiment, a non-nuclear maximum is established in the calculated electron density of beryllium but not of magnesium.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","John Spence/Arizona State University","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2003-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Physics; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 21","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 11359","","","FG03-02ER45996","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9606; JCPSA6","10.1063/1.1622656","","2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","1164067","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1164067","","Journal of Chemical Physics","21","119"

In current distribution systems for liquid fuels used in the transportation sector, commodity methanol can occasionally become contaminated with the sulfur in diesel fuel or gasoline. This sulfur would poison the catalytic materials used in fuel reformers for fuel cells. We tested the removal of this sulfur by means of ten activated carbons (AC) that are commercially available. Tests were conducted with methanol doped with 1 vol.% grade D-2 diesel fuel containing 0.29% sulfur, which was present essentially as 33-35 wt.% benzothiophenes (BTs) and 65-67 wt.% dibenzothiophenes (DBT). In general, coconut shell-based carbons activated by high-temperature steam were more effective at sulfur removal than coal-based carbons. Equilibrium sorption data showed linear increase in sulfur capture with the increase of sulfur concentration in methanol. Both types of carbons had similar breakthrough characteristics, with the dynamic sorption capacity of each being about one-third of its equilibrium sorption capacity. Results of this study suggest that a fixed-bed sorber of granular AC can be used, such as in refueling stations, for the removal of sulfur in diesel fuel-contaminated methanol.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The measurements were highly quantitative, with a temporal resolution better than 1 ms. The radial mass distribution of the fuel can be well described by a Gaussian distribution near the nozzle. The calculated volume fraction of the fuel indicates that the so-called liquid core near the nozzle did not exist under the test conditions examined (20-80 MPa injection pressure, 0.3-0.6 ms injection duration). Rather, the bulk of the spray was composed of a liquid/gas mixture with liquid content not exceeding 50% by volume. The maximum-density region was found at the front edge of the sprays, where the fuel volume fraction can reach 80%, and was limited to a thin layer (1-2 mm) perpendicular to the spray axis. The penetration of the front edge was found to be nonlinear with respect to injection duration within 20 mm from the nozzle.","","","Argonne National Lab.

It is found that the impedance of the 18650 high-power cells using LiNi{sub 0.8}Co{sub 0.2}O{sub 2} chemistry increases with time during the beginning period of storage. A symmetric cell approach is developed to distinguish the anode and cathode effects on the impedance rise. Cathode impedance, especially charge-transfer resistance, is identified as the main component of the cell impedance and is most responsible for the rise of the cell impedance during storage at room temperature. With analysis of impedance spectra from a variety of cells, the charge-transfer process is thought to take place at the interface between the electrolyte solution and the surface of surface layers on the electrode. We also propose that the surface layers might be mixed conductors of electrons and lithium ions, instead of pure lithium-ion conductors. The nature of the surface layers on the cathode is likely different from that of the surface layers on the anode.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The fundamental difference between this system and the more extensively studied pneumatic capsule pipeline is the different role played by aerodynamic forces. In a driven system the propelled capsules are resisted by aerodynamic forces and, in reaction, pump air through the tube. In contrast, in a pneumatically propelled system external blowers pump air through the tubes, and this provides the thrust for the capsules. An incompressible transient analysis is developed to study the aerodynamics of multiple capsules in a cross-linked two-bore pipeline. An aerodynamic friction coefficient is used as a cost parameter to compare the effects of capsule blockage and headway and to assess the merits of adits and vents. The authors conclude that optimum efficiency for off-design operation is obtained with long platoons of capsules in vented or adit connected tubes.","","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (US)","","","United States","2000-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Transportation Engineering; Journal Volume: 126; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May-Jun 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-270","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-947X; JTPEDI; TRN: IM200032%%124","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-947X(2000)126:3(263)","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080359","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080359","","Journal of Transportation Engineering","3","126"

To achieve this goal, it is crucially important to understand the behavior of metal particles and supports in engine exhaust gas. The authors have newly developed a medium-energy ion scattering (MEIS) simulation program for the analysis of alloy nanoparticles. The program was applied to the composition and average particle size analysis of Pt-Rh/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} treated in oxidative and reductive atmospheres. It was found that the Pt concentration near the surface decreased after oxidative treatment at 800 C and returned to its original value after reductive treatment at the same temperature. It was shown that Pt particle average sizes less than 10 nm can be evaluated quantitatively. Also, this technique gives some insight into particle size distribution in the initial stage of particle sintering, which has been quite out of the reach of conventional analytical tools.","","","Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc., Nagakute, Aichi (JP)","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 11-17","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%219","10.1006/jcat.2000.2813","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076090","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076090","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

The mechanism of selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxide with methane in excess oxygen was examined over nanocrystalline yttrium oxide. A series of heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction steps was proposed to account for the observed trends in catalytic properties. Methyl radicals generated at the catalyst surface desorb into the gas phase, where they react with nitric oxide to form nitrosomethane. Nitrosomethane then decomposes in a series of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions to produce nitrogen and nitrous oxide. Evidence for gas-phase reaction of methyl radicals with nitric oxide was found in the adsorption studies of nitric oxide on yttrium oxide, the presence of ethane and ethene in the reactor effluent, catalytic studies involving nitrosomethane and nitromethane, as well as the successful prediction of methane selectivities based on a homogeneous reaction mechanism for methyl radical consumption. The proposed pathway for nitrogen production was supported by the observation of hydrogen cyanide under certain operating conditions, as well as adsorbed NCO species detected by infrared spectroscopy.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 54-63","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%222","10.1006/jcat.2000.2814","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076093","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076093","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

The presence of Pd favored decomposition and dehydrogenation of ethanol, while Mo presented activity for oxidative dehydrogenation. The Pd-Mo catalyst showed better formation of N{sub 2} on TPD of NO, probably due to the NO adsorption on partially reduced molybdenum oxide. DRIFT results for the NO + CO reaction on the Pd-20Mo catalyst exhibited bands which correspond to nitrate or nitrous complexes and hydroxyl groups besides NCO species. MoO{sub 3} addition to a Pd/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst favored the formation of acetaldehyde at lower temperatures. A redox mechanism was proposed to explain the molybdenum promotional effect on Pd in the CO + NO reaction, evidencing Mo as promoter when the reducible oxide reacts with NO. However, molybdenum oxide does not promote the ethanol + NO reaction and this may be due to different reaction mechanisms.","","","Univ.

Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} prepared by the sol-gel method (Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(S)) exhibited excellent activity for NO reduction, compared with Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and impregnated Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} (Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(I)). XRD measurements of Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(S) indicated that a part of the Al{sup 3+} ions in Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} are substituted by Ga{sup 3+} ions, resulting in the formation of a composite oxide, [Ga{sub x}Al{sub (1{minus}x)}]{sub 2}O{sub 3} (x &lt; 1). On the other hand, Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3} particles and Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} particles were found to be present separately for Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(I). The high catalytic activity of Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(S) was accounted for by the high surface area and the nature of the [Ga{sub x}Al{sub (1{minus}x)}]{sub 2}O{sub 3} (x &lt; 1) composite oxide, which was formed uniformly by the present sol-gel method. The comparison of the reactivity between NO and NO{sub 2} suggested the participation of NO{sub 2} in NO reduction. The kinetic order for NO reduction was found to be 0.3 with respect to propene and 0.7 with respect to oxygen on both Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(I) and Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(S). However, a significant difference in the reaction order with respect to NO was observed between Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(I) and Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(S), 0.4 order on the former catalyst, and zero order on the latter one, indicating the presence of strongly adsorbed NOx species on the catalyst surface. On the basis of these results, a reaction mechanism was proposed in which the NOx adspecies formed through NO oxidation is reduced to nitrogen via organic intermediates containing nitrogen and oxygen.","","","National Inst. of Materials and Chemical Research, Tsukuba, Ibaraki (JP)","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 192; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-148","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200031%%228","10.1006/jcat.2000.2831","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20076099","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20076099","","Journal of Catalysis","1","192"

The adsorption isotherms were satisfactorily fitted to the Freundlich equation. The equilibrium coverages at 298 K were found to depend closely on the chemical composition of the oxide; thus, a decrease in the coverage beyond a maximum copper extent was observed. The adsorption isotherms of NO at various temperatures in the range from 298 to 473 K showed that the equilibrium coverage decreases with increasing temperature. This behavior enabled us to follow the logarithmic decrease of the heat of adsorption of NO on such surfaces. The adsorptions of NO and CO on surfaces preadsorbed with CO and NO, respectively, were also studied. These experiments showed the ability of NO to displace CO preadsorbed molecules whereas the contrary did not hold, suggesting the existence of common adsorption sites as well as some specific CO adsorption sites. Finally, some kinetic data are reported showing that the experimental adsorption results fit the Elovich equation (with t{sub 0} {approx} 0), although two distinct rate processes could be identified.","","","Univ.

Two general types of ceria entities are observed: aggregated crystalline ceria species (3D-Ce) and dispersed ceria species in the form of two-dimensional patches (2D-Ce). The relative amounts of each of these species do not show a linear relationship with the cerium loading: as the cerium content is increased, a trend toward formation of 3D-Ce, to the detriment of 2D-Ce, is observed. The EPR data evidence differences in chemical (redox) behavior between 2D-Ce, 3D-Ce, and unsupported ceria. Thus, the main differing characteristic of some 3D-Ce particles with respect to unsupported ceria, which holds true for all 3D-Ce formed with weight percent {le} 10, is the absence of associated vacancies upon outgassing at 773 K (evidenced by EPR of chemisorbed oxygen). This behavior is attributed to the existence of an epitaxial relationship between ceria and the underlying alumina, which influences largely the properties of relatively small 3D-Ce particles. In the initial calcined state, 2D-Ce patches are shown to present cerium in a (formally) Ce{sup 4+} oxidation state, with relaxed coordination distances and experiencing a decreased ligand field which facilitates their reduction (in comparison with 3D-Ce or unsupported ceria). Implications of these results on molecular design of depollution catalysts are discussed.","","","CSIC, Madrid (ES)","","","United States","2000-05-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: PBD: 4 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4038-4046","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; JPCBFK; TRN: IM200025%%17","10.1021/jp992796y","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20050840","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20050840","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","17","104"

ETO's with voltage and current ratings of 4--6 kV and 1--4 kA, have been developed and demonstrated. And those power levels are the highest in silicon power devices and are comparable to those of the gate turn-off thyristor (GTO). Compared to the conventional GTO, the ETO has much shorter storage time, voltage controlled turn-off capability, and much larger reverse biased safe operation area (RBSOA). Furthermore, ETO's have a forward-biased safe operation area (FBSOA) that enables it to control the turn-on di/dt similar to an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). These combined advantages make the ETO based power system simpler in terms of dv/dt snubber, di/dt snubber, over current protection, resulting in significant savings in the system cost. This paper presents experimental and numerical results that demonstrate the advantages of the ETO.","","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ., Blacksburg, VA (US)","Sandia National Laboratories; US Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 561-566","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993; ITPEE8; TRN: IM200032%%99","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080334","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080334","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","3","15"

At higher coverages the dissociation is significantly retarded by lateral interactions with N- and O-atoms and NO molecules. At coverages close to saturation the dissociation is entirely blocked by NO due to the lack of ensembles containing empty sites. The results are compared with those of earlier studies on Rh(111). It appears that dissociation of NO proceeds faster on the more open Rh(100) surface, due to the higher heat of adsorption of the N-atoms.

An almost 100% selectivity toward N{sub 2} is observed with only small amounts of NH{sub 3} formation at higher H{sub 2}/NO ratios. From the AES and TDS experiments it was concluded that an O layer that is inactive to reaction with hydrogen is responsible for the low reaction rate on the heating branch.

An indispensable requirement for a safe design of radial inflow turbines is a detailed knowledge of the exciting forces. Up to now, only a few investigations relating to unsteady aerodynamic forces in radial turbines have been presented. To give a detailed insight into the complex phenomena, a comprehensive research project was initiated at the Institut fuer Thermische Stroemungsmaschinen, at the University of Karlsruhe. A turbocharger test rig was installed in the high-pressure, high-temperature laboratory of the institute. The present paper gives a description of the test rig design and the measuring techniques. The flow field in a vaneless radial inflow turbine was analyzed using laser-Doppler anemometry. First results of unsteady flow field investigations in the turbine scroll and unsteady phase-resolved measurements of the flow field in the turbine rotor will be discussed. Moreover, results from finite element calculations analyzing frequencies and mode shapes are presented. As vibrations in turbines of turbochargers are assumed to be predominantly excited by unsteady aerodynamic forces, a method to predict the actual transient flow in a radial turbine utilizing the commercial Navier-Stokes solver TASCflow3d was developed. Results of the unsteady calculations are presented and comparisons with the measured unsteady flow field are made. As a major result, the excitation effect of the tongue region in a vaneless radial inflow turbine can be demonstrated.","","","Univ.

Before improvements to vane heat transfer predictions through boundary layer calculations can be made, an understanding of how the turbulent flow in the inviscid region of the passage reacts as it passes between two adjacent turbine vanes is needed. In this study, a scaled-up turbine vane geometry was used in a low-speed wind tunnel simulation. The test section included a central airfoil with two adjacent vanes. To generate the 20% turbulence levels at the entrance to the cascade, which simulates levels exiting the combustor, an active grid was used. Three-component laser-Doppler velocimeter measurements of the mean and fluctuating quantities were measured in a plane at the vane midspan. Coincident velocity measurements were made to quantify Reynolds shear stress and correlation coefficients. The energy spectra and length scales were also measured to give a complete set of inlet boundary conditions that can be used for numerical simulations. The results show that the turbulent kinetic energy throughout the inviscid region remained relatively high. The surface heat transfer measurements indicated high augmentation near the leading edge as well as the pressure side of the vane as a result of the elevated turbulence levels.","","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ., Blacksburg, VA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 255-262","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%68","10.1115/1.555442","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086924","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086924","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

This paper is concerned with the design and execution of the experimental portion of the study, which represents the first reported investigation to obtain nearly full surface information on heat transfer coefficients within an environment that develops an appropriate pressure distribution about an airfoil blade tip and shroud model. A stationary blade cascade experiment has been run consisting of three airfoils, the center airfoil having a variable tip gap clearance. The airfoil models the aerodynamic tip section of a high-pressure turbine blade with inlet Mach number of 0.30, exit Mach number of 0.75, pressure ratio of 1.45, exit Reynolds number based on axial chord of 2.57 x 10{sup 6}, and total turning of about 110 degrees. A hue detection based liquid crystal method is used to obtain the detailed heat transfer coefficient distribution on the blade tip surface for flat, smooth tip surfaces with both sharp and rounded edges. The cascade inlet turbulence intensity level took on values of either 5 or 9%. The cascade also models the casing recess in the shroud surface ahead of the blade. Experimental results are shown for the pressure distribution measurements on the airfoil near the tip gap, on the blade tip surface, and on the opposite shroud surface. Tip surface heat transfer coefficient distributions are shown for sharp edge and rounded edge tip geometries at each of the inlet turbulence intensity levels.","","","General Electric Corp., Schenectady, NY (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-271","","","FC21-95MC31176","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%69","10.1115/1.555443","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086925","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086925","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

This paper shows how this method has been applied to the design of a nonaxisymmetric end wall for a turbine rotor blade in linear cascade. The calculations show that nonaxisymmetric end wall profiling is a powerful tool for reducing secondary flows, in particular the secondary kinetic energy and exit angle deviations. Simple end wall profiling is shown to be at least as beneficial aerodynamically as the now standard techniques of differentially skewing aerofoil sections up the span, and (compound) leaning of the aerofoil. A design is presented that combines a number of end wall features aimed at reducing secondary loss and flow deviation. The experimental study of this geometry, aimed at validating the design method, is the subject of the second part of this paper. The effects of end wall perturbations on the flow field are calculated using a three-dimensional pressure correction based Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes CFD code. These calculations are normally performed overnight on a cluster of work stations. The design system then calculates the relationships between perturbations in the end wall and resulting changes in the flow field. With these available, linear superposition theory is used to enable the designer to investigate quickly the effect on the flow field of many combinations of end wall shapes (a matter of minutes for each shape).","","","Rolls-Royce plc, Derby (GB)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 278-285","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%71","10.1115/1.555445","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086927","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086927","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The design intent was to reduce the passage vortex strength and to produce a more uniform exit flow angle profile in the radial direction with less overturning at the wall. The new end wall has been tested in the linear cascade and a comprehensive set of measurements taken. These include traverses of the flow field at a number of axial planes and surface static pressure distributions on the end wall. Detailed comparisons have been made with the CFD design predictions, and also for the results with a planar end wall. In this way an improved understanding of the effects of end wall profiling has been obtained. The experimental results generally agree with the design predictions, showing a reduction in the strength of the secondary flow at the exit and a more uniform flow angle profile. In a turbine stage these effects would be expected to improve the performance of any downstream blade row. There is also a reduction in the overall loss, which was not given by the CFD design predictions. Areas where there are discrepancies between the CFD calculations and measurement are likely to be due to the turbulence model used.

The difference scheme comprises an explicit part in the intermediate time-step and an implicit part in the local time-step. The viscous flux vectors are decomposed to simplify the flow calculation in the explicit step. The time difference terms are expressed in terms of the viscous dependent terms that appear in the diffusion terms in the form by adding eigenvalues of viscous flux matrices into the time derivation term. In the presently proposed scheme, the two-sweep procedure is used in the implicit step instead of employing a traditional matrix operation to save the computational time. This method has been used to calculate the flow around C3X and VKI cascades. The computed results were compared with experimental data as well as with other published computations.

Two-scale roughness was used because in-service aeroengines commonly display larger roughness concentrated at the leading edge with smaller roughness distributed downstream. The first scale, covering up to the first 5 cm of the test surface, was in the form of a sandpaper strip, an aluminum strip, or a cylinder. The second roughness scale covered the remainder of the test surface (2 m) in the form of sandpaper or a smooth surface. In Part 1, the surface heat transfer results are examined. Even though the roughness scales were hydraulically smooth, they induced significantly earlier transition onset, with the two-dimensional roughness causing earlier transition than three-dimensional roughness. All of the rough/smooth cases unexpectedly triggered earlier transition than rough/rough cases. This indicated that the scale of the step-change at the joint between two roughness scales was predominant over the downstream roughness on inducing early transition. Reducing the overall height of the step change was shown to have a greater effect on transition than the specific geometry of the roughness scale.","","","Clemson Univ., SC (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 301-307","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%74","10.1115/1.555448","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086930","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086930","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The variation of intermittence through the transition region was shown to be consistent with a smooth-wall model of transition, but the prediction of transition onset was not well represented by momentum thickness for cases with strong surface disturbances. During transition, distributed roughness was shown to reduce the growth of velocity fluctuation, possibly through stronger dissipation, and to enhance wallward transport of momentum significantly without a corresponding increase in thermal transport. The step change between the two roughness scales was shown to notably affect boundary layer behavior. Spectral analysis supported the hypothesis in Part 1 that the separated region downstream of the step shed vortices into the downstream flow. The wavelet analysis suggested that transition over rough surfaces may be in bypass mode because the disturbances were shown to be amplified in a broad spectral band.","","","Clemson Univ., SC (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 308-316","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%75","10.1115/1.555454","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086931","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086931","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"
"Transonic aerodynamic losses due to turbine airfoil, suction surface film cooling","Jackson, D J; Lee, K L; Ligrani, P M; Johnson, P D","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; GAS TURBINES; FILM COOLING; ENERGY LOSSES; AERODYNAMICS; TRANSONIC FLOW","The effects of suction surface film cooling on aerodynamic losses are investigated using an experimental apparatus designed especially for this purpose. A symmetric airfoil with the same transonic Mach number distribution on both sides is employed. Mach numbers range from 0.4 to 1.24 and match values on the suction surface of airfoils from operating aeroengines. Film cooling holes are located on one side of the airfoil near the passage throat where the free-stream Mach number is nominally 1.07. Round cylindrical and conical diffused film cooling hole configurations are investigated with density ratios from 0.8 to 1.3 over a range of blowing ratios, momentum flux ratios, and Mach number ratios. Also included are discharge coefficients, local and integrated total pressure losses, down-stream kinetic energy distributions, Mach number profiles, and a correlation for integral aerodynamic losses as they depend upon film cooling parameters. The contributions of mixing and shock waves to total pressure losses are separated and quantified. These results show that losses due to shock waves vary with blowing ratio as shock wave strength changes. Aerodynamic loss magnitudes due to mixing vary significantly with film cooling hole geometry, blowing ratio, Mach number ratio, and (in some situations) density ratio. Integrated mixing losses from round cylindrical holes are three times higher than from conical diffused holes, when compared at the same blowing ratio. Such differences depend upon mixing losses just downstream of the airfoil, as well as turbulent diffusion of streamwise momentum normal to the airfoil symmetry plane.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 317-326","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%76","10.1115/1.555455","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086932","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086932","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"
"Influence of internal flow on film cooling effectiveness","Wilfert, G; Wolff, S","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; GAS TURBINES; FILM COOLING; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE","Film cooling experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of internal flow conditions and plenum geometry on the film cooling effectiveness. The film cooling measurements show a strong influence of the coolant inlet conditions on film cooling performance. The present experiments were carried out on a flat plate with a row of cylindrical holes oriented at 30 degrees with respect to a constant-velocity external flow, systematically varying the plenum geometry and blowing rates (0.5 {le} M {le} 1.25). Adiabatic film cooling measurements using the multiple narrow-banded thermochromic liquid crystal technique (TLC) were carried out, simulating a flow parallel to the mainstream flow with and without crossflow at the coolant hole entry compared with a standard plenum configuration. An impingement in front of the cooling hole entry with and without crossflow was also investigated. For all parallel flow configurations, ribs were installed at the top and bottom coolant channel wall. As the hole length-to-diameter ratio has an influence on the film cooling effectiveness, the wall thickness has also been varied. In order to optimize the benefit of the geometry effects with ribs, a vortex generator was designed and tested. Results from these experiments show in a region 5 {le} X/D {le} 80 downstream of the coolant injection location differences in adiabatic film cooling effectiveness between +5% and +65% compared with a standard plenum configuration.","","","ABB Corporate Research Ltd., Bade-Daettwil (CH)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 327-333","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%77","10.1115/1.555449","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086933","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The code has been developed at the Institute of Steam and Gas Turbines, Aachen University of Technology. It works on the basis of an implicit finite volume method combined with a multi-block technique. The cooling configuration is an axial turbine blade cascade with leading edge ejection through two rows of cooling holes. The rows are located in the vicinity of the stagnation line, one row on the suction side, the other row is on the pressure side. the cooling holes have a radial ejection angle of 45 degrees. This configuration has been investigated experimentally by other authors and the results have been documented as a test case for numerical calculations of ejection flow phenomena. The numerical investigations focus on the aerothermal mixing process in the cooling jets and the impact on the temperature distribution on the blade surface. The radial ejection angles lead to a fully three-dimensional and asymmetric jet flow field. Within a secondary flow analysis, the cooling fluid jets are investigated in detail. The secondary flow fields include asymmetric kidney vortex systems with one dominating vortex on the back side of the jets. The numerical and experimental data show a respectable agreement concerning the vortex development.","","","Aachen Univ. of Technology (DE)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 334-339","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%78","10.1115/1.555456","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086934","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086934","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The blade has only one row of film holes near the gill hole portion on the suction side of the blade. Tests were performed on a five-blade linear cascade in a low-speed wind tunnel. The mainstream Reynolds number based on cascade exit velocity was 5.3 x 10{sup 5}. Upstream unsteady wakes were simulated using a spoke-wheel type wake generator. Coolant blowing ratio was varied from 0.6 to 1.2. Wake Strouhal number was kept at 0 and 0.1. Results show that unsteady wake reduces film cooling effectiveness. Results also show that film injection enhances local heat transfer coefficient while the unsteady wake promotes earlier boundary-layer transition.

"Local swirl chamber heat transfer and flow structure at different Reynolds numbers","Hedlung, C R; Ligrani, P M","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; GAS TURBINES; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; HEAT TRANSFER; GAS FLOW","Local flow behavior and heat transfer results are presented from two swirl chambers, which model passages used to cool the leading edges of turbine blades in gas turbine engines. Flow results are obtained in an isothermal swirl chamber. Surface Nusselt number distributions are measured in a second swirl chamber (with a constant wall heat flux boundary condition) using infrared thermography in conjunction with thermocouples, energy balances, and in situ calibration procedures. In both cases, Reynolds numbers Re based on inlet duct characteristics range from 6,000 to about 20,000. Bulk helical flow is produced in each chamber by two inlets, which are tangent to the swirl chamber circumference. Important changes to local and globally averaged surface Nusselt numbers, instantaneous flow structure from flow visualizations, and distributions of static pressure, total pressure, and circumferential velocity are observed throughout the swirl chambers as the Reynolds number increases. Of particular importance are increases of local surface Nusselt numbers (as well as ones globally averaged over the entire swirl chamber surface) with increasing Reynolds number. These are tied to increased advection, as well as important changes to vortex characteristics near the concave surfaces of the swirl chambers. Higher Re also give larger axial components of velocity, and increased turning of the flow from each inlet, which gives Goertler vortex pair trajectories greater skewness as they are advected downstream of each inlet.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 375-385","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%83","10.1115/1.555458","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086939","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086939","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The main objective of this effort is to produce local heat transfer data for CFD validation. Local Nusselt number measurements in flows through round-ended U-bends of square cross section, with and without artificial wall roughness, are presented. Their earlier LDA measurements of flows through these passages are first briefly reviewed and then the liquid-crystal technique for the measurement of local wall heat transfer inside passages of complex geometries is presented. Tightly curved U-bends generate strong secondary motion and cause flow separation at the bend exit, which substantially raises turbulence levels. Wall heat transfer is significantly increased, especially immediately downstream of the U-bend, where it is over two times higher than in a straight duct. The local heat transfer coefficient around the perimeter of the passage is also found to vary considerably because of the curvature-induced secondary motion. The introduction of surface ribs results in a further increase in turbulence levels, a reduction in the size of the curvature-induced separation bubble, and a complex flow development after the bend exit with additional separation regions along the outer wall. Heat transfer levels in the straight sections are more than doubled by the introduction of ribs. The effects of the bend on the overall levels of Nusselt number are not as strong as in the smooth U-bend, but are still significant. The effects of the bend on the perimetral variation of local heat transfer coefficients within the ribbed downstream section are also substantial.","","","UMIST, Manchester (GB)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 386-392","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%84","10.1115/1.555459","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086940","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086940","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The conventional engine tester has the problem that the performance of the engine torque control system is deteriorated by the influences of the interference between the dynamometer speed control system and the engine torque control system. The authors proposed the practical engine torque control system based on an observer and an identification system to eliminate the interference of the dynamometer speed control system. The effect of observer's parameter error on the engine torque estimation response was analyzed. According to the result of this analysis, a practical method is proposed to identify the engine inertia moment and the shaft spring coefficient that are parameters of the observer. The authors confirmed through simulation and experiments that the proposed decoupling engine torque control system realizes a robust control system from the interference with the dynamometer speed control system.","","","Meidensha Corp., Tokyo (JP)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, Lake Buena Vista, FL (US), 10/08/1995--10/12/1995; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 467-474","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994; ITIACR; TRN: IM200033%%285","10.1109/28.833763","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20082438","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20082438","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","2","36"

The reactor consists of either a Plexiglass or glass cylindrical tube with macro-porous RVC electrodes placed perpendicularly to the cylinder axis. Streamers propagate between the RVC disks providing a uniform exposure of the flowing gas stream to the electrical discharge. This mode of operation provides for convenient reactor scale-up while maintaining the interelectrode spacing in a moderate range, thus allowing scale-up without the need for higher voltage power supplies. It is further envisioned that the reactor can be operated with multiple sets of electrodes placed in series down the length of the reactor in order to facilitate high efficiency removal of air pollutants. Experiments with nitrogen oxide (NO) in dry air and lower concentration oxygen gas (i.e., 15% O{sub 2}, made from air and N{sub 2}) at room temperature and pressure show that the NO, as expected in an oxidizing environment, is converted to NO{sub 2}. In addition, for these same dry gases (100 ppm) and for these gases with higher inlet NO (180 ppm) upon the addition of water vapor total NO{sub x} is also removed. In dry gas at an energy density of 117 J/l 103 ppm, NO (100%) and 115 ppm NO{sub x} (96%) are removed at a cost of 3.9 g/k Wh [257 eV/NO] (based on NO) and in humid gas at an energy density of 226 J/l 189 ppm NO (100%) and 219 ppm NO{sub x} (97%) are removed at a cost of 3.7 g/k Wh (273 eV/NO) (based on NO).

It has been found that the activity of Rh is hindered by accumulation of surface oxygen originating from NO decomposition and gas-phase oxygen in the feed. Adsorbed CO and reduced TiO{sub 2{minus}x} species in the vicinity of Rh particles act as oxygen atom scavengers and, under fuel-rich conditions, remove atomic oxygen from the surface and restore the catalytic properties. Results of the present study provide additional evidence that production of N{sub 2} is related to dissociation of adsorbed Rh-NO{sup {minus}} while production of N{sub 2}O is related to the presence of Rh(NO){sub 2}. The presence of reduced RH{sup 0} sites is necessary for the formation of both reduction products. In the absence of oxygen in the feed, surface isocyanate species are also observed under reaction conditions. Their formation requires the presence of adjacent Rh{sup 0}-CO and reduced Rh{sup 0} sites.

This article addresses two potential sources of this variation, atomization differences and impurities due to lack of quality control during production. Atomization is the first process encountered during the combustion of fuels in a compression ignition engine and is largely determined by the fuel's viscosity and surface tension. Previous work using five experimentally produced methyl ester biodiesel fuels showed that the viscosity and surface tension could be predicted from their fatty acid ester composition, and the atomization characteristics in turn could be predicted from their viscosity and surface tension. This article utilizes the results of that work to give a quantitative comparison of the atomization characteristics of fifteen biodiesel fuel types using the fuel's viscosity and surface tension, predicted directly from the fatty acid composition of the fuels. Except for coconut and rapeseed biodiesel fuels, all of the rest of the 15 biodiesel fuels had similar atomization characteristics. Since the most likely contaminant in the fuel from the processing was residual glycerides, their effect on viscosity and surface tension was studied experimentally and their effect on the atomization characteristics was computed.","","","Neil and Gunter, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (CA)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the ASAE; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 207-211","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-2351; TAAEAJ; TRN: IM200032%%12","10.13031/2013.2695","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20080247","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080247","","Transactions of the ASAE","2","43"

Design criteria are the ability of the rotor to withstand high speeds, ability to operate in vacuum, negligible zero-torque spinning losses, high reliability, high efficiency, and low manufacturing cost. The rotor of the synchronous reluctance machine consists of bonded sections of ferromagnetic and non-magnetic steels. Finite-element code, incorporating rotor rotation, has been developed in MATLAB that calculates steady-state eddy currents (and losses) in the rotor. A stator iron and stator winding have been designed to minimize rotor losses, and two such prototype machines have been fabricated. Experimental results show an efficiency of 91% at a 10-kW 10,000-r/min operating point, and rotor losses less than 0.5% of input power.","","","Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1998 Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, St. Louis, MO (US), 10/12/1998--10/16/1998; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 531-539","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994; ITIACR; TRN: IM200033%%288","10.1109/28.833771","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20082441","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20082441","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","2","36"

Modal analysis of the turbine blades indicated possible resonance in crucial operating ranges of the turbopump. Unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was conducted to support the aerodynamic and structural dynamic assessments of the turbine. Before beginning the analysis, two major problems with current unsteady analytical capabilities had to be addressed: modeling a straight centerline nozzle with the turbine blades and exit guide vanes (EGVs), and reducing run times significantly while maintaining physical accuracy. Modifications were made to the CFD code used in this study to allow the coupled nozzle/blade/EGV analysis and to incorporate Message Passing Interface (MPI) software. Because unsteadiness is a key issue for the Fastrac turbine [and future rocket engine turbines such as the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV)], calculations were performed for two nozzle-to-blade axial gaps. Calculations were also performed for the nozzle alone, and the results were imposed as an inlet boundary condition for a blade/EGV calculation for the large gap case. These results are compared to the nozzle/blade/EGV results.","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 225-233","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%65","10.1115/1.555453","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086921","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086921","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

The simulation includes the flow regions inside the coolant plena and film cooling holes in addition to the external flow. The vane is the subject of an upcoming NASA Lewis Research Center experiment and has both circular cross-sectional and shaped-film cooling holes. This complex geometry is modeled using a multiblock grid, which accurately discretizes the actual vane geometry including shaped holes. The simulation matches operating conditions for the planned experiment and assumes periodicity in the spanwise direction on the scale of one pitch of the film cooling hole pattern. Two computations were performed for different isothermal wall temperatures, allowing independent determination of heat transfer coefficients and film effectiveness values. The results indicate separate localized regions of high heat flux in the showerhead region due to low film effectiveness and high heat transfer coefficient values, while the shaped holes provide a reduction in hat flux through both parameters. Hole exit data indicate rather simple skewed profiles for the round holes, but complex profiles for the shaped holes with mass fluxes skewed strongly toward their leading edges.","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 348-359","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%80","10.1115/1.555450","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086936","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

In the past, it was recognized that the tendency for a metal surface to dissociate NO depends on its position in the periodic table, but little was understood about the dissociation process itself. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that this view is oversimplified. In addition to the distinction between molecular and dissociative adsorption on surfaces, the structure of NO on metal surfaces has also been the subject of detailed study and debate. It is therefore timely to update their ideas about NO adsorption and reactivity. Here the authors examine the structure of NO on surfaces, in particular the break-down of vibrational assignments and the authors look at how these assignments can be improved. The NO dissociation process is also discussed along with the formation, ad reactions, of the NO dimer, (NO){sub 2}, on some metal surfaces.","","","Univ.

The TPR profiles of adsorbates and CO{sub 2} show that Rh surface states and their adsorbates are governed by the redox reaction cycle of NO-CO. Adsorbed oxygen from dissociated NO oxidizes Rh{sup 0} to Rh{sup +}; adsorbed CO reduces Rh{sup +} to Rh{sup 0}. The extent of oxidation and reduction of Rh{sup 0}/Rh{sup +} is in part reflected in the intensity of the adsorbates residing on these sites (i.e., Rh{sup +}(CO){sub 2}, Rh{sup 0}-CO, Rh-NO{sup +}, and Rh{sup 0}-NO{sup {minus}}). An increasing NO/CO ratio shifts the TPR profiles of Rh{sup +}(CO){sub 2}, NO conversion, and light-off to higher temperatures. The results reveal that a high NO/CO ratio of high concentration of oxidant enhances the extent of oxidation of Rh{sup 0} to Rh{sup +}, resulting in low catalyst activity for NO reduction. Keeping the Rh surface in the Rh{sup 0} state by a low NO/CO ratio decreases the Rh{sup +}(CO){sub 2} intensity and shifts the light-off to a lower temperature. O{sub 2}, H{sub 2}, and C{sub 3}H{sub 8} present in simulated gas compete with NO and CO for the Rh site, lowering NO reduction activity.","","","Univ. of Akron, OH (US)","","","United States","2000-03-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: 16 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2265-2272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1089-5647; JPCBFK; TRN: IM200021%%295","10.1021/jp9922155","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20026915","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20026915","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","10","104"

For NO + CO, the presence of ceria and lanthana affected activity, apparent activation energy, dinitrogen selectivity, and reaction orders to varying degrees over both Pd and Rh. The turnover frequency (based on H{sub 2} chemisorption) for the ceria-promoted Pd catalyst was at least an order of magnitude greater than those for all other catalysts. Lanthana-promoted Pd was the next most active catalyst. Changes in kinetic parameters indicated that both ceria and lanthana facilitated NO dissociation on both Pd and Rh, but the effect of ceria on Pd was the most profound. For N{sub 2}O + CO, ceria promoted the reaction rate on both Pd and Rh whereas lanthana did not promote the reaction on either metal. The ceria-promoted Pd catalyst was again the most active. However, the turnover frequencies for the N{sub 2}O + CO reaction were about an order of magnitude lower than those for the NO + CO reaction under similar conditions. The rare earth components had very little effect on the activation energies and reaction orders for the N{sub 2}O + CO reaction. In situ infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of isocyanate surface species on Rh/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} but not on Pd/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, which suggested two different reaction mechanisms for the N{sub 2}O + CO reaction.

It is found that, under the experimental conditions employed, four kinds of nitrogen oxide species may coexist in the adsorbed mode, namely, Rh-NO{sup {minus}}(high), Rh-NO{sup {minus}}{angstrom}(low), Rh(NO){sub 2}, and Rh-NO{sup +}, giving rise to IR bands located at 1,770, 1,660, 1,830/1,725, and 1,908 cm{sup {minus}1}, respectively. Both negatively charged species readily dissociate on reduced surface sites, yielding nitride, and are mainly responsible for dinitrogen formation in the gas phase. The dinitrosyl species, the formation of which is favored over partially oxidized surfaces, is related to the production of nitrous oxide. The formation of both N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O requires the presence of reduced surface sites. In the absence of Rh{sup 0}, dissociative adsorption of NO stops and Rh-NO{sup +} species dominate the catalyst surface. Doping TiO{sub 2} with W{sup 6+} cations alters the electronic properties of supported Rh crystallites and, concomitantly, the chemisorptive behavior of the catalyst toward NO and CO. In particular, doping results in blue shifts in the stretching frequencies of N-O and C-O bonds contained in Rh-NO{sup +}, Rh(NO){sub 2}, Rh-CO, and Rh(CO){sub 2} species, indicating a weaker bonding of the adsorbed molecules with the surface. This is also evidenced by the significantly lower amounts of accumulated species, desorbed in TPD experiments. In contrast, the N-O bond of the Rh-NO{sup {minus}} species is weakened by doping, resulting in higher rates of dissociation and, therefore, in higher transient yields of N{sub 2} production in the gas phase, compared to the undoped catalyst.","","","Univ. of Patras (GR)","","","United States","2000-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 446-459","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200019%%295","10.1006/jcat.1999.2763","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020870","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020870","","Journal of Catalysis","2","190"

The influences of configuration parameters and operation conditions on the thermal performance of cold plates are also explored. Among the six kinds of chosen core configurations, wavy fin (17.8--3/8w) shows superior heat-removal performance. Since cold plates with lower thermal conductivity reduce the heat dissipation materials with higher thermal conductivity were selected for the thermal management of nickel/metal hydride batteries. The heat dissipated away from the top and bottom surfaces by forced convection constitutes only a very small portion of the heat generated by batteries. The average temperature of a battery is primarily dominated by the cooling performance of cold plates on both sides of a battery, which can markedly lower the temperature. Finally, the average surface temperature during charging of a packed module without cold plates could reach about 44 C, whereas with cold plates the temperature decreased to 27 C. Furthermore, during discharging, the temperatures of modules with and without cold plates were about 24 and 26 C, respectively.","","","National Tsing-Hua Univ., Hsinchu (TW)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 930-935","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-4651; JESOAN; TRN: IM200022%%275","10.1149/1.1393294","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","20030649","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030649","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","3","147"

Thermal CVD at 450 C with oxygen as carrier gas gave mixed Ce(III)/Ce(IV) oxides, and the main crystalline component was Ce{sub 4}O{sub 7}, but with fluoride impurity. The fluoride impurity was not observed if CVD was carried out using moist oxygen as carrier gas or if the as-deposited films were annealed in oxygen. Codeposition with [Y(hfac){sub 3}{l_brace}MeO(CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O){sub 2}Me{r_brace}] gave films of the mixed Ce(IV)Y(III) oxide Ce{sub 2}Y{sub 2}O{sub 7}. The depositions of cerium oxides could be enhanced by use of a palladium precursor catalyst [Pd(2-methylallyl)(acetylacetonate)] and could then be carried out at 250 C, giving films of CeO{sub 2}. Under carefully controlled conditions, films of ceria-supported palladium could be prepared by this method. The films were characterized by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques.","","","Univ. of Western Ontario, London, Ontario (CA)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemistry of Materials; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 701-710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0897-4756; CMATEX; TRN: IM200025%%41","10.1021/cm990455r","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20050864","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20050864","","Chemistry of Materials","3","12"

The experimental conditions resemble the cold-start period of an Otto engine in a car. Two types of adsorbed ethylene species seem to exist. A selective catalyst deactivation for oxygen adsorption, due to deposition of carbonaceous species, was found. A kinetic model was developed, based on elementary reaction steps, that allows one to describe the experiments quantitatively. Furthermore, this model was combined with the published model for transient carbon monoxide oxidation over the same catalyst, which enables one to predict the results of simultaneous ethylene and carbon monoxide oxidation. Both components react in rather distinct zones, with ethylene being converted only when carbon monoxide oxidation is almost complete.","","","Eindhoven Univ. of Technology (NL)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 599-609","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: IM200018%%272","10.1021/ie990614g","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20019038","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20019038","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","39"

Acoustic emission increased initially with a decrease in burst pressure, and attained a maximum at an intermediate level of damage to the FRP. However, acoustic emission decreased when the level of damage was higher and the burst pressure was lower.

Swirl provides an effective means to stabilize the flame, enhance and control the mixing process, increase the combustion efficiency, and eliminate pollutants emission. For achieving design optimization and better performance of the combustors, the properties of swirling turbulent flows should be properly predicted. A numerical simulation of swirling turbulent flows of coaxial jets in a combustor is presented in this paper. The new algebraic Reynolds stress model (ASM) is employed for the closure of the time-averaged governing equations for swirling turbulent flows. Two cases o the swirling flow, i.e., a coswirl jet flow and a counterswirl jet flow, are simulated. The calculated results of the axial and tangential velocities, static pressure, and turbulent fluctuating velocity are compared with the measured data for both cases. The results illustrate that the predictions by the new ASM are closer to the measurements than those obtained by the {kappa}-{var_epsilon} model.","","","Tsinghua Univ., Beijing (CN)","","","United States","2000-02-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

"Advantages of switched reluctance motor applications to EV and HEV: Design and control issues","Rahman, K M; Fahimi, B; Suresh, G; Rajarathnam, A V; Ehsani, M","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; HYBRID ELECTRIC-POWERED VEHICLES; ELECTRIC-POWERED VEHICLES; ELECTRIC MOTORS; CONTROL THEORY; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE","Land vehicles need their drivetrain to operate entirely in constant power in order to meet their operational constraints, such as initial acceleration and gradability, with minimum power rating. The internal combustion engine (ICE) is inappropriate for producing this torque-speed profile. Therefore, multiple gear transmission is necessary with the ICE in a vehicle. Some electric machines, if designed and controlled appropriately, are capable of producing an extended constant power range. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the capabilities of the switched reluctance motor (SRM) for electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle applications. This investigation will be carried out in two steps. The first step involves the machine design and the finite-element analysis to obtain the static characteristic of the motor. In the second step, the finite-element field solutions are used in the development of a nonlinear model to investigate the dynamic performance of the designed motor. Several 8-6 and 6-4 SRM geometries will be investigated. Effects of different stator and rotor pole widths and pole heights on the steady state as well as on the dynamic performance of the motor will be studied. The air gap for each motor will be made as small as manufacturally possible. The aspects of performance to be compared for each design motor are: (1) the range of the constant power operation; (2) drive efficiency in this extended constant power range; (3) the power factor in this operational range; and (4) the short time overload capability. The first performance index defines the rated power of the motor. The longer the constant power range, the lower is the power rating for the same vehicle performance. In the high-speed operation of the SRM, there will be considerable phase overlapping. Hence, thicker back iron than usual might be needed to prevent the back iron from saturating. However, since flux peaking of each phase occurs at different rotor positions, the phase overlapping might not necessitate special designing of the back iron. However, the possibility of the back iron being saturated will not be neglected and will be investigated. The optimal control parameters of the SRM, which maximize the constant power range with maximum torque per ampere, will be calculated. A performance comparison will be made for this optimal operation. Simulation results of the designed SRM will be presented for vehicle acceleration.","","","Texas A and M Univ., College Station, TX (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1998 Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, St. Louis, MO (US), 10/12/1998--10/16/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 111-121","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994; ITIACR; TRN: IM200019%%63","10.1109/28.821805","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020638","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020638","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","1","36"

The limiting mechanism of the electrode was found to be associated with formation of NiCl{sub 2} on the surface of the nickel electrode. This phenomenon limits the mass-transfer processes of the nonporous electrode and thus its area capacity density. Based on the results of these investigations, an electrochemical model of the electrode reactions was developed which predicts the performance characteristics of porous Ni/NiCl{sub 2} electrodes for various conditions of operation. Modifying the electrolyte with the NaBr, NaI, and sulfur additives was found to produce higher nickel utilization and lower impedance values due to doping effects, which is believed to open up the lattice for better mass transport. Solubility of the nickel chloride in sodium-chloroaluminate melts as a function of temperature and additives was also determined. The solubility measurements indicated that the solubility of nickel chloride in the chloroaluminate melt is strongly dependent on the operational temperature of the cell and the chemical additives present in the electrolyte. The results of this study clearly indicate the importance of the chemical additives, basicity of the melt, and the lower operating temperature of the Na/NiCl{sub 2} cell for improved performance and cycle life.","","","Illinois Inst. of Tech., Chicago, IL (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 502-507","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-4651; JESOAN; TRN: IM200020%%273","10.1149/1.1393224","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","20023338","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20023338","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","2","147"

Perhaps bioinformatics--the shotgun marriage between biology and mathematics, computer science, and engineering--is like an elephant that occupies a large chair in the scientific living room. Given the demand for and shortage of researchers with the computer skills to handle large volumes of biological data, where exactly does the bioinformatics elephant sit? There are probably many biologists who feel that a major product of this bioinformatics elephant is large piles of waste material. If you have tried to plow through Web sites and software packages in search of a specific tool for analyzing and collating large amounts of research data, you may well feel the same way. But there has been progress with major initiatives to develop more computing power, educate biologists about computers, increase funding, and set standards. For our purposes, bioinformatics is not simply a biologically inclined rehash of information theory (1) nor is it a hodgepodge of computer science techniques for building, updating, and accessing biological data. Rather bioinformatics incorporates both of these capabilities into a broad interdisciplinary science that involves both conceptual and practical tools for the understanding, generation, processing, and propagation of biological information. As such, bioinformatics is the sine qua non of 21st-century biology. Analyzing gene expression using cDNA microarrays immobilized on slides or other solid supports (gene chips) is set to revolutionize biology and medicine and, in so doing, generate vast quantities of data that have to be accurately interpreted (Fig. 1). As discussed at a meeting a few months ago (Microarray Algorithms and Statistical Analysis: Methods and Standards; Tahoe City, California; 9-12 November 1999), experiments with cDNA arrays must be subjected to quality control. Variables as simple as temperature and illumination differences across a microarray slide can alter readings. Between slides, additional variables add to the difficulty of comparison.

The most important effect of chloride is that it inhibits the extent of vacancy creation at common operating temperatures of working three-way catalysts, thereby highlighting the unsuitability of chloride-based preparations for such materials. While some chloride can be removed under the low-temperature cycling conditions employed, the extent of the low-temperature cycling conditions employed, the extent of this removal is small, and a lower degree of reduction was attained by the chloride sample throughout the series of experiments.","","","Univ. di Trieste (IT)","","","United States","2000-01-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 189; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 25 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 326-338","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200012%%460","10.1006/jcat.1999.2712","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014532","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014532","","Journal of Catalysis","2","189"

It has been determined that about 4 {micro}atom of oxygen per m{sup 2} of ceria is required to fill the oxygen vacancies created by the reduction in agreement with the value deduced from the TPR profiles. The same value was also obtained from the H{sub 2}/O{sub 2} titration, which shows that oxygen is able to titrate the hydrogen which has spilled over the ceria surface via the metallic particles. Thus, the consistency of the three techniques demonstrates the validity of this method of measuring both the total ceria surface area and the ceria surface in contact with the precious metals. The application of this methodology to the case of Pt and Pt-Rh/CeO{sub 2}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} model three-way catalysts leads to a set of ceria surface areas deduced from O{sub 2} chemisorption and O{sub 2} titration much lower than those obtained by TPR. This behavior has been attributed to the presence of chlorine ions originating from the precursor and to the formation of stabilized Ce{sup 3+} ions at the CeO{sub 2}/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} interface during reduction. After an ageing treatment at 1273 K under N{sub 2} + 10% H{sub 2}O, an even greater difference was observed between the TPR ceria surface areas and those deduced from the chemisorption method. The results indicate an increased fraction of ceria without metal due to sintering and to the segregation between ceria and the metal particles.","","","CNRS/Univ.

Fuel/engine efficiency, energy use, pollutant discharges, and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated for spark and compression ignited, direct injected (DI), and indirect injected (II) engines fueled by conventional and reformulated gasoline, reformulated diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), and alcohols. Since comparisons of fuels and technologies in dissimilar vehicles are misleading, the authors hold emissions level, range, vehicle size class, and style constant. At present, CNG vehicles have the best exhaust emissions performance while DI diesels have the worst. Compared to a conventional gasoline fueled II automobile, greenhouse gases could be reduced by 40% by a DI CNG automobile and by 25% by a DI diesel. Gasoline- and diesel-fueled automobiles are able to attain long ranges with little weight or fuel economy penalty. CNG vehicles have the highest penalty for increasing range, due to their heavy fuel storage systems, but are the most attractive for a 160-km range.

During oxidation of adsorbed propylene, a stable intermediate was observed and characterized using these soft X-ray methods. A general in situ method for determining the stoichiometry of carbon-containing reaction intermediate species has been developed and demonstrated for the first time. Total carbon concentration measured during temperature-programmed reaction studies clearly indicates a reaction intermediate is formed in the 300 K temperature range with a surface concentration of 0.55 x 10{sup 15} carbon atoms/cm{sup 2}. By comparing the intensity of the C-H {sigma}* resonance at the magic angle with the intensity in the carbon continuum, the stoichiometry of this intermediate can be determined unambiguously. Based on calibration with molecular propylene (C{sub 3}H{sub 6}) and propylidyne (C{sub 3}H{sub 5}), the intermediate has a C{sub 3}H{sub 5} stoichiometry for oxygen pressures up to 0.02 Torr. A set of normal and glancing angle FYNES spectra above the carbon K edge was used to characterize the bonding and structure of this intermediate. Spectra of known coverages of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne served as standards. The spectra of di-{sigma} propylene, propylidyne, and the intermediate were curve fit as a group with consistent energies and widths of all primary features. Based on this procedure, the intermediate is 1,1,2-tri-{sigma} 1-methylvinyl. The stoichiometry and temperature stability range of the 1-methylvinyl intermediate formed in oxygen pressures up to 0.02 Torr is identical with the stoichiometry and stability of the same intermediate formed during oxidation of preadsorbed propylene by excess coadsorbed atomic oxygen.","","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-01-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 12 Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 143-149","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; JACSAT; TRN: IM200017%%66","10.1021/ja992865m","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017344","","Journal of the American Chemical Society","1","122"

This model estimates the leakage mass flow, temperature rise, and angular momentum increase through the cavity, given geometry parameters and the flow conditions at the interface between the cavity and primary flow path. This cavity model consists of two components, one that estimates the flow characteristics through the labyrinth seals and the other that predicts the transfer of momentum due to windage. A description of the one-dimensional model is given. The incorporation and use of the one-dimensional model in a multistage compressor primary flow analysis tool is described. The combination of this model and the primary flow solver was used to reliably simulate the significant impact on performance of the increase of hub seal leakage in a twelve-stage axial-flow compressor. Observed higher temperatures of the hub region fluid, different stage matching, and lower overall efficiencies and core flow than expected could be correctly linked to increased hub seal clearance with this new technique. The importance of including these leakage flows in compressor simulations is shown.","","","Rolls-Royce Allison, Indianapolis, IN (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 55-61","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%57","10.1115/1.555427","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086913","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086913","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"

The first is an experimental and computational study, designed to produce detailed three-dimensional test cases for aeroelastic applications and examine the ability of a three-dimensional time-marching Euler method to predict the relevant unsteady aerodynamics. Extensive blade surface unsteady pressure measurements were obtained over a range of reduced frequency from a test facility with clearly defined boundary conditions. The test data indicate a significant three-dimensional effect, whereby the amplitude of the unsteady pressure response at different spanwise locations is largely insensitive to the local bending amplitude. The computational results, which are the first to be supported by detailed three-dimensional test data, demonstrate the ability of the inviscid method to capture the three-dimensional behavior exhibited by the experimental measurements and a good level of quantitative agreement is achieved throughout the range of reduced frequency. Additional computational solutions, obtained through application of the strip methodology, reveal inadequacies in the conventional quasi-three-dimensional approach to the prediction of oscillating blade flows. The issue of linearity is also considered, and both experimental and computational results indicate a linear behavior o the unsteady aerodynamics. The second, an experimental investigation, addresses the influence of tip leakage upon the unsteady aerodynamic response of an oscillating turbine blade. Results are provided for three settings of tip clearance.","","","Univ. of Durham (GB)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 43rd International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 93-101","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%88","10.1115/1.555432","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086944","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086944","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"
"An infrared technique for evaluating turbine airfoil cooling designs","Sweeney, P C; Rhodes, J F","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; TURBINE BLADES; FILM COOLING; PERFORMANCE TESTING; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY","An experimental approach is used to evaluate turbine airfoil cooling designs for advanced gas turbine engine applications by incorporating double-wall film-cooled design features into large-scale flat plate specimens. An infrared (IR) imaging system is used to make detailed, two-dimensional steady-state measurements of flat plate surface temperature with spatial resolution on the order of 0.4 mm. The technique employs a cooled zinc selenide window transparent to infrared radiation and calibrates the IR temperature readings to reference thermocouples embedded in each specimen, yielding a surface temperature measurement accuracy of {+-} 4 C. With minimal thermocouple installation required, the flat plate/IR approach is cost effective, essentially nonintrusive, and produces abundant results quickly. Design concepts can proceed from art to part to data in a manner consistent with aggressive development schedules. The infrared technique is demonstrated here by considering the effect of film hole injection angle for a staggered array of film cooling holes integrated with a highly effective internal cooling pattern. Heated free stream air and room temperature cooling air are used to produce a nominal temperature ratio of 2 over a range of blowing ratios from 0.7 to 1.5.

"Stall inception in the compressor system of a turbofan engine","Hoess, B; Leinhos, D; Fottner, L","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; TURBOFAN ENGINES; GAS COMPRESSORS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; INSTABILITY; GAS FLOW; AERODYNAMICS","Compressor flow instabilities have been the subject of a great number of investigations during the past decade. While most of this research work was done on isolated test-rig compressors, this paper presents stall inception measurements in the compressor system of a two-spool turbofan engine at various power settings. Several analyzing techniques such as temporal low-pass and band-pass filtering, temporal and spatial Fourier transforms including power-spectral-density calculations of the spatial coefficients, and a wavelet analyzing technique are applied. For the low-pressure compressor three different types of stall inception processes were observed depending on the rotor speed. At low speed, stall originates from spike-type precursors, while long wavy pressure fluctuations corresponding to modal waves were observed prior to stall at midspeed for undistorted inlet flow. At high speed, the rotor shaft unbalancing dominates the stall inception process as an external forcing function. In the case of distorted inlet flow spike-type stall inception behavior dominates throughout the speed range. While filtering and the Fourier spectra give a good insight into the physical background of the stall inception process (but with a very short warning time), the wavelet transform indicates the approach of the stalling process a few hundred rotor revolutions in advance independently of the type of precursor. Setting up a reliable stall avoidance control based on this analysis scheme seems to be promising.","","","Univ. der Bundeswehr Muenchen (DE)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 43rd International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 32-44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200019%%49","10.1115/1.555425","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020624","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020624","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"

"Vaporization cooling for gas turbines, the return-flow cascade","Kerrebrock, J L; Stickler, D B","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES; EVAPORATIVE COOLING; TURBINE BLADES; COOLANTS; TWO-PHASE FLOW; DESIGN","A new paradigm for gas turbine design is treated, in which major elements of the hot section flow path are cooled by vaporization of a suitable two-phase coolant. This enables the blades to be maintained at nearly uniform temperature without detailed knowledge of the heat flux to the blades, and makes operation feasible at higher combustion temperatures using a wider range of materials than is possible in conventional gas turbines with air cooling. The new enabling technology for such cooling is the return-flow cascade, which extends to the rotating blades the heat flux capability and self-regulation usually associated with heat-pipe technology. In this paper the potential characteristics of gas turbines that use vaporization cooling are outlined briefly, but the principal emphasis is on the concept of the return-flow cascade. The concept is described and its characteristics are outlined. Experimental results are presented that confirm its conceptual validity and demonstrate its capability for blade cooling at heat fluxes representative of those required for high pressure ratio high temperature gas turbines.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%261","10.1115/1.483188","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015442","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015442","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Also illustrated is the technique developed for simultaneous optimization of several process variables such as cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, rake angle, and tool nose radius to control the residual stresses and dimensional instability within the acceptable tolerance band of the component. Prediction equations were developed for residual stress, dimensional instability, tool life, surface finish, and material removal rate. Predicted data were validated experimentally.

Nondestructive video edge view microscopy and destructive sectioning techniques were used to study the microscopic damage mechanisms that evolved. The elastic stiffness was monitored and recorded throughout the fatigue life of the coupon. In addition, residual compressive strength tests were conducted on fatigue coupons with various degrees of damage as quantified by stiffness reduction. Experimental results indicated that the monotonic tensile properties were only minimally influenced by temperature, while the monotonic compressive and fully reversed fatigue properties displayed greater reductions due to the elevated temperature. The stiffness degradation as a function of cycles, consisted of three stages; a short-lived high degradation period, a constant degradation rate segment covering the majority of the life, and a final stage demonstrating an increasing rate of degradation up to failure. Concerning the residual compressive strength tests at room and elevated temperatures, the elevated temperature coupons appeared much more sensitive to damage. At elevated temperatures, coupons experienced a much larger loss in compressive strength when compared to room temperature coupons with equivalent damage. The fatigue damage accumulation law proposed for the model incorporates a scalar representation for damage, but admits a multiaxial, anisotropic evolutionary law. The model predicts the current damage (as quantified by residual stiffness) and remnant life of a composite that has undergone a known load at temperature. The damage/life model is dependent on the applied multiaxial stress state as well as temperature. Comparisons between the model and data showed good predictive capabilities concerning stiffness degradation and cycles to failure.","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 62-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%264","10.1115/1.483176","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015445","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

A piston design that incorporates the heat-pipe cooling technology may provide a new approach that could improve the thermal-tribological performance of heavy-duty diesel engine pistons. A simplified piston crown with an annular reciprocating heat pipe is constructed to demonstrate this concept. The piston crown is experimentally tested on a specially designed reciprocating apparatus. Experimental data indicate that the annular heat-pipe cooling can greatly assist in reducing the temperature gradient and peak temperature along the ring bank. In order to predict the performance in a more realistic piston working condition, a three-dimensional finite element modeling is used to analyze the thermal performance of this annular heat-pipe cooled crown (AHPCC). The heat-transfer coefficient under the reciprocal environment of the experimental apparatus and the effective thermal conductance of the heat pipe are determined by correlating the numerical calculations with the experimental measurements. The results indicate that the heat-pipe-cooling concept presented in this paper can provide an effective means for piston temperature control under real piston operating conditions.","","","Northwestern Univ., Evanston, IL (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 99-105","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%271","10.1115/1.483181","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015452","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015452","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

A mixed lubrication model with consideration of shear-thinning effects of multigrade oils was used to describe the lubrication between the running surfaces of the two lands and the liner. Oil squeezing and asperity contact were both considered for the interaction between the flanks of the TLOCR and the ring groove. Then, the moments and axial forces from TLOCR/liner lubrication and TLOCR/groove interaction were coupled into the dynamic equations of the TLOCR. Furthermore, effects of piston dynamic tilt were considered in a quasi three-dimensional manner so that the behaviors of the TLOCR at different circumferential location could be studied. As a first step, variation of the third land pressure was neglected. The model predictions were illustrated via an SI engine. One important finding is that around thrust and anti-thrust sides, the difference between the minimum oil film thickness of two lands can be as high as several micrometers due to piston dynamic tilt. As a result, at thrust and anti-thrust sides, significant oil can pass under one land of the TLOCR along the bore, although the other land perfectly seals the bore. Then, the capabilities of the model were further explained by studying the effects of ring tension and torsional resistance on the lubrication and oil transport between the lands and the liner. The effects of oil film thickness on the flanks of the ring groove on the dynamics of the TLOCR were also studied. Friction results show that boundary lubrication contributes significantly to the total friction of the TLOCR.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 119-124","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%274","10.1115/1.483183","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015455","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015455","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

The emissions reduction is especially important at light engine loads. In this paper results are presented for a GM V8 engine. Natural gas, pure hydrogen and different blends of these two fuels have been tested. The fuel supply system used provides natural gas/hydrogen mixtures in variable proportion, regulated independently of the engine operating condition. The influence of the fuel composition on the engine operating characteristics and exhaust emissions has been examined, mainly but not exclusively for 10 and 20% hydrogen addition. At least 10% hydrogen addition is necessary for a significant improvement in efficiency. Due to the conflicting requirements for low hydrocarbons and low NO{sub x} determining the optimum hythane composition is not straight-forward. For hythane mixtures with a high hydrogen fraction, it is found that a hydrogen content of 80% or less guarantees safe engine operation (no backfire nor knock), whatever the air excess factor. It is shown that to obtain maximum engine efficiency for the whole load range while taking low exhaust emissions into account, the mixture composition should be varied with respect to engine load.","","","Univ. of Gent (BE)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 135-140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%276","10.1115/1.483191","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015457","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015457","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Prior to injection of the natural gas, a quantity of diesel fuel is injected into the cylinder (from the same injector) to provide for gas ignition. Tests have been conducted at medium load and speed over a wide range of injection timing, and with both conventional diesel and gas/diesel operation. With natural gas fueling, significant reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions have been measured without significant loss in efficiency, relative to conventional diesel operation. Using measurements of cylinder pressure development, a new method of combustion analysis has been used to estimate mass burning rate, burned gas temperature, and rate of nitrogen oxide (NO) generation. The method uses a nonlinear regression technique to determine the distribution with crank angle of the cylinder heat loss rate. The method assumes that NO formation takes place within one turbulent mixing time following combustion of each fuel-air increment. Comparison of measured and calculated NO concentration in the exhaust over the whole range of injection timing shows that for both conventional diesel and gas/diesel operation the effective turbulent mixing period is equivalent to 4 degrees of crank angle at 1,250 RPM. The results demonstrate that a mass burned method can be used to infer cylinder temperature distributions and NO formation rate as well as the progress of combustion.","","","Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia (CA)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 141-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%277","10.1115/1.483185","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015458","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Under conventional weld solidification conditions, epitaxial nucleation occurs off grains in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and solidification proceeds along preferred growth directions. In some aluminum alloys, such as those containing Li and Zr, a nondendritic equiaxed grain zone (EQZ) has been observed along the fusion boundary that does not nucleate epitaxially from the HAZ substrate. The EQZ has been the subject of considerable study because of its susceptibility to cracking during initial fabrication and repair. The motivation of this investigation was to develop a technique that would allow the nature and evolution of the fusion boundary to be studied under controlled thermal conditions. A melting technique was developed to simulate the fusion boundary of aluminum alloys using the Gleeble{reg{underscore}sign} thermal simulator. Using a steel sleeve to contain the aluminum, samples wee heated to incremental temperatures above the solidus temperature of a number of alloys. In Alloy 2195, a 4Cu-1Li alloy, an EQZ could be formed by heating in the temperature range approximately from 630--640 C. At temperatures above 640 C, solidification occurred by the normal epitaxial nucleation and growth mechanism. Fusion boundary behavior was also studied in Alloys 5454-H34, 6061-T6 and 2219-T8. Nucleation in these alloys was observed to be epitaxial. Details of the technique and its effectiveness for performing controlled melting experiments at incremental temperatures above the solidus are described.","","","Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal (Miami); Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1s-8s","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-2296; WEJUA3; TRN: IM200012%%237","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014309","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014309","","Welding Journal (Miami)","1","79"
"Effect of intermediate annealing on texture evolution and plastic anisotropy in an Al-Mg autobody alloy","Li, S; Kang, S B; Ko, H S","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; ALUMINIUM ALLOYS; MAGNESIUM ALLOYS; TEXTURE; ANNEALING; AUTOMOBILES; PLASTICITY; ANISOTROPY; MICROSTRUCTURE","The effect of intermediate annealing (IA) on texture evolution and plastic anisotropy of an Al-Mg autobody sheet was investigated. The formation of annealing textures after two finds of final heat treatments was discussed with the aid of microstructural characterization. The results showed that the IA treatment had obvious influences on the final annealing texture as well as the resulting plastic anisotropy. It led to relatively lower recrystallization extent and stronger retained rolling orientations in the sheets after final heat treatment. The final annealing textures were very weak due to the dominant influence of particle stimulated nucleation. The other orientations occurring can either be attributed to genuine recrystallization or to recrystallization in situ. As a result of good suppression of the cube and rotated cube orientations, a good combination of normal anisotropy and planar anisotropy was achieved in the sample with IA and after O treatment.","","","Central South Univ. of Tech, Changsha (CN)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical and Materials Transactions.

"Deterministic stress modeling of hot gas segregation in a turbine","Busby, J; Sondak, D; Staubach, B; Davis, R","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; GAS TURBINES; GAS FLOW; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; THERMAL STRESSES; UNSTEADY FLOW; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION","Simulation of unsteady viscous turbomachinery flowfields is presently impractical as a design tool due to the long run times required. Designers rely predominantly on steady-state simulations, but these simulations do not account for some of the important unsteady flow physics. Unsteady flow effects can be modeled as source terms in the steady flow equations. These source terms, referred to as Lumped Deterministic Stresses (LDS), can be used to drive steady flow solution procedures to reproduce the time-average of an unsteady flow solution. The goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using inviscid lumped deterministic stresses to model unsteady combustion hot streak migration effects on the turbine blade tip and outer air seal heat loads. The LDS model is obtained from an unsteady inviscid calculation. The inviscid LDS model is then used with a steady viscous computation to simulate the time-averaged viscous solution. The feasibility of the inviscid LDS model is demonstrated on a single-stage, three-dimensional, vane-blade turbine with a hot streak entering the vane passage at midpitch and midspan. The steady viscous solution with the LDS model is compared to the time-averaged viscous, steady viscous, and time-averaged inviscid computations. The LDS model reproduces the time-averaged viscous temperature distribution on the outer air seal to within 2.3%, while the steady viscous has an error of 8.4%, and the time-averaged inviscid calculation has an error of 17.2%. The solution using the LDS model is obtained at a cost in CPU time that is 26% of that required for a time-averaged viscous computation.","","","United Technologies Research Center, East Hartford, CT (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 62-67","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200019%%50","10.1115/1.555428","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020625","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020625","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"

They offer the advantages of simple structure, fault tolerance, and mechanical robustness, leading to attractiveness for industrial and electrical vehicle (EV) applications. In this paper, a nonlinear varying-network magnetic circuit (VNMC) modeling method is developed for doubly salient permanent-magnet (DSPM) motors. The method is used to analyze the static characteristics of DSPM motors by specific permeance calculations, in which the interaction between the permanent-magnet field and the armature current field, as well as magnetic saturation, are taken into account. Two newly proposed DSPM motors (12/8-pole and 6/4-pole) are used as examples. There is good agreement between the results of the nonlinear VNMC modeling method and finite-element analysis. Moreover, the nonlinear VNMC method offers the advantage of calculating, effectively and efficiently, the static characteristics of DSPM motors having different dimensions, parameters, and conditions. Finally, the proposed method is verified by experimental testing of a 6/4-pole prototype.","","","Univ. of Hong Kong (HK)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1Pt2; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 339-348","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9464; IEMGAQ; TRN: IM200019%%278","10.1109/20.822544","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020853","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020853","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","1Pt2","36"

In this study, experiments were performed in a 2.67-mm-inside-diameter stainless steel tube with a heated length of 0.610 m for the purpose of investigating the characteristics of supercritical heat transfer with endothermic fuel reforming. Thermocouples were positioned along the tube both in the fluid stream and on the heated wall for local heat transfer measurements. Both heat transfer coefficients and endotherms were calculated from the measured results. State-of-the-art correlations for heat transfer were evaluated, and a correlation for supercritical heat transfer to hydrocarbon fuel has been developed. The results provide a basis for supercritical fuel heat-exchanger/reactor design and its practical applications, in an area that has received relatively little attention in the engineering literature, viz., supercritical forced convection heat transfer with endothermic chemical reaction.","","","Argonne National Lab.
