It was suggested that the reaction consists of sequential processes of methanol {r_arrow} formaldehyde (methyl){r_arrow}methyl formate {r_arrow} acetic acid (methyl acetate). While the Ru(II) complexes capable of catalyzing the dehydrogenation of methanol into methyl formate are known, this catalyst system is unique because of its extra ability to isomerize methyl formate to acetic acid without a CO atmosphere (usually high pressure) or an iodide promoter (often corrosive to reaction apparatus). In this communication, the authors examine the cyclopentadienyl bis(triphenylphosphine) ruthenium(II) auxilliary in view of its well defined geometry and configurational stability, and demonstrate that combination with the SnF{sub 3} ligand gives quite high catalytic ability compared to the conventional SnCl{sub 3} ligand. 12 refs., 1 fig.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Coordination Chemistry; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1-3; Other Information: PBD: 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 117-119","","","","Journal ID: JCCMBQ; ISSN 0095-8972; TRN: 96:003634-0001","10.1080/00958979408024241","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","274103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/274103","","Journal of Coordination Chemistry","1-3","32"

The effect of these residues on benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) metabolism in human mammary epithelial cells was studied. Cells were preincubated with hexane-extractable coal tar material for 16 hr, then incubated with {sup 3}H-BaP for 2 hr and the amount of BaP metabolites in cell extracts was determined by HPLC. An up to 5-fold increase over control in BaP metabolites was seen after preincubation with 0.2 {mu}g/ml coal tar material (a oncytotoxic dose). Coal tar extracts were equally effective as pure BaP in inducing BaP metabolism. As BaP constitutes less than 1% of the coal tar, other components in the coal tar mixtures appear to be even more potent than BaP in inducing the enzyme system responsible for BaP metabolism. The increase in BaP metabolites was accompanied by a proportional increase in P4501A1 mRNA as measured by Northern blotting, and resulted in an increase of BaP adducts to DNA. These results show that coal tars and other P450-inducting compounds can act as cocarcinogens by enhancing the genotoxic effects of compounds metabolized by the P4501A1 enzyme.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: Suppl.23; Conference: 25. annual meeting of the Environmental Mutagen Society, Portland, OR (United States), 7-12 May 1994; Other Information: PBD: 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 22","","CONF-9405324-","","Journal ID: EMMUEG; ISSN 0893-6692; TRN: 95:004220-0017","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","88813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/88813","","Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis","Suppl.23","23"

"Hydrogen exchange with adsorbed methanol and methoxy on nickel/alumina","Flesner, R L; Falconer, J L","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ALUMINIUM OXIDES; SORPTIVE PROPERTIES; HYDROGEN; SORPTION; METHANOL; METHOXY RADICALS; NICKEL; CARBON MONOXIDE; ISOTOPIC EXCHANGE; CATALYSTS; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE","Hydrogen isotope exchange with adsorbed CH{sub 3}OH and coadsorbed CO + H{sub 2} (which form CH{sub 3}O) was studied on a Ni/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst by temperature-programmed reaction and desorption (TPR, TPD). Since both CH{sub 3}OH and CH{sub 3}O are adsorbed on the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} support, but H{sub 2} adsorbs and dissociates on the Ni surface, H atom spillover onto the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} surface is an important step in the exchange process. Hydroxyl hydrogens in CH{sub 3}OH exchange orders of magnitude more rapidly than methyl hydrogens, and both types of exchange are faster than CH{sub 3}OH hydrogenation to CH{sub 4}. Thus, TPR, allows these processes to be separated in time, and exchange during TPR also allows different adsorbed species to be distinguished. Coadsorbed CO + H{sub 2} exhibit two exchange processes, one of which is different from those observed for adsorbed CH{sub 3}OH. These differences demonstrate that CH{sub 3}OH and CO + H{sub 2} do not form identical species on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Coadsorption of CO + H{sub 2} forms H on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} in addition to CH{sub 3}O, and this H results in an H{sub 2} TPD peak in addition to H{sub 2} that forms from CH{sub 3}O decomposition. Exchange is inhibited significantly by CO adsorbed on Ni, apparently because CO blocks H{sub 2} adsorption sites. 15 refs., 12 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 301-310","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS 90-21194; TRN: 95:000935-0009","10.1006/jcat.1994.1348","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","47975","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/47975","","Journal of Catalysis","2","150"

Modification with cinchonidine or quinine yields R-lactate in excess, whereas modification with cinchonine or quinidine favors S-lactate formation. Ir/SiO{sub 2} catalysts (20%) calcined at 393 to 573 K and reduced at 523 to 593 K were highly active for racemic hydrogenation in the absence of a modifier (rates typically 1.8 mol h{sup -1} g{sub cat}{sup -1}) and were comparably active when modified with cinchonidine but gave an enantiomeric excess of about 30%. Use of higher calcination or reduction temperatures led to substantially inferior activity and selectivity. The high rates recorded for both racemic and enantioselective reactions are dependent on the catalysts being activated before use by a procedure involving exposure of the catalyst to air after the initial reduction. Use of a Cl-free precursor gave an Ir/SiO{sub 2} catalyst (20%) of superior activity but inferior enantioselectivity. Ir/CaCO{sub 3} (5%) was more active for racemic hydrogenation than for enantioselective hydrogenation, but provided the highest value of the enantiomeric excess 39%. Kinematics of reaction are reported. Exchange of H for D in 10,11-dihydrocinchonidine at room temperature over Ir/CaCO{sub 3} occurred in the quinoline moiety but not in the quinuclidine ring system, indicating that the alkaloid was adsorbed to the Ir surface via the interaction of its {pi}-electron system. For both silica-supported and calcium carbonate-supported Ir, the presence of chloride ion in the catalyst was advantageous for the achievement of enantioselectivity. 25 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 321-328","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000935-0011","10.1006/jcat.1994.1350","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","47977","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/47977","","Journal of Catalysis","2","150"

The Ru dispersion of these catalysts was determined by TEM, and the fraction of the Ru surface available for H{sub 2} adsorption was determined by {sup 1}H NMR. Even after low-temperature reduction, the surface of titania-containing catalysts is covered by titania to a substantial degree. The specific activity and selectivity of these catalysts are dominated by the interactions occurring between the Ru particles and the titania overlayer. As the fraction of the Ru particle surface covered by titania increases, the turnover frequency for CO consumption passes through a maximum, while that for methane formation decreases monotonically. The probability for chain growth and the olefin-to-paraffin ratio of the products increase with increasing titania coverage. These trends are attributed to the effects of the titania overlayer on the catalytic properties of Ru. 31 refs., 6 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 400-406","","","AC03-76SF00098; W-7405-ENG-82","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000935-0018","10.1006/jcat.1994.1358","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","47984","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/47984","","Journal of Catalysis","2","150"

The in situ Raman spectroscopy studies show that under dehydrated conditions the molecular structure of the silica-supported molybdenum oxide surface species is independent of the preparation methods used in the present study. The surface molybdenum oxide species is assigned to an isolated, highly distorted octahedral mono-oxo Mo structure. The appearance of new structures in some samples is due to the presence of calcium impurities in the silica supports which result in the formation of calcium molybdate. Neither the preparation method nor the specific silica used affected the methanol oxidation activity of the MoO{sub 3}/SiO{sub 2} catalysts. The surface molybdenum oxide coverage on silica is the only relevant factor that determines the catalytic properties during methanol oxidation. In situ Raman spectroscopy during methanol oxidation shows aggregation of surface molybdenum oxide species to crystalline beta-MoO{sub 3}. The extent of aggregation increases with the surface molybdenum coverage, even at very low coverages, and accounts for the decrease in the methanol oxidation catalytic activity with increasing surface molybdenum coverage. 56 refs., 12 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 407-420","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9006258; TRN: 95:000935-0019","10.1006/jcat.1994.1359","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","47985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/47985","","Journal of Catalysis","2","150"

The results have been interpreted in the light of transition state theory and cage effects. Conversions obtained are low compared to the liquid phase oxidation because of dilute concentrations of the reactants. Cyclohexanone is more selectively formed and favored by both pressure and temperature.

In the continuous flow mode, the dominant reaction was the homogeneous coupling of CH[sub 3] radicals to form C[sub 2]H[sub 6]; however, significant amounts of HCHO and CH[sub 3]OH were also observed. Over MoO[sub 3] at 300-[degree]C, CH[sub 3]OH was the principal oxygenate, but at 500[degree]C the CH[sub 3]OH was converted mainly to HCHO. At both temperatures, HCHO was the favored product over MoO[sub 3]/SiO[sub 2]. The addition of H[sub 2]O to the reactants enhanced the formation of CH[sub 3]OH at 300[degree]C.

This oxide can be prepared by three different routes: burning magnesium ribbon in air, thermal decomposition of magnesium hydroxide, and thermal decomposition of magnesium basic carbonate.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 25-29","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2703; CODEN: CHTEDD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6628441","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6628441","","CHEMTECH; (United States)","","24:11"

It was found that this modification enhanced the strength of both Bronsted acid sites (terminal or bridging ZrOH groups) and Lewis acid sites (low-coordinate Zr ions). However, Bronsted acid sites with enhanced strength appeared to be weaker than bridging OH groups in zeolites. Modification also created protons with a new environment. These protons were assumed to form multicenter bonds with oxygen atoms of SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} anions or with neighboring basic oxygen and to possess acidic properties, comparable to those of protons in zeolites. Low-temperature ethylene and cyclopropane oligomerization and H-D exchange were shown to proceed on sulfated zirconia, presumably with participation of such sites. 25 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 143-149","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000744-0012","10.1006/jcat.1994.1330","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28676","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28676","","Journal of Catalysis","1","150"

Infrared spectra taken during both isothermal and temperature-programmed experiments reveal the following species: methanol, methoxy groups, formaldehyde, methylenebis(oxy) groups, and formate groups. The only products observed during temperature-programmed decomposition are formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon dioxide is 0.5 indicating that both products are formed by the decomposition of formate groups on the surface of copper. A mechanism for methanol decomposition is proposed, based on the sequence of species observed during temperature-programmed infrared (TPD-IR) experiments. Simulations of the TPD-IR experiments based on the proposed scheme provide an accurate representation of the observed variations in the concentrations of adsorbed species. 41 refs., 18 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 81-93","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000744-0006","10.1006/jcat.1994.1324","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28670","","Journal of Catalysis","1","150"

The sole hydrocarbon product produced from pulses of propane over a freshly reduced Pt/alumina catalyst at 873 K in the absence of sulphur was methane, with concomitant carbon laydown. The effect on activity and selectivity of predosing the catalyst with hydrogen sulphide at 293 and 873 K was examined, as was the effect of cofeeding at ratios of 1:10 and 10:1 H{sub 2}S:C{sub 3}H{sub 8}. Predosing at 873 K had the largest effect on selectivity, allowing the formation of propene from the first pulse of propane, whereas cofeeding required the build-up of sulphur on the surface before selectivity was achieved. Adding sulphur into the catalyst preparation was more effective than subsequent addition from the gas phase. The results also indicated that the selectivity observed was not directly related to the amount of sulphur on the surface. The presence of a hydrogen reservoir on the catalyst, which was available for reaction, was detected using catalysts reduced in deuterium. The results also indicated that hydrogen from adsorbed hydrogen sulphide could react with hydrocarbon fragments on the catalyst surface to produce methane. 31 refs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 170-176","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000744-0014","10.1006/jcat.1994.1333","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28678","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28678","","Journal of Catalysis","1","150"

The oxygen exchange between gas-phase {sup 18}O{sub 2} and surface oxygen {sup 16}O{sub s} was investigated in the temperature range from 539 to 1035 K. The oxygen-exchange activity decreased from Sm{sub 2}O{sub 3} (E{sub a} = 81 kJ/mol) via Sm{sub 2}O{sub 3}/MgO (E{sub a} = 96 kJ/mol) to MgO (E{sub a} = 261 kJ/mol). The presence of methane did not influence the exchange rate of {sup 18}O{sub 2} with the surface. This indicates (a) that oxygen activation on the surface is faster than activation of methane and (b) that neither gas-phase oxygen nor nondissociated surface oxygen is involved in the reaction with methane under the reaction conditions applied. It was shown that the surface reaction of methane with oxygen intermediates formed from gas-phase O{sub 2} is faster than the desorption of any diatomic oxygen species. Over Sm{sub 2}O{sub 3}, the degree of oxidative conversion of methane and the resulting product distribution are determined by the amount of surface-oxygen species formed by dissociation of gaseous O{sub 2} on the catalyst surface. It is suggested that these active oxygen sites consist of highly reactive short-lived species (below 200 ms) and also species having longer lifetimes. 16 refs., 11 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 71-80","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Contract JOUF-0044-C; TRN: 95:000744-0005","10.1006/jcat.1994.1323","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28669","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28669","","Journal of Catalysis","1","150"

Catalytic studies reveal that product selectivity is governed by intermetallic ratios and method of preparation. Perturbation in metallic charge distribution and morphological changes in metal crystallites could influence both catalytic and magnetic behavior of the catalyst. To examine the correlations between catalytic and magnetic properties, the authors investigated the Zero-field NMR and Magnetization character of a series of supported and unsupported Cu-Co catalysts in the range 0.2 < Cu/Co < 8.0. Significant shifts of NMR lines of cobalt occur in samples for Cu/Co > 1, indicating strong interactions between Cu and Co. Chromia serves as a neutral support inhibiting inter-metallic interactions, while titania supported catalysts exhibit strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). Cu-Co-Cr[sub 2]O[sub 3] catalysts show three distinct regions of magnetization character similar to the three regions of selectivity.

Activity-based rate and phase equilibrium expressions provide an accurate and thermodynamically consistent description of composition changes in nonideal, reacting vapor-liquid mixtures. For certain strategies of operation, which dictate the rate of product removal, the model equations are nonautonomous, leading to unusual dynamic behavior. However, for a certain special product removal policy, the effects of kinetics can be described by a single parameter, the Damkoehler number, which measures the rate of reaction relative to product removal. For small values of the Damkoehler number, the nonreactive simple distillation residue curve map is recovered and the singular points are the pure components and azeotropes in the nonreactive mixture. A bifurcation analysis shows the deformation and, in some cases, the disappearance of these singular points as the Damkoehler number is increased until the equilibrium reactive residue curve map is recovered at large values. A model problem for the reactive distillation of methyl tert-butyl ether from isobutene and methanol is solved.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 40:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1814-1824","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690401106","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7051467","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7051467","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","40:11"

Under anoxic conditions, nitrate may serve as a terminal electron acceptor with reduction to elemental nitrogen. T. denitrificans has previously been shown to remove hydrogen sulfide from sour gases under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations were reduced from 10,000 ppmv to undetectable levels with 1-2 s of gas-liquid contact time in bench-scale fermentors. The oxidation product, sulfate, accumulated in the liquid phase of the culture medium. Flocculated T. denitrificans has now been used to remove hydrogen sulfide (up to 1500 ppmv) from a sour gas in a 0.5-m{sup 3} pilot-scale bubble column. The bubble column was operated for 7 weeks under aerobic conditions, with gas feeds of air and hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen. Up to 97% removal of hydrogen sulfide was observed with complete oxidation to sulfate, which accumulated in the reactor medium. Limitations in H{sub 2}S removal were due to mass transfer and not the microbiology of the system. More complete H{sub 2}S removal can be accomplished by increasing gas-liquid contact in a single reactor or using two bubble columns in series. 10 refs., 5 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biotechnology Progress; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 611-614","","","","Journal ID: BIPRET; ISSN 8756-7938; TRN: 98:001534-0001","10.1021/bp00030a005","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","598197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/598197","","Biotechnology Progress","6","10"

The levels of total covalent binding to microsomal phospholipid due to {sup 14}CHCl{sub 3} reactive intermediates in ethanol-pretreated microsomes were identical to those measured in microsomes from untreated rats at any pO{sub 2}. The distribution of radioactivity obtained after transmethylation of the adducts of {sup 14}CHCl{sub 3} intermediates with microsomal phospholipids (PL) indicated that binding to fatty acyl chains (due to {center_dot}CHCl{sub 2} radicals) increased with decreased pO{sub 2}.

The reflectance spectra of the catalysts showed that Mo{sup 6+} ions with O{sub h} and T{sub d} symmetries coexisted, but that the relative proportion depended on the MoO{sub 3} loading.

These transport restrictions decrease both H{sub 2} and CO concentrations near catalytic sites and lead to significant changes in product selectivity. Time-on-stream experiments show that after an experiment is started methane and paraffin/olefin ratios increase rapidly while CO conversion and C{sub 5} + selectivity decrease on diffusion-limited pellets until steady state is reached. These changes are not observed on pellets free from transport limitations. The authors results indicate that CO concentrations decrease continuously and to a greater extent than H{sub 2} concentrations from the exterior to the center of a large liquid-filled pellets. Extreme intrapellet diffusion restrictions totally deplete CO near the pellet center and restore the hydrogenolysis activity of Ru which is otherwise strongly inhibited by CO during FT synthesis. In the absence of CO, large hydrocarbons that are removed slowly from liquid-filled catalyst pores undergo extensive hydrogenolysis on Ru sites close to or at the center of the pellets, leading to lower wax yields and to higher methane and light paraffin selectivity. 25 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 428-437","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005619-0015","10.1006/jcat.1994.1309","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","98935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/98935","","Journal of Catalysis","2","149"

The feed contained an equal number of {sup 13}C and {sup 12}C atoms. The products were analyzed by GC-MS, allowing the determination of the isotopic composition of the reactor effluent. The ethanol was immediately converted to ethene, so the reaction system was equivalent to a feed consisting of methanol/ethene/water. While the methanol was completely or almost completely converted to hydrocarbons, the larger part of the ethene emerged unreacted. The products propene and butenes were mostly formed from methanol and contained a large excess of {sup 13}C atoms. The ethene effluent consisted mainly of all {sup 12}C or all {sup 13}C atoms, and only to a small extent of {sup 12}C-{sup 13}C molecules. The reaction system was followed from an initially very active catalyst until the catalyst was sufficiently deactivated that C{sub 1} was not completely converted to hydrocarbons. The tendency for ethene to emerge unreacted, and for all new hydrocarbons to be formed from methanol became more pronounced with progressing catalyst deactivation. The results show clearly that the higher hydrocarbons are, over this catalyst, not formed by successive methylations of ethene. A previously proposed {open_quotes}carbon pool{close_quotes} mechanism can explain the gross effects seen in the product and isotopic distribution. 15 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 458-464","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005619-0017","10.1006/jcat.1994.1312","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","98937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/98937","","Journal of Catalysis","2","149"
"Catalytic intermolecular hydrogen transfer in the hydrogenation of heterocyclic aldehydes and ketones. A review","Yuskovets, Zh; Shimanska, M","40 CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; ALDEHYDES; HYDROGENATION; KETONES; CATALYSIS; REVIEWS","Catalytic hydrogen transfer holds a special position among the well known and commonly used methods for the catalytic hydrogenation of organic compounds in light of its several advantages relative to methods of homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen. Advantages of the method of transferring hydrogen from a donor to an acceptor for the reduction of various functional groups and multipole bonds include the simplicity of the apparatus required, avoidance of the use of a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, often under pressure, mild conditions, high reduction selectivity, and ease of separating the products formed. The most important point is that this method permits us, in most cases, to increase the reduction selectivity of only one functional group in polyfunctional compounds by varying the combination of solvent, catalyst, and hydrogen donor. Furthermore, in several cases, reactions, which could not be carried out under the most vigorous conditions of catalytic hydrogenation with molecular hydrogen, may be achieved. Several reviews have appeared, in which the major types of catalysts and hydrogen donors used in heterogeneous and homogeneous reduction have been examined, temperature and solvent effects have been evaluated, and the major results on the reduction of unsaturated bonds and functional bonds have been summarized. 80 refs., 6 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1994; TN: Translated from Khimiya Geterotsiklicheskikh Soedinenii; No. 4, 435-449(Apr 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 381-392","","","","Journal ID: CHCCAL; ISSN 0069-3154; TRN: 96:002638-0001","10.1007/BF01169929","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","241169","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/241169","","Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds","4","30"

The cobalt oxide cation CoO[sup +] was generated from the reaction of Co[sup +] (produced by laser desorption) with N[sub 2]O, producing CoO[sup +]*, which was subsequently thermalized by collisions with argon buffer gas. The activation of methane by CoO[sup +] results in the very inefficient exothermic formation of CH[sub 3]OH. Ethane through pentane are much more reactive toward CoO[sup +] as compared to methane. Ethane reacts by eliminating water, ethylene, and ethanol. For propane and larger alkanes activation of the carbon backbone is also observed. The cobalt-butadiene cation is the major product ion from the reaction of n-butane and is generated as well from n-pentane and 2-methylbutane.

The aim of the work was to point out possible inconsistencies between the standard octane numbers of the fuels and their knock behavior in mass-produced engines. The fuels of the first group had R.O.N.s and M.O.N.s very close to the minimum values required by European Community regulations (95, and 85, respectively), whereas the fuels of the second group had higher R.O.N.s and M.O.N.s (about 100, and 87.5, respectively). One of the tested fuels in the first group was a typical European unleaded gasoline; the other gasolines had higher olefin or aromatic contents. An increase of the aromatic content has not shown appreciable differences between the expected knock behavior of the fuel from its standard octane numbers, and its performance on the mass-produced engine. On the contrary a higher olefin content has revealed a remarkable difference. The second group was made up of gasolines, obtained by mixing base fuels.

Eucalyptus and orange oils possess high octane values and are also good potential alternative fuels for SI engines. The high octane value of these fuels can enhance the octane value of the fuel when it is blended with low-octane gasoline. In the present work, 20 percent by volume of orange oil, eucalyptus oil, methanol and ethanol were blended separately with gasoline, and the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics were evaluated at two different compression ratios. The phase separation problems arising from the alcohol-gasoline blends were minimized by adding eucalyptus oil as a cosolvent. Test results indicate that the compression ratio can be raised from 7.4 to 9 without any detrimental effect, due to the higher octane rating of the fuel blends. Knock-limited maximum brake output also increases due to extension of the knock limit.

The rate of methane formation was measured at 1 atm and the state of the working catalyst was characterized by XPS immediately after reaction. With the exception of AlO{sub x}, each of the oxides was found to enhance the rate of CO methanation relative to that observed over unpromoted Rh. The maximum degree of rate enhancement occurs at an oxide coverage of approximately half a monolayer. AlO{sub x} retards the formation of methane in direct proportion to the oxide coverage. FeO{sub x} behaves in a manner identical to that of AlO{sub x} in the case of CO{sub 2} hydrogenation, whereas all of the other oxides studied produce a maximum degree of methanation rate enhancement at an oxide coverage of half a monolayer. The enhancement of CO and CO{sub 2} hydrogenation is attributed to the formation of Lewis acid-base complexes between the oxygen and of adsorbed CO (or H{sub 2}CO formed during the reaction) and anionic vacancies present at the edge of the oxide-metal boundary. The degree of enhancement of CO and CO{sub 2} hydrogenation is found to increase with the average oxidation state of the metal in the oxide overlayer. This trend is attributed to the direct relationship between Lewis acidity of an oxide and the oxidation state of the metal in the oxide. The degree of reduction of a given oxide is found to be higher during CO{sub 2} hydrogenation than CO hydrogenation. 95 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 149-158","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005337-0014","10.1006/jcat.1994.1280","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","113776","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/113776","","Journal of Catalysis","1","149"

Results demonstrate that the distribution coefficient and selectivity in systems with reduced water activity resulting from salt addition were markedly increased. These observations can be qualitatively explained on the basis of the hydration theory. It was also determined that strong electrolytes added to the aqueous feed reduced extractant solubility in the aqueous phase, thus contributing to lower solvent losses.

When this process is performed in a slurry bubble column reactor, fine catalyst particles are distributed in the liquid phase and these must be separated from the product before it can be further refined. Sedimentation is the most common and simple chemical engineering unit operation for separating suspended solids from liquids. It can be easily accomplished by holding the suspension in a settling tank for a period of time without incurring additional processing costs. However, sedimentation velocities are inversely proportional to particle size; if the solid particles are very small, the sedimentation velocity may be so low that the processing time is unacceptably long. This article deals with the effect of exposure to a magnetic field on the settling velocities of suspensions of iron particles in a hydrocarbon liquid.

It was found that a 0.5% K-promoted catalyst, a stoichiometric H[sub 2]/CO ratio (approximately 2), and a low (2%) CO[sub 2] concentration were favorable for isobutanol yield. In contrast, for the synthesis of methanol, a higher K loading, H[sub 2]/CO ratio, and CO[sub 2] concentration were found to be favorable. The results suggest that isobutanol synthesis requires a balanced level of oxidation (Cu/Cu[sup 1+]), as conformed by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while methanol synthesis requires a greater degree of oxidation (more Cu[sup 1+]). Contact time experiments showed the selectivity of aldehydes to pass through a maximum, suggesting the intermediacy of aldehydes in a classic aldol'' condensation mechanism.

Greater deactivation at higher temperatures resulted in lower final activities; nevertheless steady-state isobutanol yields increased significantly at higher temperatures.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 33:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2021-2028","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00033a001","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","6961107","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6961107","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","33:9"

In entering the lattice of the basic phase of vanadyl pyrophosphate, they act as electron donors, increasing the effective negative charge on the oxygen atom and facilitating cleavage of a proton from the paraffin molecule, which increases the oxidation rate. A simultaneous increase in the surface acidity due to diffusion of phosphorus causes an increase in selectivity. At the same time, perturbations of the structure of pyrophosphate on addition of the additives (determined by the concentration and radius of the added ion) decrease the selectivity of the process.

The rate constant for n-butanol dehydration on H-ZSM-5 (determined from in situ FTIR kinetic studies by monitoring the growth of the water deformation peak at 1640 cm{sup -1}) is shown to be the true dehydration rate constant (1.7 x 10{sup -4}s{sup -1} at 100{degrees}C). On the other hand, the rate constants determined from GC steady-state kinetic studies (temperature interval 105-185{degrees}C) are effective ones, giving activation energies of 22{+-}2 kcal/mol and 33{+-}2 kcal/mol for complete dehydration and dehydration to butene only, respectively. By studying the dehydration reaction under different conditions (flow and static reactors, steady-state and non-steady-state regimes) and on samples with rather similar acid strengths but different porous systems (H-ZSM-5-microporous channels with diameter {approximately}5.5 {angstrom}, and amorphous aluminosilicate-pores of average diameter {approximately}50 {angstrom}), it was shown that depending on the concentration of butanol in the immediate vicinity of the active alkoxide intermediate {exists}-OC{sub 4}H{sub 9}, different reaction paths are utilized. High concentrations of alcohol favor ether formation, whereas low ones favour butene. This also explains the so-called {open_quotes}stop effect{close_quotes} observed in GC experiments, where an increase in the rate of butene formation occurs when the flow of alcohol is stopped and replaced with a flow of pure helium. Here, decreasing the concentration of alcohol in the micropores results in more of the alkoxide intermediate transforming to butene rather than to ether (which was the case at steady state). 28 refs., 17 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 36-51","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005337-0004","10.1006/jcat.1994.1270","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","110975","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/110975","","Journal of Catalysis","1","149"

On Pt, synthesis gas (CO and H{sub 2}) dominates near its stoichiometry, while olefin production dominates at higher fuel-to-oxygen ratios. No carbon buildup is observed, and catalysts exhibit no deactivation over at least several days. On Rh, primarily synthesis gas is produced under these conditions, while on Pd, carbon deposition rapidly deactivates the catalyst. The authors observed up to 65% selectivity to olefins at nearly 100% conversion of propane or n-butane with a catalyst contact time of 5 ms. Ethylene selectivity is maximized by increasing the reaction temperature, either by preheating the reactants or by using oxygen enriched air. Propylene selectivity is maximized by lower temperature and shorter catalyst contact time. Very small amounts alkanes and higher molecular weight species are obtained, suggesting that a homogeneous pyrolysis mechanism is not occurring. A very simple reaction mechanism appears to explain the observed product distribution. Reactions are initiated by oxidative dehydrogenation of the alkane by adsorbed oxygen to form a surface alkyl. On Pt, {beta}-hydrogen and {beta}-alkyl elimination reactions of adsorbed alkyl dominate which lead to olefin production rather than cracking to C{sub s} and H{sub s}. 24 refs., 14 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 127-141","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005337-0012","10.1006/jcat.1994.1278","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","110983","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/110983","","Journal of Catalysis","1","149"

Comparisons between the activities of TS-1 and and TiO{sub 2}-SiO{sub 2} coprecipitate for alkane oxidation and alkene epoxidation using nonaqueous H{sub 2}O{sub 2} indicate that the absence of water is crucial for the catalytic activity of silica-supported titanium.

In order to eliminate the extent of reaction as a factor, a parameter, R has been defined as the ratio of the percentage of [sup 13]C in the CO[sub x] products to that in the feed gas. If the amount of CO[sub x] derived from C[sub 2]H[sub 6] is small, it can be shown that R is approximately the ratio of the rate constant for CO[sub x] formation from C[sub 2]H[sub 4] to that from CH[sub 4].

Dehydrogenation products (unsaturated C[sub 4]'s) and carbon oxides were the primary products. For the supported sample of high vanadium loading where a significant amount of vanadium existed as V[sub 2]O[sub 5] crystallites under reaction conditions, Cs modification significantly increased the selectivity for dehydrogenation and decreased the extent of reduction of the vanadium oxide crystallites in the reaction mixture, but had only small effects on the activation energy or rate of reaction.

Three approaches used for the description of system nonideality are compared. All approaches use appropriate equations of state (EOS) with mixing rules taking into account the fact that the interaction parameters k[sub ij] depend on temperature as well as on the composition.

The treatment of the parent zeolite (5.2 Al/u.c.) resulted in a slight decrease of the content of framework Al but in a strong enrichment of nonframework Al on the outer surface. The catalytic effect was an increased aromatization of propane and a prolonged lifetime in the methanol conversion. The treatment of a dealuminated sample, containing much nonframework Al, caused a partial reinsertion of Al into the framework. This modification leads to an enhanced aromatization of methanol. Thus treatment with NaOH can control the content of framework Al and the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. 25 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 148:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 562-568","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1242","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","6651197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6651197","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","148:2"

The configuration of the experiment was chosen to approximate the atomizer geometry, surface tension and Weber number of a single coaxial rocket injector. The measurements are made in a water-cooled, optically accessible confinement chamber at a pressure of 1 atm. Data are reported for two atomizing air velocity conditions. One yields a flame length of approximately 1 m, the other, half that value. Both the Weber number (characterizing the atomization process) and the Reynolds number (characterizing the gas-phase mixing process) vary between the cases, but the data suggest that it is the Weber number which has the dominant effect. In both cases OH imaging shows that the reaction zone is confined to a narrow region, with the OH field being similar in appearance to that of a single-phase turbulent mixing-controlled (diffusion) flame. Size-classified mean velocity vectors derived from the phase-doppler data show striking differences in the flow pattern for low and high Stokes number droplets. Droplets 5 [mu]m in diameter and below (Stokes number less than 3) appear to follow the recirculating eddies that provide flame stabilization while droplets of large Stokes number travel ballistically through the flow. Increasing the Weber number by a factor of 2.5 decreased the Sauter mean diameter of the spray by as much as one-third, and the arithmetic mean diameter by as much as one-half. The authors believe that it is this decrease in the spray droplet diameter that is primarily responsible for the very different flame lengths in the two cases.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (United States); Journal Volume: 98:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 205-219","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMAO","10.1016/0010-2180(94)90236-4","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","7056931","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7056931","","Combustion and Flame; (United States)","","98:3"

Several important conclusions were reached. An activation pathway involving C-H addition across the metal-amido bond (i.e., [sigma]-bond metathesis) is disfavored relative to a pathway involving C-H addition across the metal-imido bond (i.e., [2[sub [sigma]] + 2[sub [pi]]] addition). The M(=NH)[sub 2](NH[sub 2]) complexes possess substantially more pyramidal coordination geometries than group IVB imides, M(NH[sub 2])[sub 2](=NH). Comparisons of metal-imido bond lengths for d[sup 0] imido and bis(imido) complexes are consistent with weakening of the metal-imido linkage, an important component of the [pi]-loading strategy. Calculated methane elimination barriers ([Delta]H[sub elim]) also show reasonable agreement with experiment and reproduce trends as a function of the metal. Methane activation by M(=NH)[sub 2](NH[sub 2]) (M = V, Nb, Ta) is approximately 10 kcal mol[sup [minus]1] more exothermic, versus separated reactants, than the analogous reaction for M(NH[sub 2])[sub 2](=NH) (M = Ti, Zr, Hf), a result consistent with the [pi]-loading hypothesis. 33 refs., 2 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Organometallics; (United States); Journal Volume: 13:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2987-2994","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0276-7333; CODEN: ORGND7; CNN: CHE-9314732","10.1021/om00020a014","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7027223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7027223","","Organometallics; (United States)","","13:8"

The nucleophiles were chosen such that their electronic (pK[prime][sub a] = [minus]2.79 to 12.20) and steric (Tolman cone angles, [theta] = 101-182[degree]) properties are systematically varied. With 10 smaller nucleophiles ([theta] [le] 133[degree]) the reactions occur via two well-separated steps: adduct formation and CO-dissociation from the adducts to form the monosubstituted products. The structures of the adducts formed are shown spectroscopically to be closely related to other reported and structurally characterized elsewhere. The rate equations for the two steps are effectively k[sub obs] = k[sub +L][L] and [kappa][sub obs] = [kappa]-[sub CO], respectively. With 11 larger nucleophiles ([theta] [ge] 136[degree]) the reaction is a quite different, second-order one-step, process with no spectral evidence for adduct formation being observed. Quantitative analysis of the dependence of the various rate constants on the electronic and steric properties of the nucleophiles or ligands involved shows that adduct formation of this HNCC with the group of smaller nucleophiles is much more facile than any comparable nucleophile-dependent reactions of other metal carbonyls. 37 refs., 5 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:14","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 6252-6261","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT","10.1021/ja00093a027","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6945472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6945472","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","116:14"

Apparent activation energies ranged from 35.5 to 95.4 kJ/mol for isomerization reactions over two loadings of Ni/NaX zeolite reduced under different conditions. Rates of isomerization, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis are also reported. Deactivation and regeneration of catalysts are discussed.

Solid-state [sup 51]V NMR for the V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/SiO[sub 2] catalysts indicated the presence of microcrystalline bulk-like vanadia species even at low vanadia loadings. Temperature programmed reduction of V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/SiO[sub 2] exhibited multiple peaks. It is suggested that the low temperature peak is due to reduction of surface vanadia.

Vanadia was more highly dispersed on alumina than on silica as evidenced by NMR and TPR. The two lowest temperature TPR peaks appear to be related to the reduction of surface vanadia on V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3]. It was found that for V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] the average oxidation state of V after reduction to 900[degrees]C is consistent with the stoichiometry V[sup +5] [yields] V[sup +4], whereas the V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/SiO[sub 2] catalysts exhibited 70% reduction of the V[sub 2]O[sub 5] to V[sub 2]O[sub 3] as did bulk V[sub 2]O[sub 5].

Oxygen exchange reactions were also studied over supported vanadia catalysts under steady-state oxidation reaction conditions. O exchange of O[sub 2] with V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/SiO[sub 2] increased significantly in the presence of methane. This is attributed to a redox reaction making the surface more active for O exchange in the presence of the methane. The involvement of catalyst oxygen in the formation of the products HCHO, CO, and CO[sub 2] was demonstrated. However, an estimation of the contribution of the lattice oxygen in the formation of the products is complicated by the presence of secondary O exchange. The total amount of [sup 16]O exchanged with the feed O[sub 2] and the products indicates that the oxygen associated with silica or the vanadia-silica interface is also involved in the exchange process.

However, unlike V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/SiO[sub 2], the O exchange of O[sub 2] with V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] did not increase significantly in the presence of methane. This was attributed to the differences in the interactions of vanadia with silica and alumina. 37 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 148:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 378-387","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1218","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6859081","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6859081","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","148:1"

The loss of metallic surface, accounting for the catalyst deactivation, was shown to come from the migration of nickel subcarbonyl adspecies formed during the reaction. The catalyst, presenting initially a bimodal Ni particle size distribution, evolved towards a bimodal system consisting of small spherical and large faceted crystals, with a selective development of <111> planes after several hours under reaction conditions. The formation of a nickel carbide monolayer could interfere with the formation of the large particles, possibly by decreasing the concentration of the mobile subcarbonyl adspecies. The best description of the observed sintering process was provided by considering a model with two distinct species, evolving according to the Ostwald-ripening mechanism, and being coupled by mass transport through the mobile nickel subcarbonyl intermediates. Long-term simulations allowed for the prediction of the ultimate state of the catalyst, and solutions aimed at slowing down the loss of nickel surface was proposed. 24 refs., 9 figs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 148:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1180","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6859208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6859208","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","148:1"

At 960 psig, 4600 hr[sup [minus]1] GHSV, 7 vol% O[sub 2], and temperatures sufficient for 100% O[sub 2] conversion (440-465[degrees]C), studies with first row transition metals supported on ZSM-5 showed that Cu, Ni, and Zn oxides produced C[sub 5][sup +] liquids (Fe-ZSM-5 produced C[sub 2]-C[sub 4] hydrocarbons) without the need for a feed additive. Co-, Cr-, and Mn-ZSM-5 catalysts under the same conditions produced no higher hydrocarbons. It is believed that of the CH[sub 3]OH formed in the system to higher hydrocarbons over metal-containing ZSM-5 is made possible by two metal functions. Initial trace dehydrogenation of CH[sub 4] (or of minute C[sub 2][sup +] feed components) to olefins provides initiation of the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) reaction but survival of olefins in the system is a function of the olefin oxidation activity of the metal oxide. Further experimentation using Ga-, Pt-, and Ag-ZSM-5 catalysts was consistent with this hypothesis. Thus, metal-containing ZSM-5 catalysts can produce C[sub 5][sup +] liquids from CH[sub 5] and O[sub 2] if dehydrogenation and oxidation functions of the metal are in balance. 12 refs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 148:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 134-137","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1194","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6798135","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6798135","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","148:1"

The system has a high selectivity for the production of propene over propane but is accompanied by the formation of oligomeric material that causes catalyst deactivation. Oligomer deposition can be readily followed by in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The amount of oligomer falls with increase in temperature and hydrogen pressure. The mechanism has been investigated through analysis of the oligomer fraction and by the use of deuterium in place of hydrogen. Greater than 70% of the C[sub 6] products are dienes, principally trans-2-methylpenta-1,3-diene, trans-2-trans-4-hexadiene, and 2,3-dimethyl-buta-1,3-diene. Three C[sub 6]H[sub 8] compounds, 2-methylpenta-1-ene-3-yne and the cis and trans isomer of hex-2-ene-4-yne make up the bulk of the remainder. Their amounts decrease steeply with increase in hydrogen pressure. The reaction with deuterium leads to dienes with an average of two deuteriums and ene-ynes averaging almost one deuterium. Unreacted propyne is exchanged to a significant extent very largely at the C[sub 1] position. Product propenes contain zero to three deuterium atoms distributed throughout the vinyl part of the molecule. There is a moderate kinetic isotope effect on going from hydrogen to deuterium which affects propene production a much greater extent than oligomer formation. The significance of these findings in relation to the steps by which hydrogenation and oligomerization occur is discussed. 23 refs., 7 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 148:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 125-133","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1193","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","6798147","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6798147","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","148:1"

The following electrochemical cell was constructed; (1) 1% hydrogen, Pt [vert bar] specimen ceramic [vert bar] Pt, O[sub 2]-Ar mixture (2) and electrochemical hydrogen permeation through this sample was examined under open- and closed-circuit conditions. When the circuit was closed, the hydrogen or water vapor evolution rates at the cathode decreased with increasing partial pressure of oxygen in the cathode. From the conductivity measurement under various p[sub O[sub 2]], it was confirmed that the main charge carrier except protons was a positive hole, and that this ceramic behaved as a proton-hole mixed conductor under the asymmetrical condition. When the circuit was open, water vapor evolved spontaneously, and its formation rates were enhanced with increasing p[sub O[sub 2]] in compartment (2). These phenomena indicate that this cell is a self-short-circuited via hole conduction in the bulk, and that hydrogen permeates electrochemically from compartment (1) to (2). Further, based on the principle of hydrogen permeation due to the proton-hole mixed conduction, CH[sub 4] dimerization was carried out at 1,173 K using SrCe[sub 0.95]Yb[sub 0.05]O[sub 3 [minus][alpha]] ceramic as a membrane reactor.

The IR spectra of adsorbed CH[sub 3]OH were determined for the same zeolites. The decrease of cation concentration with increasing Si/Al ratio in the framework of faujasites, mordenites, and zeolites A and ZK-4 results in the decrease of CH[sub 3]OH adsorption heats for the broad coverage range and in weakening of the [nu][sub OH] disturbance for adsorbed CH[sub 3][sub OH]. For highly dealuminated faujasite, the OH vibrations in adsorbed CH[sub 3]OH are strongly perturbed due to intermolecular interactions even at small coverages. The adsorption heat is very low in this case. Sodium cations at 8-membered oxygen rings of zeolite ZK-5 are more tightly bonded to the framework and so they are less active adsorption centers for CH[sub 3]OH molecules as compared to the appropriate cations of zeolite Na-A. The step on the adsorption heat curve for CH[sub 3]OH on zeolite Na-A in the coverage interval from 3 to 5 molecules/unit cell corresponds to the transition of adsorbed molecules from the interactions with cations in 8-membered oxygen rings to those with cations in 6-rings. The second step at coverages about 6 molecules/unit cell results from the crystallographic nonidentity of adsorption complexes formed by CH[sub 3]OH molecules with cations at 4-rings for different uptakes. The acidic structural OH groups of decationated mordenite are involved in strong hydrogen bonds with adsorbed CH[sub 3]OH molecules or protonate them.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States); Journal Volume: 165:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 318-324","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9797; CODEN: JCISA5","10.1006/jcis.1994.1235","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","7169853","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7169853","","Journal of Colloid and Interface Science; (United States)","","165:2"

Electrolysis of phosphate buffer solutions containing sodium formate in the presence of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) and MV[sup 2+] at -0.7 V vs SCE yielded formaldehyde if the concentration of the enzyme used was low, whereas both formaldehyde and methanol were produced for relatively high concentrations of the enzyme where the methanol production began to occur when the formaldehyde produced accumulated.

Methanol can be produced from CO[sub 2] and hydrogen, and can be used either as a fuel or as a chemical raw material. If used as a fuel, it would in effect have the added environmental advantage of reducing consumption of fossil fuels. Currently, methanol is produced from syngas, a mixture of H[sub 2], CO, and CO[sub 2]. CO is the main carbon source in the commercial-scale process by which methanol can be produced under competitive economics from a mixture of CO[sub 2] and hydrogen. This complex undertaking requires the development of a suitable catalyst, optimization of process parameters, and an adjustment of Lurgi's proven methanol technology to the specific requirements.

Moreover, it was discovered that subsurface oxygen species were primarily located in the vicinity of grain boundary defects. Desorption profiles suggested that coadsorbed oxygen moieties could destabilize chemisorbed formate. Because of the invariance in infrared band positions associated with formate species, regardless of whether or not neighbouring atomic oxygen species were present, a kinetic stabilization mechanism is proposed.

The presence of Co atoms in Ru-Co carbonyl clusters led to a remarkable increase in the rate of product formation, especially for oxygenates. The Ru-Mn bimetallic carbonyl cluster-derived catalyst showed similar conversion, but it exhibited poor activity and selectivity for oxygenates as compared with catalysts derived from Ru[sub 6]C(CO)[sub 17]. In contrast to the Ru[sub 6]C(CO)[sub 17] carbonyl cluster-derived catalyst, the Ru-Cr bimetallic carbonyl cluster-derived catalyst exhibited very low activity and selectivity for ethane and oxygenates, indicating that the Cr sites in Ru-Cr bimetallic carbonyl cluster-derived catalyst have a poisoning effect on ethylene hydroformylation.

Catalytic formulations have been developed around the world, which allow rather high alcohol selectivities to be reached, but these performances are generally attained after an aging period which is necessary for the in situ preparation of the active phase. For this reason, the evolution of copper-cobalt-based model catalysts has been studied in different test equipment and operating conditions, such as fixed bed, slurry phase, and Berty reactors, as well as autoclaves and differential scanning calorimeters (DSC). The evolution of metallic cobalt dispersion was followed by magnetic measurements, and carbon deposits were visualized by temperature-programmed hydrogenation experiments. The interest of a slurry reactor for alcohols synthesis is demonstrated at lab scale. Acetaldehyde thermodesorption and CO disproportionation allow the performances of cobalt-based active phases to be predicted.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 33:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1460-1467","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00030a005","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","7023572","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7023572","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","33:6"

Methanol can be synthesized from biomass or urban waste, and as a result, it does not contribute to the net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Cold-starting of methanol-fueled engines is difficult at temperatures below 10 C, and at sub-zero temperatures, starting may be impractical without significant engine modifications. In this research, an attempt has been made to study and prevent the cold-starting problem by using hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas mixture produced by decomposing liquid methanol using a submerged electric arc device. The electric arc has the advantage of instantaneous gas production and the experimental data relating to the performance of the device and its design are reported. The device is capable of producing up to 0.01 cu m (10 L) per min of a gas which is primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen with a thermal efficiency of 18 percent relative to the theoretical energy requirements for methanol decomposition. The feasibility of using this arc device is analyzed based on the simulated cold-starting data collected for a single-cylinder Kawasaki engine at [minus]20 C.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 155-160","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738; CODEN: JERTD2","10.1115/1.2906021","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7151740","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7151740","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology; (United States)","","116:2"

The instantaneous methanol oxidation current is unaffected by the methanolic CO formation (surface poisoning) and depends on platinum surface structure and composition of supporting electrolyte with respect to the anions. The highest oxidation current, 156 mA-cm[sup [minus]2], is observed with the Pt(110) electrode in perchloric acid solution at 0.200 V vs Ag/AgCl reference. In terms of turnover, this current translates to 163 molecules-(Pt site)[sup [minus]1][center dot]s[sup [minus]1], a high rate exceeding previous expectations in methanol electrode kinetics. Overall, the oxidation current changes by 3 orders of magnitude between the extreme cases examined in this study. Breaking up the total effect into individual components shows that the surface geometry and anionic effects are roughly comparable.

A public meeting will be held this week to begin working on an agreement. EPA says most of the data should be collected in 1995 and expects the program to cost approximately $3 million. In December, EPA floated a proposal to require 30% of the oxygenates used in the reformulated gasoline program to come from renewable sources such as ETBE and ethanol. Although EPA found no serious health risks associated with MTBE, questions remain, which is why EPA says it will test the use of ETBE and TAME. William Piel, business manager for oxygenated fuels at Arco Chemical (Newtown Square, PA), says testing is {open_quotes}just a formality.{close_quotes} There should be no difference in results among MTBE, ETBE, or TAME, he says. But ETBE and TAME have much lower volatility than MTBE, which would mean significantly less exposure to these oxygenates, Piel says. Arco is the biggest producer of MTBE but also has capability to make ETBE.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; Journal Volume: 154; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: 11 May 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10","","","","Journal ID: CHWKA9; ISSN 0009-272X; TRN: 97:000638-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508311","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508311","","Chemical Week","18","154"

The techniques utilized were UV-vis reflectance, volumetric, TEM, and mainly FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. Whereas CO is not adsorbed on oxidized samples, the depletion under vacuum of oxygen from the sample reduced at 500 K produces a coordinative unsaturation (cus) on the ferric surface ions with lowering of the oxidation number and reversible adsorption of CO at [nu] = 2150, 2138, and 2124 cm[sup [minus]1]. The reduction at 623-773 K favors further reduction to a highly dispersed FeO-like phase spread on the support; the frequencies of reversibly adsorbed CO are red-shifted up to 2080 cm[sup [minus]1] and are the fingerprints of a high heterogeneity of Fe[sup x+] (x [approx] 2) sites. However, the oxide-oxide interaction hinders an easy reduction to Fe[sup 0] even at 773 K; at this temperature only small quantities of carbonylic clusters and of CO adsorbed on more extended iron faces, with [nu]CO = 2100-1970 cm[sup [minus]1], are formed at room temperature. The oxidation at 473 K fully eliminates the process of reduction and of oxide-oxide interaction. 38 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 98:18","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4884-4891","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100069a019","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7019594","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7019594","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","98:18"

While the potential prize is immense-a cheap way of upgrading vast reserves of methane-rich natural gas-the research field is littered with failures and false starts. But now, even as the prospects of making olefins directly from methane through high-temperature oxidative coupling reactions are dimming, several novel low-temperature approaches are promising new opportunities. Late last month, Catalytica (Mountain View, CA) gained a US patent covering a catalytic methane-to-methanol synthesis. Working with partners Petro-Canada and a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Oil, Catalytica developed a low-temperature synthesis to foil one of the classic problems in direct methane oxidation-stopping the reaction at methanol.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; Journal Volume: 154; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: PBD: 4 May 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35","","","","Journal ID: CHWKA9; ISSN 0009-272X; TRN: 96:006553-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","458701","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/458701","","Chemical Week","17","154"

This work focused on the homogenous gas phase partial oxidation of methane to oxygenates in the temperature range 300--500 C and at pressures of 3--6 MPa and compared the experimental results with model calculations.

Addition of a sufficient water vapor partial pressure prevented both carbon deposition and corrosion. The role of water vapor is viewed as being to maintain the iron surface in an oxide state, which is inactive for the catalytic formation of filamentous carbon. Carbon dioxide was found to be a much less effective oxidant than water vapor, while hydrogen did not prevent filamentous carbon formation.

The oxygenates adsorb on the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] support, and hydrogenation involves a spillover process since H[sub 2] dissociates on the Ni surface. The rates of hydrogenation to CH[sub 4] are essentially the same for all the oxygenates studied. Apparently, the same rate-determining step, reverse spillover of an oxygenated species from Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] to Ni, limits the formation of CH[sub 4]. Similar processes occur on Ni/SiO[sub 2] for methanol and ethanol, but their coverages on SiO[sub 2] are a factor of 15 lower and hydrogenation to CH[sub 4] takes place over a broad temperature range. None of the oxygenates remained on the Ni surface of Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] in H[sub 2] flow; apparently they spilled over to the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] or were hydrogenated at room temperature. On Ni/SiO[sub 2], only HCOOH adsorbs and dissociates on Ni to form adsorbed CO. Coadsorption shows that [sup 13]CO and various oxygenates have independent adsorption and hydrogenation behavior. 56 refs., 10 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 147:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 72-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: CTS-9021194","10.1006/jcat.1994.1115","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","7288153","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7288153","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","147:1"

The nonporous membrane film that consisted of PbO modified by alkaline or alkaline earth compound was supported on porous SiO[sub 2]-Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] tube. Higher hydrocarbons were successfully synthesized with high selectivity (about 90%). A kinetic analysis was conducted to clarify whether oxide ion transportation through PbO film participated in the oxidative coupling of methane. The evaluated value of the diffusion coefficient of oxide ion transport based on the methane oxidation agreed well with that of published data. The simulated gradient of the oxide ion concentration through the PbO membrane agreed well with that measured by electron probe X-ray microanalyzer. A transient response simulated by using kinetic parameters evaluated from steady-state analysis also agreed well with the experiment. These results prove the validity of the reaction model that consists of surface reactions of methane with oxide ion which is transferred from inside to outside of the membrane reactor. Alkali modifiers on the PbO membrane surface exhibited a promotional effect on the surface reaction of methane coupling. Another membrane reactor containing Bi[sub 2]O[sub 3] showed higher activity than the PbO membrane.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 40:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 870-877","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690400513","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7262407","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7262407","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","40:5"

Zeolite [beta] gives isobutane as the major product from methanol conversion under all reaction conditions tested, together with significant selectivities to C[sub 2] and C[sub 3] hydrocarbons. The conversions of ethanol and propanol over zeolite [beta] lead to the almost exclusive formation of the corresponding alkene via water elimination.

The studies reported here provide evidence for this reaction on single crystal copper surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Alkyl iodides are used as molecular precursors to generate adsorbed methylene and alkyl groups on a Cu(100) surface. High-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy and work function change measurements show that C-I bond dissociation occurs below 200 K in iodoalkanes to form alkyl groups on the surface. Indirect evidence supports the formation of adsorbed methylene groups via CH[sub 2]I[sub 2] dissociation. Temperature-programmed reaction studies of the CH[sub 2] + CD[sub 3] reaction show that sequential CH[sub 2] insertion followed by [beta]-hydride elimination produces ethylene-d[sub 2] and propylene-d[sub 3]. Similarly, reaction of CH[sub 2] with C[sub 2]D[sub 5] produces propylene-d[sub 4]. All of these reactions are extremely facile, occurring at 230-250 K with activation energies of 12-20 kcal/mol. Similar studies on Cu(110) show that the methylene insertion reaction is structure sensitive, being approximately two orders of magnitude faster on Cu(100) than on Cu(110). The source of this difference appears to be slow diffusion of methylene across the corrugated Cu(110) surface. 42 refs., 15 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 147:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 250-263","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: CHE-90-22077; DAAL03-91-C-0016","10.1006/jcat.1994.1136","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","7185319","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7185319","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","147:1"

Since ignition of methanol by the straight forward diesel cycle is not attainable, Mitsubishi decided to use glow plugs for ignition. The result has been the adaptation of the 450 mm bore test engine, at Nagasaki, with a special cylinder head carrying two methanol precombustion chambers and two main methanol injectors. Results from the tests at Nagasaki showed that NO[sub x] formation was no more than 500 ppm at full load, while thermal efficiency was at least equal to that of a straight diesel engine. A base model ship for Japanese coastal waters operation is being studied. Plans of the ship have been sent to the Japanese classification society, NK, and they include a separate methanol treatment room and storage tanks. The committee concluded that a methanol-engined ship of about 1000 dwt can be operated economically with a relatively small increase in freight rate. Lower crew costs are part of that equation, because of an expected decrease in machinery maintenance. Conceptual approval for the project is now being sought with NK. 2 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide; (United States); Journal Volume: 26:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 44-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0278-5994; CODEN: DGWODS","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7073487","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7073487","","Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide; (United States)","","26:4"

The reactivity of surface-lattice oxygen of MgO and Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3] was studied in the Knudsen regime with respect to the H-D exchange in methane. Surface hydroxyl groups were found to participate in this reaction, but no direct interaction of methane molecules on the catalyst surface occurred. H-D exchange proceeds via a multistep mechanism involving methane-surface interaction leading to dissociative adsorption of methane. On MgO, surface-lattice oxygen is responsible for methyl radical formation resulting in C[sub 2] hydrocarbons, while adsorbed oxygen species have very short lifetimes (<0.1 s) on the surface and take part in the reactions of total oxidation. On Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3], active oxygen species formed by the interaction of gaseous O[sub 2] with the catalyst surface have lifetimes up to 20 s and are mainly responsible for methane conversion and product formation. Based on the response analysis it was assumed that direct interaction of gas-phase methane with active oxygen surface species is the first step in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3]. It was found that the type of methane activation which takes place in H-D exchange was not involved in the OCM reaction over Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3]. 38 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 146:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 346-357","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1073","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","7203845","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7203845","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","146:2"

Rh catalysts were prepared by supporting Rh[sub 4](CO)[sub 12] or on ZrO[sub 2] after adsorption of Mo(CO)[sub 6]. The Rh content on all catalysts was 1% (w/w) while the Mo/Rh atomic ratio ranged from 0.0 to 2.0. The supported catalysts were decomposed in H[sub 2] at 523 K (LTR) and at 773 K (HTR). The samples were characterized by TEM, EPR, FTIR, and chemisorption of H[sub 2], O[sub 2], and CO. The catalytic activity was tested in the CO hydrogenation reaction at 493 K and 101 kPa. The total CO conversion increased with Mo/Rh ration on LTR catalysts while it was unaffected on HTR catalysts. By increasing the Mo content the amount of CO[sub 2] formed increased significantly. The CO carbon efficiency to methane and total hydrocarbon without CO[sub 2], did not depend on the Mo/Rh ratio for LTR catalysts while a constant decrease was observed for HTR catalysts. The carbon efficiency to methanol increased with the Mo content both on LTR and HTR catalysts, and that to ethanol changed with the Mo/Rh ratio and the activation temperature. The environment of Rh particles is strongly modified by the presence of Mo as evidenced by modification of the IR spectrum of chemisorbed CO both in the linear and in the bridged Rh-CO region. On the basis of the experimental results the reaction paths to CO[sub 2], CH[sub 3]OH, and CH[sub 4], and the effect of MoO[sub 3] promoter are discussed in detail.

"Effect of additives on the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadium oxide phase in V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/TiO[sub 2] catalysts","Deo, G; Wachs, I E","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANOL; OXIDATION; VANADIUM OXIDES; STRUCTURAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; CATALYST SUPPORTS; CATALYSTS; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS; NIOBIUM OXIDES; PHOSPHORUS OXIDES; POTASSIUM OXIDES; SILICON OXIDES; TITANIUM OXIDES; TUNGSTEN OXIDES; ALCOHOLS; ALKALI METAL COMPOUNDS; CATALYSIS; CHALCOGENIDES; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; HYDROXY COMPOUNDS; NIOBIUM COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; OXIDES; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS; POTASSIUM COMPOUNDS; REFRACTORY METAL COMPOUNDS; SILICON COMPOUNDS; TITANIUM COMPOUNDS; TRANSITION ELEMENT COMPOUNDS; TUNGSTEN COMPOUNDS; VANADIUM COMPOUNDS; 400201* - Chemical & Physicochemical Properties; 100200 - Synthetic Fuels- Production- (1990-)","Additives on a 1% V[sub 2]O[sub 5]/TiO[sub 2] catalyst exhibit two types of interactions with the surface vanadium oxide phase which are observed by Raman spectroscopy under dehydrated conditions and methanol oxidation. Under dehydration conditions, noninteracting additives (WO[sub 3], Nb[sub 2]O[sub 5], and SiO[sub 2]) coordinate directly to the oxide support without significantly interacting with the surface vanadium oxide phase. Furthermore, the effect of the noninteracting additives on the surface vanadium oxide phase is independent of the order of preparation or precursor used. These noninteracting additives do not affect the methanol oxidation activity and selectivity. Interacting additives (K[sub 2]O and P[sub 2]O[sub 5]), however, directly coordinate with the surface vanadium oxide phase. Addition of K[sub 2]O progressively titrates the surface vanadium oxide sites, as observed from the changes in the structure and reactivity of the surface vanadium oxide phase. The effect of P[sub 2]O[sub 5] on the surface vanadium oxide phase depends on the concentration and sequence of preparation. Addition of higher concentrations of P[sub 2]O[sub 5] forms vanadium phosphate compounds, and results in a change in methanol oxidation activity and selectivity. The addition of 1% V[sub 2]O[sub 5] to a 5% P[sub 2]O[sub 5]/TiO[sub 2] sample, however, does not show any evidence of compound formation, but a part of the surface vanadium oxide phase appears to be titrated. Under ambient conditions, the additives change the pH at point of zero charge of the surface moisture layer which controls the structure of the surface vanadium oxide layer. Thus, depending on the nature of the additive, interacting or noninteracting, the dehydrated structure and reactivity toward methanol oxidation of the surface vanadium oxide phase are affected or remain essentially unchanged, respectively. 27 refs., 8 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 146:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 335-345","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1072","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","7288152","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7288152","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","146:2"

Kinetic orders with respect to H[sub 2]O[sub 2] are generally close to zero, while those with respect to the alcohol are strongly affected by the solvent used. The kinetic pattern is interpreted in terms of an interaction of the lattice titanium atom of titanium silicalite-1 with H[sub 2]O[sub 2]. The kinetic order with respect to the alcohol can be interpreted either in terms of titanium-alcohol adducts or with a selective alcohol sorption in the catalyst pores. The reaction pattern is consistent with a process taking place essentially inside the zeolite channels, with a transition-state-restricted shape-selectivity.

"Reactivity of supported vanadium oxide catalysts: The partial oxidation of methanol","Deo, G; Wachs, I E","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANOL; OXIDATION; VANADIUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; ARRHENIUS EQUATION; CATALYST SUPPORTS; CATALYSTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS; PARTIAL OXIDATION PROCESSES; TITANIUM OXIDES; ZIRCONIUM OXIDES; ALCOHOLS; CATALYSIS; CHALCOGENIDES; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; EQUATIONS; HYDROXY COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; OXIDES; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; THERMOCHEMICAL PROCESSES; TITANIUM COMPOUNDS; TRANSITION ELEMENT COMPOUNDS; VANADIUM COMPOUNDS; ZIRCONIUM COMPOUNDS; 400201* - Chemical & Physicochemical Properties; 100200 - Synthetic Fuels- Production- (1990-)","The partial oxidation of methanol was used to probe the reactivity of the surface vanadium oxide redox sites present in supported vanadium oxide catalysts. Formaldehyde was the main oxidation product for all the supported vanadium oxide catalysts operating under differential reactor conditions. The methanol oxidation turnover frequency (TOF) of the surface vanadium oxide phase varies by three orders of magnitude when the support is changed from ZrO[sub 2]/TiO[sub 2] (10[sup 0] s[sup [minus]1]) to SiO[sub 2] (10[sup [minus]3]). The TOF of the surface vanadium oxide phase supported on Nb[sub 2]O[sub 5] (10[sup [minus]1]s[sup [minus]1]) and Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] (10[sup [minus]2] s[sup [minus]1]) have intermediate values with surface vanadium oxide phase on Nb[sub 2]O[sub 5] having a TOF very close to ZrO[sub 2] or TiO[sub 2]. The TOF of the surface vanadium oxide phase on all the oxide supports is essentially independent of the vanadium oxide loading below monolayer coverage. The similar structures of the surface vanadium oxide phase on the different oxide supports as well as the independence of the TOF with respect to vanadium oxide surface coverage suggests that a structural difference is not responsible for the difference in reactivity of the various supported vanadium oxide catalysts. It is proposed that the number of participating surface vanadium oxide sites is most probably related to the reductibility of the V-O-Support bond since this bridging bond strength controls the reductibility of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts. 51 refs., 3 figs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 146:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 323-334","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: CTS-9006258","10.1006/jcat.1994.1071","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","7185299","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7185299","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","146:2"

One, a process that converts carbon dioxide to methanol, is seen as a means of reducing the amount of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere without an economic penalty. The other, unsteady-state operation, is a chemical processing innovation that is finding its way into the cleaning of plant exhaust gases. Particulars on the developments were presented in separate forums at the American Chemical Society's national meeting in San Diego. The methanol process, developed by Lurgi Oel-Gas-Chemie, Frankfurt, was outlined for the Catalysis and Surface Science Secretariat. Lurgi is ready to commercialized a variation of its methanol process, which converts carbon dioxide to ethanol in two stages. Underlying the process is development of a catalyst that is suitable for operation in two temperature regimes. The paper describes the development of the process. A catalytic reverse processing system is being used to decontaminate gas streams containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs may be unacceptable in the environment or undesirable in subsequent processing units. Other applications include nitrogen oxides reduction, ammonia and methanol synthesis, and oxidation of SO[sub 2] to SO[sub 3] in the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Among the materials that have been removed as VOCs are C[sub 4] to C[sub 8] alcohols, phenol, formaldehyde, cyanic acid, and a variety of organic solvents.

Syngas conversion uses hydrocarbon feedstocks, steam, O[sub 2] and CO[sub 2], either separately or in combinations. Autothermal reforming (ATR) is a low-investment process using a simple reactor design. The process is soot-free due to burner design and fixed-bed catalyst. Developed in the late '50s, ATR's main application was for ammonia and methanol syntheses. In ammonia plants, hydrogen production was maximized by operating at high H[sub 2]O/C ratios ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 mole/mole. In methanol units, CO[sub 2] recycle adjusted the syngas composition. ATR is also used to co-produce CO and H[sub 2] as separate streams at H[sub 2]O/C ratios of 1.4 to 2.0 mole/mole. recent developments and optimizations allow cost-effective operation at very low H[sub 2]O/C feed ratios to produce CO-rich syngas.

This result suggests that adsorbed ethoxide can form via two routes: (i) by dissociative adsorption on Lewis acid site giving rise to the [sup 18]O-containing ethoxide and (ii) by the nucleophilic attack of the surface oxide on ethanol which is probably activated toward C-O bond cleavage by interacting with a Bronsted acid site. Thus, the product distribution following the adsorption of [[sup 18]O]ethanol provides useful information on the acidic properties of oxides, especially with respect to the nature of Lewis versus Bronsted acid sites.

The structures of the samples were characterized by several techniques (LRS, XRD, XPS, ESR, TPR, O[sub 2], CO and H[sub 2] chemisorption, and TPD) and accounted for the catalytic properties for alcohol synthesis from synthesis gas. It is revealed that for the potassium-promoted samples and interaction between the potassium promoter and the supported molybdenum component occurs. The amount of the species resulting from this interaction gets saturated at a K/Mo ratio of 0.8. On the oxidic samples, K-Mo interaction species which may contain potassium cations and an Mo[sub 7]O[sup 6[minus][sub 24]] unit are formed. This retards, to some extent, the sulfidation and reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(IV). The sulfidation of the interaction species leads to the aggregation of MoS[sub 2] and the formation of surface [open quotes]K-Mo-S[close quotes] species. At K/Mo ratios above 0.8, KCl crystallites form; some amount of KCl, which is not aggregated, covers the exposed molybdenum surface, and decreases the amount of [open quotes]K-Mo-S[close quotes] species and Mo(CUS) sites. The activity toward alcohol formation over the sulfided samples is in parallel with the extent of the K-Mo interaction, with the maximum achieved at K/Mo ratio of 0.8, while alcohol selectivity monotonically increases with K/Mo ratio. It is tentatively proposed that the surface [open quotes]K-Mo-S[close quotes] species and Mo(CUS) sites are responsible for the alcohol and hydrocarbon formations, respectively. The high C[sub 2+]OH/C[sub 1]OH ratio in the alcohol product distribution is probably due to the substantial amount of the SH species present on the surface of the sulfided samples during reaction. 42 refs., 10 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 146:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 144-154","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(94)90017-5","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6798076","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6798076","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","146:1"

In the absence of alkali metal, only an isolated surface molybdenum oxide species was present on the silica support. Addition of alkali metals decreased the number of isolated surface molybdenum oxide species and formed new alkali-molybdate compounds due to the weak interaction of the Mo species with the silica surface. The oxygen associated with the alkali-molybdate compounds are generally not available for oxidation reactions. Consequently, the addition of alkali metal decreased the catalytic activity for the oxidation of both methane and methanol.

The reaction is highly temperature-sensitive. Isobutene has an enhancing effect on the rate whereas ethanol has an inhibitor one. Besides, low ETBE concentrations enhance the reaction but as chemical equilibrium is approached the ether shows an inhibitor effect, as expected. As alcohol-olefin-ether mixtures behave nonideally, kinetic analysis has been performed by using the UNIFAC liquid-phase activities of isobutene, ethanol, and ETBE. The best kinetic model stems from an Eley-Rideal mechanism in which the ethanol, adsorbed on one center, reacts with the isobutene from solution to give the ether adsorbed on one center. Surface reaction is the rate-limiting step. Two additional centers take part in this step.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 33:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 581-591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00027a015","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","7207833","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7207833","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","33:3"

In the absence of sulfur but in the presence of hydrogen, supported metallic nickel catalyzes the rapid hydrogenolysis of alkanes, resulting in exceedingly poor selectivity toward dehydrogenation products. However, the hydrogenolysis activity can be essentially eliminated by proper sulfidation, resulting in high selectivity toward isobutylene production. Due to thermodynamic limitations, elevated temperatures are necessary to attain reasonable conversions to isobutylene. Under these conditions, the formation of coke is rapid and is the main cause of catalyst deactivation. Treatment of nickel catalysts with relatively large amounts of sulfur-containing reagents results not only in dramatically improved selectivity but also in a decreased rate of coke formation. The catalysts exhibited activation periods of several hours until a maximum was reached when they were placed in the reaction environment at 873 K. This activation period did not depend upon the previous reduction treatment but did depend upon the time on stream. A correlation was found between the increase in activity and the growth of a carbidic phase on the catalyst. This species, characterized by TPO and XPS, reaches a saturation value at a C/Ni ratio of unity, which was coincidental with the amount of carbon on the catalyst when it achieved its maximum activity. Two alternative explanations for the activation process are discussed. The first considers the participation of a nickel-carbidic-carbon complex in the reaction scheme. The second considers the creation of sulfur vacancies during the initial coke deposition period which would increase the exposure of a catalytically active Ni-S moiety. 43 refs., 16 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 146:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 40-55","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(94)90006-X","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7034820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7034820","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","146:1"

The presence of water and CO led to severe inhibition of the methanol conversion at any temperature; propylene addition had no effect on the conversion profile. The CO inhibition is described as competitive adsorption of the CO on palladium oxidation sites. The methanol conversion was described through a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. At low temperature, and under reducing conditions, the methanol conversion displayed a local maximum. This maximum is attributable to a shift in the oxidation state of the palladium catalyst within the temperature range of the methanol oxidation reaction. Temperature programmed oxidation and differential scanning calorimetry reveal that the catalyst changes from a relatively reduced surface at low temperature to a less active, relatively oxidized surface as the temperature is increased.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 33:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 526-533","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00027a009","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","7073081","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7073081","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","33:3"
"Effect of pressure on the oxidative coupling of methane in the absence of catalyst","Chen, Q; Couwenberg, P M; Marin, G B","03 NATURAL GAS; 10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; METHANE; OXIDATION; REFORMER PROCESSES; PRESSURE DEPENDENCE; CARBON MONOXIDE; CHEMICAL REACTION YIELD; ETHANE; ETHYLENE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; ALKANES; ALKENES; CARBON COMPOUNDS; CARBON OXIDES; CHALCOGENIDES; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; HYDROCARBONS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; OXIDES; OXYGEN COMPOUNDS; YIELDS; 030300* - Natural Gas- Drilling, Production, & Processing; 100200 - Synthetic Fuels- Production- (1990-)","The oxidative coupling of methane was carried out in the absence of catalyst in a continuous flow setup at total pressures up to 1,000 kPa, temperatures from 950 to 1,230 K, and inlet molar ratios of CH[sub 4]/O[sub 2] down to 2.5. At constant temperature and residence time, the conversions of methane and oxygen increase drastically with increasing pressure. At oxygen conversions higher than 80%, product selectivities are comparable at different pressures. The space-time yield of the C[sub 2]products reaches a level comparable to that required for industrial operations from 400 kPa on. A radical-reaction network consisting of 38 elementary reactions allows to describe the experimental data. To describe adequately the effect of total pressure, the pressure fall-off behavior of the rate coefficients for the unimolecular reactions in the network has to be taken into account explicitly. General features of the reaction mechanism do not depend on the total pressure. Methyl and hydrogen peroxy radicals are the most abundant radicals. The total pressure increase results in a drastic increase of the concentrations of the chain carriers, particularly the hydrogen peroxy radical. Higher pressures favor the oxidative route from ethane to ethylene compared to the pyrolytic route. Increasing the total pressure leads to an increase of the primary and a decease of the consecutive CO formation relative to the coupling. The balance between these nonselective routes determines the effect of the total pressure on the integral selectivity to C[sub 2] products at different conversions. The major contribution to the integral CO selectivity comes from the oxidation of methyl radicals.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 40:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 521-535","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690400313","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","7115660","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7115660","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","40:3"

The ranking of specific catalytic activity and selectivity with respect to the addition of hydrogen to CO, CO{sub 2}, and the > C{triple_bond}O and -C{triple_bond}N groups is determined mainly by the energies of the bonds between the metal and the compound being hydrogenated, and between the metal and hydrogen. In turn, the bond energies depend on the chemical nature of the metal and also on the degree of dispersity of the metal. The role of the dimensional factor, which influences the concentration of active centers, has also been investigated. On the basis of the relationships that have been found between the physicochemical and catalytic properties of monotypical substances, criteria have been formulated for the selection of catalysts for the hydrogenation of these compounds.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Theoretical and Experimental Chemistry; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1994; TN: Translated from Teoreticheskaya i Eksperimental`naya Khimiya; 29: No. 5, 395-417(Sep-Oct 1993)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 260-277","","","","Journal ID: TEXCAK; ISSN 0040-5760; TRN: 95:008914-0001","10.1007/BF00531460","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","171753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/171753","","Theoretical and Experimental Chemistry","5","29"

In 98% sulfuric acid, methane is oxidized to CH[sub 3]OSO[sub 3]H by a variety of 1e[sup [minus]] and 2e[sup [minus]] oxidants, such as S[sub 2]O[sub 8][sup 2[minus]], Ce(IV), Pd(II), and Hg(II). In the case of ethane, the observed products are CH[sub 3]OSO[sub 3]H and HO[sub 3]SCH[sub 2]CH[sub 2]OSO[sub 3]H. These oxidations appear to proceed through a series of electron-transfer steps involving the intermediacy of radicals and carbocations. We have determined the ratio of rate constants for methane versus methanol oxidation by the Pt(II) ion in water and an average value of 0.17(2) was obtained. The similarity in rate constants for methane and methanol oxidations under such mild conditions is remarkable. Moving to substrates with C-H bonds somewhat weaker than that in methane results in actual reversal of commonly observed selectivity. As an example, we have observed the exclusive oxidation of the methyl group in ethanol resulting in the formation of 1,2-ethanediol as the predominant product. In addition, when ethane was included as a substrate, the relative rate of C-H bond activation by the Pt(II) ion decreased in the order H-CH[sub 2]CH[sub 3] > H-CH[sub 2]CH[sub 2]OH > H-CH(OH)CH[sub 3]. Another example of unusual selectivity was the observation of 1,3-propanediol as the predominant product in the oxidation of 1-propanol by the Pt(II) ion in water. 17 refs., 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 998-1003","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT; CNN: CHE-9209264","10.1021/ja00082a022","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5204005","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5204005","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","116:3"

To this end, two basic designs of reactors are studied as the key factor in controlling the free-radical reactions. One design has the reactants well mixed upstream of the plasma zone. The other has at least one reactant gas introduced downstream of the plasma zone. The latter type has an inherent advantage that the critical free-radical reactions occur away from the plasma zone so that the intermediates leading to the desired product do not further react in the plasma zone. In addition, if methane is introduced downstream of the plasma zone, the methane dimerization is essentially eliminated. 32 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 98:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 206-210","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100052a034","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5154720","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5154720","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","98:1"

The data show a clear interaction between the Ti(110) support and the overlayer, as a function of thermal treatments and oxidation state. Two model substrates, fully oxidized and partially reduced TiO[sub 2], were impregnated with metallic cobalt or cobalt oxide via dry chemical methods. The resulting four combinations, TiO[sub 2]-o/Co, TiO[sub 2]-o/CoO, TiO[sub 2]-r/Co, and TiO[sub 2]-r/CoO, were compared with reference spectra for the isolated constituents by means of electron spectroscopic measurements following annealing to subsequently higher temperatures. We employ a new fingerprint' technique to analyze the data, thereby allowing us to utilize all available peak positions for a better understanding of chemical interactions and dispersion changes. From our data we can conclude that only metallic cobalt influences the chemical state of titania. The dispersion of CoO changes at moderate temperatures, 500-700 K, but this is restricted to coalescence of the overlayer. The overlayer oxide is less stable on the partially reduced support than on fully oxidized titania. Metallic cobalt, as deposited or from decomposition of CoO, diffuses into titania at above 700 K on TiO[sub 2]-o and above 500 K on TiO[sub 2]-r. This interdiffusion is accompanied by a reduction of the support. The lower stability of CoO on the partially reduced support is accompanied by a stabilization of cobalt in the surface region. 52 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 178-187","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0743-7463; CODEN: LANGD5","10.1021/la00013a027","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","5165017","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5165017","","Langmuir; (United States)","","10:1"

The reduction in CH[sub 4] conversion and increase in C[sub 2] selectivity, observed when CO[sub 2] is added to the feed gas, are accounted for by modifying rate equations for the heterogeneous reactions. The modification assumes that the number of active sites on the catalyst is determined by the equilibrium established between active Li[sub 2]O[sub 2] and inactive Li[sub 2]CO[sub 3]. An Eley-Rideal type rate equation best describes a range of experimental data obtained at 700 C, including data acquired with CO[sub 2] added to the feed. Furthermore, the observed beneficial effect of adding auxiliary O[sub 2] to the midpoint of the catalyst in a fixed bed reactor is predicted by the model.

Tunneling splitting patterns, selection rules, and effective B values for K = 0 rotational levels of the hydrogen-bonded methanol dimer are predicted from group-theoretical considerations, a modified internal axis method, approximate descriptions of possible tunneling paths, and the assumption that K = 0 levels can be treated by themselves. It is shown that 25 different tunneling motions are possible when the two methanol monomers are identical, giving rise to 16 tunneling-rotational levels for K = 0: four nondegenerate A levels, eight doubly degenerate E levels, and four fourfold degenerate G levels. The gross features of a recently observed dimer K = 0 [alpha]-type microwave spectrum can be explained using only two of these tunneling motions, namely the internal rotation of each of the two inequivalent methyl groups in the dimer. Finer details of the observed splittings presumably arise from some of the remaining 23 tunneling motions. Tunneling splitting patterns are also predicted for cases in which the two methanols in the dimer are isotopically different, but the C[sub 3v] symmetry of both methyl tops is preserved.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy; (United States); Journal Volume: 163:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 86-107","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-2852; CODEN: JMOSA3","10.1006/jmsp.1994.1010","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","5449856","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5449856","","Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy; (United States)","","163:1"

For acetic acid on the Rh(111)(2 x 2)O surface, acetates were formed via direct transfer of the acid hydrogens to the surface oxygen atoms to form surface hydroxyls. When oxygen atoms were present on the surface, the only pathway for acetate decomposition was decarboxylation at 430 K. Thus coadsorbed oxygen atoms provide significant stabilization of acetates on Rh(111), as previously observed for formates on the same surface. In the presence of adsorbed oxygen, a portion of the methyl groups of surface acetates was oxidized to CO at temperatures below those expected for reactions of atomic carbon and oxygen species. This observation suggests that oxygen intervenes in the acetate decomposition pathway prior to the complete fragmentation of these intermediates. 63 refs., 11 figs., 10 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 145:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 37-53","","","FG02-84ER13290","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1005","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7185288","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7185288","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","145:1"

Butane is converted to aromatics by using either zinc-promoted [Ga]-ZSM-5 or zinc and gallium copromoted [Fe]-ZSM-5 zeolite as a catalyst. However, the formation of aromatics is severely limited by hydrocracking of butane to methane, ethane, and propane due to the hydrogen formed during aromatization reactions. On the other hand, the oxidative dehydrogenation of butane to butene over molybdate catalysts is found to be accompanied by a concurrent undesirable reaction, i.e., total oxidation. When two of these reactions (oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization of butane) are coupled by using a dual function catalyst they have shown to complement each other. It is believed that the rate-limiting step for aromatization (butane to butene) is increased by adding an oxidative dehydrogenation catalyst (Ga-Zn-Mg-Mo-O). The formation of methane, ethane, and propane was suppressed due to the removal of hydrogen initially formed as water. Studies of ammonia TPD show that the acidities of [Fe]-ZSM-5 are greatly affected by the existence of metal oxides such as Ga[sub 2]O[sub 3], MgO, ZnO, and MoO[sub 3]. 40 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 145:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 65-72","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1008","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","7185339","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7185339","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","145:1"

As the temperature was increased, all of the peaks shifted to lower wavenumbers and broadened, until at 800[degree]C only a broad asymmetric band remained.

The results demonstrate the importance of weakly adsorbed species at high coverage in controlling surface reactions at elevated pressures and temperatures. 26 refs., 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:49","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12656-12659","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100151a002","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7304936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7304936","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","97:49"

Experiments are conducted with recirculation batch and integral flow reactors. For highly dispersed platinum, the activity decreases in the order zirconia > silica > [gamma]-alumina. Over larger platinum particles, the batch experiments show the same turnover rate on the three supports. On highly dispersed platinum, sulfation, via SO[sub 2] oxidation or H[sub 2]SO[sub 4] exposure, significantly increases the catalytic activity of Pt/[gamma]-alumina, while Pt/silica and Pt/zirconia remain unaffected. Surface acid strength is measured with Hammett indicators. Upon sulfation, the acid strength of zirconia and [gamma]-alumina increases, while no change is observed for silica. Acid strength does not have a major influence on propane-oxidation activity. Within the experimental error, the apparent activation energy for propane oxidation is independent of metal concentration, support material, and sulfation, suggesting that changes in activity are primarily the result of a change in reaction-site density. 29 refs., 9 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 484-494","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1348","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","5154815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5154815","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:2"

By using MgO with surface areas from 49 to 141 m[sup 2]g[sup [minus]1] as supports, and carrying out the incorporation of vanadium starting from vanadyl oxalate or ammonium metavanadate, it has been found that different V species are formed, with V/Mg ratios at the catalyst surface ranging from 0.02 to 0.5. A new preparation procedure which allows a homogeneous dispersion of vanadium along the MgO is presented. The highest activity and selectivity are obtained on catalysts with an Mg-enriched surface in which isolate VO[sub 4] tetrahedra are present. Similar trends for the influence of the V/Mg surface atomic ratio on the selectivity to propene and for the shift of the binding energy (B.E.) of the O1s line, obtained by XPS, are observed. The higher the shift of the B.E. of the O1s line, the higher the selectivity to propene. For this reason, a correlation between the low nucleophilic character of the oxygen and the selectivity for the ODH of alkanes has been tentatively proposed. 34 refs., 13 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 425-438","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: Project MAT 607/91","10.1006/jcat.1993.1343","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5223825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5223825","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:2"

Methanol synthesis was much faster with CO[sub 2]/H[sub 2] than with CO/H[sub 2], particularly at low temperatures. A trace amount of CO[sub 2] improved the rates significantly. Thus it appeared that CO[sub 2] was the primary source of methanol with CO/CO[sub 2]/H[sub 2] feed. When space velocities were varied, both the previously conflicting observations on the effect of CO[sub 2]/CO composition, i.e., monotonical increase in synthesis rate vs the presence of a maximum rate as CO[sub 2] concentration increased, were observed. The different conversion levels and consequent difference in surface oxygen coverage and/or water appeared to be responsible for the different effects. The more oxidized surface state of copper obtained for CO[sub 2]/H[sub 2] was more active and stable in methanol synthesis than the overreduced surface obtained for the CO/H[sub 2] feed. Due to the promotional and inhibition effects of water for CO/H[sub 2] and CO[sub 2]/H[sub 2] feeds, respectively, higher space velocities yielded higher synthesis rates for CO[sub 2]/H[sub 2] and the opposite effect was observed for the CO/H[sub 2]feed. 30 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 414-424","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1342","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5223887","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5223887","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:2"

The driving force for the additional separation is the difference in chemical potential between liquid and vapor feeds with the same composition. This idea of using two feeds with the same composition but different enthalpies (herein called two-enthalpy feed) is applied to stripping and enriching columns and fractional distillation. Two-enthalpy-feed distillation, a new method for using waste heat effectively, should be useful in heat-integrated plants. When an ordinary distillation column has a two-phase feed, the use of two-enthalpy feed increases separation (same N and L/D), or decreases the number of stages (same L/D, x{sub D}, and x{sub B}), or decreases the reflux ratio (same N, x{sub D}, and x{sub B}). The two-enthalpy-feed system has a lower minimum reflux ratio than ordinary distillation with a two-phase feed. For other types of feed, two-enthalpy-feed distillation requires either less energy or energy at a less extreme temperature (i.e., lower temperature for reboilers or higher temperature for condensers) than ordinary distillation. Examples are presented for constant relative volatilities, hydrocarbon systems, and ethanol-water.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3061-3067","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9412%%263","10.1021/ie00024a015","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","142350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/142350","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","12","32"

After dehydration, paramagnetic Mo(V) species are generated and detected by electron spin resonance (ESR) with g[sub e] > g[sub [perpendicular]] > g[sub [parallel]]. A rhombic ESR signal is observed after adsorption of D[sub 2]O, CD[sub 3]OH, and CH[sub 3]OD. Upon O[sub 2] adsorption, the Mo(V) ESR signal intensity decreases and an O[sub 2][sup [minus]] radical is formed. The location and coordination geometry of Mo(V) have been determined by three-pulse electron spin echo modulation data and simulations. For MoH-SAPO-5, Mo(V) is directly coordinated to three D[sub 2]O and two CD[sub 3]OH, but for MoH-SAPO-11, Mo(V) is directly coordinated only to two D[sub 2]O and one CD[sub 3]OH. The coordination distances are longer and the number of coordinated adsorbates is less than for Cu(II)-doped H-SAPO-5 and H-SAPO-11. These differences are consistent with Mo(V) being an oxomolybdenum species, likely (MoO[sub 2])[sup +], in these SAPO materials. 31 refs., 6 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:45","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 11811-11814","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100147a039","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5463192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5463192","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","97:45"

It also shows a characteristic sorption behavior depending on the properties of the adsorbates. Most nonpolar substances such as olefins are adsorbed only on the surface (surface area is less than 10 m[sup 2]/g), while polar compounds such as alcohols, water, pyridines, and ethers mostly penetrate into the bulk to form a pseudo-liquid phase. Thus, some reactions occur only on the surface, whereas others occur in the bulk of the heteropoly acid. A heteropoly compound is highly soluble in some organic solvents. Taking advantage of this property, heteropoly acid can be blended with a polymer to form a porous film by using a common solvent which dissolves both the heteropoly compound and the polymer. Since polymer materials are thermally unstable at high temperatures, their utilization has been restricted within the lower temperature ranges. Therefore, if the heteropoly acid and blended polymer film is used as a catalyst, it must be applied in low-temperature reactions. However, if the heteropoly acid catalyst is well dispersed in the bulk of the film, a high catalytic activity can be expected for certain reactions even at low reaction temperatures. In this study H[sub 3]PMo[sub 12]O[sub 40]-blended polysulfone (abbreviated as PMo-PSF hereafter) film was prepared and its catalytic activity for the ethanol conversion reaction was investigated. 5 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 348-351","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1335","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5131900","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5131900","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:1"

A kinetic and catalytic study led to a rate equation based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.

Altervalent cation doping of metal oxides involves incorporation of foreign cations of valence lower or higher than that of the parent cation into the crystal structure of the parent oxide. As a result of this process, the electron structure (Fermi energy level), acidity/basicity characteristics, and oxygen anion mobility are altered. These parameters are expected to influence catalytic rates of surface reactions, which in turn, control activity and selectivity parameters. It is very desirable then to investigate the intrinsic correlations of the aforementioned parameters with those of catalyst performance, if any exist. Further, this information has to be obtained under experimental conditions similar to those employed for measurements of kinetics parameters. In the case of the OCM reaction this may not be an easy task. The present work aims towards the establishment of a fundamental understanding of what might be the role of lattice oxygen under OCM reaction conditions towards methane activation, and how this is influenced by the dopant concentration in Li[sup +]-doped TiO[sub 2] catalysts.

The hydrogenolysis of the two different kinds of C-C bonds has been distinguished. It is shown that the addition of Mo to Pt drastically changes the selectivity of the reaction, but that this selectivity is approximately the same for all the bimetallic Pt-Mo catalysts. Using a rate equation that had already been used for the hydrogenolysis of alkanes (Maurel, R., Leclercq, G., and Leclercq, L., J. Catal. 44, 68 (1975)), calculation has been made of the values of the equilibrium adsorption constants ([lambda]) and those of the rate constants of the C-C bond splitting steps (k) for the hydrogenolysis of the terminal C-C bonds ([lambda][sub 1] and k[sub 1]) and of the middle C-C bond ([lambda][sub 2] and k[sub 2]). In this way it has been shown that only Pt alone, two different intermediaries with high [lambda] values are formed in which the C-C bonds will be broken further with different selectivities but with low rate constants. On the contrary, on all Pt-Mo catalysts, butane is adsorbed as a single intermediate adsorbed species with a much lower adsorption equilibrium constant than on Pt alone, but this adsorbed species is much more reactive (k[sub 1] and k[sub 2]). The adsorption equilibrium constants are the same for all Pt-Mo taking into account the margin of error, which shows that, on all Pt-Mo, butane is adsorbed on the same mixed Pt-Mo site of constant composition whatever the catalyst's composition. The number of these active sites (proportional to k[sub 1] and k[sub 2]) increases as Mo/(Mo + Pt) increases up to 25-30%, then it decreases. 38 refs., 3 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 118-130","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1318","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5078463","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5078463","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:1"

For high CH[sub 4]-to-oxygen ratios, electrochemical supply of O[sup 2[minus]] causes up to 50-fold increases in the rate of CH[sub 4] consumption with a concomitant decrease in C[sub 2] hydrocarbon selectivity. Electrochemical removal of O[sup [minus]2] causes a decrease in the rate of CH[sub 4] consumption and an increase in C[sub 2] selectivity. Electrochemically supplied oxygen can be significantly more active and selective than gas-phase oxygen. By varying the imposed current and catalyst potential the selectivity to C[sub 2] hydrocarbons is varied reversibly between 25 and 75%. Maximum C[sub 2] hydrocarbon yield was 8%.

Fine-tuning the acidity of ZSM-5 by incorporating boron into the zeolite framework is a goal of this research. From the position of boron in the periodic table, it would be expected that the substitution of aluminum with boron in the framework of pentasil zeolites would weaken the acidic strength of the zeolites. Ammonia, 1-butene, and ethylene have been used as probe molecules to study the acidic sites of zeolites. These results show that three types of acidic sites are present on boron-containing zeolites, i.e., one inactive for reactions of 1-butene, another active for dimerization of 1-butene, and a final one responsible for isomerization of butene. Framework aluminum plays an important role in adsorption of butene or ethylene molecules on boron/aluminium ZSM-5. Butene or ethylene adsorption appears to be nonlinear with the number of acidic sites, and aluminum appears to activate the adsorption of butene or ethylene on boron acidic sites. 20 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 285-295","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1330","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5041561","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5041561","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:1"

The lower loading samples were found to be more selective for oxidative dehydrogenation. At 520[degrees]C, with a feed of He/O[sub 2]C[sub 4]H[sub 10] = 88/8/4 at a total flow rate of 100 ml/min, the total dehydrogenation selectivity on the 0.58 wt% V sample was 65 and 50% at butane conversions of 5 and 20%, respectively, whereas they were 42 and 5% on the 6.4 and 50% at butane conversions of 5 and 20%, respectively, whereas they were 42 and 5% on the 6.4 wt% V samples. The activation energies for the oxidation of butane were about 110 kJ/mol for the lower loading samples and 164 kJ/mol for the higher loading samples. At 520[degrees]C, the activity per vanadium was comparable for the different samples. Laser Raman spectra of fresh catalysts indicated that only a well-dispersed vanadia species existed on the 0.58 wt% V sample, while crystalline V[sub 2]O[sub 5] was also formed on the 6.4 wt% V samples. The ratio of well-dispersed to crystalline vanadia species on the fresh catalysts was higher for the Cabosil silica-supported sample than the Davison silica-supported sample. After reaction, the spectra of the 0.58 wt% V samples did not indicate any changes. However, significantly more crystalline V[sub 2]O[sub 5] was found on the 6.4 wt% V samples on both silica supports, indicating that aggregation of vanadia had occurred during reaction. The higher total dehydrogenation selectivity on the 0.58 wt% V samples was attributed to the presence of the well-dispersed vanadia, while the presence of crystalline V[sub 2]O[sub 5] species on the higher loading samples contributed to the production of total oxidation products. 40 refs., 6 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 144:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 202-213","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1324","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","5041631","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5041631","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","144:1"

These alcohols adsorb on the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] support of Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] and dehydrogenate by reverse spillover to the Ni surface. Thus, the presence of Ni dramatically increases their decomposition rates. Methanol adsorbed on Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] alone decomposes to form (CH[sub 3])[sub 2]O at lower temperature and CO, H[sub 2], and CO[sub 2] above 600 K. On Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3], most CH[sub 3]OH dehydrogenates to form CO and H[sub 2].

On Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3], C[sub 2]H[sub 5]OH dehydrogenation to CO, H[sub 2], and surface carbon is the main reaction. 1-Propanol decomposes on Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] to form C[sub 3]H[sub 6], H[sub 2], (C[sub 3]H[sub 7])[sub 2]O, and C[sub 3]H[sub 6]O.

On Al[sub 2]O[sub 3], the alcohols decomposition rates are in the order 1-C[sub 3]H[sub 7]OH > C[sub 2]H[sub 5]OH > CH[sub 3]OH, but on Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] the rates are almost identical. The increase in the decomposition rate of alcohols, when Ni is present, is attributed to alcohol diffusion along the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] surface and decomposition on the Ni surface or at the Ni-Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] interface.

The catalyst is remarkably robust, as indicated by the [sup 1]H NMR and UV-vis spectra of the reaction mixture during the catalytic reaction and by its ability to maintain its turnover efficiency with subsequent additions of oxidant. The catalytic mechanism for TBHP utilization was explored by observing the effects of varying the tripodal ligands on the ([mu]-oxo)([mu]-carboxylato)diferric catalysts and varying the bridge on Fe[sub 2]O(TPA)[sub 2] catalysts. The (A + K)/P ratio increased as the ligands became more electron donating. Solvent also played an important role in determining the partitioning of products between A + K and P, with benzonitrile favoring hydroxylated products at the expense of P and pyridine having the opposite effect. 49 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 115:21","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9524-9530","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT; CNN: GM-38767; GM-13343","10.1021/ja00074a017","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","5188981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5188981","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","115:21"

Also, deactivated bimetallic Co-Ru catalysts can be regenerated by a hydrogen treatment at reaction temperatures whereas monometallic Co catalysts cannot. On Co/TiO[sub 2], Ru addition increases turnover rates by a factor of three and C[sub 5]+ selectivities from 84.5 to 91.1%, without an apparent change in cobalt dispersion. Activation energies and reaction kinetics are unaffected by Ru addition. These data suggest that the presence of Ru leads to higher Co site density during reaction without modifying the chemical reactivity of exposed Co surface atoms. Ru appears to inhibit the deactivation of surface Co ensembles. Ru atoms at the surface of Co crystallites increase the rate of removal of carbon and oxygen species during reaction and during regeneration of deactivated Co catalysts. The resulting higher Co site density leads to higher apparent turnover rates and to enhanced readsorption of [alpha]-olefins. As a result, Co-Ru catalysts yield a heavier and more paraffinic product than monometallic Co catalysts with similar initial dispersion. The observed bimetallic interactions require intimate contact between Co and Ru, a state that forms during oxidation of the bimetallic precursors at high temperature. This treatment induces migration of Ru oxide species and leads to mixed Co-Ru oxides. The reducibility and the carbon deposition rates on well-mixed bimetallic Co-Ru catalysts are very different from those of monometallic Co catalysts. Electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric studies confirm the intimate mixing required for catalytic rate and C[sub 5]+ selectivity enhancements, for faster reduction of Co oxide precursor, and for inhibition of carbon deposits during reactions of H[sub 2]/CO mixtures. 40 refs., 14 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 345-368","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1281","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5154898","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5154898","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:2"

Three different Cu[sub 2]O surfaces were examined: A Cu[sup +]-terminated (100) surface, an oxygen-terminated (100) surface, and a (111) surface with accessible copper cations and lattice oxygen. Selective oxidation to acrolein is promoted by coordinately unsaturated surface lattice oxygen. No clear correlation between the formation of partial oxidation products and oxygen coordination was observed. Both selective and nonselective oxidation products are formed from lattice oxygen. The propene oxidation pathway proceeds through an allyloxy (CH[sub 2][double bond]CHCH[sub 2]O-) species where oxygen insertion occurs prior to the second hydrogen abstraction over Cu[sub 2]O. This conclusion was reached by comparing the propene TDS results from atmospheric pressure exposures with UHV allyl alcohol and acrolein thermal desorption data. The selective oxidation process over Cu[sub 2]O is subject to a [open quotes]pressure gap[close quotes] at 300 K with oxygen insertion occurring at higher pressures, presumably because of translational and collisional activation. However, the subsequent steps in the selective oxidation pathway can be effectively modeled by dissociative adsorption of oxygenates under UHV to simulate the oxygenated surface intermediates. 34 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 464-480","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1290","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5183221","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5183221","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:2"

In particular, it is shown that vanadium localized initially in the secondary structure can exchange with the molybdenum atoms of the oxoanion during the catalytic reaction. Introduction of vanadium in the molybdophosphoric acid structure enhances the selective formation of maleic anhydride from the butadiene when vanadium is present both inside the oxoanion or localized in the secondary structure (before the catalytic tests), but the maximum in catalytic performance is found for different amounts of vanadium, depending on where the vanadium is localized initially. However, when present in the secondary structure, vanadium also has a negative influence on the activity of the heteropoly acid. On the contrary, in n-butane oxidation, the presence of vanadium enhances the rate of alkane activation due to the different rate-determining step. The presence of V ions also affects the maximum selectivity and yield to maleic anhydride from butane. V ions in the secondary structure are more selective at low conversion, while V ions inside the oxoanion are more selective at higher conversions and thus allow better maximum yields to maleic anhydride. 40 refs., 11 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 325-344","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1280","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5223959","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5223959","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:2"

The results show that alcohols adsorb associatively on NiO(100) at 90 K and reversibly desorb upon heating under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Both methanol and ethanol are bonded to the cation sites of NiO(100) via their oxygen atom with the methyl and ethyl group, respectively, directed away from the surface. At low coverages, there is a repulsive interaction between adsorbed alcohols, resulting in a decrease in the apparent activation energy of desorption. Below monolayer coverages, the change in the relative mode intensities in the HREELS spectra with respect to the methanol coverage correlates excellently with two desorption states evident in the TPD studies, indicating reorientation of a portion of the adsorbed methanol at high coverages. In the case of ethanol adsorbed on NiO(100), however, only a single desorption state above 200 K is observed, consistent with the HREELS data which show that the relative mode intensities remain essentially unchanged within the monolayer coverage range. 59 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:37","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9425-9433","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100139a029","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5463178","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5463178","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","97:37"

This reaction proceeds via a very complex network and requires medium-high temperatures (550 < T[sub R] < 650[degrees]C) to attain detectable rates. The unique features of the SiO[sub 2] surface in catalysing the formation of partial oxidation products have been largely documented, while the roles played by MoO[sub 3], V[sub 2]O[sub 5], Nb[sub 2]O[sub 5], WO[sub 3], Cr[sub 2]O[sub 3], and other oxides on the reactivity of the SiO[sub 2] and the nature of the active centers are still topics of debate. A number of papers have particularly addressed the importance of the reaction system and the contribution of the gas phase and/or wall reaction in getting valid and comparable reactivity data. Indeed, given the constraints of the conversion-selectivity relationship, a suitable reactor device must exploit a differential methane conversion level per pass as to ensure high selectivity to HCHO providing also finite conversion values for a reliable kinetic analysis of the data. In this note, the authors present the potentiality of the temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) method in evaluating the activity of the MPO catalysts. A preliminary comparative analysis of the catalytic performances of bare SiO[sub 2] and various silica supported oxide (MoO[sub 3], V[sub 2]O[sub 5], Nb[sub 2]O[sub 5]) catalysts is reported.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 299-303","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5645987","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5645987","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:1"

At present the dry reforming reaction takes place at high temperatures (>973 K) and little is known about the mechanism. The reverse reaction, which we call dry methanation, is simpler and operates at lower temperatures. The authors decided to investigate the methanation reactions in order to gain information about the reverse reactions and, in particular, dry reforming. Hydrogenation of CO[sub 2] was also investigated, so that CO and CO[sub 2] could be compared for their respective methanation capabilities. Further Rh shows unique properties for CO hydrogenation when promoted with certain metal oxides for ethanol under such circumstances, this area of work having been recently reviewed.

The effects of reactor diameter, recycle flow rate, catalyst weight, and methane-to-oxygen ratio on the catalyst activity have been outlined. By performing several blank tests with an empty and a quartz-filled reactor, it has been demonstrated that the gas-phase reaction does not affect the catalytic pathways. Reasons for controversial results reported previously are discussed. They lie in the lack of an adequate experimental approach and in the generally adopted rule to evaluate the catalytic activity at differential conditions in order to push the HCHO selectivity to high values. The approach presented here allows one to evaluate the catalytic activity by performing tests at quasi-zero conversion per mass but at a finite extent of conversion. The need to express the catalytic activity as space time yield (STY) to HCHO (g[center dot]kg[sub cat][sup [minus]1][center dot]h[sup [minus]1]) is presented. The reactivities of various commercial SiO[sub 2] samples obtained by precipitation, sol-gel, and pyrolysis methods have been determined. The fact that the nature and source of silica has a marked effect on STY, previously observed for reaction at 520[degrees]C, has been confirmed for operation at 550-650[degrees]C. Highest STYs are found with precipitated silica samples. In fact, at 650[degrees]C with such precipitated SiO[sub 2] a STY to HCHO of 303 g[center dot] kg[sub cat][sup [minus]1] [center dot] H[sup [minus]1] has been obtained. Incorporation of molybdena depresses the STY value for the precipitated silica but enhances the STY of bare fumed silica. In contrast, addition of vanadia to either precipitated or fumed silicas leads to higher STY values. 29 refs., 6 figs., 8 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 262-274","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1271","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","5771923","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5771923","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:1"

Change of neither dispersion, particle size, nor particle shape by the high-temperature treatment leading to the enhancement was observed. A strong particle-size dependence of reaction rate for hydrogenation of ethene on Pd/SiO[sub 2] was observed after the catalyst had received the high-temperature treatment, while after low-temperature pretreatment, no dependence of the rate on particle size was observed. Adsorbed CO on the high-temperature treated Rh samples showed much different vibrational spectra from those for the low-temperature treated samples.

The nature and distribution of catalyst surface species were characterized by XPS and ISS spectroscopic techniques, which indicated that there is no direct correlation between support basicity and oxidative coupling activity. However, catalysts containing sufficiently high Ba loadings are more easily poisoned by carbon dioxide than those with low Ba contents, due to increased stability of a BaCO[sub 3] phase. With supports of low basicity, or when the Ba is uniformly distributed on the catalyst support, the susceptibility to carbon dioxide poisoning is minimized. XPS characterization of the Ba/MgO catalysts confirmed that oxidative coupling activity is directly related to the capability of the catalyst to form surface O[sub 2][sup 2[minus]] ions existing in a BaO[sub 2] phase that is sustained under reaction conditions by the presence of molecular O[sub 2].

The nature of this activating pretreatment dramatically modifies both the activity and the selectivity of the catalyst. Reductive pretreatments lead either to inactive, or to active but poorly selective, catalysts (Mo metal on the surface or pure Mo carbide), whereas oxidative treatments first inhibits the hydrogenolysis reaction present on oxygen-free molybdenum carbide, and second, enhances the isomerization rate of the catalyst. The branched molecules isomerize to give mostly acyclic isomers. No deactivation is observed with time on stream during isomerization of the branched molecules. The rate of hydrogenolysis of methylcyclopentane and cyclopentane is about four times lower than the rate obtained with branched molecules, and the catalyst is strongly deactivated. This phenomenon is attributed to the formation of highly dehydrogenated polyaromatics, and to the formation of CH[sub 4], by demethylation of methylcyclopentane, which can irreversibly reduce the oxicarbide phase. The deactivated catalyst can easily be regenerated by a short oxidative treatment at 350[degrees]C. The results, in terms of both activity and isomer selectivity, obtained for n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, and 3-methylpentane isomerization are attributed to a bond-shift mechanism involving a metallocyclobutane ring intermediate which would take place on an oxicarbide phase. 23 refs., 1 fig., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 249-261","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1270","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5738227","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5738227","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:1"

At a WHSV of 20 h[sup [minus]1], an initial conversion level of 96% was achieved with combined C[sub 2]H[sub 4], C[sub 3]H[sub 6], and C[sub 4]H[sub 8] selectivities of about 80%. During the useful life of the catalyst the C[sub 3]H[sub 6] selectivity was 50-60%. The percent conversion decreased to 50% over a period of 20 h, but the catalyst could be regenerated by heating in flowing air. As the catalyst deactivated, the C[sub 3]H[sub 6] selectivity increased slightly and the C[sub 2]H[sub 4] selectivity decreased. Catalytic and spectroscopic results confirm that phosphorus, derived from trimethylphosphine, was responsible for a decrease in the strong Broensted acidity in the zeolite. For example, the phosphorus-modified zeolite was inactive for n-hexane cracking at 350[degrees]C, and the protonated amount of pyridine, added to the zeolite as a probe for acidity, decreased significantly. The catalyst, however, had sufficient acidity to crack hexene or octene at 500[degrees]C to propylene and ethylene in ratios that were very similar to those detected during the conversion of CH[sub 3]Cl. Without the strong Broensted acidity the PMg-ZSM-5 zeolite apparently is unable to convert the light olefins to paraffins and aromatics. A mechanism is proposed in which magnesium cations activate CH[sub 3]Cl to form HCl and a carbene intermediate. The latter is believed to be responsible for C-C bond formation via reaction with a surface methoxide species. Ethylene probably is the primary hydrocarbon, but it oligomerizes to a higher molecular weight olefin which cracks back to ethylene and propylene. 22 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 32-44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1251","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","5548126","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5548126","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:1"

Both chlorine-free and residual-chlorine-containing catalysts were studied, the latter being prepared from platinum (IV) chloride. Both types of catalyst are of negligible sulphur content (<2ppm). Comparison of hydrogen chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy results for both [open quotes]chlorine-free[close quotes] and chlorine-containing Pt/MgO catalysts showed that (i) chemisorption capacity was substantially as expected from TEM-derived particle size following a reduction temperature of 593 K (LTR), and (ii) chemisorption was depressed to 40% or less of expectation when a reduction temperature of 753 K (HTR) was used. Reactions of saturated hydrocarbons in a flow of hydrogen (p[sub hydrocarbon] = 8-16 Torr, balance to 760 Torr hydrogen) showed hydrogenolysis to be a prominent reaction. With LTR chlorine-free catalysts, hydrogenolysis of n-pentane was almost exclusively by central scission. The chlorine-containing HTR catalyst yielded largely terminal scission. HTR chlorine-free catalysts and LTR chlorine-containing catalysts gave an intermediate behavior. Thus, both higher reduction temperature and presence of chlorine act to move scission of the C-C chain from the center to the ends. Hydrogenolysis of neohexane showed increased direct demethanation to give n-butane with the presence of chlorine in the catalyst. Ring scission of methylcyclopentane depressed hydrogen chemisorption and the carbanionic reactivity in these cracking reactions are interpreted in terms of a moderately strong metal-support interaction with a shift of negative charge from the magnesia O[sup 2[minus]] ions to the platinum. This interaction is increased by the presence of chlorine in the catalysts. 40 refs., 4 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 143:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 122-137","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1259","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","5548180","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5548180","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","143:1"

The experiment involves measurements of flame temperature, flame position and evaporation rate of the liquid pool, observations of the recirculation zone and the soot layer, and identification of flame extinction. A finite-volume method is employed to numerically solve the corresponding transport equations. Calculated results show that in the vicinity of the liquid surface, both convection and diffusion transports are weakened by the flow rotation, resulting in the suppression of the evaporation strength of liquid; the recirculation zone can be identified and compared with experimental observation. For the steady burning of an ethanol pool in a swirling air jet, it is found that as the angular velocity increases, the diffusion flame shifts closer to the upper burner, has a larger flame thickness, experiences a smaller flame stretch, but suffers from the reduction of mass diffusion of ethanol vapor to the flame. However, the evaporation rate of ethanol is usually decreased with increasing angular velocity. In the flame extinction experiment, the critical volumetric oxygen concentration at extinction first decreases to a minimum value and then increases with angular velocity. It is generally concluded that flow rotation reduces the rates of both droplet combustion and evaporation.","","","","","","United States","1993-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 115:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 175-182","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738; CODEN: JERTD2","10.1115/1.2905990","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","5524938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5524938","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology; (United States)","","115:3"

In the case of isobutylene, this has happened because of the dramatic increase in demand for methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), the transportation fuel oxygenate additive that has isobutylene as half the molecule. The driver for new propylene capacity, however, is different. Propylene is a major co-product from steam crackers and the economics of the process are highly dependent on the supply-demand situation for both propylene and ethylene. In some geographic areas, propylene demand is increasing faster than ethylene demand. In this situation it does not pay to add cracking capacity to produce both products, but rather to make only propylene. Thus the interest in propane dehydrogenation.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: CHEMTECH; (United States); Journal Volume: 23:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 35-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2703; CODEN: CHTEDD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5754552","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5754552","","CHEMTECH; (United States)","","23:8"

Many papers exist on the preparation of catalysts and the mechanism of the reaction. In the MOC reaction, methane is supposed to be activated through abstraction of an H atom from CH[sub 4] by an active oxygen species. Lunsford and his co-workers detected (Li[sup +]O[sup [minus]]) centers in an Li/MgO catalyst by ESR and proposed that O[sup [minus]] species were responsible for the activation of methane over Li/MgO. For TiO[sub 2]-based catalysts, when TiO[sub 2] alone was used as a catalyst, whether as anatase or rutile, little or no coupling activity was observed. However, the addition of Li drastically improved the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons, with optimum effectiveness at 10 wt% or 16.2 wt% Li. At selected conditions, the selectivity to C2 hydrocarbons and the conversion of methane reached 75.3 and 13.5%, respectively, for a 10-wt% Li/TiO[sub 2] catalyst. Therefore, it is interesting to study the role of Li and other promoters in the MOC reaction. In this paper the authors report the results of a dynamic ESR study for O[sub 2] chemisorption on model TiO[sub 2]-based catalysts to elucidate the active species which exist on the surface of catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 142:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 719-724","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1244","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","5649741","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5649741","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","142:2"

The pure bismuth, iron, and cobalt molybdates and mixed cobalt and iron molybdates (solid solutions) have been prepared and individually tested as catalysts. Mechanical mixtures of these phases have been prepared and tested as catalysts. All the catalysts have been characterized before and after the catalytic reaction by several techniques such as ESR, XPS, EDX-STEM, TEM, XRD, and Moessbauer and UV spectroscopies. The synergy effect observed is tentatively explained as due to the deposition on the large bismuth molybdate particles of smaller mixed iron and cobalt molybdate particles with spreading of the bismuth molybdate over the latter particles. It is proposed that the Fe[sub x]Co[sub 1-x]MoO[sub 4] phase plays the role of the fast electron conducting material which enhances the electron mobility and the efficiency of the redox mechanism, the active and selective phase being the overlying bismuth molybdate compounds. 27 refs., 5 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 142:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 381-391","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1216","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5601923","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5601923","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","142:2"

Two types of active surface sites were found: one responsible for single exchange between gas phase oxygen and lattice oxygen and the other responsible for multiple exchange between gas phase oxygen and lattice oxygen. The multiple exchange reaction takes place at lower temperature than the single exchange reaction. The number of active sites responsible for multiple exchange of oxygen is only a fraction (<20%) of that responsible for single exchange. The amount of lattice oxygen exchanged by gas-phase oxygen depends on both the nature of the catalyst and exchange temperature.

In particular, the possible roles of CO as a reaction intermediate or as a catalyst, via the formation of ketene, are evaluated. Experiments using [sup 13]CH[sub 3]OH/[sup 12]CO reactant mixtures demonstrate that no CO is incorporated into ethene, the primary product of this reaction.

Model experiments for the methylation of ketene by reaction with Me[sub 2]SO[sub 4] and Me[sub 3]O[sup +]SbCl[sub 6][sup [minus]] did not provide evidence for methylation of ketene on either of the C atoms, and from the products observed it is apparent that ketene acts only as an acylating agent in the normal way.

Preferential deposition of promoter metal submonolayers on Pt was observed at moderate surface coverages ([theta][sub M]<0.5-0.8). Some bulk metal crystallite formation as [open quotes]bridges[close quotes] between small Pt particles covered partially with promoter was also observed on alumina-supported Bi/Pt and Pb/Pt catalysts. Measurement of the electrochemical potential of the catalyst slurry during the oxidation of 1-methoxy-2-propanol to methoxyacetone and the cyclic voltammetric polarization of the bimetallic catalysts revealed that the catalysts are in an oxidized state during reaction. The following order of promoting influence was observed: Bi > Pb [approximately] Sn > Au [approximately] Ru. Two major effects of promoters are suggested: (i) they suppress the initial irreversible adsorption of the reactant alcohol on Pt which results in self-poisoning, and (ii) they form new active centers that adsorb the oxidizing species (OH) better than Pt. A formal rate equation is suggested (r = f [center dot] [theta][sub org] [center dot] [theta][sub OH]) which explains the optimum in promoter/platinum ratio. The different influences of the promoters are explained by their hydrogen and oxygen sorption characteristics and by the surface geometry of the bimetallic catalysts. 51 refs., 12 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 142:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 237-253","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1204","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5713757","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5713757","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","142:1"

The pyridine adsorption experiments showed an increase in the number of acid sites as well as in the acid strength with increasing metal loading. The catalytic measurements showed a related increase in the rate of isomerization as the %Mo is increased. The cis/trans ratios decreased with increasing molybdenum loading, suggesting an increase in the acid strength of the remaining alumina hydroxyl groups. The results suggest a Broensted acid mechanism for the isomerization reaction over catalysts with molybdenum loading [ge] 3.9% Mo. The 1.0% molybdena-alumina catalyst behaved totally different. The results suggest a [pi]-allylic mechanism operative on the unperturbed alumina surface. The rate of formation of ethylene and propylene (products of metathesis) increased dramatically with increasing molybdenum loading.

The surface reaction model for Pt is in good agreement with previously reported low-pressure (0.1 to 1 torr) reactor measurements of CH[sub 4] oxidation rates at temperatures from 600 to 1,500 K and of OH radical desorption during CH[sub 4] oxidation at 1,300 to 1,600 K over polycrystalline Pt foils. The model predictions for both catalysts are also consistent with product selectivities observed over monolithic catalysts in an atmospheric-pressure laboratory-scale reactor, and the differences between Pt and Rh can be explained by comparing individual reaction steps on these surfaces. Because of the good agreement between the model and both low- and atmospheric-pressure reactor simulations, a complete energy diagram for methane oxidation at low coverages is proposed. The model results show that under CH[sub 4]-rich conditions at high temperatures, H[sub 2] and CO are primary products of the direct oxidation of methane via a pyrolysis mechanism.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 39:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1164-1177","","","FG02-88ER13878","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; CODEN: AICEAC","10.1002/aic.690390708","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5826236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5826236","","AIChE Journal (American Institute of Chemical Engineers); (United States)","","39:7"

When the reaction was run under conditions of low, differential conversion (where the structures of the substituted Keggin ions were shown to remain largely intact), the turnover frequency per vanadium for the production of formaldehyde increased by less than a factor of 2 as the size of the exposed vanadium ensembles increased form V[sub 1] to V[sub z]. Thus, the reaction appears to be independent of the adjacency of vanadium ions. The rate of the principal competing reaction, dehydration of methanol to make dimethyl ether, was found to depend sensitively on surface charge density: it decreased exponentially as the anion charge was made more negative either by replacing P with Si or by replacing W with V. The latter substitution provided a way to prepare catalysts whose activity and selectivity could be increased together. 60 refs., 17 figs., 8 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 142:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-17","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1184","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5839571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5839571","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","142:1"

Thus, except at very low CH[sub 4] partial pressures, the rate-limiting step is oxygen incorporation, rather than the activation of CH[sub 4] at the surface. Carbon dioxide is a poison for the production of CH[sub 3][center dot]radicals and for the conversion of CH[sub 4]. By extrapolation of the rate data, the rate of CH[sub 4] reaction over the unpoisoned catalyst was determined, and the rate was shown to be first order with respect to N[sub 2]O. A kinetic model, based on competitive surface reactions, in addition to gas-phase reactions, adequately accounts for the conversion as a function of reagent concentrations and temperature, as well as the selectivity for ethane and ethylene. At comparable levels of conversion O[sub 2] is a less selective oxidant than N[sub 2]O, not because of more gas-phase oxidation, but because of surface reactions involving reactive oxygen species. The presence of CH[sub 4] significantly inhibits the decomposition of N[sub 2]O over the catalyst. It is suggested that CH[sub 4] and N[sub 2]O are activated by a common intermediate (e.g., O[sup [minus]][sub s]ions) and that CH[sub 4] reacts more rapidly with this species. 24 refs., 6 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 142:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 325-336","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: CHE-9005808","10.1006/jcat.1993.1211","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5835423","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5835423","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","142:1"

In addition to isotopic labeling studies, these catalysts have also been examined under steady-state reaction conditions to assess the effect of the concentration of gas-phase oxygen. Results of the characterization and reaction studies suggest that the production of HCHO proceeds via utilization of lattice oxygen through the Mo[double bond]O sites.

First it is more complicated than it appears initially, involving a reaction that is not immediately obvious and is, therefore, more challenging for students to understand. Second, the platinum illustrates the phenomenon of exothermic reactions in a distinctive and memorable way. Because the platinum foil has to be heated before the reactions will proceed, this demonstration also is a perfect example of the temperature dependence of [Delta]G in determining the spontaneity of a reaction.

Water oxide (H[sub 2]O-O) is employed as a model singlet oxygen atom donor. Molecular orbital calculations with the 6-31G basis set at the MP2, QCISD, QCISD(T), CASSCF, and MRCI levels of theory suggest that oxygen insertion by water oxide occurs by the interaction of an electrophilic oxygen atom with a doubly occupied hydrocarbon fragment orbital. The electrophilic oxygen approaches the hydrocarbon along the axis of the atomic carbon p orbital comprising a [pi]-[sub CH(2)] or [pi]-[sub CHCH(3)] fragment orbital to form a carbon-oxygen [sigma] bond. A concerted hydrogen migration to an adjacent oxygen lone pair of electrons affords the alcohol insertion product in a stereoselective fashion with predictable stereochemistry. Subsequent oxidation of the alcohol to a ketone (or aldehyde) occurs in a similar fashion and has a lower activation barrier. The calculated (MP4/6-31G*//MP2/6-31G*) activation barriers for oxygen atom insertion into the C-H bonds of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and methanol are 10.7, 8.2, 3.9, 4.8, 4.5, and 3.3 kcal/mol, respectively. We use ab initio molecular orbital calculations in support of a frontier MO theory that provides a unique rationale for both the stereospecificity and the stereoselectivity of insertion of electrophilic oxygen and related electrophiles into the carbon-hydrogen bond. 13 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 115:13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 5768-5775","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT; CNN: CA 47348-03; 900707","10.1021/ja00066a049","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","5748006","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5748006","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","115:13"

For example, methyl iodide is converted to ethylene on CsX zeolite at ca. 500 K. The order of reactivity of various catalyst/adsorbate combinations is consistent with the predictions of elementary chemical principles. The order of reactivity of the methyl halides follows the expected leaving-group trend. The activity of the catalyst framework correlates with its basicity (or nucleophilicity). All reactions were performed in a batch mode in sealed magic angle spinning (MAS) rotors while the contents were continuously monitored by in situ [sup 13]C NMR. Methyl iodide reacts on CsX below room temperature to form a framework-bound methoxy species in high yield. An analogous ethoxy species readily formed from ethyliodide. These species were characterized in detail. The ethoxy species was quantitatively converted to ethylene below 500 K. [sup 133]Cs MAS NMR was used to characterize the interactions of methyl iodide and other adsorbates with the cation in zeolite CsZSM-5. Solvation of the alkali metal cation was reflected in large, loading-dependent chemical shifts for [sup 133]Cs. Interactions between the cation and adsorbates were also reflected in the [sup 13]C shifts of the alkyl halides and ethylene. The cumulative evidence suggests a mechanism for carbon-carbon bond formation analogous to one proposed by Chang and co-workers for methanol-to-gasoline chemistry on acidic zeolites (J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun, 1987, 1320) that involves framework-bound methoxy and ethoxy species. The mechanism for methyl halide conversion is proposed to include roles for the basicity of the zeolite framework as well as the Lewis acidity of the cation. 68 refs., 18 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 115:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4732-4741","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT; CNN: CHE 89-18741","10.1021/ja00064a037","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","6311023","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6311023","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","115:11"

The performance of the resulting catalysts is found to strongly depend on the nature of the alkali metal compounds forming the pair, the promoter contents, and the appropriate reaction conditions (temperature, pseudo-contact time, etc.). In addition, the choice of a proper MgO offers a considerable effect in improving the overall performance of the resulting catalysts. The most effective catalytic systems are MgO promoted with the bialkali metal compounds of LiA + NaA(A = Cl[sup -], OH[sup -], Ac[sup -], CO[sub 3][sup 2-], or NO[sub 3][sup -]), LiA + CsA, or NaA + CsA containing total loadings of alkali metal compounds of 10 or 20 mol% with equal molar loading from both compounds. An appreciable C[sub 2] yield as high as 19.8% was obtained at a methane conversion of 23.8 mol% over (10 mol% NaCl + 10 mol% CsCl)/MgO. Moreover, the methane conversion and the total C[sub 2] selectivity, after a slight initial decrease, remain almost unchanged for a period of 60 h. In contrast, the maximum C[sub 2] yield over any monoalkali-promoted system never exceeded 5.5% under the same conditions and their stability with time-on-stream was not as prominent. The relatively high performances of the bialkali-metal-compound-promoted MgO compared to those of the respective monoalkali-promoted systems are likely to be related to the synergistic increase in the surface basicity (superbasicity) caused by the enrichment of the surface with the alkali. The presence of a second alkali noticeably enhances the enrichment. The relationship between the catalytic performances and the physicochemical characteristics of the catalysts revealed by XRD, XPS, and basicity measurements. 37 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 141:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 628-647","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1169","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5989682","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5989682","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","141:2"

A band due to linearly adsorbed CO, which shifted to lower wavenumbers with increasing temperature and was both shifted and weakened with increasing time, was influenced by the dissociative adsorption of CO, structural reorganisation and sintering of Ru, and the build-up of surface hydrocarbon in situ during reaction.

Three types of surface hydrocarbon were present in situ during reaction: these were ethoxy groups on the silica support, probably derived from reaction of ethene with silanol groups, methylene chains (with methyl end groups) possibly bonded to Ru via a single CH[sub 2] end group, and CH[sub 2] groups specifically bonded to Ru.

The infrared results support the proposal that hydrocarbonaceous species may be further hydrogenated on the Ru surface to give methane. 29 refs., 8 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 141:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 355-367","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1146","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6216237","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6216237","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","141:2"

Most of them relate to the inhibitory effect of water then present in high excess. For example, it has been reported that the autoxidation of different alkylbenzenes and [alpha]-phenylcarbinols is entirely prevented by an excess of water. On the other hand, it has also been stated that, of the polar molecules, water is able to form H-bonds with inhibitors such as phenols and aromatic amines; the inhibiting group is then blocked and the H-bonded inhibitor molecules do not react with the peroxy radicals. The inhibitory activity is therefore diminished, and the overall rate of the inhibited reaction will be increased by the presence of water. No references are in the literature with respect to real catalysis by water in the liquid-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons in the absence of metal ions. In the presence of metal ions, however, water may exert a rate-influencing effect, but this is always connected with the formation of aquo and hydroxo complexes, i.e., the catalytic species is modified. In this paper, the authors present examples to show that water is a real catalyst when applied in small quantities during the oxidation of hydrocarbons with dioxygen. 8 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 141:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 721-724","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1176","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","6215737","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6215737","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","141:2"

At this temperature, the amount of phyllosilicates which depends on the drying time, can reach 20% of the overall Ni. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of impregnated nickel exhibit three peaks of hydrogen consumption at 300, 380, and about 500[degrees]C, attributed to the decomposition of nickel nitrate or basic nitrate into NiO, the reduction of NiO, and the reduction of 1:1 nickel phyllosilicates, respectively. The last peak corresponds to the reduction of 20% of the overall Ni content regardless of the Ni loading and the conditions of drying at 25 or 90[degrees]C. This fixed percentage proves that phyllosilicate may be still formed at the beginning of the TPR. After TPR up to 700[degrees]C, the nickel is totally reduced and the metal nickel particles have a constant average size of about 65 A while the concentration of particles per surface unit increases with the Ni loading. Before complete reduction, the nickel phyllosilicates are probably located at the interface between silica and the remaining nickel, for which they act as anchoring sites. During TPR, after nitrate decomposition, the NiO particles located on the phyllosilicates are reduced into Ni[sup O] at 400[degrees]C without any migration. Between 400 and 700[degrees]C, the increase in metal particle size is due not only to the reduction of the phyllosilicates but also to Ni[sup 0] migration induced by thermal effect and probably also by the weakening of the anchoring strength because of the reduction of phyllosilicates. 47 refs., 8 figs., 12 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 97:21","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 5703-5712","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHAX","10.1021/j100123a040","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6045895","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6045895","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","97:21"

We were able to effect reaction, under UHV conditions, by exposing gas-phase atomic hydrogen, rather than molecular hydrogen, to a Ru(001) surface that is saturated with CO. By virtue of the bond dissociation energy, atomic hydrogen corresponds to a state of much higher chemical potential and, consequently, to a state of higher reactivity. The UHV chamber in which the HREELS experiments were performed has been described previously, as have the properties and method of preparation of the saturated CO overlayer, the fractional coverage of which if 0.65.

Comparison of reaction rates with STO site densities showed that the oxidation was taking place on the more coordinatively unsaturated corner atoms on the catalysts. Specific site TOFs were found to be 5.5, 7.9, and 5.0 moles O[sub 2] uptake/mole of site/min for the [sup 3]M[sub 1], [sup 3]M[sub R], and [sup 3]MH sites, respectively. Initial rate data were obtained for reactions run at several 2-propanol concentrations at three separate oxygen pressures. These data were analyzed using the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke method commonly employed in enzyme kinetic determinations. The data obtained showed that oxygen was adsorbed about 200 times more strongly than 2-propanol in these reactions. A maximum rate value of 18 moles O[sub 2] consumed/mole of active site/min was calculated. This value represents the maximum rate for the reaction when it is run under zero-order conditions for both reactants without diffusion limitations. The present data were obtained, however, under first order reaction conditions. Given the difference in reaction conditions, the experimentally determined TOF of 6 min[sup [minus]1] is not an unreasonable value. 49 refs., 9 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 141:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 58-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1118","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6251057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6251057","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","141:1"

Recent investigations in this field employ global kinetic rate expressions to model the chemical reactions occurring in the gas phase. In the present paper a detailed kinetic mechanism is employed to describe the ignition process of dilute methanol sprays in air, the mechanism for methanol comprises 23 species and 168 elementary reactions. The present investigation accounts for unsteady droplet heating and vaporization using a distillation-limit model; temperature dependence of liquid phase properties is included. Effects of varying parameters such as initial gas temperature, initial fuel-vapor concentration, pressure, droplet size in both monodisperse and bidisperse sprays as well as equivalence ratio on both ignition-delay time and on spray lifetime are investigated. It is shown that there is a minimum ignition-delay time in dependence of both equivalence ratio and of initial droplet size for various conditions. Ignition-delay time of a bidisperse spray is dominated by the characteristics of the smaller droplets. There is a two-stage heating for small droplets caused by gas-phase characteristics. Fuel-vapor accumulation leads to delayed ignition and to higher gas temperatures for small droplets. The results of the calculations give profiles of radical concentrations such as OH as well as concentration of pollutants.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (United States); Journal Volume: 93:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 239-254","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMAO","10.1016/0010-2180(93)90106-D","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","6394596","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6394596","","Combustion and Flame; (United States)","","93:3"

The work undertaken consists of a systematic investigation of the effects of reactor tube wall temperature, pressure, feed oxygen concentration, and gas flow rate on methane conversion and methanol yield and selectivity. Methanol yields in the range of 1.5-2.3 mol % and selectivities in the range of 23-47 mol % have been observed, depending on the process parameters used. Increasing the oxygen concentration in the feed is found to decrease methanol selectivity dramatically, while yield exhibits a trade-off between decreasing selectivity and increasing conversion. The influence of pressure is most noticeable between 1.5 and 3.0 MPa, where substantially more methanol is produced at the higher pressure. The effect is less pronounced as the pressure is increased further. The most significant outcome of this study is the recognition of the importance of the interaction of the chemistry of the system and the heat-transfer properties of the reactor system. The system is very sensitive to heat release rate and exhibits a discontinuity in methane conversion, with hysteresis being observed under process conditions employing high feed oxygen concentrations and total gas flow rates. More importantly, highest methanol yields are observed on the downward sweep of reactor wall temperature, reinforcing the concept that the reaction is most sensitive to temperature and that low temperatures favor methanol production.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 780-787","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00017a003","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6358410","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6358410","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:5"

With increasing residence time, the HCN hydrolysis reaction decreases the amount of HCN formed. Experiments also show that the addition of Rh to a Pt-coated support slightly reduces the selectivity of HCN synthesis and that catalytically active supports can adversely affect the reaction selectivity. For the Ostwald process, increasing residence times cause the decomposition reactions of NO and NH[sub 3] to contribute and thus decrease the net NO[sub x] formation. In both HCN synthesis and NH[sub 3] oxidation, turbulent, well-mixed flow improves the product selectivity. Based on these tests, guidelines are presented for the design of an alternative Pt-coated catalyst support which gives competitive selectivities and conversions.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 809-817","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00017a007","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","6355426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6355426","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:5"

A trio of scientific teams charges that atmospheric monitoring suggests reformulated gasoline is not significantly cutting carbon monoxide (CO) levels and could be raising ambient concentrations of such compounds as formaldehyde and nitrogen oxides. The results, presented at last week's meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Denver, come less than a month after heightened public concerns about the health effects of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The scientists reporting at the ACS meeting separately measured air pollution in Denver; Albuquerque, NM; and Brazil-areas that have used oxygenated fuels for several years. The preliminary results, they say, show oxygenates use has little impact on carbon monoxide. And the researchers say they have found relatively high levels of acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and related compounds, including the mutagen peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), in the atmosphere. According to Daniel Grosjean, of environmental research firm DGA (Ventura, Ca), measured levels of acetaldehyde in three Brazilian cities - which began using ethanol fuels in the late 1970s - appear to be among the highest in the world. The findings could cast serious doubts on the ambitious U.S. oxygenates program, which is increasingly requiring cities to use reformulated fuels. In 1988, Denver became the first U.S. city which mandated oxygenated fuels requirements. The region now uses oxygenates-mainly MTBE-for four months each year. But, says Larry G. Anderson, a chemist at the University of Colorado (Denver), we have seen no statistical effect on CO in the air. He points to a predicted 15%-20% drop in ambient CO by 1993. There is considerable evidence formaldehyde increased, Anderson says.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; (United States); Journal Volume: 152:13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-272X; CODEN: CHWKA9","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6390946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6390946","","Chemical Week; (United States)","","152:13"

This chemical can be catalytically dissociated, giving hot (about 700[degree]C) steam-gas products (mostly ammonia) under more than 700 bar (10,150 psi) pressure. Because of its physical characteristics, hydrazine hydrateis especially suitable for use in underwater devices. The power pack was tested successfully March 10-14, 1993 in the eastern mid-Atlantic. The device was installed on a specially designed natural environment frame (NEF) with autonomous buoyancy control, several measuring sensors, and a recording system. The tests proved the normal, self-controlled work of the power pack at different depths to more than 2,600 meters, self-start and emergency-stop operations, and its ability to blow out 500 liters of water immediately to provide additional buoyancy for rapid ascent.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sea Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 34:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 29-33","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-3651; CODEN: SEATAD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6806364","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6806364","","Sea Technology; (United States)","","34:4"

Here accurate solutions of these problems are determined where both the state and control profiles are approximated at the same level of detail. In this study the authors consider characteristics of the maximum batch distillate problem and show that the approach is especially useful for the optimization of detailed tray-by-tray models with tray and condenser holdups. In particular they discuss two formulations: an inequality path constrained problem and the classical endpoint constrained problem. In both cases interesting and unusual optimal policies are determined and compared to current practice. Moreover, parallels are observed between optimal reflux policies for these two problems, and these are also related to findings from previous studies. To handle these problems, nonlinear programs of up to 8,000 variables are solved reasonably quickly on a small workstation. This results from a nonlinear programming strategy that incorporates an efficient decomposition step, determines control variable discontinuities, and enforces a wide variety of state and control variable constraints. Finally, it is observed that more complex batch distillation problems can be handled in a straightforward manner through this approach.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 692-700","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00016a016","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","6634253","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6634253","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:4"

These interrelated, transient, process changes can greatly disrupt downstream unit operations. Data and observations from commercial ammonia synthesis gas adsorbers agree well with the effects predicted by the model. The effluent temperature rise can be used to monitor the condition of the adsorbent, the effectiveness of the previous thermal regeneration step, and flow distribution in the adsorber. A combination of activated alumina followed by 13X molecular sieve should reduce the transient process changes due to nitrogen adsorption, increase the capacity of the adsorber, and provide greater operating flexibility relative to 13X molecular sieve as the sole adsorbent.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 613-619","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00016a007","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6634261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6634261","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:4"

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) were used to characterize these catalysts. The results of XRD and TPR show that the catalysts with 1-8 wt% vanadium oxide loadings had a uniform structure but no well-defined crystalline phase of vanadium oxide. These catalysts showed very different selectivities for methanol. At the fixed methane conversion, methanol selectivity generally increased with the decrease of the vanadium oxide loading. The size of vanadium oxide ensembles may have significant effect on catalytic selectivity. N[sub 2]O was found to be much more active than O[sub 2] for the oxidation of methane. In the presence of both N[sub 2]O and O[sub 2], N[sub 2]O had to compete with O[sub 2] for the adsorption sites.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 584-587","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00016a002","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","6550713","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6550713","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:4"

Methanol adsorption on alumina is zero within experimental error. The negative surface charge of silica is almost entirely compensated by cation adsorption. Both charge and cation adsorption decrease when water is replaced with a mixed solvent. With alumina, the compensation is much lower and both charge and adsorption are independent of the solvent composition up to 30% w/w of methanol and ethanol. Potentials calculated from adsorption data are compared with the measured values.

Surface acidity measurements by amine titrations over the series of Li-doped TiO[sub 2] catalysts revealed that total acidity decreases with increasing Li[sup +] dopant concentration.

Within the same e[Phi] ranges the catalytic activation energy E varies linearly with e[Phi] and can be lowered from 40 kcal/mol to 11 kcal/mol.

A series of F/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] samples (wt % F = 0 to 20) has been studied using a combination of solid-state [sup 27]Al NMR, FT-IR, and ethanol-[sup 18]O TPD techniques. Solid-state [sup 27]Al NMR is particularly sensitive to amorphous phases or small crystallites present on the catalyst surface, many of which cannot be detected by XRD. [sup 27]Al NMR shows the presence of three types of AlF[sub 3](H[sub 2]O)[sub n] species (with n varying between 0 and 3) on fluorided alumina. FT-IR studies of ethanol adsorption show that fluoride blocks the sites required for dissociative chemisorption of ethanol. A similar analysis of adsorbed pyridine shows an increase in the number of Broensted acid sites with the addition of up to 10 wt % fluoride. However, increasing the fluoride loading to 20 wt % decreases the number of Broensted acid sites. The TPD of ethanol-[sup 18]O from F/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] samples shows that at low levels fluoride serves to block Lewis acid sites, but at higher levels its predominant role is to increase the Broensted acidity of the alumina surface. The pyridine adsorption and TPD experiments show that fluoride strengthens the remaining Lewis acid sites. 14 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 140:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 84-102","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1070","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","6130618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6130618","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","140:1"

These reactions produced a wide range of products ranging from alkenes, dienes, anhydrides, acids, and carbon oxides. Broadly speaking, the major products were dehydrogenation products over Mg[sub 3](VO[sub 4])[sub 2], combustion products over Mg[sub 2]V[sub 2]O[sub 7], and oxygen-containing organic products over (VO)[sub 2]P[sub 2]O[sub 7], although there are exceptions to this broad generalization. From the product selectivities, the moles of oxygen consumed per mole of alkane reacted could be calculated. These were the average oxygen stoichiometries for the reactions. They had values of about unity for ethane oxidation over VPO, about two when oxidative dehydrogenation was the predominant reactions, and about four for the other reactions studied. The selectivity patterns in terms of the formation of dehydrogenation products versus oxygen-containing products including carbon oxides were explained by assuming that there existed a selectivity-determining step, which could be the reaction of the surface alkyl species or the adsorbed alkene before its desorption. The formation of oxygen-containing products would be facilitated if the surface alkyl or adsorbed alkene could interact with the vanadium ions in two adjacent VO[sub x] units such that it could easily react with the reactive oxygen in the V-O-V bridge. The results of ethane oxidation, however, could not be explained simply by this model, and other factors needed to be considered. 48 refs., 5 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 140:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 226-242","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1080","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","6130768","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6130768","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","140:1"

The effectiveness factors of the heterogeneous model were calculated by the dusty gas model. The IDP method was compared with sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the Box complex method. The optimized distributions of catalyst volume with the pseudohomogeneous and heterogeneous model lead to different results. The IDP method finds the global optimum with high probability.

That plant is by far' the lowest-cost supplier of delivered methanol to the U.S., says analyst Sam Kanes of Scotia McLeod (Toronto), with gas costs below $1/1,000 cu.ft. Also included in the deal are two New Zealand plants: Petralgas, with capacity for 520,000 m.t./year, and Synfuel. Synfuel has the capacity to produce the equivalent of 1.8 million m.t./year of chemical-grade methanol, or 70,000 m.t./year of gasoline, or a combination. Currently rated at 450,000 m.t./year of methanol, that could double in 1994 with the addition of distillation capacity. After the transaction, Methanex will have a total of 2.4 million m.t./year of methanol capacity, plus marketing agreements for 1.0 million m.t./year. The company has plans to add 1.2 million m.t. of production (in Trinidad and the U.S.) and 0.6 million m.t. of further marketing arrangements over the next year and a half, bringing the total to over 5.0 million m.t./year.

For HENs, a grand composite curve (GCC) simultaneously represents heat sources like steam, and heat sinks like cooling water. The GCC also has been used for other pinch analyses, but all the energy-active process units have not been accounted for on a single GCC. There have been two reasons for this: 1. Units that are inappropriately placed against the pinch temperature cancel other streams in the GCC, thus giving a false picture of the energy cascading; and 2. Many units bypass the HEN and thus do not participate in the usual GCC--that is, energy is cascaded from energy sources directly to energy sinks, for instance, from a reactor to a boiler. One can overcome these two limitations by first eliminating all inappropriately placed process units from the GCC and then placing them in front of the GCC as additional composite curves together with adequate process utilities. The authors call this presentation the Extended Grand Composite Curve (EGCC). The EGCC thus is composed of a GCC that is extended with utility composite curves (UCCs). While the GCC represents indirect heat exchange (energy flows from hot utilities through the HEN to cold utilities), UCCs graphically reproduce direct heat exchange between energy sources and energy sinks. In such a manner, a simplified exergy (energy availability) analysis of the whole process is possible, as the authors will describe. The EGCC has the same advantages over traditional composite curves (CCs) that the GCC has. The extended pinch design method will be illustrated by the design of an ammonia plant, whose simplified process scheme is shown in a figure.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Engineering Progress; (United States); Journal Volume: 89:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 49-60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-7275; CODEN: CEPRA8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6083042","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6083042","","Chemical Engineering Progress; (United States)","","89:2"

All of the glassy samples contain two kinds of acid sites with different acid strengths, both of which are due to surface POH groups. The number of strong acid sites which are responsible for dehydration activity decreases significantly upon crystallization, while the number of weak acid sites remains almost constant. This reduction of surface acidity results from a solid-state condensation reaction of POH groups which always accompanies their crystallization. Thus, for the metaphosphates, glass formation is effective for increasing surface acidity. This increase is probably due to the characteristic structure of glasses. 20 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 139:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 568-575","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1050","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6045774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6045774","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","139:2"

In addition, using a mixed conduction (protonic and p-type electronic conduction) of this ceramic, formation rates of C[sub 2]-products were accelerated further.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 140:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 459-462","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-4651; CODEN: JESOAN","10.1149/1.2221068","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6449229","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6449229","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society; (United States)","","140:2"

Recently, the use of solid electrolytes to promote catalysis for a number of reactions has been investigated. During these investigations, dramatic increases in the oxygen consumption, far exceeding the amount of oxygen supplied through the O[sup 2]-conducting electrolyte, have been observed accompanying overall increases in reaction rates. In addition, this effect has been recently demonstrated in oxidative reactions using Na[sup +]-conducting as well as proton-conducting solid electrolytes. This phenomenon, named NEMCA (nonfaradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity), has been attributed to an effect on chemisorption bonding, and hence the reaction rate constant, by altering the catalyst work function. The conversion of methane to ethane and ethylene is a subject of extensive study by a very large number of research groups in the last 7 years. Attempts to convert methane into useful raw materials by using solid oxide electrolytes have been separately reviewed. Recently, a three-electrode cell using Ag and Ni-Zr electrodes on yttria-stabilized zirconia has been used to study the current-voltate relationship during the oxidation of methane at 600-800[degrees]C. The present communication explores the nonoxidative coupling of methane to C[sub 2] hydrocarbons over silver electrodes using a solid electrolyte with major conductivity via protons. An added feature of this investigation is the utilization of the electrolyte as a support in a one-chamber reactor rather than a solid oxide membrane partition in a two-chamber reactor. This design, adapted from Otsuka et al., simplifies the overall reactor configuration. Using this type of cell, an attempt is made to connect the nonoxidative coupling of methane with the NEMCA phenomenon. 11 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 139:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 683-687","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1060","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6310991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6310991","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","139:2"

Dehydration products consisted of dimethyl ether (DME), di-isobutyl ether (DIBE), methyl-isobutyl ether (MIBE), butenes, octenes, and traces of methyl-tertiarybutyl ether (MTBE). At low temperatures and high alcohol pressures (P [ge] 150 kPa), the dehydration product slate was dominated by ether formation with selectivity within the ethers significantly in favor of the mixed ether, MIBE. The rates of ether and butene formation as a function of alcohol pressure could be described by Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics in which competitive adsorption of the two alcohols on the surface -SO[sub 3]H sites was the dominant feature. The kinetics of isobutanol dehydration to isobutene were consistent with a dual-site mechanism involving the cooperative action of a free surface -SO[sub 3]H site and an adjacent adsorbed alcohol molecule. Dehydration to ethers was consistent with the reaction of two adsorbed alcohols, also by a dual-site mechanism. As a consequence, dehydration to symmetric ethers showed saturation-type kinetics as a function of alcohol pressure, while the rate of isobutene formation went through a distinct maximum. Due to the competitive adsorption of methanol and isobutanol, the mixed ether MIBE was formed at a maximum rate with an optimum ratio of partial pressures of the two alcohols. The high selectivity to MIBE was explained by stronger adsorption of isobutanol on the catalyst surface as compared to methanol. The absence of MTBE and the predominance of products such as MIBE and 2,5-dimethylhexene suggests that dehydration to give free carbenium ions that subsequently rearrange to the more stable tertiary intermediate was not occurring. It was proposed that the alcohols react with the -SO[sub 3]H groups to give oxonium ions or esters. These intermediates couple to give the product ethers or octenes. 24 refs., 13 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 139:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 406-420","","","AC22-90PC90044","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1036","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6298240","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6298240","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","139:2"

Selectivities for ethane can be as high as 77%, for ethylene 25%, and for acetylene 25%. Conversions of methane as high as 52% have been realized. Coking can be minimized by proper choice of catalyst and high flow rates. Ethane and ethylene can be converted with 100% selectivity to ethylene and acetylene, respectively, in a similar process.

Addition of a small amount of tetrachloromethane (TCM) to the reactant stream improves the catalytic activity of these oxides. In particular, the praseodymium catalyst yields high selectivity to the C[sub 2] compounds comparable to La[sub 2]O[sub 3] or Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3] when TCM is present in the feedstream. The X-ray diffraction patterns for these catalysts after the reaction with TCM show the presence of the oxychlorides in the catalysts except for the cerium catalyst, for which the selectivity to C[sub 2] compounds is very low even in the presence of TCM. The oxychlorides can be generated on La[sub 2]O[sub 3], Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3], or Pr[sub 6]O[sub 11] by preheating under a stream including TCM. The product distribution of the reaction with these catalysts in the absence of TCM is similar to that with the oxides in the presence of TCM, while Pr[sub 6]O[sub 11] pretreated with TCM is unstable with no TCM in the feedstream.

From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the optimum zeolite for this reaction is the less acidic faujasite (Si/Al = 2.5). Competitive dehydration of ethanol takes place and, consequently, the two nucleophiles ethanol and water react with the nitriles. Zeolites with the strongest acid sites (beta, mordenite) show higher activity in a first step of the process, particularly towards amide formation. A linear relationship between activity and acidity is established in this step for a competitive attack of the nucleophiles. After the strong acid sites have been poisoned by the product, the reaction is performed over the remaining less acidic free sites. A consecutive reaction takes place leading to the ester with good selectivities (80%) over faujasites. The probable operating mechanism involves as the first step a fast protonation of the nitrile, the rate-determining step being, as in homogeneous conditions, the nucleophilic attack. 35 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 139:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 362-370","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1031","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","6235814","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6235814","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","139:2"

The influence of hydrogen on the CO desorption kinetics may be directly related to a shift in CO binding site induced by the presence of ambient hydrogen. This hydrogen-induced shift of CO molecules from linear sites to bridging sites on the Ni(111) surface has been observed quite recently using FTIR measurements. 21 refs., 8 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 449-454","","","AC02-76ER01198","Journal ID: LANGD5; ISSN 0743-7463; TRN: 96:000941-026","10.1021/la00026a015","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","171443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/171443","","Langmuir","2","9"

The adsorption was carried out under equilibrium conditions and the resulting materials were characterized by laser Raman and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The experimental data were simulated using the triple layer model (TLM) of Davis in an attempt to elucidate the adsorption mechanism. The TLM, which was developed for the description of the oxide/solution interface, was modified by a further subdivision of the {beta}-layer so as to allow adsorption of ions having largely different radii, such as Pd(NH{sub 3}){sub 4}{sup 2+} and NH{sub 4}{sup +}. The palladium-ammino-aquo complexes are adsorbed on both oxides with or without exchange of ligands depending on the adsorption conditions, such as pH, nature of the base, and nature of the electrolyte. Adsorption at high pH ({gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, >10.6, SiO{sub 2}, >10.0) from an aqueous solution of NH{sub 3} leads predominantly to electrostatically adsorbed Pd(NH{sub 3}){sub 4}{sup 2+}, whereas adsorption at lower pH and/or using of an aqueous NaOH solution also promotes reactions involving ligand exchange leading to species such as Pd(NH{sub 3}){sub 3}(SOH){sup 2+} (S indicates surface). 16 refs., 11 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 460-466","","","","Journal ID: LANGD5; ISSN 0743-7463; TRN: 96:000941-027","10.1021/la00026a017","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","171444","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/171444","","Langmuir","2","9"

In separate work, scientists at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis) have directly converted methane to syngas in a catalytic oxidation process that avoids steam reforming. While still far from commercialization, the Catalytica work - which achieves dramatically higher yields than previously produced with catalytic oxidation - provides tantalizing hints that the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol could be economically feasible. Numerous groups have worked on the problem but have been foiled by the difficulty in stopping the reaction at methanol and thus achieving commercially acceptable yields.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Week; (United States); Journal Volume: 152:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 15","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-272X; CODEN: CHWKA9","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6756781","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6756781","","Chemical Week; (United States)","","152:3"

The net reaction catalyzed by mercuric ions, Hg(II), is the oxidation of methane by concentrated sulfuric acid to produce methyl bisulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50 percent, 85 percent selectivity to methyl bisulfate ([approximately] 43 percent yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of 10[sup [minus]7] mole per cubic centimeter per second and Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10[sup [minus]3] per second. Separate hydrolysis of methyl bisulfate and reoxidation of the sulfur dioxide with air provides a potentially practical scheme for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. The primary steps of the Hg(II)-catalyzed reaction were individually examined and the essential elements of the mechanism were identified. The Hg(II) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH[sub 3]HgOSO[sub 3]H, 1.

The technique efficiently converts carboxylic acids to 1-alkenes ([alpha]-olefins) having one less carbon atom. Only minute quantities of by-products are generated, much less than the amounts typically obtained with current processes. The process also offers a green alternative to existing methods for making [alpha]-olefins because it can produce them from fatty-acids (carboxylic acids from natural sources) instead of from petroleum. In the reaction, an equimolar mixture of a carboxylic acid and acetic anhydride is heated to 250 C in the presence of a palladium or rhodium catalyst. This causes the carboxylic acid to undergo decarbonylation and dehydration to a 1-alkene having one less carbon atom. Catalyst lifetimes are very long, Miller says, and the spent catalyst can be recovered for reuse.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical and Engineering News; (United States); Journal Volume: 71:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 36-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2347; CODEN: CENEAR","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6054583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6054583","","Chemical and Engineering News; (United States)","","71:2"

The stoichiometric and catalytic decarbonylation of aliphatic aldehydes and acid chlorides to alkanes and alkenes, respectively, by transition-metal complexes are well-known and synthetically useful transformations. Relatively little, however, has been reported concerning the analogous decarbonylation/dehydration of aliphatic carboxylic acids to olefins, with generally poor results achieved in terms of catalyst efficiency and selectivity toward terminal olefin formation in the product. For example, the decarbonylation/dehydration of stearic acid to heptadecane using a Rh-based catalyst was reported to proceed with a maximum catalyst turnover number (TON; moles of olefin product formed per mole of catalyst used) of ca. 250, with selectivities toward 1-heptadecene formation typically below 50%. Interestingly, results were presented in this work which suggested that the decarbonylation of stearic acid proceeded via intermediate formation of stearic anhydride. Use of a preformed, symmetrical anhydride is not desirable from an economic or synthetic viewpoint, particularly since its decarbonylation should result in the formation of equal amounts of olefin and carboxylic acid coproducts. The authors now report here that the use of a carboxylic acid substrate as an equimolar mixture with acetic anhydride (Ac[sub 2]O) produces a mixed anhydride system which undergoes an extremely facile decarbonylation reaction to provide a general and highly selective route to the corresponding 1-alkenes of one less carbon atom. 19 refs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Organic Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 58:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 18-20","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3263; CODEN: JOCEAH","10.1021/jo00053a008","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","6130661","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6130661","","Journal of Organic Chemistry; (United States)","","58:1"

The model discrimination and the parameter estimation are performed according to the integral method of kinetic analysis on experiments described in part 1 of this series. In the construction of the kinetic model, the information gained from in situ catalyst characterization is used. The model proposed assumes different active sites for the water gas shift reaction on one side and for the reactions leading to n-paraffins and 1-olefins on the other side. The rate expressions for the hydrocarbon-forming reactions are based on elementary reactions corresponding to the carbide mechanism, in the assumption that two kinds of elementary reactions, the ones describing the adsorption of carbon monoxide and these describing the desorption of the hydrocarbon products, are not at equilibrium. The assumption that the active sites are almost completely occupied with surface hydrocarbon intermediates greatly simplified the kinetic expressions. The rate expression for the water gas shift reaction is based on elementary reactions involving a formate surface intermediate. The two-site reaction describing the formation of the formate intermediate is proposed to be rate determining. The values of the activation energies derived correspond well with data reported in the literature.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 32:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 71-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00013a011","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6554873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6554873","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","32:1"

It has been shown that conversions are accompanied by the formation of aromatic C{sub 6}-C{sub 10} hydrocarbons, the total yield of which from dienes is an order of magnitude higher than from olefins. It has been established that, with increasing molecular weight of the diene, the arene yield passes through a peak corresponding to C{sub 5} dienes, and here uncoupled dienes form more aromatic hydrocarbons than coupled dienes. The distribution of arenes with respect to composition is specific for each diene. With an increase in the temperature of the reaction from 300 to 400{degrees}C, the differences in the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from different dienes decrease, while differences in the composition of arenes are largely levelled out. The formation of aromatic hydrocarbons is associated with the participation in this process of diene C{sup 2}-C{sub 4} fragments, which, in the opinion of the authors, are allyl cations. During conversion of allyl alcohol, where easy separation of the OH group is possible, the composition of the arenes coincides with that for 2,4-hexadiene, which is due to the identical nature of the active particles during aromatization of the two compounds., A similar mechanism is assumed for the aromatization of propylene, although, for dissociation of the C-H bond, more rigorous conditions are required than for dissociation of the C-OH bond. 18 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Petroleum Chemistry; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-76","","","","Journal ID: PHEME4; TRN: 96:003723-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263487","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263487","","Petroleum Chemistry","2","32"

Initial interaction of methane and (H)[sub 2]M[double bond]NH leads to the formation of alkane complexes bound by [approx]9 kcal mol[sup [minus]1]. Experiment indicates that the polarity of the metal-ligand bond upon which the C-H is activated plays an important role in facilitating subsequent scission. Calculations support this hypothesis and suggest that formation of the alkane complex acts to increase C[sup [delta][minus]]H[sup [delta]+] polarization, setting the stage for C-H cleavage. Calculated methane elimination barriers for (H)[sub 2]M(CH[sub 3])(NH[sub 2]) (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) are in good agreement with experimental models in terms of absolute numbers and trends as a function of metal. Calculated geometries indicate a late transition state for methane elimination, in agreement with experimentally determined activation parameters. The TSs have a kite-shaped geometry with an obtuse angle about the H of the C-H bond being activated (H[sub t]) and a short MH[sub t] distance, 1-2% greater than normal. The short MH[sub t] distance suggests a stabilizing interaction, supported by a positive bond overlap population. Calculation of the intrinsic reaction coordinate demonstrates the importance of agostic interactions between N-H and M along the reaction coordinate. 43 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 114:26","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 10557-10563","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSAT; CNN: CHE920007N","10.1021/ja00052a060","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","6567168","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6567168","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","114:26"

Rate expressions derived from the reaction sequence yielded a kinetic model for simultaneous carbon deposition, catalytic site activation, and catalyst deactivation, which exhibited trends qualitatively similar to experimental results for Ni-catalyzed carbon deposition from propylene/hydrogen mixtures. It was found that increasing the H[sub 2] concentration decreased the rates of deposition and poisoning but did not affect the rate of site activation. Thus, higher H[sub 2] concentrations lead to lower initial deposition rates, but the total level of deposition increases because of reduced deactivation rates. The hydrocarbon concentration affected the rates of activation, poisoning, and deposition similarly so that the ultimate level of deposition was independent of the hydrocarbon concentration. However, as the hydrocarbon concentration increased, the time over which deposition occurred decreased due to an increased rate of deactivation. Optimization fits the model to experimental data at various temperatures showed that the model agreed well with data at H[sub 2] concentrations from 0.0 to 45%, propylene concentrations up to 3%, and temperatures up to 550[degrees]C. 44 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1992-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 138:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 129-144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90012-7","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5719520","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5719520","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","138:1"

Lattice parameters from X-ray diffraction suggests that there is a maximum framework substitution of 5 mol% for both metals. However, samples with 5 mol% Mg or Mn appear to contain large concentrations of defects in the structure, based on the observation of slow adsorption of branched alkanes. In simultaneous temperature-programmed-desorption (TPD)/thermogravimetric-analysis (TGA) measurements, both amines reacted to an olefin and ammonia in a well-defined decomposition feature between 575 and 650 K for isopropylamine and between 625 and 675 K for ethylamine. By comparison with similar results on high-silica zeolites, the sites which decompose the amines are known to be Bronsted acid sites and decomposition occurs through an alkylammonium ion intermediate. For low concentrations of Mn and Mg (<1 mol%), the moles of isopropylamine and ethylamine which decompose in TPD-TGA are the same and equal to the moles of substituted metal atoms, indicating that the metals substitute for the Al in the framework to form Bronsted-acid sites.

The most effective catalytic system is obtained when 10 mol% BiOCl is supported on MgO with 10 mol% Li[sub 2]CO[sub 3], which leads to a methane conversion of 18%, C[sub 2] selectivity of 83%, and an ethylene-to-ethane molar ratio of 2.9 for at least 12 h under the aforementioned conditions and atmospheric pressure. The unsupported or supported samarium chloride free of Li[sub 2]CO[sub 3] was less effective under similar conditions. Only when the samarium chloride and lithium carbonate contents on the support were sufficiently increased (28 and 40 mol%, respectively) the system became effective towards high C[sub 2] selectivity and stability. In contrast, none of the manganese-chloride-based systems exhibited good C[sub 2] selectivity and stability except initially, but they mainly promoted the reaction of methane to carbon oxides. The introduction of Li[sub 2]CO[sub 3] is found to retard the loss of surface chlorine and prevent the decrease of surface bismuth and samarium, resulting thereby in more stabilized systems. In addition, the bulk and surface modifications, which are more prominent in the presence of Li[sub 2]CO[sub 3], caused by calcination and reaction conditions are believed to influence the formation of the catalytically active or inactive sites. The performance of the catalysts is related to its surface composition, bulk modification, decomposition, and reducibility of the metal chlorides or oxychloride on the basis of XPS, XRD, SEM, and thermal analysis (TPD and TPR) investigations. 59 refs., 9 figs., 8 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1992-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 138:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 322-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90026-E","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5601950","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5601950","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","138:1"

The process carries out the primary separation by selective liquid-phase adsorption of one of the components of the feed mixture on an adsorbent. The adsorbed component is then desorbed by a desorbent liquid which is equally or more strongly adsorbed than the selectively adsorbed component of the feed mixture. The desorbent liquid is removed from the adsorbent by displacing it with the less strongly adsorbed component of the feed mixture so that the adsorbent can be reused. At least one simple distillation is also required by the process which separates the desorbent liquid from the less strongly adsorbed component of the feed mixture. The process can be used to separate liquid mixtures with close boiling components or azeotropic mixtures which require energy intensive distillation. A very efficient separation can be achieved in these cases by spending only a fraction of the distillation energy. An example of such an application, viz., separation of a bulk ethanol-water mixture for motor fuel grade alcohol production, is described. A local equilibrium model of the process is used to evaluate the performance of the process for that separation using an activated carbon as the adsorbent and acetone as the desorbent liquid. Experimentally measured equilibrium adsorption characteristics for ethanol-water, acetone-water, and acetone-ethanol binary liquid mixtures on the carbon as well as adsorption column dynamics for the steps of the process are reported.","","","","","","United States","1992-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 27:14","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1875-1887","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-6395; CODEN: SSTEDS","10.1080/01496399208019455","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","7007508","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7007508","","Separation Science and Technology; (United States)","","27:14"

These studies relate to the chemistry of methanol synthesis using the standard Cu/ZnO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst, which produces essentially all of the world`s methanol supply. Methanol adsorbs on the alumina phase at 298 K to form a surface-bound terminal methoxy, but it forms a bridging methoxy on the ZnO phase. On catalysts containing Cu, these methoxy groups were oxidized to a surface-bound symmetrical formate at ca. 373 K. Formate is mobile on the surface at 493 K. Heating to ca. 523 K converted formate to carbonate or bicarbonate, but again only on catalysts containing Cu. These carbonates partially decomposed at 523 K to free CO{sub 2}. Paraformaldehyde underwent a Cannizzaro-type disproportionation on all catalysts studied to form formate and methoxy groups. This observation is consistent with a transient intermediate role for formaldehyde. Evidence of a surface-bound dioxymethylene was seen on ZnO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} during this reaction. CO{sub 2} readily adsorbs on Cu/ZnO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} to form carbonate at 298 K. CO adsorbs to form a small amount of carbonate and a weakly bound surface carbonyl. Detailed measurements of relaxation rates and the principal components of the {sup 13}C chemical shift tensors are reported for all catalyst/adsorbate systems. All adsorbates showed biexponential {sup 13}C T{sub 1} behavior on Cu/ZnO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} only. Our interpretation of this result is that small paramagnetic clusters of Cu are dispersed in an oxide phase. The results of this study are interpreted in terms of several mechanistic controversies. 44 refs., 9 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1992-10-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: PBD: 21 Oct 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 8552-8559","","","","Journal ID: JACSAT; ISSN 0002-7863; CNN: Grant CHE-8919741; TRN: 96:002900-0002","10.1021/ja00048a030","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","457060","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/457060","","Journal of the American Chemical Society","22","114"

The reaction was examined at temperatures higher than 823 K and at a higher methane/toluene ratio than 10. In order to understand the whole network of this reaction, the kinetic studies on the homocoupling of each reactant have been carried out. The results suggested a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type mechanism for both reactants; i.e., the rate-determining step is at the abstraction of hydrogen from methane or from toluene, forming methyl or benzyl species on the surface, respectively, or liberating the corresponding alkyl radicals into the gas phase. The coupling of the alkyl intermediates produces each coupling product, i.e., C{sub 2} and C{sub 14} compounds. Under methane and toluene cofeed conditions, the formation of C{sub 8} compounds (ethyl-benzene and styrene) can be explained in terms of the coupling of methyl and benzyl intermediates. Although a large difference between the reactivities of methane and toluene made it difficult to carry out the kinetic studies on the cross-coupling of methane and toluene, the results were well interpreted in terms of the reaction mechanisms proposed for the oxidation of methane and that of toluene.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 137:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 487-496","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90175-H","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7004468","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7004468","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","137:2"

The membrane was laboratory prepared using the solution casting technique. The sorption characteristics in relation to pervaporation were also studied. It was found that the preferential sorption was altered when the liquid composition was changed, whereas the water component permeated through the membrane preferentially over the whole range of feed mixture compositions. The experimental results were analyzed in terms of sorption ratio and permeation ratio to characterize nonideality of sorption and pervaporation. The effects of some operating parameters, including temperature, feed concentration, and permeate pressure, on the pervaporation performance were also investigated.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 27:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1583-1597","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-6395; CODEN: SSTED","10.1080/01496399208029225","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","7023364","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7023364","","Separation Science and Technology; (United States)","","27:12"

These bands were identifiable with the reported multicarbonyl and the linear-bonded monocarbonyl species and indicate that the different oxidation states of ruthenium serve as independent CO chemisorption sites which may coexist on a real catalyst surface at a particular temperature. The effect of exposure temperature and that of the postexposure thermal annealing on CO vibrational bands suggest that the multicarbonyl species transform progressively to monocarbonyl forms which are in turn identified as precursors to the methylene groups in the presence of hydrogen. Though the presence of hydrogen had no apparent effect on the shape and the frequency of different C-O stretch bands, CO + H{sub 2} interaction at temperatures above 400 K gave rise to hydrocarbon structures consisting of a chain of methylene groups.

The copolymer membranes preferentially permeated water from an aqueous ethanol solutions in both pervaporation and evapomeation. The copolymer membranes preferentially permeated water from an aqueous ethanol solution in evapomeation. In pervaporation, ethanol was predominantly permeated from an aqueous ethanol solution through the copolymer membranes containing a long polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain above about 20 wt% PEG content in a copolymer. This result was attributed to a remarkable swelling of the copolymer membrane containing a long PEG chain by the aqueous ethanol solution in pervaporation. In evapomeation, both the separation factors and the permeation rates through these membranes are not much affected by the ethanol concentration in the feed vapor. In pervaporation, they were significantly dependent on the ethanol concentration in the feed solution. The above results are discussed from the viewpoint of the physical structure of the membrane in evapomeation and pervaporation.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Separation Science and Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 27:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1599-1617","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-6395; CODEN: SSTED","10.1080/01496399208029226","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7076216","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7076216","","Separation Science and Technology; (United States)","","27:12"

Pretreatment of these carbon materials with HNO[sub 3] aqueous solution (6/7M) at 373 K improved the rate of phenol production remarkably. Among these carbon materials, the carbon whisker showed the best results. Hydroxyl radical was suggested to be the active oxygen species responsible for hydroxylation of benzene. The reaction mechanism assuming hydroxyhexadienyl radical as a reaction intermediate has been proposed. Coaddition of Pd black and Fe-cation to the carbons showed a market synergism for the formation of phenol. Pd black increases the rate of reduction of dioxygen. Fe-cation enhances the generation of hydroxyl radical as well as the selectivity to phenol. The combination of these effects explains the synergism of Pd black and Fe-cation.

IR spectra in the OH-stretching region showed adsorption bands at 3,747 and 3,673 cm{sup {minus}1} assigned, respectively, to terminal silanols and to hydroxyls located on extraframework aluminium species. These OH groups were more strongly perturbed than silanols by adsorbed CO, thus suggesting a more pronounced Broensted acidity. The major features of the spectra in the CO-stretching region are two intense absorptions centered, respectively, at 2,178 and 2,138 cm{sup {minus}1}. Neither of them, however, is a single-peak band. The 2,178-cm{sup {minus}1} band was assigned to CO molecules polarized by Na{sup +} ions. It could be resolved into two components, revealing coordination of Na{sup +} ions by one molecule (high-frequency component) or by more than one (low-frequency component). The high-frequency component showed an asymmetric profile which was assigned to the presence of Na{sup +} ions in slightly different environments. The 2,138-cm{sup {minus}1} band corresponds to liquid-like CO inside the zeolite channels where the molecule behaves as a hindered rotor, thus explaining the fine structure observed. A weak IR adsorption was also observed at 2,112 cm{sup {minus}1} and assigned to CO simultaneously interacting through both ends with two Lewis acid centers. Finally, a combination mode observed at 2,305-2,315 cm{sup {minus}1} allowed assignation of a value of ca. 140 cm{sup {minus}1} to the Na{sup +} -CO.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 137:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 179-185","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90147-A","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7241373","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7241373","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","137:1"

The SSITKA results indicate that, during steady-state, CO hydrogenation, carbidic carbon evolved into methane via a high-reactivity C(h) and a low-reactivity C(l) trajectory. With increasing amounts of K{sup +} the average true intrinsic turnover frequency (k) of both of these carbidic pools decreased, as did their steady-state surface abundance. Relative to C(l), the C(h) pool was affected to a slightly greater extent, both in terms of its reactivity and abundance. It is likely that potassium was able to strengthen the carbon-metal interaction which made hydrogenation of the carbon adlayer more difficult, resulting in smaller methane-destined pools of active surface carbon. With time-on-stream, deactivation by deposition of inactive carbon did not significantly affect the product distribution or the methane rate constant at the prevailing K{sup +} doping levels; instead, deactivation was due to a loss in the steady-state abundance of carbon-containing surface intermediates exiting as methane. Implications of the role of potassium during steady-state CO hydrogenation in influencing the active metal surface, the carbidic adlayer, and the latter's transformation into unreactive carbon are addressed.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 137:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 22-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90136-6","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7249677","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7249677","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","137:1"

The product's carbon number distribution differed significantly from that obtained from a CO/H{sub 2} feed under identical conditions. The results are explained in terms of three competing reactions: water-gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and nitrile synthesis. Other experiments are described that indicate a nitrile synthesis mechanism involving a C-N intermediate which further reacts with a carbon species to form the acetonitrile. A mechanistic hypothesis involving an isocyanide ligand is proposed.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 137:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 127-138","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90144-7","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7247049","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7247049","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","137:1"

Samples taken from nearby drinking-water wells and groundwater-monitoring wells were below the analytical detection limit. Monitoring well data demonstrated that groundwater flow was not toward local residential wells. Dilution by snow and subsequent freezing in the soil limited the downward spread of the methanol, an advantage not found in milder, more temperate conditions. Contaminated material was removed and processed to reclaim the methanol. Volatilization and biodegradation should remove any remaining methanol. Cleanup options were limited by the possible hazardous waste classification of the contaminated soil.

In this paper, the authors show experimentally that selectivities of CH{sub 4} oxidation to CO and H{sub 2} over Pt-Rh gauzes and HCN synthesis from CH{sub 4}, NH{sub 3}, and air over Pt-coated ceramic monoliths are strongly affected by the gas flow rate and the catalyst geometry. For any series reactions in which that desired product is an intermediate species, such as HCN synthesis, an optimal residence time exists where the production of the desired component is maximized, and the selectivity of formation of the intermediate product improves with increasing rates of mass transfer. For parallel and series-parallel reactions, mass transfer may improve or reduce selectivity of formation of the intermediate product, with the effect of mass transfer depending strongly on the reaction orders of the kinetics. However, typical series-parallel partial oxidation reactions such as the partial oxidation of CH{sub 4} to synthesis gas require high rates of mass transfer for maximum reactor selectivity.","","","","","","United States","1992-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 300-308","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90063-N","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7256034","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7256034","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:2"

Previous experiments with pure CH{sub 4} and O{sub 2} feed and with a sand-packed reactor conclusively showed the need for both the C{sub 3} additive and the zeolite in the system to produce C{sub 5}{sup +} liquids. Evidence of CH{sub 4} incorporation into the liquid products was given by selectivity calculations which indicated the C{sub 3} alone could not account for the C{sub 5}{sup +} hydrocarbons. CH{sub 4} incorporation has been conclusively confirmed by mass spectral analyses of tetramethylbenzene produced in a run with {sup 13}CH{sub 4} under identical conditions which show significant {sup 13}C enrichment in the C{sub 9}H{sub 11}{sup +} and C{sub 6}H{sub 5}{sup +} fragments. While CH{sub 4} undergoes DPO to CH{sub 3}OH in the system, two possible reaction mechanisms can explain the role of C{sub 3}; one involves C{sub 3} aromatization followed by aromatics alkylation with CH{sub 3}OH. Studies on this system with HZSM-5 catalysts having varying Al contents indicate a sensitivity to zeolite acidity except at high Al concentrations.","","","","","","United States","1992-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 578-583","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90087-X","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7150471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7150471","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:2"

The success rate using this apparatus for preparing reactive catalyst-adsorbate samples for study by MAS NMR is nearly 100%. A second major advantage of this design is that it permits the MAS rotor to be returned to the vacuum line for the adsorption of additional reactants prior to resuming in situ NMR study. The use of the second-generation CAVERN apparatus is illustrated by demonstrating the sequential adsorption feature. The observed induction period in the conversion of methanol to gasoline on HZSM-5 is studied by sequential adsorption of methanol. Although the first aliquot of methanol exhibited a long induction period before hydrocarbon synthesis at 523 K, none was observed following adsorption of a second aliquot, showing that the products have an influence on the observed kinetics.","","","","","","United States","1992-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 504-509","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90080-2","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","7241336","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7241336","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:2"

Interest in the reaction of methane with transition-metal chlorides in the vapor phase is due to the following factors. First, methane as a reducing agent can replace hydrogen, widely used for reducing metal chlorides, to yield ultrapure metals. Second, metal chlorides are of interest as catalysts for methane chlorination with subsequent conversion to ethylene or aromatic hydrocarbons. The latter two-step method of obtaining organics from methane is industrially simpler than by direct conversion of methane into ethylene by the Benson method. Chlorinated methanes are obtained by heating methane with molecular chlorine. This reaction is the basis of industrial chlorinated methane production but has a number of problems that prompt searching for catalytic chlorinations. The present paper presents a more detailed study of methane chlorination in the presence of MoCl{sub 5}, WCl{sub 6} and correlates the results with the reaction of methane with other vapor-phase transition-metal chlorides. 12 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Russian Journal of Applied Chemistry; Journal Volume: 65; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 10 Jul 1992; TN: Translated from Zhurnal Prikladnoi Khimii; 65: No. 1, 145-150(Jan 1992)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 120-124","","","","Journal ID: RJACEO; ISSN 1070-4272; TRN: 95:007780-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","159861","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/159861","","Russian Journal of Applied Chemistry","1","65"

The rate of hydrogenation of the C=O bond to produce the unsaturated alcohol increased concomitant with a decrease in the rate of C=C hydrogenation. IR spectroscopy showed a strong perturbation of the C=O bond for the alkali-promoted catalyst, and volumetric chemisorption and TPD results suggested that the alkali species blocked adsorption at low-coordination Ru sites. These adsorption and reaction studies suggest that polarization of the adsorbed substrate at the C=O bond is responsible for the significant shift in product selectivity upon alkali promotion.

BPTDS is a technique which utilizes vapor-deposited Bi (at a surface temperature of {approximately} 100 K) to passivate a previously prepared adlayer against intraadsorbate bond-breaking reactions. After such passivation, the surface is heated and adsorbed intermediates desorb intact for mass spectral indentification, provided they have stable gas-phase analogues. Here, the authors show that BPTDS is a useful technique for monitoring the coverages of adsorbed intermediates produced during the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on Pt(111). At 95 K, cyclohexene adsorbs molecularly in a di-{sigma} fashion. By 200 K (E{sub a} {congruent} 13.7 kcal/mol) this species converts to another form of di-{sigma}, molecularly adsorbed cyclohexene, which itself converts to {pi}-allyl c-C{sub 6}H{sub 9,a} (plus adsorbed hydrogen) at 200-240 K (E{sub a}{congruent} 14.4 kcal/mol). At about the same temperature, part of the cyclohexene decomposes, producing small amounts of adsorbed benzene and cyclohexadiene. At about 340 K, the c-C{sub 6}H{sub 9,a} species converts to adsorbed benzene (E{sub a} = 20.8 kcal/mol) and the adsorbed hydrogen desorbs as H{sub 2}. The c-C{sub 6}H{sub 9,a} intermediate is identified in BPTDS by its deuteration to c-C{sub 6}H{sub 9}D gas at {approximately} 190 K when coadsorbed with deuterium.

Under dehydrated conditions, the surface chromium oxide content. The catalysts above 2% CrO{sub 3}/SiO{sub 2} also contain crystalline {alpha}-Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} particles in addition to the surface monochromate species. The methanol oxidation studies reveal that the catalytic activity per Cr atom, the turnover number (TON), decreases as the chromium oxide content increases. The major reaction product is HCHO, while HCOOCH{sub 3}, CO, and CO{sub 2} are next in abundance. The selectivity for HCHO increases as the chromium oxide content increases and the precalcination temperature is increased. The opposite trend is observed for the selectivity of HCOOCH{sub 3}. These selectivity changes are due to dehydroxylization of the silica surface by precalcining at elevated temperatures and increasing the surface chromium oxide species. The current results suggest that HCHO and HCOOCH{sub 3} are produced on two different catalytic sites: HCHO is formed on the Cr site, whereas HCOOCH{sub 3} is produced via hemiacetal intermediates, which are formed by interaction between HCHO adsorbed on the Cr site and CH{sub 3}O adsorbed on the silica site.

However, several Ru systems yield oxygen-containing compounds. The reasons for these oxygenate synthesis activities have not been well discussed. Raney Ru catalysts have also been found active for methanol synthesis from CO and H{sub 2}. Methanol can be synthesized at a temperature as low as 353 K on Raney Ru. Fine particles of raney Ru powder catalyst can be suspended in a solution for the low-temperature methanol synthesis process in which a reduced Ni complex catalyst is supposed to be used. A new methanol process under low temperature and low pressure could save much of the energy required for the process, and new catalysts including Raney Ru should be studied in detail. The point of interest in the case of Raney Ru is why methanol is produced selectively, although Ru powder gives hydrocarbon exclusively. Here, the authors tried to identify the surface state of raney Ru that is related to methanol selectivity.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 252-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90125-2","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","7004484","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7004484","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:1"

Infrared spectra of adsorbed NO and XPS spectra for the 3p{sub 3/2} orbital of Co and Ni suggest that Co in the alloy interacts electronically with Ni in the outer shell orbital, resulting in the creation of adsorption sites with a new electron density. As a result, alloying Co with Ni strengthens the hydrogen adsorption. Thus alloying Co with Ni allows hydrogen to compete more effectively for adsorption sites in the co-adsorption of CO and H{sub 2}. Since the rate of H{sub 2}-D{sub 2} exchange on CO preadsorbed Co-Ni alloy shows a good correlation with the CO hydrogenation activity, the reactivity of adsorbed hydrogen in the presence of CO plays a decisive role in determining the activity for CO hydrogenation in this alloy system.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 232-241","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90122-X","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","7258105","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7258105","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:1"

Apparent activation energies for methanol synthesis on the Cu/ZnO catalyst depend on both temperature and fractional CO{sub 2} in the CO-CO{sub 2} mixture and reflect a change in the importance of the CO and CO{sub 2} as sources of methanol in the synthesis. The water-gas shift reaction does not proceed to equilibrium for CO mole fractions below 0.05. Experimental results confirm earlier observations that methanol is formed directly from CO and CO{sub 2}.

A linear relationship was found between the rate constant and the surface area of zero-valent copper. It is hence proposed that surface Cu(0) species are responsible for the dehydrogenation. The higher values of turnover frequency for the present system in comparison with the values previously found on CuO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} enable a proposal to be made for the role of the zinc in the activity of the Cu(0) species.

Activity for CO hydrogenation and product distribution depended on the electron affinity of the oxide supports. A support-effect was also recognized in the adsorption state of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. The support effect observed in this study seems to result from electronic interaction between Ru and support oxide, since the binding energy Ru 3d{sub 2} XPS peaks and the IR adsorption frequency of linear-type NO depended on the electron affinity of the oxide support. The extent of charge transfer was represented by the electronegativity of support oxide in this study. The activity and the chain growth probability in CO hydrogenation are enhanced by using Ru on support oxides with high electronegativity because the deficient electron density of Ru weakened the CO adsorption and enhanced the concentration of hydrogen on catalyst surface.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 161-169","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90115-X","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7152249","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7152249","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:1"

ESR, oxygen and carbon dioxide uptakes and the catalytic properties clearly demonstrate that spontaneous spreading of MoO{sub 3} on the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} support at 500 C in the presence of wet O{sub 2} is a most effective alternative method for preparing molybdenum-alumina catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 50-58","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1002/chin.199239025","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","7252948","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7252948","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:1"

MgO was found to be the most effective support among several pure oxides. The high activity is thought to be due to the high Ru dispersion, the Cl-free system, and the basicity of the support. Modifying MgO by adding other oxides was also tried. Na{sub 2}O-MgO and Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}-MgO supports were found to be as effective as the pure MgO. Fourteen kinds of metal nitrates, including alkali metals, alkali earth metal nitrates (Cs{sup +}, Rb{sup +}, and K{sup +}), especially CsNO{sub 3}, were most effective. The synthesis rate was greatest when the Cs/Ru ratio was as low as 1.0, where the activity was 20 times as high as that without CsNO{sub 3} at 588 K and under 80 kPa of N{sub 2} + 3H{sub 2}. CsNO{sub 3} was considered to be disproportionated to CsOH during the hydrogen treatment. The alkali promoter proved to act not only as a Cl scavenger in the case of a Cl-containing Ru catalyst but also as an electronic surface modifier to Ru. Hydrogen chemisorption studies disclosed that alkali covered mostly the Ru surface but had a weak interaction with the MgO surface. The importance of surface morphology in the combination of Ru and promoter was noted. Ru-CsOH/MgO (5 wt%: Cs/Ru = 1) was even more active than 4.7 wt% Ru-K/AC and was comparable to the Raney Ru-CsNO{sub 3} catalyst, which had previously been reported to be the most active catalyst at 573 and under 80 kPa of N{sub 2} + 3H{sub 2}.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 136:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 126-140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90112-U","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","7252961","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7252961","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","136:1"

The first scheme, proposed initially by Brosilow, is designed based on Kalman filter estimation. The second less traditional design uses an estimator computed from the partial least squares regression method (PLS). The second approach was found to give superior performance when the nonlinear system under study is operated in a wide range of operating points. Due to the nonlinearity of the system it is essential to address the issue of robustness of the proposed schemes. This is formally done in this work using structured singular value theory. For the robustness analysis it is crucial to develop a realistic but not overly conservative uncertainty description. Since the PLS estimator uses a large number of measurements, a robust design based on the uncertainty associated with each one of the measurements, a robust design based on the uncertainty associated with each one of the measurements would be very conservative. To overcome this problem, a lumped uncertainty description is proposed which is identified directly form experiments.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 31:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1665-1679","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00007a013","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","7103083","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7103083","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","31:7"

Kinetic studies show that the rate of formic acid appearance in first order each in [2], pH{sub 2}, and p{sub CO2} in the range 50-300 psi (following prehydrogenation). In situ high-pressure IR and NMR experiments reveal that the addition of H{sub 2} to [Rh(NBD)(PMe{sub 2}Ph){sub 3}]BF{sub 4} (2) produces rhodium dihydride complexes [H{sub 2}Rh(PMe{sub 2}Ph){sub 3}(S)]BF{sub 4}(4, 5; S = H{sub 2}O, THF) and [H{sub 2}Rh(PMe{sub 2}Ph){sub 4}]BF{sub 4} (3).

When the rate of O{sub 2} reduction is not sufficiently fast to match the rate of reaction of holes, an excess of electrons will accumulate on the TiO{sub 2} particles, and the rate of electron-hole recombination will increase. The authors now show experimentally that electrons do indeed accumulate on slurried TiO{sub 2} particles during photoassisted oxidation of 1.6 M aqueous methanol and that electrons on the slurried particles persist for at least {approximately}1 min even in O{sub 2}-saturated solutions. The rate of particle depolarization, i.e. of electron transfer to dissolved O{sub 2}, is increased and the negative charge on the TiO{sub 2} particles is completely eliminated upon incorporation of Pd{sup 0} in the surface of the TiO{sub 2} particles.

FT-IR and this new technique have been used to study the adsorption and dehydration reactions of a series of aliphatic alcohols on [gamma]-alumina. It was found that the facility with which the various alkoxides undergo elimination processes is dependent on the size of the alkyl groups and the degree of branching. Reactions involving [[sup 18]O]ethanol and [[sup 18]O]methanol produce two isotopomeric ether products (R[sup 18]OR and R[sup 16]OR), which shows that bound alkoxides are formed by two routes: (a) dissociative adsorption on Lewis acid sites and (b) nucleophilic attack by a surface oxide on an alcohol that is probably activated toward C-O cleavage. Poisoning experiments using 2.6-dimethylpyridine confirm that the ether isotopomers are formed from different alkoxide species.

In all cases homogeneous precursors with a hydrotalcite-type structure were prepared, which upon calcination formed mainly cubic nonstoichiometric spinel-type structure were prepared, which upon calcination formed mainly cubic nonstoichiometric spinel-type phases. The presence of small amounts of Co led to considerable modification in the surface reactivity of the main Cu-containing fraction and the formation of a smaller less reducible fraction. On the other hand, TPD tests showed a considerable increase in the strength of the CO interaction with the surface. The catalytic data showed a change from a low-temperature methanol to a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, which occurred in two stages: (1) With Co content up to 2% a dramatic deactivation was observed without any change in selectivity and (2) at higher Co contents an increase in activity was detected, but with a high selectivity in hydrocarbons. This behavior was interpreted as being due to the formation by reduction of the cubic nonstoichiometric spinel-type phase mainly of a highly dispersed metallic Cu, not detectable by XRD analysis and probably characterized by low-Miller-index surface planes. The low amounts of Co destroyed the catalytic activity by poisoning the oxidizing capacity of the catalyst surface, while further Co additions resulted in an increase in the activity with a change in selectivity to hydrocarbons, probably the result of a synergetic effect between the well-dispersed metallic Cu and the Co-containing cubic spinel-type phase.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 386-399","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90041-F","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6995100","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6995100","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:2"

The morphology of a number of different catalysts has been examined by detailed transmission electron microscopy and the results have been correlated with catalyst performance, in particular selectivity to C[sub 2] hydrocarbons. Three samples of magnesium oxide have been prepared by different methods. Magnesium oxides prepared from the hydroxide, (ex OH), and from burning magnesium ribbon in air show similar morphology, exposing largely (100) planes; they also show very similar catalytic selectivity and specific activity. Steps and corner sites are present in much greater density on the ex OH samples than on the ribbon residue, and, since catalyst performance is unchanged, it is clear that these sites play no significant part in the catalysis over these materials. The active site is therefore located on the planar (100) surfaces. The most selective magnesium oxide catalyst was prepared by thermal decomposition of magnesium hydroxycarbonate and exposed a greater proportion of higher index mean crystal planes, e.g., (111), than the less selective forms of magnesium oxide. The morphology/performance relationship has also been examined for lithium-doped magnesium oxide catalysts. The emergence of a dislocation at the surface of the crystallite provides a locus for [Li[sup +]O[sup [minus]]] centres, thought to be the active site in methyl radical generation in methane coupling. Similar dislocations are observed in Au/MgO catalysts, which are much less selective to C[sub 2] hydrocarbons than in pure MgO.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 576-595","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90055-M","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7026075","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7026075","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:2"

Temperature and partial pressures of the reactants were varied within the following ranges: 933 K [le] T [le] 1,033 K, 5 kPa [le] P[sub CH[sub 4]] [le] 80 kPa, 0.3 kPa [le] P O[sub 2] [le] 20 kPa.

The rate of methane conversion was well described by a power-law rate equation. Mechanistic assumptions derived from these kinetic results and corroborated by kinetic isotope effects are presented. In addition, kinetic equations for C[sub 2] hydrocarbon formation, carbon oxide formation, and methane conversion as reported in the literature were scrutinized for their applicability to describing the experimental data obtained in this work.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 467-480","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90048-M","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7189371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7189371","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:2"

"Roles of chemisorbed oxygen and zinc oxide islands on Cu(110) surfaces for methanol decomposition","Fu, S S; Somorjai, G A","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 40 CHEMISTRY; METHANOL; DECOMPOSITION; COPPER; CATALYSIS; ZINC OXIDES; CATALYSTS; OXYGEN; CHEMISORPTION","The interaction of methanol with Cu-Zn-O surfaces is studied on a model system produced by depositing zinc oxide islands on Cu(110) surfaces. Various amounts of oxygen are then adsorbed onto the exposed copper part of the surface to form ZnO{sub x}/y ML O/Cu(110) surfaces. The role of O/Cu(110) in methanol decomposition on the authors model Cu-Zn-O surfaces was discerned by examining the interaction of methanol, adsorbed at 150 K in ultrahigh vacuum, with these ZnO{sub x}/y ML O/Cu(110) surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Methanol reduces the zinc oxide and removes oxygen chemisorbed on copper. The decomposition temperatures of formate and methoxy species formed upon methanol decomposition on the components of oxygen covered Cu(110) and ZnO{sub x} are unaffected by the presence of the other component. However, the amount of formate species decomposed on the ZnO{sub x} component of ZnO{sub x}/O/Cu(110) surfaces is controlled by the amount of chemisorbed oxygen on copper. The authors show that there are cooperative effects between O/Cu and ZnO which increases the total amount of formate formed; for ZnO{sub x}/0.2 ML O/Cu(110) surfaces, the concentration of surface formate doubles on the three-component system as compared to the sum of the concentration of formate species on the separate components. This produces a change in the relative surface formate to methoxy ratio from 1:9, for the case of 0.2 ML O/Cu(110), to 1:3, for the case of ZnO{sub x}/0.2 ML O/Cu(110) surfaces. 20 refs., 12 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1992-05-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; Journal Volume: 96; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: 28 May 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4542-4549","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: JPCHAX; ISSN 0022-3654; TRN: 96:006502-0076","10.1021/j100190a076","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","555063","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/555063","","Journal of Physical Chemistry","11","96"

Although the intrinsic reason for requiring such high temperatures is still unclear, it is well known that at these temperatures mobility of lattice oxygen in an oxide catalyst becomes significant. The importance of the oxygen-anion mobility with respect to C[sub 2] formation has received only little attention. In the present work, CaO-CeO[sub 2] mixed oxides which form solid solutions with highly mobile lattice oxygen are applied as model catalysts to evaluate the influence of oxygen mobility on C[sub 2] formation. A marked advantage of this catalyst system is the possibility of varying oxygen-ion conductivity in a controllable way by changing the CaO content; electron conductivity is negligible compared to anion conductivity for this solid material.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 317-320","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90290-X","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","6936410","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6936410","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:1"

This includes crossed aldol condensations of aldehydes and ketones and stepwise C[sub 1] linear additions, both occurring in normal and oxygen retention reversal modes, as well as reversible ketonization reactions, and is consistent with chemical equilibrium constraints affecting the following reactions: methanol synthesis, water-gas shift, hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, ester formation, and ketonization. Using nine rate parameters, the model successfully describes the concentrations of 20 primary alcohols and ketones (and of the species related by chemical equilibria) as functions of contact time, temperature, pressure, and feed composition. The formation of about 50 additional compounds in trace amounts is also predicted which are indeed not detected in the synthesis products. The parameter estimates show that aldol condensations are one order of magnitude faster than C[sub 1] additions, indicate a greater reactivity of aldehydes than ketones, attribute a significant role to reverse ketonizations in the chain growth process in parallel to alkol condensations, and demonstrate the specific inhibiting action of water on condensations with oxygen retention reversal and ketonization.

It is shown by EPR and diffuse reflectance spectroscopies that two types of molybdenum were deposited onto silica during the grafting reaction: (i) grafted Mo as [triple bond]SiOMoCl[sub 4] (g = 1.9652 and g = 1.968), and (ii) physically adsorbed Mo as the diamagnetic Mo[sub 2] Cl[sub 10] dimer; this compound turns blue in air because of both its partial oxidation and hydrolysis to form the so-called molybdenum blues. After the grafting reaction itself, the second step involves washing by water or ammonia solution.

In consequence, at the very end of the preparation, only the grafted Mo species remains on the silica and the sample color is brown. The catalytic behavior of the unwashed and washed catalysts in the reaction of methanol oxidation emphasizes the differences in the Mo species. The unwashed sample containing molybdenum blues behaves like a polycrystalline MoO[sub 3] catalyst, producing mainly methylal at low reaction temperature (230 C) and formaldehyde at higher temperature (280 C), whereas the washed one, containing only grafted Mo, produces mainly methylformate and, to a lower extent, formaldehyde.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 156-172","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90277-O","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6975831","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6975831","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:1"

Oxidative coupling of methane has been covered in a number of recent reviews. In the authors' recent studies, rare earth oxides have been compared for their acid/base strength distribution and catalytic activity of the OCM process, and a mechanism for the formation of methyl radicals involving acid-base pairs on the catalyst surface has been suggested. According to this mechanism, the formation of the methyl radical involves the transfer of an electron from CH[sub 3][sup [minus]] to an oxygen molecule. Hence, for the rare earth oxide catalyst to be active in the OCM process, the presence of free oxygen is essential. Earlier, Lin et al. have observed the requirement of free O[sub 2] for the formation of methyl radicals on La[sub 2]O[sub 3] (at 773 K) in substantial concentrations. It is therefore very interesting to compare the catalytic activity/selectivity of the rare earth oxides in the conversion of methane and also of ethane and ethylene (which are the desirable products of the OCM) in the absence and presence of free oxygen for understanding the catalytic process. These studies could be carried out very conveniently using a pulse microreactor. The present investigation was undertaken for this purpose. The rare earth metal oxide catalysts studied were La[sub 2]O[sub 3], CeO[sub 2], Sm[sub 2]O[sub 3], Eu[sub 2]O[sub 3], and Yb[sub 2]O[sub 3].","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 135:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 310-316","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90289-T","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7024831","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024831","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","135:1"

Significant amounts of C{sub 2}{sup +} were produced ({approximately}35% C{sub 2}{sup +} carbon selectivity at {approximately} 15% methane conversion) at temperatures much lower than those of conventional low-pressure catalytic oxidative coupling (550-600 vs 750-900 {degrees}C). The observed selectivity/conversion behavior, however, was not unusual compared to conventional oxidative coupling literature data. The modes C{sub 2}{sup +} selectivity influence of a samarium oxide catalyst run at the same atypical conditions supports the view that noncatalytic gas-phase radical reactions play a strong role in conventional oxidative coupling. At the conditions of the present study, direct conversion of methane to methanol and C{sub 2}{sup +} products appears to depend upon the relative contributions of two pathways, increasing oxygen partial pressure and/or temperature favor C{sub 2}{sup +}, while reducing these parameters favors methanol.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 31:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1259-1261","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00005a003","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7103106","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7103106","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","31:5"

Probable reaction intermediates of the ethanol dehydration such as protonated ethanol dimer ((C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH){sub 2}H{sup +}) and monomer (C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH{sub 2}{sup +}) were directly identified in this phase by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

The BET area and the chemisorption of CO[sub 2] increase rapidly with increasing Na[sup +] content, reaching a maximum, and then decrease sharply to a low value. The basicity seems to be closely related to BET area rather than to Na[sup +] content. Fresh samples showed only the XRD pattern of MgO, but used samples gave diffraction peaks of an unidentified new crystalline phase. XPS studies gave also a new Na 1s peak with lower BE for used samples. Surface elemental analysis and sputtering indicate the confining of Na[sup +] to the surface, and the loss of Na[sup +] and the increase of surface oxygen on use. Infrared examination established the formation of HCOONa during reaction. Plots of Ln X (X is % conversion of MF) against time on stream give broken lines indicating rapid and slow deactivation stages. The rapid stage is supposed to be related for formate formation and the slow stage to Na[sup +] loss, surface area decrease, and other causes, such as poisoning. TPSR and FTPSR (frontal temperature programmed surface reaction) studies reveal the delay of CO evolution compared to methanol in the decomposition of dissociatively adsorbed MF, the start of substantial conversion of MR at around 483 K, and the appearance of H[sub 2] above 600 K. Two mechanisms might have been involved in the decomposition of MF, one is dissociative and the other non-dissociative. Strong basic centers of Na[sub 2]O are believed to be the active sites, and MgO serves mainly as a carrier.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 644-653","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7024871","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7024871","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

Below 900 K the CH[sub 4] formation has an apparent order of [approx equal]1.2 in p[sub H], and [approx equal]0.3 in p[sub CO]. Under most experimental conditions the rate of CO[sub 2] formation (E[sub a](app) = 40-50 kJ/mol) is higher than that of CH[sub 4] formation (E[sub a](app) = 130-150 kJ/mol), resulting in carbon deposition. Only at pressures above 5 bar can CO be selectively converted with H[sub 2] into CH[sub 4] and CO[sub 2] above 900 K. Hydrogenation of the support and of the carbon deposited by the CO disproportionation is not catalysed by potassium. A reactive carbon intermediate is proposed, formed by catalysed dissociation of CO. This can either react with hydrogen to form methane or form the carbon deposite. The oxygen is removed by CO in a manner similar to that in potassium-catalysed oxygen exchange reactions. The observed deactivation is ascribed to a combined effect of blocking of the active sites by carbon deposition and migration of metallic potassium into the carbon matrix, leading to H[sub 2] adsorption on the liberated carbon edge sites, as revealed by temperature-programmed desorption. Potassium is hardly lost at all during the methanation experiments.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 525-535","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90339-J","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","6945652","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6945652","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

Cu/Co/Al amorphous precursors were prepared by means of the citric complexing method. Four different decompositions-calcination procedures were employed: I. Air-air 500 C; II, N[sub 2]-N[sub 2] 500 C; III, N[sub 2] 500 C-air 500 C, and IV, N[sub 2] 280 C-air 500 C. Th physicochemical properties of the mixed oxides (major surface species, porous structure, binary phases) were influenced by the decomposition-calcination procedure employed. The mixed oxides obtained through procedure II and III exhibited poor higher alcohol selectivites. The mixed oxides obtained through procedures I and IV exhibited similar physicochemical properties and catalytic activities. XRD and TPR characterization identified the formation of CuO and Co[sub 3]O[sub 4] oxides and Co(Cu)Al[sub 2]O[sub 4] aluminates. Surface species were mostly CuO and Co[sub 3]O[sub 4]. The distribution of the metals was uniform and the surface area values were relatively high (60-65 m[sup 2]/g). These catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity and were selective for the formation of alcohols, producing 52-54 wt% of total alcohols and 23-25 wt% of ethanol and higher alcohols. The catalytic results suggest that the homogeneous distribution of the metallic elements is crucial to higher alcohol synthesis.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 594-607","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90345-I","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6975847","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6975847","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

It was found that while the activity for formation of carbon oxides was not influenced by the ratio MgO/CaO, both selectivity and activity to C[sub 2] hydrocarbons were maximum (67% and 14.5 C-mmol h g, respectively) with 85% MgO/CaO at 1023 K. The values increased with increasing reaction temperature. Physical properties such as the strain in the MgO lattice and the amount of strongly adsorbed CO[sub 2] were also maximum at the same composition. It was found that most of the surface species was MgO for Mg-rich oxides. Surface basicity, which was estimated by the wavenumber difference of the asymmetric and symmetric IR absorption bands of surface carbonates, was associated with these properties. The basicity of MgO, which was promoted by incorporated CaO, is considered to be the main factor for promoting the coupling activity.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 422-433","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90332-C","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","6993421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6993421","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

It is suggested that the mode of action of such catalysts involves metal promotion of the oxide productivity by enhancement of the equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies. A large contribution to the enthalpy of formation of an oxygen vacancy in an oxide comes from the energy required to raise two electrons to the oxide conduction band. Any metal which forms a Schottky junction with a given oxide can give rise to an active catalyst because in such cases the conduction band edge lies higher in energy than the metal Fermi level. The enthalpy of formation of a doubly ionized vacancy is reduced by allowing electrons to move to the metal Fermi level. This scheme predicts that catalyst productivity is dependent on metal/oxide contact area. Hence, catalyst microstructure determines the absolute activity. However, the junction effect theory is not without controversy. In light of the junction effect hypothesis, the authors reported earlier on an investigation of the activity and microstructure of Ag/CeO[sub 2] systems derived from binary Ce-Ag alloys. They have extended their earlier studies to examine the methanol synthesis activity of Au/CeO[sub 2] catalysts derived by the oxidative activation of CeAu[sub 2].","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 747-750","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90359-P","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","7180553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7180553","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

The model takes into account the effects on the overall kinetics due to finite residence time of intermediates on the surface, diffusional rate of lattice oxygen, and overall stoichiometry of the reaction. It is shown that except under the condition when adsorption of the hydrocarbon reactant is the slow step, the rate expression derived from this model differs from that obtained with a model in which these effects are neglected. One important consequence of the model is that the rate of consumption of hydrocarbon can be changed if the selectivity of the reaction is changed, even when reoxidation of the catalyst is the rate-limiting step. In such a circumstance, the rate might show an order dependence in oxygen partial pressure, the apparent activation energy reflects that of reoxidation and the temperature dependence of the selectivity, and the apparent preexponential factor is also influenced by the stoichiometry of the reaction. The implications of these to the interpretation of substituent effects and deuterium kinetic isotope effects are discussed.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 691-701","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90353-J","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7180591","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7180591","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:2"

In this approach, [sup 12]CO was adsorbed at 300 K and the catalyst temperature was then raised in H[sub 2] flow to facilitate spillover. The heating ramp was interrupted before a significant amount of CH[sub 4] formed, and the sample was quickly cooled to 300 K. Then the catalyst was exposed to [sup 13]CO to displace any [sup 12]CO that remained on the Pd surface. At room temperature, gas phase CO readily exchanges with adsorbed CO on Pd. The authors also observed previously that gas phase CO does not exchange with CH[sub 3]O on Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] of Ni/Al[sub 2]O[sub 3]. Thus, any [sup 12]CO remaining on the catalyst after exchange was assumed to be present as [sup 12]CH[sub 3]O on the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] surface. The amount of [sup 12]CH[sub 4] that formed during the subsequent TPR was thus a measure of how much [sup 12]CO had spilled over to the Al[sub 2]O[sub 3] since all the adsorbed [sup 12]CH[sub 3]O was hydrogenated to [sup 12]CH[sub 4].

At lower and higher coverages, methanol decomposes via the more traditional methoxy intermediate. Moreover, when methyl is formed, it is not observed to decompose until the temperature is raised to 400 K. This thermal behavior is quite unusual since CH{sub 3} has been observed to combine with H to desorb as CH{sub 4} below 300 K, dimerize to produce C{sub 2}H{sub 6} below 200 K, or dehydrogenate to form CH{sub 2} and H below 200 K. In addition, it is found that methyl undergoes sequential dehydrogenation as the temperature is increased to form CH{sub 2} at 400 K, CH at 500 K, and C at >500 K.

The HOMO of Ni{sup I}F(NH{sub 3}){sub 4}({eta}{sup 1}-CO{sub 2}) is largely contributed from the O p{sub {pi}} orbital and lies higher in energy than the HOMO (nonbonding {pi} orbital) of the uncomplexed CO{sub 2}.

As a result, the coordinated CO{sub 2} in Ni{sup I}F(NH{sub 3}){sub 4}({eta}{sup 1}-CO{sub 2}) is activated to electrophilic attack and is expected to undergo facile protonation.

A half reaction order in the oxygen pressure and the first order in ethanol pressure were obtained, both of which remained nearly unchanged with the SAW on.

The relationship between the acid-base properties and the catalytic behavior was investigated. The number and character of acidic sites of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} catalysts were determined by studying the adsorption of a basic molecule using microcalorimetry. The reducibility level and the evolution of the surface state, as well as the heat evolved, were studied by using a pulse method with pure ethane only. The reaction of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation was studied by a continuous flow method and the activation energies for the formation of C{sub 2}H{sub 4} and CO were calculated. The selectivity of the catalyst was interpreted in connection with the acid-base properties. The strong sites were observed to decrease rapidly with time on stream, although the catalysts were still active.

According to Efren Medellin, superintendent of vehicle maintenance at the Orange County Transit Authority, two LPG buses had registered a total of 31,000 moles with relatively little, if any, downtime. The two methanol buses had run a total of 30,000 miles while the two CNG buses had traveled only 5000 miles. Furthermore the methanol and CNG buses have had their share of downtime for new parts and other problems. The propane-powered buses appear to be running consistently well without mechanical difficulties. The only problem that occurred was occasional backfiring. As a result, the electronic controls were replaced and no subsequent complaints were heard.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Butane-Propane News; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0521-9140; CODEN: BUPNA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5581803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5581803","","Butane-Propane News; (United States)","","24:3"

The principal emphasis of this study was to determine the reaction pathways and intermediates involved in alcohol and aldehyde decomposition. Propoxide intermediates were formed by the dissociation of 1-propanol; these were easily isolated in the HREEL spectrum at 147 K. Decarbonylation occurred at ca. 226 K, resulting in the formation of adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments and adsorbed CO. No aldehyde or acyl intermediates were detected during the course of the decomposition of this primary alcohol. 1-Propanol decomposed on the Rh(111) surface to produce CO, H[sub 2], and surface carbon. In contrast, propionaldehyde adsorbed on Rh(111) decomposed to form ethane, as well as CO, H[sub 2], and surface carbon. At 145 K, [eta][sup 2](C,O)-propionaldehyde was observed by HREELS. By 251 K, some decarbonylation had occurred to yield bridge-bonded CO and ethyl species. A portion of the ethyl species formed by low temperature decarbonylation of propionaldehyde was hydrogenated to ethane, while the rest dehydrogenated to form ethylidynes, observed at 301 K by HREELS. Ethylidyne species dehydrogenated to acetylides which ultimately decomposed to carbon and hydrogen. The surprising divergence of reaction pathways for propanol and propionaldehyde is consistent with observations for ethanol and acetaldehyde decomposition on Rh(111) and suggests that higher alkoxide decomposition on this surface may involve C-H scission along the alkyl chain, rather than at the [alpha]-carbon. 36 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Langmuir; (United States); Journal Volume: 8:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 862-869","","","FG02-84ER13290","Journal ID: ISSN 0743-7463; CODEN: LANGD5","10.1021/la00039a021","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5652136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5652136","","Langmuir; (United States)","","8:3"

In this paper, the authors present results of the investigation of this synergy effect using an isotopic labeling technique coupled with in situ laser Raman spectroscopy. Results from these studies, when integrated with their previous work, provide complementary evidence for the catalytic job distribution of the two phases, in which the MoO{sub 3} phase incorporates its lattice oxygen into the hydrocarbon molecule, while the simple molybdate phase provides the oxygen necessary to regenerate MoO{sub 3} sites through an oxygen spillover mechanism. The in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments combined with structural specificity studies provide further clues about the catalytic sites responsible for selective versus complete oxidation.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 24-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90206-W","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6983829","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6983829","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:1"

So far as the supported molybdenum oxide forms a monolayer, the turnover frequency of methanol oxidation increases linearly with the Mo surface concentration; this is evidence for two neighboring Mo sites as an active site for the reaction. On further loading, however, MoO{sub 3} forms a large isolated crystal in the macropore without formation of a multiple overlayer, and strong acid sites are created. Large crystals and acid sites thus formed are, however, not available for the reaction, since the turnover frequency is constant.

Combining these data with the selectivity and activity in synthesis gas to oxygenate conversion, a model is derived from which reaction rates of elementary steps and surface concentrations are calculated. Ethanal formation appears to occur at two distinguishable sites. Vanadium promotion decreases the desorption rate of ethanal, enhances the hydrogenation rate to ethanol, and increases the surface concentration of oxygenated intermediates.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 13-23","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90205-V","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","7169770","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7169770","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:1"

Three such systems were studied: unpromoted, K-promoted, and KCl-promoted manganese oxide. In each case the effect of pulses of CHCl{sub 3} on the activity, selectivity, and catalyst structure was determined. Depending on the conditions, various oxides or mixed oxides of Mn were present. Of these, Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} is an unselective total oxidation catalyst; K-promotion stabilizes this phase, drastically reducing CO{sub 2} formation and raising C{sub 2} activity. Chloride ions (added as KCl) prevent the formation of highly unselective potassium manganese oxides. Chlorine introduced from the gas phase has an additional effect: C{sub 2} activity is further enhanced leaving CO{sub 2} production unaffected. This form of chlorine promotion is greatly augmented by the presence of KCl. There are strong indications that the effects of chlorine involved substantial modification of the surface chemistry and are not purely due to Cl atom-induced homogeneous chemistry.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 242-252","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90225-7","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","7244752","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7244752","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:1"

Furthermore, the results showed that the presence of promoter favored the formation of longer chain alcohols, accompanied by decreases in the C{sub 1}OH-C{sub 4}OH fraction. C{sub 2}- and C{sub 3}-olefin selectivity was studied as a function of reactor operating conditions, and the selectivity was found to decrease with increasing temperature, pressure (constant conversion), reciprocal space velocity (space-time), and conversion. Bulk catalyst characterization by XRD and DSC suggested that the promoter did not influence the bulk structure of the catalyst. The potassium promoter concentrated on the surface as demonstrated from BET surface area measurements and XPS studies. BET measurements showed the catalyst surface area to initially decrease at low levels of promoter (0% potassium, 13.2 m{sup 2}/g; 0.01% potassium, 10.1 m{sup 2}/g), and then to increase with increased promoter loadings (1% potassium, 17.0 m{sup 2}/g). XPS studies on a 0.25% potassium promoted catalyst showed a surface aggregation of the potassium promoter from the bulk to occur during stages of calcination (6%), reduction (10%) and subsequent CO hydrogenation (2-4%). The data from the study suggest that the role of potassium is to modify the concentration of cobalt active sites and simultaneously to assist in the breakdown of the CO reactant.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 186-203","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90221-3","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7245128","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7245128","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:1"

Transient model experiments employing temperature-programmed surface reaction spectroscopy and pulse surface reaction rate analysis were used to unravel changes in rates of elementary reaction steps. CO dissociation is the rate-limiting step in the overall methanation reaction. The rate of CO dissociation is found to be enhanced by vanadium. The activation energy is lowered from 90 kJ/mol for Rh/SiO{sub 2} to 65 kJ/mol for the promoted catalyst. The activation energy for CO dissociation is not dependent on the hydrogen partial pressure, while it is a strong function of the CO surface coverage. CO adsorption at temperatures above 250 C results in very reactive surface carbonaceous intermediates. Even at {minus}15 C methane formation was observed upon hydrogenation. This reactive surface carbon can be incorporated in higher hydrocarbons. This process is favored by vanadium promotion.","","","","","","United States","1992-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 134:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90204-U","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","6984950","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6984950","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","134:1"

Accumulation of carbidic carbon intermediates on the Ni(100) surface results in a (2 {times} 2)p4g overlayer, and its hydrogenation proceeds at a rate almost equal to that of a steady-state methanation reaction. In contrast to the carbide overlayer on the Ni(100) surface, the LEED pattern of the carbide overlayer on the Ni(111) surface is too complex to be solved. A single-domain carbide on a Ni(111) surface accidentally obtained by the segregation of carbon allowed the authors to deduce the structure of the carbide overlayer on the Ni(111) surface. It was shown that the carbide overlayer on Ni(111) has exactly the same arrangement of carbon atoms as that of the (2 {times} 2)p4g structure on the Ni(100) surface. In addition, the carbide overlayer undergoes decomposition at 685 K on Ni(100), Ni(110), and Ni(111) surfaces. Therefore, they conclude that the accumulation of carbidic intermediates creates an identical surface carbide on Ni(100) and Ni(111) surfaces. This may be a reason for the structure-insensitive catalysis, because the methanation may be catalyzed by this surface carbide on Ni(100) and Ni(111) surfaces.","","","","","","United States","1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 133:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 461-466","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90253-E","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","6984933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6984933","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","133:2"

This increased the rate of CO desorption because of the repulsive interactions present between CO molecules on Ni at high coverages and because readsorption on Ni was decreased. These studies show that CH{sub 3}O must undergo reverse spillover onto the Ni surface in order to decompose. Decomposition directly on the Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} surface does not occur at these temperatures. Carbon isotope labeling and temperature-programmed desorption were used to study this process.

The grouping of metal oxides based on the production of the less stable alkene isomers from 2-octanol is similar to that for trans-2-methlycyclohexanol. It is proposed that the same catalytic properties determine the selectivity for both reactants: for smaller metal cations the product selectivity is determined by steric crowding in the transition state, and for the larger cations the product selectivity is determined by the basicity of the oxygen anion and the relative acidity of the {beta}-hydrogens that are eliminated to produce water.","","","","","","United States","1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 133:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 445-460","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90252-D","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","7105536","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7105536","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","133:2"

It was suggested that NMBI enriches the Ru hydride species and accelerates the CO insertion to the hydride and the hydroxymethyl species by acting as a ligand and a base. The Ru anionic hydride species has a much lower activity for the CO hydrogenation to form FAL and a higher activity for the MeOH formation that proceeds via the methoxy species. The studies on catalyst concentration dependencies by means of batchwise reaction revealed the involvement of dinuclear mechanisms, which probably worked in the reductive elimination of the acyl complexes.","","","","","","United States","1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 133:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 332-341","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90244-C","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7107071","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7107071","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","133:2"

Although hydrogen-promoted methane formation, experiments with deuterium and methanol-d{sub 1}(MeOD) clarified that the hydrogen of the methanol hydroxyl group is the exclusive hydrogen source of the CH{sub 4} formation and that this reaction occurs at nickel centers, which are also involved in the acyl compound formation. Temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments suggested that the hydrogen effect is caused by changes in the number of active sites and that neither methanol carbonylation nor methane formation proceeds at the larger nickel(0) crystallites detectable by XRD. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that under certain reaction conditions, hydrogen can induce a remarkable deactivation of the catalyst by promoting nickel aggregation. A mechanism that accounts for the hydrogen effects has been postulated.","","","","","","United States","1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 133:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 370-382","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(92)90247-F","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","7244567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7244567","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","133:2"

The energy content of the gas is high (the heat of methane combustion is 212.8 kg cals/mol) and carbon dioxide emissions are about 20% less than gasoline for production of a unit of energy. The use of natural gas as a transport fuel is limited by storage problems. High pressure storage requires a weight penalty associated with cylinders, and this limits the application to larger vehicles. Lower pressure adsorption beds are being studied, but adsorption capacities are too low (but only by a factor of ca 2-5) for vehicle application.

The quantity of surface intermediates detected during this real transient may or may not relate to those existing under steady-state reaction since the surface is experiencing major changes. Examination of reactive surface intermediates under steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis. This technique entails an abrupt switch in the isotopic composition of one of the reactants, which does not disturb the steady-state condition, accompanied by the continuous monitoring (e.g., by mass spectrometry) of the relaxation and evolution of labeled reactants and products. The main difference between these two techniques is the unavoidable perturbation of the reaction environment with non-steady-state isotopic transient techniques. Results are presented that detail for the first time some of the problems with trying to relate amounts of surface species measured under non-steady-state conditions to concentrations of surface reaction intermediates existing during the steady-state oxidative coupling of methane.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 132:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 556-559","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90170-9","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7106008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7106008","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","132:2"

Commercial processes exist which involve the oxidation of alkanes by O{sub 2} with cobalt carboxylate catalysts. Elevated temperatures and pressures are required, and the metal ion function is to decompose hydroperoxides formed in a radical-chain process. The authors have demonstrated that a weakly solvated cobalt-acetonitrile complex (Co(NCCH{sub 3}){sub 4})(PF{sub 6}){sub 2}, with a weakly coordinating anion catalyzes the air oxidation of alkanes under mild conditions (75C and 3 atm). Cyclohexane and adamantane are converted to the corresponding alcohol and ketone products. The commercial catalyst for cyclohexane oxidation does not function under these milder conditions. Experiments indicate a mechanism in which the metal ion functions both as an initiator and as a hydroperoxide decomposition catalyst.","","","","","","United States","1991-11-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorganic Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 30:24","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4506-4510","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0020-1669; CODEN: INOCA","10.1021/ic00024a009","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","7023296","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7023296","","Inorganic Chemistry; (United States)","","30:24"

Their formation, as well as that of branched isomers, is consistent with previously proposed surface reactions of alkyl groups on metal surfaces. Secondary hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis of {alpha}-olefins are inhibited by the water product of the synthesis step. However, {alpha}-olefin readsorption and surface chain initiation and cis-to-trans isomerization take place as secondary reactions. The decrease in {alpha}-olefin readsorption and surface chain initiation and cis-to-trans isomerization take place as secondary reactions. The decrease in {alpha}-olefin readsorption and surface chain initiation and cis-to-trans isomerization take place as secondary reactions. The decrease in {alpha}-olefin readsorption and surface chain initiation and cis-to-trans isomerization take place as secondary reactions. The decrease in {alpha}-olefin selectivity with increasing CO conversion and molecular size reflects the greater extent of readsorption as bed and pore residence times of {alpha}-olefin increase. Readsorption of {alpha}-olefins and chain initiation increases with molecular size because the rate of removal of olefins from liquid-filled catalyst pores is decreased due to intraparticle diffusion limitations. This diffusion-enhanced olefin readsorption accounts for the observed deviations of carbon number distributions from those predicted by Flory polymerization kinetics. Chain growth probability increases with chain length until an asymptotic value is reached. Readsorption decreases the contribution of termination via hydrogen abstraction to chain growth kinetics. In effect, differences in selectivity between small and large hydrocarbons are due to the increasing influence of pore residence times and the decreasing influence of bed residence times on secondary reactions as olefin size increases.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-03T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:20","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 7795-7804","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100173a046","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","7169553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7169553","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","95:20"

The catalysis rates proved to be nonlinear in [Rh][sub tot] over the range 3-20 mM, a result which was interpreted in terms of the system having dinuclear and mononuclear rhodium species present, both types of species being catalytically active but the mononuclear cycles being the more reactive. The rates also displayed a nonlinear dependence on P[sub CO] over the range 0.3-1.8 atm, although this was independent of [Rh]. The kinetics behavior with respect to P[sub CO] leads to the proposal of the reversible addition of CO to the catalytically active species prior tothe rate-limiting step in both the mono- and dinuclear catalytic cycles.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorganic Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 30:20","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3837-3842","","","FG03-85ER13317","Journal ID: ISSN 0020-1669; CODEN: INOCAJ","10.1021/ic00020a013","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7073256","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7073256","","Inorganic Chemistry; (United States)","","30:20"

The authors know the problem is solvable because several enzymes, including methane monooxygenase and the cytochrome P-450 dependent monooxygenases, can carry out this reaction. The authors have tried to combine simple chemical engineering with chemistry to obtain high selectivity in alkane reactions. The result is a system that is useful not only for alkanes but also for a wide variety of other organic molecules.

Because methanol is more costly than gasoline, fuel prices will also increase. On the other hand, methanol use will reduce ozone pollution and some of the health risks associated with gasoline. Considering all three markets affected by the phasing-out of gasoline, the switch to methanol results in net gains. The health benefits from lower pollution and the lives saved from the switch from gasoline to methanol are in addition to these gains. Overall, the benefits of the policy far outweigh the costs.

The procedure for obtaining the titania coatings involved reacting the silanol groups on the silica surface with titanium alkoxides under a N{sub 2} atmosphere. This self-limiting reaction led to a coating of dispersed titania on the silica spheres with a weight loading between 0.5 and 1.4 {times} 10{sup {minus}3} g/m{sup 2}. The dispersed titanium oxide on the silica spheres was visible as a surface texturing of the silica in TEM images, and led to over two orders of magnitude increase in the reactivity of the silica spheres for 1-propanol dehydration. Raman spectroscopy and TEM confirmed that the dispersed titania was stable to calcination in dry air at 973 K or to heating under a vacuum of 2 {times} 10{sup {minus}7} Torr up to 1,058 K. However, under alcohol dehydration reaction conditions, the dispersed titania transformed into crystals of anatase, 3 nm in diameter. On Cabosil-fumed silica, on the other hand, a similar preparation resulted in a titania loading (per square meter) that was only 7% of that seen on the silica spheres. Higher loadings caused the appearance of bands due to crystalline TiO{sub 2} (anatase) in the Raman spectra. The lower monolayer capacity on Cabosil silica can be correlated with the presence of singly bound hydroxyls as seen by IR. The Stober spheres on the other hand show hydroxyl bands that show significant hydrogen bonding.","","","","","","United States","1991-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 131:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 260-275","","","AC04-76DP00789","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90343-3","","2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","5757118","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5757118","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","131:1"

In sodium-modified silicalite-1, three kinds of the adsorption sites are present, that is, silanol sites, sodium-ion sites, and active oxygen bridge sites. Dissociative adsorption of methanol on the active oxygen bridge probably causes generation of silanol and methoxyl groups on the silicalite surface. by heating a sodium-modified silicalite-1 sample at 970 K, the number of the active oxygen bridges increased compared with that for the sample preheated at 770 K and its catalytic activity for methanol dehydrogenation also increased.

The rate of reaction follows the stability of the intermediate alkoxy species except for 2-propoxy which shows a slower rate than expected. This effect and the poisoning observed for saturation coverages of preadsorbed oxygen are due to the stabilization of the alkoxy species by coadsorbed surface hydroxyl groups or oxygen atoms.

Oxygen-exchange experiments in the absence of methane resulted in a quantification of the lattice oxygen diffusivity and total oxygen uptake. The catalyst had three more-or-less distinct regions: (1) the physical surface at which exchange between the gas phase and the solid occurred, (2) several subsurface atomic layers readily available for exchange, and (3) the bulk oxide. Using isotopic switches of oxygen and methane under steady-state reaction, the active intermediates along the carbon and oxygen reaction pathways are quantified. Lattice oxygen was found to play a significant role in the oxidation process under steady-state reaction. CO and CO{sub 2} appeared to be formed via a multistep surface oxidation pathway while ethane was formed via surface-generated intermediates along a parallel pathway. Sites involved with the generation of intermediates for selective coupling were found to have a lower activity than sites active for the generation of nonselective intermediates.","","","","","","United States","1991-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 131:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 143-155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90331-W","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","5792992","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5792992","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","131:1"

A relationship was found between the strength of the acid sites microcalorimetrically evaluated and the activation energy of the dehydration reaction, while the activation energy of the dehydrogenation reaction was independent of the strength of the catalytic sites.

The reverse occurs for benzene. At higher cesium coverages ({Theta}{sub Cs} {ge} 0.15), the molecular TDS peaks for benzene, cyclohexane, and cyclopentene shifted to lower temperatures. This shift is attributed to steric hindrance of the preferred hydrocarbon adsorption site by cesium adatoms.

In CO{sub 2} hydrogenations over these catalysts, methane is almost exclusively produced, and traces of ethane are formed besides, as evidenced by gas chromatography. To study the origins of this selectivity behavior, in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy has been applied. Surface species in carbon dioxide as well as carbon monoxide hydrogenation reactions are correlated with the formation of gas-phase products. CO{sub 2}/H{sub 2} mixtures rapidly yield surface formate as the immediate precursor of the methane product on the coprecipitated catalyst. Doubly and singly bound adsorbed CO is detected besides; doubly bound CO is observed to originate from surface formate. In CO/H{sub 2} reactions, higher saturated hydrocarbons are produced besides methane. The formation of these products proceeds from singly bound adsorbed CO via a dissociative mechanism. The respective hydrogenation steps are discussed in detail in a corresponding reaction scheme.","","","","","","United States","1991-08-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:16","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 6341-6346","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100169a049","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7081045","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7081045","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","95:16"

However, the relationship of the catalytic activity/selectivity with the surface acidity/basicity is not straightforward; it is quite complex. Stronger acid sites are found to be harmful for the selectivity. There is a possibility of an involvement of an acid-base pair (M{sub LC}{sup n+} O{sub LC}{sub 2{minus}}, where subscript LC denotes low coordination) on the surface in the abstraction of the H-atom from adsorbed methane molecule by its polarization followed by heterolytic C-H bond rupture to form CH{sub 3}{sup {minus}} (which interacts with M{sub LC}{sup n+}) and (OH){sub LC}{sup {minus}} and a transfer of electron from the carbanion to O{sub 2}, resulting methyl radical and O{sub 2}{sup {minus}}.

In the absence of CO{sub 2}, both the methanol and HAS yields reach a maximum as the K{sub 2}CO{sub 3} promoter concentration increases. The complex behavior results from the ability of these catalysts to incorporate CO, CO{sub 2}, and methanol into higher alcohols, on at least two different types of catalytic sites. It is suggested that CO{sub 2} participates directly in HAS on copper sites while alkali/copper interfacial sites are involved in converting CO.

The decarbonylation of acetaldehyde produced methane at 267 K in TPD. For acetaldehyde coverages less than 0.05 monolayer, no methane was desorbed, but for a coverage that saturated the first layer, methane was produced with 50% selectivity. Coadsorbing deuterium with a low coverage of acetaldehyde resulted in the enhancement of methane production. This result indicates that the selectivity to methane was partially controlled by the availability of hydrogen atoms on the surface required to hydrogenate the hydrocarbon species produced by acetaldehyde decarbonylation. Monodeuterated methane was the primary methane product observed after these coadsorption experiments. Thus it was concluded that acetaldehyde decarbonylates via a methyl migration mechanism on the Rh(111) surface. Decarbonylation of ethanol did not produce methane. The absence of methane production indicated that the decomposition of ethanol on the Rh(111) surface did not proceed via dehydrogenation to adsorbed acetaldehyde, but instead, ethanol appeared to dehydrogenate by methyl hydrogen abstraction resulting in the formation of an oxametallacycle. Since this proposed intermediate rapidly dehydrogenated to carbon monoxide and surface carbon, it was difficult to characterize spectroscopically. The existence of an ethanol decomposition pathway that does not include acetaldehyde intermediates indicates that ethanol formation on supported Rh catalysts may not be the result of acetaldehyde hydrogenation.","","","","","","United States","1991-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 130:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 528-546","","","FG02-84ER13290","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90133-O","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5564775","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5564775","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","130:2"

Functionalization of cyclohexane gave cyclohexanol (CyOH) and cylcohexanone (CyONE). The presence of an oxidizing intermediate was suggested by iodometric titration in the functionalization of cyclohexane with complexes 1-4 and H{sub 2}O{sub 2}. This intermediate was isolated from the reaction mixture and identified by {sup 13}C NMR as cyclohexyl hydroperoxide (CyOOH) as compared to an independently prepared sample. The decomposition of CyOOH by 1-4 and H{sub 2}O{sub 2} gave CyOH/CyONE ratios of 0.7, 0.9, 0.7, and 2.8, respectively, in the ranges observed in the actual cyclohexane oxidation reactions. These hydrocarbon oxidation reactions were also inhibited by 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenol. Reactions run under a sweep of argon gave mmol of product/mmol of Fe complex 0-31% of the normal values. These results are consistent with a free-radical chain mechanism in which an initially formed cyclohexyl radical is trapped by oxygen gas to give a cyclohexyl peroxyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom to give CyOOH and carry the chain.

Benzaldehyde reacted with benzene derivatives to afford mixtures of diaryl- and triarylmethanes. Formation of ditolyl- and dianisylmethanes in the corresponding reactions indicated that bulky triarylmethanes, once formed inside the crystalline framework, have strong diffusional limitations to get out of the zeolite cavities and can undergo subsequent protolytic cleavage. A decrease in the activity of the zeolite to catalyze hydride transfer reactions lead to a decrease on the diphenylmethane yield. Finally, diphenylmethane appears as a primary product indicating that a series of consecutive reactions such as the formation of diarylcarbinols followed by protonation, water elimination, and hydride abstraction are taking place inside the pores of the zeolite before the real primary product comes out from the zeolite.","","","","","","United States","1991-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 130:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 138-146","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90098-O","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5653338","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5653338","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","130:1"

This catalyst was specially developed to achieve high selectivity to liquid hydrocarbons (C{sub 5}- c{sub 12} range). Runs were performed in a continuous process development unit specially designed for assessing the viability of the pseudoadiabatic operation for this complex reaction system. It was observed that the pseudoadiabatic regime was obtained in an important range of the following conditions: 2.4 -16.9 L(STP)/min input flow, 350-380{degrees} C inlet temperature, 20-34 atm total pressure, 0.73-1.4 H{sub 2}/CO ratio. It was found that the bifunctional catalyst operated without equilibrium limitations for methanol formation favoring the synthesis of hydrocarbons in the gasoline range. Under the considered conditions, the liquid productivity varied from 0.0035 to 0.0136 kg/h and the selectivity to aromatics from 38.7 to 70.8% (weight percent of aromatics in total hydrocarbons). A simulation of the reactor with a pseudohomogeneous model was also performed.

According to the literature it is possible to enhance the rate of carbon monoxide hydrogenation and to affect the selectivity by the addition of a modifier to the silica support. However, another method which may be used is modification of the rhodium, after reduction, by a suitable adsorbate. Hence we embarked on a short programme of work aimed at studying the effect of pre-adsorbed sulphur, deposited from hydrogen sulphide and carbonyl sulphide, on the activity and selectivity of rhodium-catalysed carbon monoxide hydrogenation. Each catalyst exhibited a typical period (approximately 1 h) of non-steady-state behaviour immediately after coming on stream before settling to steady-state operation. Once steady-state conditions had been achieved, reproducible activities and selectivities were observed. Activities and selectivities obtained at 548 K are shown in 2 figures and a table.","","","","","","United States","1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 129:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 540-543","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5724877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5724877","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","129:2"

They found that none of the alloy surfaces were more effective catalysts than any of the pure platinum surfaces under the conditions of measurement employed here and that alloying platinum with tin to any extent significantly reduced the activity. As reported previously by others, they observed tin to spontaneously adsorb on platinum surfaces from dilute sulfuric acid supporting electrolyte containing Sn(II) in concentrations above ca. 5 {mu}M. At a given concentration, the coverage by tin decreased as the atomic density of the platinum surface increased. However, they did not observe any enhancement of methanol oxidation on any platinum modified by this irreversibly adsorbed tin. They did observe a diffusion-limited enhancement on Pt(111) and on Pt(100) due to Sn(II) in the electrolyte at 1 {mu}M concentration. At this concentration, tin did not appear to be adsorbed to any observable extent, and the catalysis appeared to occur via the direct interaction of a dissolved tin species with the surface. They propose a mechanism of catalysis that is a hybrid homogeneous-heterogeneous sequence based on known homogeneous Pt-Sn catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 3740-3746","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100162a056","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5988480","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5988480","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","95:9"

Recently, particular attention has been directed at the rate of growth of soot particles when rich premixed hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures are burned in a flat flame, but an alternative approach is to compare the reported growth rates for soot particles in flames with those predicted from the rate constants for pyrocarbon growth in the absence of soot nucleation. In this paper it is shown that in the absence of soot formation there is no difference in the growth processes of soot particles and pyrocarbon. The observed discrepancy in the growth rate constants for a soot surface and a quartz filaments (4.5 times for methane and 2-3 times for other hydrocarbons) results from the appearance of a rough surface on the quartz. It is known that when soot is formed in the course of methane pyrolysis, the growth rate of particles is two order higher than the pyrocarbon growth rate in the absence of soot formation, and the same effect has been observed with other hydrocarbons. This acceleration in the soot particle growth at low hydrocarbon concentration is caused by destruction of hydrocarbon radicals on the growing surface. Acceleration of pyrocarbon growth in the thermal decomposition of methane, acetylene, and benzene is also found at temperatures up to 1400{degrees} C in pipes of 1 mm diameter, and soot formation is prevented with the rate of gas flows of 100 ms{sup {minus}1}. The present calculations were made for typical mixtures compositions in premixed sooting flames for which detailed data on the growth of soot particles has been presented.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (United States); Journal Volume: 85:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 279-281","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(91)90196-I","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5092861","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5092861","","Combustion and Flame; (United States)","","85:1"

A kinetic scheme consisting of over 250 elementary reactions was applied for an ideal plug flow reactor, and the most important reaction paths leading to N{sub 2}O were identified and quantified for a number of conditions relevant for fluidized bed combustion. In addition, the effect of different operating parameters on N{sub 2}O formation was investigated, and the results were compared to the existing data from laboratory and full-scale experiments.

The results are presented graphically as a function of surface heat flux and ambient pressure. The ignition process was found to be roughly divided into two regions of self- sustaining ignition (S.S.I.) and non-S.S.I., depending on whether the ignition reaction is self-sustained or extinguished when the external radiation is interrupted after ignition. Furthermore, the non-S.S.I. was composed of two regions of radiation-assisted combustion (R.A.C.) and radiation-assisted unstable combustion (R.A.U.). The addition of nitramines, in particular HMX to AP-based composite propellants resulted in a marked reduction in the ignition times and made the self-sustaining ignition region shift to lower heat fluxes at each specific pressure. It was found, from the results of differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry, that nitramine-containing propellants exhibit an exothermic decomposition at relatively low temperatures that is independent of the presence of other ingredients. This triggers the ignition reaction of the AP- based propellants and lowers temperature of the main exotherm. Consequently, it appears that the improvement of ignitability by the addition of nitramines is due to the intense low-temperature exothermic reaction of nitramines. It was found from the time-temperature histories measured with fine thermocouples on the surface during the ignition process that ignition temperatures also are lowered by the addition of nitramines.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (United States); Journal Volume: 85:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 68-76","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(91)90177-D","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5092873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5092873","","Combustion and Flame; (United States)","","85:1"

Methane and other hydrocarbon production was held to less than 5% of the CO reacted. product could be controlled as the percent of higher alcohols in the anhydrous product to between 0 and 80%, and the identity of the alcohols could be controlled to predominantly ethanol, propanol, or isobutyl alcohol; these factors plus high production rates give the process exceptional commercial appeal.

Further characterization of catalyst acidic/metallic properties was conducted with 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane at 80{degree}C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the chemical state of Ni in the various catalysts. Two series of catalysts were investigated: 0.7, 2.7, 4.7, and 8.5 wt% Ni/SiO{sub 2} prepared by precipitation of basic NiCO{sub 3} on the silica, and 4.8 and 6.0 wt% NiSiO{sub 2} prepared by neutral impregnation with nickel nitrate. Various pretreatment and reduction conditions were investigated; for the 0.7-8.5% series it was found that the temperature of drying prior to reduction/reaction was an important variable. For the 8.5% catalyst, temperature of reduction also became an important factor. Study of the ether formation activities for various catalysts from both series, in conjunction with XPS investigation and 1-1 dimethylcyclopropane reactivity, indicated that the active site for ether formation is an acidic nickel silicate promoted by Ni(0). Ether formation is inversely related to surface-reduced Ni on these catalysts, thus it does not appear that large ensembles of zero-valent nickel play a significant role in the catalysis.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 128:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 337-351","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90293-D","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5740755","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5740755","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","128:2"

However, the importance of radiative heat feedback in metalized propellant combustion is still unknown. In this study, radiative effects in aluminized propellants were examined by embedding optical fibers and microthermocouples in propellants to measure radiative and conductive feedback. Extinguishment by rapid depressurization was used to determine the condition and location of the thermocouple and optical fiber at the burning surface. Hemispherical reflectivity measurements were also made to determine propellant absorptivity. The reflectivity measurements showed that even a small amount of aluminum powder in a propellant increases the absorptivity significantly through multiple scattering in spite of the intrinsically high-bulk reflectivity of aluminum. The results of this study confirm previous findings that the effect of radiation on burning rate in nonmetalized propellants is negligible because of low incident flux from the flame and low absorptivity of the propellant.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (USA); Journal Volume: 84:1 and 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 41-153","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(91)90043-B","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","5641700","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5641700","","Combustion and Flame; (USA)","","84:1 and 2"

However, when gas motion is completely absent, which may occur in the quiescent, microgravity environment of a spacecraft; the importance of radiation compared to convection is enhanced. The authors develop a theoretical model of flame spread over a thin solid fuel into an opposing flow of oxidizer, the opposing flow being present in the quiescent environment in flame-fixed coordinates, including the effects of radiative heat transfer from the fuel surface. Numerical solutions to the conservation equations in the gas and the solid phase and describe the spreading flame are presented for a variety of ambient conditions and surface emittances. When surface radiation is significant the solid surface acts as a heat sink, causing the flame to cool, shrink in size, and spread more slowly. Better agreement with experiment for net heat transfer to the surface is obtained when surface radiation is included. For low ambient oxygen levels, radiative effects lead to flame extinction. A radiation/conduction parameter is identified that adequately describes the importance of surface radiation.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (USA); Journal Volume: 84:1 and 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 160-169","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(91)90045-D","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","5641708","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5641708","","Combustion and Flame; (USA)","","84:1 and 2"

The utility of the shape selective acetalization of H-ZSM-5 in selectively reducing one aldehyde in presence of the other with sodium borohydride is also pointed out.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 128:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 63-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90066-D","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","5614564","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5614564","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","128:1"

Leading to a form of metal-support interaction and manifested by reduction rates which are much slower than for unsupported magnetite. These results are corroborated in subsequent oxidation experiments by the fact that CO{sub 2} oxidation rates of supported iron are much higher than for unsupported iron and the Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} phase formed in the former at 673 K is {gamma}-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} as opposed to {alpha}-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} in the latter.

Hydrogenolysis of n-butane, which is suppressed in the SMSI state, was used to monitor the onset and reversal of the SMSI state. When CO hydrogenation was performed on a Pt/TiO{sub 2} catalyst subjected to high temperature reduction, there was almost a complete restoration of hydrogenolysis activity. This implies that the working catalyst surface during CO hydrogenation is free of the site-blocking oxide species responsible for the SMSI state. The ratio of hydrogenolysis/isomerization activity of n-butane was also unaffected by onset of the SMSI state. Therefore, the migration of TiO{sub x} over the metal surface during SMSI does not cause selective suppression of hydrogenolysis with respect to isomerization. The site-blocking oxide species responsible for SMSI on the metal surface do not appear to be necessary to obtain enhanced CO hydrogenation activity on Pt/TiO{sub 2}.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 128:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 186-197","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90076-G","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5517207","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5517207","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","128:1"

The analysis includes the effects of pore diffusion and growth, inert mineral matter, gas-phase heat and mass transfer, and treats solid spherical and cenospheric char particles. The combustion dynamics are described by time-dependent equations for particle temperature, radius, ash layer thickness, and a number of intraparticle conversion variables. These are coupled to pseudo-steady equations for gas-phase transport and internal reaction and diffusion. Model predictions were contrasted with combustion measurements obtained for several synthetic chars and two coal-derived chars. The synthetic chars were glassy carbons produced in the form of solid monodisperse spheres. Cenospheric synthetic chars were also produced. All synthetic chars were mineral free. The coal-derived chars contained mineral matter and were considered spherical. In each case, apparent and intrinsic rate parameters were estimated by direct application of the combustion model to experimental data gathered under conditions of moderate to large Thiele modulus. These rate parameters were compared with previous results using a simpler model that does not consider pore enlargement and the temperature dependence of gas-phase properties.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (USA); Journal Volume: 84:1 and 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 47-65","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(91)90037-C","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","5516397","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5516397","","Combustion and Flame; (USA)","","84:1 and 2"

In this investigation the modified palladium catalysts are characterized by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and CO and NH{sub 3} temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Average particle sizes of the palladium crystallites were also determined using chemisorption techniques. The XPS results indicate that the lithium-modified catalyst, which deactivated substantially during methanol decomposition testing, exhibited a significant build-up of carbon on the catalyst under identical conditions. The CO TPD results show that the lithium-, sodium-, and barium-modified catalysts, which deactivate during methanol decomposition testing, produce a much greater amount of CO{sub 2} relative to the amount of CO desorbed than do the potassium-, rubidium-, cesium-, and lanthanum-modified and the unmodified catalysts, which do not deactivate considerably under identical conditions. Ammonia TPD and chemisorption results indicate that no correlation exists between support acidity or particle size and the degree of CO dissociation. Finally, a correlation between the charge density of the modifier and the degree of CO disproportionation is presented which fits for all cases except one. This appears to support an electrostatic model for the promotion of CO bond cleavage by the alkali modifier.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 128:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 198-209","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90077-H","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","5581166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5581166","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","128:1"

The Co/W surfaces have highly strained and different geometries (1) but have similar activity. The activity matches that of the highly active, highly reduced Co/alumina catalysts, suggesting that the steady-state activity of cobalt surfaces is independent of surface structure. AES spectra show the after-reaction Co/W surfaces to have high coverages of both carbon and oxygen, with carbon lineshapes characteristic of carbidic carbon. Carbonyl-derived Co/dehydroxylated alumina catalysts have high extents of reduction, high dispersions, and good activity stability. Increasing the dehydroxylation temperature of the alumina support increases metal dispersion while decreasing CO{sub 2} and olefin selectivities. Specific CO hydrogenation activity is constant over the range of dispersion of 5-37% for highly reduced 3 and 5% Co/alumina catalysts and over the entire range of dispersion (0-100%) if polycrystalline Co and Co/W surfaces are included. The specific activity of carbonyl-derived catalysts appears to be more closely related to the extent of reduction and the support dehydroxylation temperature than to the dispersion. Thus, the chemical nature of the support surface appears to be the controlling factor in determining the specific activity of supported cobalt catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 128:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 231-247","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90080-N","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","5602223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5602223","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","128:1"

The governing system consists of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes' momentum (including a body force term), energy, species, and continuity equations, together with a finite-rate chemical kinetics described by a second-order Arrhenius-type rate equation. The burning rate of fuel is expressed by an Arrhenius-type pyrolysis law. The nondimensional model is solved numerically. Two parametric studies, based on changing gravity level and ambient oxygen index, respectively, are investigated. Under the variation of gravity, both Damkohler number and preexponential factor for fuel pyrolysis are changed. Two quenching limits are identified separately at a very low and a high gravity level. The envelope flame exists when gravity is less than 12.95 g. As gravity is increased, there appears a transition to open-tip flame, stabilized on the side of fuel plate. A similar trend is found when ambient oxygen index is decreased from the higher value to the lower one but only with a quenching limit that is blowoff.

These results are consistent with the decoration model proposed for the metal-support interaction between La{sub 2}O{sub 3} and noble metals, where the decoration species play the role of a promoter. The presence of these effects after such a mild pretreatment suggests that dissolution of the support by acidic precursor solutions during impregnation/drying and/or migration of support species during the early stages of reduction are probably the primary causes of the decoration. The extent of decoration appeared to be increased upon reduction of the La{sub 2}O{sub 3}-supported catalyst at 400{degree}C as evidenced by a further suppression of CO chemisorption and cyclopropane hydrogenation rate. H{sub 2} uptake, which greatly exceeded CO uptake after the 200{degree}C reduction suggesting spillover of H{sub 2} to decorating species and/or the support, increased further after a 400{degree}C reduction indicating an increased capacity of the decorating species and support for spillover H{sub 2}.

A Pt-assisted reduction mechanism over the entire range of composition was established by the TPR studies as well as by the chemisorption results. An enhanced metallic dispersion for the Pt-rich catalyst and formation of bimetallic particles on the Co-rich side was also indicated. In the CO hydrogenation over the Pt-rich catalysts the predominant products are methanol and dimethyl ether whereas on the Co-rich samples hydrocarbons and higher alcohols are produced. The mechanisms of deuterium exchange with methane and methanol are significantly different, the former being catalyzed solely by metallic sites while the latter utilizes both oxide and metallic sites for stepwise and multiple exchange, respectively.

A net activity decline was observed after a few hours of irradiation; this decline did not depend on the reactor temperature, the powder composition, or the amounts of produced ammonia. The highest activity is found when no excess iron is segregated at the surface; overall turnover numbers for dinitrogen reduction as high as six electrons per iron atom can then be reached before powder deactivation, showing the catalytic character of the participation of Fe in this process. An IR investigation of the active and spent specimens revealed that the irradiation determines the almost complete disappearance of the OH groups from the powder surface. Furthermore, an ESR study of all the powders showed that bulk Fe{sup 3+} ions are better electron traps than Ti{sup 4+} ions so that, when a UV photon generates a hole-electron pair, the electron can be stabilized on the iron ions.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (USA); Journal Volume: 95:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 274-282","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100154a052","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5793173","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5793173","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (USA)","","95:1"

The prepared catalysts were composed of microparticles of diameters ranging from 0.3 to 100 {mu}m, and were considered to be covered by the oxides added.

The kinetic model was modified to account for deactivation of supported catalyst particles by Ostwald ripening. Pretreatment of Fe/TiO{sub 2} with hydrazine increased the ammonia synthesis turnover frequency by more than an order of magnitude over unpretreated Fe/TiO{sub 2}. The ammonia partial pressure dependence and apparent activation energy over hydrazine-pretreated Fe/TiO{sub 2} were more representative of iron uninfluenced by the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) which occurs in Metal-titania systems. In situ CO chemisorption measurements following the ammonia synthesis kinetics measurements showed higher CO uptake with hydrazine-pretreated Fe/TiO{sub 2} then with unpretreated Fe/TiO{sub 2}. The increased turnover frequency, altered kinetic parameters, and higher CO uptake suggest that hydrazine pretreatment inhibited the onset of SMSI, which is attributed to titanium nitride formation on the support surface. Addition of the alkali promoters K and Cs to the catalysts not only increased the turnover frequency and decreased the apparent activation energy and ammonia partial pressure dependence, but acted to stabilize supported iron particles against growth by Ostwald ripening. The data suggest that physical covering of the surface by alkali inhibits Ostwald ripening of iron particles by blocking dissociation of iron atoms from supported particles thus suppressing their migration over the support surface to form larger particles.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 127:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 227-250","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90223-Q","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5641742","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5641742","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","127:1"

From FTIR studies of the kinetics of t-BuOh adsorption, the authors estimate the diffusion coefficient of t-BuOH in the zeolite channels as 5 x 10{sup {minus}11}cm{sup 2}s{sup {minus}1} at 23{degree}C. The course of the dehydration reaction with time (in the temperature interval 23-60{degree}C) is followed by simultaneous growth of a peak for adsorbed water, changes in the stretching and deformation vibrations for the adsorbed organic, and changes in the nature of the H-bonded species. These changes show that dehydration is accompanied by rapid isomerization and oligomerization of the butene product (the rates of isomerization and oligomerization substantially exceed the rate of dehydration), making it impossible to identify the intermediate for the dehydration reaction (be it carbonium ion or alkoxy species). Under reaction conditions the oligomers (most likely linear C{sub 8} species) remain adsorbed on the active sites inside the zeolite channels, resulting in rapid deactivation of the sites. When the sites within the zeolite pores are completely deactivated, the dehydration reaction proceeds on sites located at the external surface of the zeolite crystallites. The latter sites are deactivated much more slowly than the former ones under these reaction conditions.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 127:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 377-392","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90233-T","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5507668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5507668","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","127:1"

A unique system has been devised which offers a method of actually reducing the CO{sub 2} concentration in the atmosphere while still generating energy from fossil fuel. The only economically and technically reasonable method for removal of CO{sub 2} from the atmosphere is by the process of solar photosynthesis which extracts carbon from atmospheric CO{sub 2} by formation of biomass, e.g., hemi-cellulose. The biomass is then thermochemically converted by the HYDROCARB technology with fossil fuel, gas, oil or coal to produce carbon black and methanol. The carbon is returned to the earth, for long-term storage, while the methanol is used as fuel. In this manner, methane gas and oil co-processed with biomass results in a net removal of CO{sub 2} from the atmosphere of about 78 lb CO{sub 2} per million Btu of methanol generated energy. There is also a large energy enhancement in utilizing gas and oil for producing methanol compared to conventional methanol processes using these fuels. Co-processing with coal results in no net CO{sub 2} generated or removed per unit of methanol energy generated. Co-processing with coal results in no net CO{sub 2} generated or removed per unit of methanol energy generated. This compares to an emission of 330 lbs CO{sub 2} per million Btu when conventional steam reforming coal is used for methanol production. The process chemistry system is described and quantified in this paper.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Energy-Environment-Economics; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 319-324","","","AC02-76CH00016","Journal ID: CODEN: IJEEE","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5409267","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5409267","","International Journal of Energy-Environment-Economics; (United States)","","1:4"

Results are analyzed by calculating the local density of states (LDOS) and bond order overlap populations. On Rh(111) CH is adsorbed on threefold sites, CH{sub 2} on twofold sites and CH{sub 3} on onefold sites in order to restore missing C-H bonds. The height of CH{sub x} to the metal surface decreases with decreasing hydrogen content x, while the adsorption energy increases. Adsorption of CH{sub 3} on Rh(111) is studied in detail. CH{sub 3} bonds on the metal surface mainly via {sigma} type interactions of the n Ch{sub 3} orbital with surface metal atoms of the same symmetry. In case of the onefold adsorption, the highest occupied molecular orbital (n CH{sub 3}) has a large interaction with metal s, p{sub z}, and d{sub z}{sup 2} orbitals. For twofold adsorption it interacts mainly with the symmetric s, p{sub x}, and d{sub xz} metal group orbitals. Preliminary results are presented for the coupling reaction of coadsorbed CH{sub 2} and CH{sub 3}. A strong repulsion due to steric interaction of the hydrogen atoms is found when the carbon-carbon distance is decreased. In a final section the authors have analyzed CH{sub 3} is found to adsorb on onefold sites. Decreasing the spatial extension of the Ni d orbitals causes a shift to multiply bonding adsorption sites.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 127:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 141-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90216-Q","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5517187","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5517187","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","127:1"

But today most syngas is produced from noncoal feedstocks, by catalytic steam reforming of natural gas and naphtha or partial oxidation of heavy hydrocarbons such as petroleum resid. Three types of syngas, characterized by their H{sub 2}/CO ratio, are needed. Low ratio, H{sub 2}/CO = 0.4-0.8, syngas can be used in recently developed processes such as the Liquid Phase Methanol synthesis and the Shell Fischer-Tropsch wax synthesis; moderate ratio, H{sub 2}/CO = 0.8-1.5, syngas is used in the Tennessee Eastman coal based synthesis of methanol and acetic anhydride; high ratio, H{sub 2}/CO = 1.8-2.5, syngas is used in traditional methanol synthesis and the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis at Sasol. Different types of gasifiers are available for the production of syngas. These include Lurgi fixed-bed dry bottom and slagging gasifiers, agglomerating fluidized-bed gasifiers, single and two-stage entrained slurry feed gasifiers, and single-stage entrained dry feed gasifiers. The cost of syngas from subbituminous coal is shown to be relatively insensitive to the H{sub 2}/CO ratio produced and may soon be competitive with natural gas-based syngas in some parts of the country due to the increasing demand for and cost of natural gas. Recent in this paper, DOE sponsored research on three topics on the production of syngas from coal, coal gasifiers for the direct production of high hydrogen content syngas, advanced methods to separate hydrogen from syngas at elevated temperatures and biological conversion of coal to syngas, are also discussed.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; (United States); Journal Volume: 13:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 443-460","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; CODEN: EGYSA","10.1080/00908319108909001","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","5607740","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5607740","","Energy Sources; (United States)","","13:4"

The elementary reactions reported in the literature that were used consisted of 37 elementary reactions and 20 chemical species. The rate constants were chosen so that the computed and experimental propane conversions and product distributions in the oxidative pyrolysis reaction were in good agreement at conversion up to 35% at 574 C and 25% at 558 C. With the use of these elementary reactions and rate constants, the conversions and product distributions in the postcatalytic reactor were calculated assuming different desorbed reactive intermediates which included propyl, ethyl, methyl, and OH radicals. After comparison of the results of the calculation with those from experiments, it was concluded that propyl radicals were the most likely species that desorbed from a V-Mg-O catalyst surface, although OH radicals were also possible candidates. The rate of propyl radical desorption was estimated to be 23% of the rate of reaction of propane on the catalyst surface at 570 C and 5% at 556 C.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 30:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 352-361","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRED","10.1021/ie00050a012","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","6963932","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6963932","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (United States)","","30:2"

The authors begin with the assumption that the Pearson reaction, in which methanol is converted to hydrocarbons at 200C by polyphosphoric acid (PPA), operates by a mechanism similar to the zeolite-catalyzed processes. Results from the literature are combined with new experimental and computational work to present a simple, thermochemically reasonable picture of the overall transformation cycle. Consistent with established gas-phase thermochemistry and recent solid-state NMR results, carbon monoxide appears to be the operative catalytic species. According to the new scheme, after its slow initial generation (induction period), CO is methylated, producing an acylium ion, which is then deprotonated; subsequent methylation of the resulting ketene represents the key new C-C bond forming step. Loss of ethylene completes the cycle. Ab initio calculations support the kinetic and thermodynamic accessibility of the overall reaction sequence.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 112:25","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9085-9092","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSA","10.1021/ja00181a008","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","5964917","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5964917","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (United States)","","112:25"

Characterization of the samples with IR and TEM indicates extensive formation of a PtZn alloy already at 220{sub o}C. As the activation temperature increases, the spectroscopic data indicate an increased back-donation in the CO antibonding orbitals which seems to be related to a significant ligand effect of Zn in the alloy.

The goal of this work was to isolate ensemble effects, electronic effects, or the influence of the metal particle structure on catalytic behavior. The rate per surface Ru atom, or turnover frequency, was used to correlate catalytic activity with surface composition. The turnover frequencies for the series of Ru-Cu catalysts declined by a factor of about two when the relative Cu composition increased form 0% to 10% (at constant Ru loading). Increasing the Cu loading beyond this level did not affect the turnover frequency. Similar behavior was noted for the Ru-Ag catalysts where the turnover frequency declined until a Ag loading of about 25% was obtained. Increased Ag content did not further change the turnover frequency. As the segregating element (Ib) preferentially goes to the low-coordination, defect-like sites, the observed turnover frequency declines. Once all low-coordination sites are filled, no variation in turnover frequency with composition was observed, indication a lack of ensemble effects. This result contrasts with previously reported investigations of the Ru-Cu system. The overall rate changed modestly and the turnover frequency did not change significantly with composition over the series of Ru-Ag catalysts. The product distribution shifted to smaller molecules with increasing Cu content in the Ru-Cu series but remained constant over the entire composition range for the Ru-Ag and Ru-Au catalysts.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 126:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 421-433","","","W-7405-ENG-82","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90009-9","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","5724898","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5724898","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","126:2"

Application of this high ionic conductivity have been made to fuel cells, oxygen pumps, oxygen sensors, and reactors for various kinds of catalytic reaction. Recently, an attempt has been made to utilize oxygen ions transported through a solid electrolyte to a catalyst electrode for the oxidative coupling of methane. It has been reported that oxygen transported to Bi{sub 2}O{sub 3}-Ag catalyst at low transport rates showed higher activity and selectivity for production of C{sub 2} compounds (ethane and ethylene) than oxygen supplied from the gas phase. However, over an Ag electrode such high selectivity was not obtained. In the present work, the oxidation of methane was carried out over a single electrode in order to escape from the complexity which arises from the coexistence of electrode and catalyst. Silver pastes and lanthanum cobaltate powders were employed as electrode materials, because these materials are known to catalyze partial and deep oxidation, respectively. The solid electrolyte tubes were made of zirconia doped with 8 mol% yttria (yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)). Reactants and products such as CO, H{sub 2}, CO{sub 2},C{sub 2}H{sub 6}, C{sub 2}H{sub 4}, and C{sub 3}H{sub 8} were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with Unibeads 1S and Molecular Sieve 13X columns. A material balance within {+-}5% was achieved for carbon. To compare the reactivity of the transported oxygen with that of oxygen in the gas phase, the following three reaction systems were employed: (1) transport system, where the reaction is caused by oxygen transported electrochemically, (2) Mixture system, where the reaction is caused by oxygen premixed in the gas phase, and (3) Joint system, where both transported and premixed oxygen taken part in the reaction.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 126:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 671-673","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90029-J","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","5628913","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5628913","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","126:2"

Methyl vinyl ketone (19) affords products in low yield that may arise from an intermediate cyclopropane derivative. Phenyl vinyl sulfoxide (24) mainly acts as an oxidizing agent, transforming 1 into methyl benzoate. for olefin 24 and {alpha}-(N-methylanilino)acrylonitrile the authors found products that should be formed on an olefin metathesis pathway. The methyl-substituted carbene complex 48 also affords the expected donor-acceptor-substituted cyclopropanes; however, acyclic isomers are formed in higher amounts. The molybdenum and tungsten complexes 55 and 56, respectively, also furnish cyclopropane derivatives, but the yields are lower than with the chromium compound 1. Disubstituted olefins and complex 1 still give the cyclopropanes in moderate yields, while all trisubstituted and most of the difunctionalized alkenes do not react with this Fischer carbene complex. The cyclopropanes synthesized can be deprotonated and alkylated or transformed into ring-opened products.

Experiments with linear and branched C{sub 4} alcohols, aldehydes, and acids over an unpromoted ZnCr oxide sample have indicated a series of major catalyst functions, namely aldol-like condensation (also with oxygen retention reversal), decarboxylation and decarboxylative condensations, hydrogenation-dehydrogenation, dehydration and hydrolysis, along with isomerization and cracking. TPSR experiments with linear C{sub 4} molecules over K-promoted ZnCr oxide have demonstrated the effects of alkali addition on the catalyst functions. The results are supportive of a mechanism of chain growth to C{sub 3+} primary alcohols based on a sequence of aldolic condensations of aldehydes, which do not operate over 2-methyl species. Formation of ketones under TPSR conditions is explained by decarboxylative condensation reactions of aldehydic and carboxylate species, as well as by aldol-like condensation reactions with oxygen retention reversal. Secondary alcohols detected in the products of the synthesis are formed by hydrogenation of ketones. Methyl esters and ethers are produced in the synthesis by alcoholysis of carboxylate and alkoxide species, respectively. Decarboxylation of carboxylate species, along with dehydration, may also play a role in the formation hydrocarbons during HAS.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 126:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 401-420","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90008-8","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5536953","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536953","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","126:2"

Kinetic analysis indicates that methane is directly oxidized to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide. Formaldehyde is oxidized to carbon monoxide, which is itself further oxidized, providing an alternative route to carbon dioxide. The kinetic model shows that sodium poisons the direct oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon dioxide, but promotes the oxidation of formaldehyde and carbon monoxide. Model predictions of rates and selectivities are in good agreement with the experimental data.

A tray-to-tray simulator of an industrial propylene/propane column that considers 5-min composition analyzer dead time was used to test the nonlinear PMBC controller for setpoint changes, a feed flow rate change, and feed composition changes. The nonlinear PMBC controller used an approximate model based upon the Smoker equation directly to make control decisions. The nonlinear PMBC controller exhibits excellent control performance for all test cases with a maximum relative deviation of the impurity from setpoint of about 10% for the two product streams.

To attain extensive metal/cerium oxide interaction, activation in N{sub 2}O and CO/H{sub 2}, with and without hydrogen pretreatment, was investigated; pressures up to 50 bar and temperatures up to 500{degree}C were used. No methanol synthesis activity was observed from Ag/CeO{sub 2} systems derived from binary cerium-silver alloys. Furthermore, the activity of the Cu/Ag catalysts derived from the ternary precursor was very significantly reduced relative to that expected by comparison with CeCu{sub 2}-derived catalysts on the basis of its copper content. Thus at least for methanol synthesis catalysts derived from these intermetallic precursors, the identity of the transition metal does indeed appear to be crucial.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 126:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 219-227","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90060-W","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5748803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5748803","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","126:1"

At higher ambient velocities or low ambient fuel concentrations, the two zones appear to merge. However, the thickness of the reaction zone(s) is greater than that corresponding to the nonreactive ambient case. Measurements indicate that the stability of the envelope flames is enhanced by fuel gases in the ambient.

The surface base property of magnesium oxide was modified by the addition of a metal ion; the addition of a metal ion with larger ionic radius than that of Mg{sup 2+} induces surface acid sites without any appreciable changes in the amount of surface base site. Active catalysts were formed in the latter case but not in the former case. It was thought that a surface acid property as well as a surface base property played an important role in the course of the reaction. Reaction of deuterium-substituted acetonitrile and methanol revealed that the exchange reaction between hydroxyl hydrogen of methanol and methyl hydrogen of acetonitrile took place readily under the conditions of acrylonitrile synthesis and the isotopic distribution in acetonitrile after the reaction was very close to that of isotopic equilibrium. No exchange reaction between methyl hydrogen of methanol and that of acetonitrile was observed. It was found, on the other hand, that the isotopic exchange reaction between methyl hydrogen of deuterated methanol and light methanol can occur under the same conditions. The reaction mechanism appears to be dehydrogenation of methanol to adsorbed formaldehyde which then reacts with the acetonitrile anion and, after dehydration, yields acrylonitrile.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 126:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 208-218","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90059-S","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","5536918","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536918","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","126:1"

The beauty of the hydroboration reaction as a synthetic method stems from the facts that it is broadly applicable, generally quantitative, occurs at ambient temperature, and is highly regio- and stereoselective. The hydroboration-oxidation experiment might thus be expected to enjoy a prominent place in the undergraduate laboratory curriculum. However, it is generally not considered to be suitable for the following reasons: (1) the key reagent, diborane, is somewhat difficult to prepare by traditional methods requiring the use of metal hydrides and strong mineral or Lewis acids (e.g., boron trifluoride etherate); (2) the most commonly used and commercially available hydroborating reagents, borane-tetrahydrofuran (BH[sub 3]-THF) and borane-dimethyl sulfide (BMS), are difficult to manipulate requiring dry and oxygen-free conditions; (3) the standard oxidation procedure requires the use of a dangerous 30% hydrogen peroxide solution. The authors have developed a hydroboration-oxidation experiment that can be readily performed in an undergraduate laboratory in a 4-h laboratory period.

The reactions involve the use of in situ generated diborane (via reaction of sodium borohydride with iodine) as the hydroborating reagent and sodium perborate as the oxidizing agent.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Education; (United States); Journal Volume: 67:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 975-976","","","FG05-86ER60434","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9584; CODEN: JCEDA8","10.1021/ed067p975","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","7000087","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7000087","","Journal of Chemical Education; (United States)","","67:11"

This process likely yields an intermediate 1,4-metalla diradical. {beta}-elimination from this intermediate gives olefin and regenerates V(V), likely as VO{sub 2}Cl. Thus, although the overall process involves no net change in oxidation state for vanadium, the decarboxylation process is oxidatively induced. Intramolecular trapping of the intermediate yields glycolate and then C-C cleavage products, and skeletal rearrangement gives ketonic products. Qualitatively, rates for oxidative decarboxylation of the acids and the stereospecificity of formation of olefinic products depend on the electron-withdrawing ability of groups attached to vanadium. Methodology is described for the preparation of tri- and tetrasubstituted olefins in high yield from appropriate 3-hydroxy carboxylic acid precursors.","","","","","","United States","1990-10-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Organic Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 55:21","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 5619-5624","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3263; CODEN: JOCEA","10.1021/jo00308a021","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5148489","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5148489","","Journal of Organic Chemistry; (United States)","","55:21"

The mechanism was shown to predict correctly the rates and products observed in CH{sub 3}CHO oxidation studies in a low-pressure in a stirred flow reactor and at high pressure in a rapid compression machine. The oscillatory phenomena in the flow system and the two-stage ignition observed at high pressure were satisfactorily described by the mechanism.

All three powders act as catalysts for CO hydrogenation to hydrocarbons, with low catalytic activities when reduced up to 623 K; in these conditions, methanol was also produced in small amount with Co33. After reduction up to 773 K, a strong increase of catalytic activity was observed mainly for Co50 and Co75 catalysts, over which an increase of methane formation is also observed.

These catalysts were tested alone as well as combined with zeolite ZSM-5 in a microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The nickel/zirconia catalyst is found to be considerably more active and selective to higher hydrocarbons compared to other nickel catalysts on conventional supports. When combined with ZSM-5, the nickel/zirconia catalyst gives the product distribution, which is rich in gasoline-range hydrocarbons and aromatics. The nickel catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction and hydrogen chemisorption. The role of zirconia as a promoter for hydrocarbon synthesis has been discussed.","","","","","","United States","1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1753-1757","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00105a002","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","6404683","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6404683","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA)","","29:9"

Silica as the support provided the highest catalyst activities. A Co{sub 2}(CO){sub 8}/Zr(OPr){sub 4}/SiO{sub 2} catalyst (3.5% cobalt, 6.6% zirconium) was developed as the most active system in the FT slurry reactor and also gave the best liquid fuel selectivity. Selectivity patterns correlated to the Schulz--Flory prediction. These catalysts exhibited low water/gas shift activity. Diesel fuel product produced by this catalyst was high quality. A kinetic expression that took water inhibition into account was verified, yielding an activation energy of 97 kJ/mol for syngas conversion ranging from 34% to 71% at 240--280{degrees} C.","","","","","","United States","1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1807-1813","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00105a011","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6464273","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6464273","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA)","","29:9"

The model, based on the assumption of existence of both shape-selective (e.g., para-selective) internal catalytic sites and nonselective (e.g., non-para-selective) external sites, addresses the preferred overall formation of the isomer that diffuses more rapidly in the intracrystalline space, as well as the decline in shape selectivity with conversion. Exemplified for the production of xylene from toluene over HZSM-5 catalysts, the model gives a very good fit with experimental data of toluene disproportionation. Lack or loss of para selectivity is thus explained as resulting from reactions occurring on the external surface of the zeolite. The model predicts maxima in {ital p}-xylene production, subject to system variables, as a function of reaction time.","","","","","","United States","1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1814-1821","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00105a012","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","6464532","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6464532","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA)","","29:9"

Though the product distribution in Fischer--Tropsch synthesis is governed by the existence of an Anderson--Schultz--Flory polymerization model, certain modifications in the catalyst formulations have produced a shift toward lower molecular weight olefins. At the present time, the yields and selectivities of lower olefins are far from optimal, but continued research efforts in this area may lead to the development of stable catalyst systems capable of producing highly desirable distributions of lower olefins.","","","","","","United States","1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:9; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1735-1752","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE","10.1021/ie00105a001","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","6223774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6223774","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA)","9","29:9"

The vanadium removal was improved to {approximately}28% by applying the reductive wash with an aqueous sulfur dioxide solution followed by the oxidative wash with an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution to the same regenerated catalyst. A significant fraction of vanadium, 50-70%, was further removed by subjecting the same catalyst to the calcination step at higher temperatures (730-815{degrees}C) before the reductive and oxidative washing scheme. The microactivity test results show that the catalytic activity of the devanadated FCC equilibrium catalyst was remarkably rejuvenated. The improvement in the catalytic activity of the devanadated system is directly tied with the degree of vanadium removal. These results suggest that the poisoning effect of the vanadium on the FCC catalyst can at least partially be reversed by removing vanadium from the metal-contaminated FCC catalyst by a simple calcination/washing process.","","","","","","United States","1990-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1183-1188","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; CODEN: IECRE; TRN: 91-013896","10.1021/ie00103a016","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","5819732","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5819732","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; (USA)","","29:7"

The composition of the emissions from the two types of vehicles was based on new measurements of the individual organic compounds emitted by vehicles operating on gasoline, M85 fuel, and M100 fuel. Simulations were conducted using a range of atmospheric conditions and two different chemical mechanisms. The results suggest that replacing gasoline-fueled vehicles with methanol-fueled vehicles may not reduce ozone in all urban areas. Also, it was found that the experimental methanol-fueled vehicle tested provides, at best, small ozone reductions compared to prototype gasoline-fueled vehicles. Additional work is necessary to reduce formaldehyde emissions from methanol-fueled vehicles. Lastly, if both M85 and M100 vehicles are assumed to have the same low-formaldehyde fraction in the emissions, the results suggest that M85 vehicles provide 80-85% of the ozone reductions of M100 vehicles.","","","","","","United States","1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 853-862","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; CODEN: ESTHA","10.1021/es00076a010","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","5455811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5455811","","Environmental Science and Technology; (United States)","","24:6"

These gases have little value unless they can be moved to large-scale consumers through a pipeline or transported as liquefied gases. Because conversion of methane to a transportable liquid hydrocarbon fuel would open new markets, it is a goal being actively pursued by many groups around the world. Currently, two large-scale, viable approaches for converting methane to liquid hydrocarbons are being used: the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) route, and the Fischer--Tropsch (FT) route. Both of these processes begin with the production of synthesis gas from methane,which is a high-temperature, endothermic, costly operation. Concepts for directly converting methane to a liquid hydrocarbon fuel without reforming methane to synthesis gas conceptually appear attractive. A few have reached the stage where a preliminary evaluation directed at understanding the critical process factor is possible. The authors report on their studies involving the following process schemes: oxidative coupling, partial oxidation, and oxyhydrochlorination.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Engineering Progress; (USA); Journal Volume: 86:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2495; CODEN: CEPRA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6726791","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6726791","","Chemical Engineering Progress; (USA)","","86:4"

The results of the studies at subatmospheric pressure indicate that burning rate enhancers augment the AP/binder interfacial reactions, CuCr{sub 2}O{sub 4} decomposes into copper oxide and chromium oxide with net heat release, and if this occurs at the surface, it constitutes one route by which the burning rate could be enhanced, Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} possibly enhances near-surface breakdown of heavy fuel molecules, and the melt layer on AP particles and the low-viscosity binder-melt, which exist when LiF is present in the propellants, possibly depress the burning rate.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (USA); Journal Volume: 80:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-6","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(90)90048-V","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6729092","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6729092","","Combustion and Flame; (USA)","","80:1"

The phase composition of the support or the doping procedure (bulk or surface) has a minor effect on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity. Also, the various doping agents, with the exception of K{sub 2}O, have minor effects. K{sub 2}O doping decreases the activity and changes the selectivity of Rh/ZrO{sub 2} in the CO/H{sub 2} reaction, favoring the formation of oxygenated compounds. Activation at high temperature (823 K) decreases the activity but does not change the selectivity of the catalysts. A significant influence of the feed H{sub 2}/CO ratio on activity and selectivity has been found: activity decreases with H{sub 2}/CO ratio and selectivity to oxygenates increases.

The catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction, O{sub 2}-H{sub 2} titration, and temperature-programmed desorption. The dispersion and H{sub 2} chemisorption of Pd/zeolite-X catalysts were almost unchanged on La promotion. The virtually unchanged chemisorption capacity of the Pd/zeolite-X catalysts on La promotion is attributed to the cationic exchange method adopted to introduce La after Pd introduction into the zeolites. The La{sub 2}O{sub 3} formed during calcination was partially reduced during reduction with hydrogen due to its contact with palladium. PdLaO{sub x} entities formed thereby trigger the activation of coordinated CO/H{sub 2} and facilitate the hydrogenation of CO to methanol/oxygenates at low temperature. Thus, the Pd sites responsible for methanol synthesis are stabilized by La at low and high pressures. Dimethyl ether, dominant for low La content Pd/zeolite-X catalysts, may be ascribed to the acid sites developed, but other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. The effect of the zeolite matrix lies in the stabilization of PdLaO{sub x} entities, but otherwise it behaves in a similar fashion to other supports. The zeolite lattice, however, ensures the maintenance of small PdLaO{sub x} particles. The turnover frequency values obtained with the optimum La promotion on Pd/zeolite-X are consistent with the reported values observed on Pd/La{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts. The zeolites are therefore potential alternative supports in the preparation of suitable bimetallic systems.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 122:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 320-329","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90286-S","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6404723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6404723","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","122:2"

The active sites are stable compared with the active oxygen bridges on highly dehydrated silica, which also catalyze the selective ethanol dehydrogenation. Since there were trace amounts of acid site on the silicalite-1, simultaneous ethanol dehydration was observed. However, almost all the acid sites disappeared by heating at 1,070 K in the case of silicalite-1 containing 0.7 wt% of sodium ions, and ethanol was selectively converted to acetaldehyde. In this treatment, the sodium ions partly poison the active sites for dehydrogenation, but their activity is restored by leaching excess sodium ions from the silicalite-1 under reflux in water.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 122:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 352-361","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90289-V","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","6214619","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6214619","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","122:2"

The reduction of peroxide to water is initiated by the reaction of Mn{sup II}L with a dinuclear Mn{sup III,IV}L{sub 2}. A subsequent fast reaction between the transient product of this reaction and hydrogen peroxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide effectively oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(IV) in a concerted step without formation of the hydroxyl radical. The green mixed-valence complex, which is probably a bis({mu}-oxo)-bridged structure, is stable in neutral aqueous solution and exhibits a 16-line ESR signal in frozen solution. The basis of catalase activity is the autocatalytic formation of this complex when hydrogen peroxide is reduced by manganese(II). The catalase cycle is independent of the formation of oxy radicals. Mononuclear Mn{sup III}edda and Mn{sup II}edda react with superoxide radicals, but the decomposition of peroxide is virtually independent of these reactions. In unbuffered solutions, with a moderate excess of hydrogen peroxide, an oscillation in the concentration of the dinuclear complex is detected. 28 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inorganic Chemistry; (USA); Journal Volume: 29:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 897-905","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0020-1669; CODEN: INOCA","10.1021/ic00330a003","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6956688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6956688","","Inorganic Chemistry; (USA)","","29:5"

The process uses a homogeneous catalyst system where reactants, products and catalyst are all soluble in the same liquid phase---thereby avoiding some of the disadvantages of heterogenous catalysts.

The temporal variation of CO yield proceeded through a maximum suggesting that it was produced as an intermediate in the pathway leading to CO{sub 2}. CO selectivity (s{sub CO} = y{sub CO}/x{sub HCHO}) was maximized by operating at oxygen concentration below the stoichiometric point and at high reaction temperatures. A mechanism for formaldehyde oxidation is proposed which involves adsorption of formaldehyde followed by catalytic decomposition to CO and H{sub 2} and oxidation of the surface species; the rate limiting step apparently shifts from the decomposition at high oxygen concentration to the oxidation of surface species at low concentration. The rate expression was obtained from the postulated mechanism and found to be consistent with the experimental results. The maximum for the yield of CO provided a second method by which to confirm the postulated rate expression.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; (USA); Journal Volume: 40:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 352-358","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; CODEN: JAWAE","10.1080/10473289.1990.10466693","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6723466","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6723466","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; (USA)","","40:3"

Catalytic reaction data, coupled with infrared spectroscopic characterizations of adsorbed species, indicate that at least two different types of catalytically active sites are generated on activated La{sub 2}O{sub 3} and Nd{sub 2}O{sub 3} surfaces that are prepared by thermal dehydration of the corresponding trihydroxides. One kind of site (designated Type I) is much less numerous than the other (Type II), but is more strongly basic and has a much higher initial activity for alcohol dehydration, via a probable ethoxide intermediate, at 300-400{degree}C. The parallel alcohol dehydrogenation pathway, on the other hand, occurs only on Type II sites, which also have moderate dehydration activity. The resulting aldehyde products readsorbs exclusively on the more strongly basic Type I sites, where it undergoes a series of secondary condensation reactions that cause a decrease in the overall rate of alcohol dehydration. The comparative behavioral features of the two kinds of sites may be due to differing surface environments, with Type I sites being in structurally more defective and/or more energetic surface locations than are Type II sites. Increases in pretreatment temperature of the oxides cause thermally induced transformations of Type I sites into Type II sites by a surface annealing or restructuring process, with corresponding modifications in the observed catalytic behavior for the two alcohol conversion pathways. 33 refs.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 122:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 80-94","","","AS05-78ER06042","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90263-J","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6348370","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6348370","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","122:1"

With NaOH as base, the resultant materials had a layered structure. After exchange with NH{sub 4}{sup +} ions and calcination at 623 K, the layered structure was converted to the anatase phase. When the calcination temperature was raised to 723 K and higher, a portion of the anatase phase was converted to the rutile phase for samples of high Cr(III) content. The latter also contained a small amount of Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} structure. When the 2-propanol decomposition reaction was carried out, the mixed oxides demonstrated both acidic and basic sites on the surfaces. Furthermore, both Broensted and Lewis acid sites were found on the surface of the bimetallic oxides, based on IR spectra of the adsorbed pyridine. The Broensted acid sites were identified as CrO-H groups. When the bimetallic oxides were used as catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, activity was found to be a function of Cr content. The Cr-O species were proposed to be the active sites for formation of both ethylene and CO{sub 2}.

Various compositions of the bimetallic phase can be achieved by changing the initial Sn/Ni ratio. The obtained catalysts were very active and selective in the hydrogenation of ethyl acetate to ethanol. Characterization of the bimetallic phase has shown that the particles are bimetallic (STEM). As a result of chemisorption IR, and magnetic measurements, it appears that the presence of tin has four effects: (i) it decreases significantly the amount of CO and H{sub 2} adsorbed; (ii) it isolates nickel atoms from their neighbors; (iii) it increases electron density on nickel; and (IV) it suppresses the magnetic properties of nickel. Redox behavior of Ni-Sn/SiO{sub 2} toward surface OH indicates that surface hydroxyls can oxidize Sn{sup (0)}, probably to Sn{sup (II)} with evolution of H{sub 2}, the process being reversible with H{sub 2}.

Minimum miscibility pressures (MMP's) and vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) of these synthetic oils have been calculated for adding nitrogen. The Peng-Robinson equation of state has been used in conjunction with binary interaction parameters, either experimentally determined or from independent correlations. It appeared that aromaticity hardly influences MMP's but that it has a significant impact on the mutual miscibility of equilibrium phases at 373.15 K and 400 bar.

The experiments were carried out under low concentrations of feed in a 1-L stirred autoclave, according to a statistical experimental design. The inert liquid phase used for this investigation was a 78:22 blend of paraffinic and naphthenic mineral oils. A complete thermodynamic analysis was carried out in order to determine the liquid phase concentrations of the dissolved species. A global kinetic model was developed for the rate of dimethyl ether synthesis in terms of the liquid phase concentration of methanol. The activation energy of the reaction was found to be 18,830 cal/gmol. Based on a step-wise linear regression analysis of the kinetic data, the order of the reaction which gave the best fit was 0.28 with respect to methanol.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel Science and Technology International; (USA); Journal Volume: 8:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 637-671","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-3759; CODEN: FSCTE; CNN: RP-317-06","10.1080/08843759008915948","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","6723468","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6723468","","Fuel Science and Technology International; (USA)","","8:6"

The object was to separate the velocities of charged soot particles from those of the ionic wind by making use of the difference in their relative evolution times. This has not been considered previously, largely because much of the research was carried out on flat counterflow flames, but is here shown to be important for conventional flame shapes. Laser Doppler and scattering methods were used to determine particle velocities and sizes. Soot particles of the order of 10 {delta} m diameter were found to have mobilities of the order of 5 {times} 10 {sup -6} m {sup 2} s {sup -1} V {sup -1} and zero for particles exposed to a flux of positive and negative charge carriers, respectively.

Multiphoton ionization of the product clusters using the third harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser leads mainly to species of the comparison H{sup +}(NH{sub 3}){sub n}(NH){sub m}, where X = Cl or I and n is greater than m. In addition, for the case where X = I the species NH{sub 3}{center dot}HX{sup +} and H{sup +}(NH{sub 4})(HX) are positively observed. Evidently they arise due to the fragmentation of clusters containing more than one HI molecule; H{sup +}(NH{sub 3}){sub 2}HI is the smallest mixed cluster observed to be formed under single collision conditions.

The low-pressure study was conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber in which methanol was direction onto the surfaces with a doser tube. Up to 425 C, the Zn-polar surface was at least five times more active than the other two surfaces, and the stepped nonpolar surface was marginally more active than the O-polar surface. The near-atmospheric pressure study was conducted in a microreactor at 250-300 C. No measurable activities were found on the O-polar (000{ovr 1}) surface, whereas the activities of the Zn-polar (0001) and the stepped nonpolar (50{ovr 5}1) surfaces were comparable. The reaction rate increased with increasing methanol pressure up to about 27 MPa beyond which the reaction became zeroth order in methanol. In the zeroth order region, the activation energy was 138-161 kJ/mole for the Zn-polar surface. These values and the turnover frequencies were comparable to values obtained on powder ZnO samples under near-atmospheric pressures. In the first-order region, the activation energy decreased as the temperature was increased. The major carbon-containing product observed was formaldehyde at low pressures and CO at near-atmospheric pressures. Differences between the results obtained at the two different pressures and the importance of surface defects generated by reduction of the surfaces were discussed.","","","","","","United States","1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 120:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 231-255","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90263-7","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","6839653","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6839653","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","120:1"

In particular, the selectivity to ethanol seems to be increased for Rh supported or promoted by metal oxides showing both acid and basic properties, such as TiO{sub 2}, ZrO{sub 2}, and V{sub 2}O{sub 3}. Notwithstanding the different and partially conflicting hypotheses on the mechanism of formation of ethanol and other oxygenated molecules, there is not doubt that the promoter effect of the support influences the temperature of CO dissociation: this temperature is lowered from 483 K for Rh/SiO{sub 2} to 448 K for Zr{sup 4+}-promoted Rh-Zr (1:1)/SiO{sub 2} catalyst. Similar results are obtained for Rh/SiO{sub 2} promoted by oxidic phases of Ti, V, and Mn located at the surface of Rh particles. Evidence for this effect is given by the IR spectra of CO adsorbed on these systems at room temperature (RT) after reduction at 673 K. These spectra show the usual linear and bridged CO species on Rh{sup 0} at 2040-2060 and 1880 cm{sup {minus}1}, respectively, accompanied by a broad and not well resolved shoulder between 1750 and 1520 cm{sup {minus}1} (1670 cm{sup {minus}1} for the Zr-promoted catalyst). These low-frequency CO bands have been assigned, in accord with the spectral position of analogous homogeneous species, to a tilted CO group, C-bonded to Rh{sup 0} and O-bonded to the promoter metal ion. The formation of this surface species evidently favors the CO dissociation process. To ascertain if a similar species is formed on a Rh/ArO{sub 2} system, the author has carried out an accurate Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic investigation.","","","","","","United States","1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 120:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 287-291","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90268-6","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","7089920","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7089920","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","120:1"

High electric field pulses were used to quantitatively desorb the final products, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, thus achieving steady-state conditions. Substantial amounts of methoxy (mainly desorbed as CH{sub 3}{sup +} ions) were also present at the surface. Applying a steady electric field, F{sub R} {ge} 4 V/nm, between the field pulses, led to a deceleration of the decomposition reaction and to increase of the amount of adsorbed CH{sub 3}O and CH{sub 2}O species. There were indicators that the rate-determining step of the reaction is C-H bond cleavage in adsorbed methoxy to form the CH{sub 2}O intermediate. This was supported by the observation of a kinetic isotope effect in the formation of CD{sub 2}O and CHDO from methyl-d{sub 2}-alcohol, CHD{sub 2}OH. Here, the C-H bond breaking to form the CD{sub 2}O was found to be twice as fast as the breaking of the C-D bond which results in CHDO.

Selectivities to acetone measured at 4.73% conversion follow this order as well, ranging from 95.7% and 93.9% for MgO and CsAce/CsNaY, respectively, to 17.6% for the CsNaX. Thus, these catalysts can be grouped into two categories: (i) catalysts which vary in acid/base properties yet possess identical topology (e.g., the zeolites) and (ii) catalysts which vary in topology yet have similar acid/base properties (e.g., MgO and CsAce/CsNaY). These catalysts were compared using the side chain alkylation of toluene, ethane, methane, and acetone with methanol. For the impregnated zeolites, similar toluene conversions were observed. No formaldehyde was observed in the product stream of the impregnated Y zeolite. Both MgO and CsAce/CsNaY had similar methanol decomposition products; i.e., no formaldehyde and high CO formation, yet unlike CsAce/CsNaY no toluene conversion was observed for MgO.

Under nitrogen the esters predominated, but under 65 atm of carbon monoxide the principal condensation products were ketones with 2n carbon atoms. Isotopic labeling studies showed that carbon from CO was not incorporated into the esters and ketones, that oxygen, on the other hand, was exchanged between CO and the reaction products, and that the ketones were formed by an aldol-type mechanism.

Flames were stabilized on a flat-flame burner shrouded by nitrogen. OH number density profiles were determined from laser absorption at 309.28nm (A-X, O-O Q/sub 2/(6)). Potassium profiles were obtained from laser absorption on the 404.53-nm transition. Addition of potassium was observed to accelerate the OH decay rate, with the additive influence being most pronounced at higher equivalence ratios. The influence of {Kappa} was nonlinear, and increasing seeding levels produced progressively less acceleration of the OH decay rate. The measured potassium atom number density decayed slowly with distance above the burner for fuel-rich conditions but decayed rapidly in lean flames. Potassium reaction mechanisms were tested against the experimental data in a series of numerical simulations. Based on a best fit to the experimental data, a rate coefficient for K + OH + M {yields} KOH + M was estimated as 5 X 10/sup 32/cm/sup 6/molec/sup -2/s/sup -1/ at 2000{Kappa}.

A sheet of laser light, approximately 200{mu}m thick is shone through the cylinder of a single-cylinder ported internal combustion engine. The homogeneous charge of propane and air is seeded with submicron TiO/sub 2/ particles and the scattered light is collected through a quartz window in the engine head and is imaged on a 100 x 100 diode array camera. The number density of the TiO/sub 2/ particles scales with the gas density so that a two-dimensional map of reactants and products is obtained.

Studies were carried out on thin layers of oxide supported on Ta or Ti, and on thin, Teflon-bonded oxide layers attached to a glassy carbon rotating disk-electrode. The catalytic activity of RuO{sub 2} for HCHO oxidation was considerably greater than that of IrO{sub 2} and Rh{sub 2}O{sub 3}. At RuO{sub 2} formaldehyde was observed to undergo oxidation to formate at potentials from ca 0.75-1.25 vs. reference hydrogen electrode (RHE), and to carbonate at higher potentials. The results suggest that HCHO (and HCOOH) oxidation is mediated by higher valent states of the oxide metals ions electrogenerated at the electrode surface. Values of 10{sup {minus} 3} cm s{sup {minus} 1} (geometric electrode area based) and 10{sup {minus} 6} cm s{sup {minus} 1}(real area based) were estimated for the heterogeneous rate constant for HCHO oxidation at RuO{sub 2}.

The H{sup +}-exchanged form of ferrierite has been reported as an efficient catalyst for the hydration of alkenes, the cracking of n-alkanes, and the isomerization of m-xylene to p-xylene. Harrison et al. have noted that its use in methanol conversion gives appreciably lower aromatic selectivity than ZSM-5, probably because the 10-ring windows of ferrierite (0.42 {times} 0.54 nm) are smaller in diameter than those of ZSM-5 (0.53 {times} 0.56 and 0.51 {times} 0.55 nm). Alkali-metal-exchanged zeolites are at present of considerable commercial significance since they are key components of effective catalysts for the aromatization of alkanes, such as n-hexane to benzene. A good example is the K{sup +}-exchange form of zeolite L. The authors considered, therefore, that a sensible test material for a structural investigation of ferrierite would be the K{sup +}-exchanged form of the zeolite. Previously the authors have reported the use of high-temperature X-ray studies of Ni{sup 2+}-exchanged zeolite Y, and a low-temperature neutron diffraction study of La{sup 3+}-exchanged zeolite Y.

The role of ethylidyne in this catalytic process has been a topic of uncertainty. In his ASED-MO study it is shown that steric interactions prevent ethylene from approaching the ethylidyne-covered surface but ethylidyne can readily shift laterally to new sites and open up space for ethylene to approach and be hydrogenated by the surface platinum hydride. Hydrogenation by the {alpha}-H of surface ethylidene, which has been postulated to be a hydrogenation intermediate, is found to proceed with a higher activation energy, forming nonadsorbed ethyl radicals. The higher activation energy and the formation of ethyl radicals are inconsistent with experimental results. Furthermore, ethylidene is predicted to have insufficient stability to be present in substantial concentrations on the surface. It is shown that ethylidene can readily exchange {beta}-H with the surface, but {beta}-H exchange is very slow in the experimental studies. From these results it is concluded that ethylidene plays no substantial role in ethylene hydrogenation.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (USA); Journal Volume: 93:16","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 6145-6149","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100353a039","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7197308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7197308","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (USA)","","93:16"

The temporal and spatial development of flames exiting a small cylindrical prechamber were observed in the experiments using laser-schlieren videography. The equivalence ratio of the ethylene-air mixture was varied from 0.5 to 0.65. The corresponding flame speeds S/sub {mu}/ for this range of equivalence ratios were measured in a complementary study and were shown to increase from 10 to 254 cm/s, respectively, while the ratio of unburned to burned gas densities varied by less than 20%. The associated increase in gas velocity with equivalence ratio was used to change the estimated Reynolds number in the experiment from 1870 to 8090. Good agreement between the predicted and measured prechamber flame propagation rates was obtained. For the lowest Reynolds number experiment the calculated spatial and temporal development of the flame in the main combustion chamber agreed with the experimental observations. For all Reynolds numbers the numerical results scale with the characteristic time scale obtained by normalizing with the burned gas flame speed S/sub b/. In the experimental results this normalized time scale is not an accurate measure of similar flame development. As the Reynolds number was increased in the experiment the flame development was more rapid. At the highest Reyolds number conditions, a combination or the simplifying assumptions in the flame sheet-vortex dynamics model results in a slower development of the flame-vortex interaction without the experimentally observed shear layer instabilities.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; (USA); Journal Volume: 77:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 101-122","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; CODEN: CBFMA","10.1016/0010-2180(89)90031-X","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5482934","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5482934","","Combustion and Flame; (USA)","","77:2"

In both reactions, the highest activity was observed for the catalyst containing 1 wt% Na{sub 2}O. UV-Vis spectra of the catalysts show that there are three different phases of vanadates on the silica surface, namely a polymeric phase and two tetrahedral phases. One of the tetrahedral phases exhibits an absorption band at 315 nm, which is an active species in the photocatalysis. By comparison of the results of the reactions, it is concluded that the addition of sodium ions alters the composition of surface phases. Addition of an appropriate amount of sodium ions maximizes the fraction of the active phase on the surface and enhances photocatalytic activity.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 118:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 327-338","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90321-7","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7263222","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7263222","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","118:2"

Although the amount of residual aluminum in the catalyst (mainly Al{sub 2}O{sub 3n}H{sub 2}O) remains almost constant on its outermost surface, regardless of the leaching time, it decreases in the interior phases up to a depth of 600 {angstrom} with leaching times over 9 min. The activities of catalysts with average content of aluminum relative to nickel, i.e., 11.6 and 6.8% wt%, in their surface layers (ca. 0.4 {mu}m thick) were 2.7 and 2.1 mmol/h BET m{sup 2} for the hydrogenation rates of allyl alcohol and 3.6 {times} 10{sup {minus}3} and 2.4 {times} 10{sup {minus}3} mmol/, BET m{sup 2} for the adsorption amount of I{sup {minus}} ion, respectively. These results suggest that the activities for hydrogenation and adsorption were enhanced when the content of residual aluminum in the catalyst was increased, and that the role of the residual aluminum in catalytic reactions can be classified into two types: to provide an increase in active sites due to formation on interstitial lattice defects, and to make a negligible contribution to the formation of active sites because of deposition of Al{sub 2}O{sub 3n}H{sub 2}O on the Raney nickel catalyst.","","","","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 118:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 436-442","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90330-8","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","7151500","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7151500","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","118:2"

Two broad categories of reaction mechanism can be identified: (a) Type I: Carbon monoxide, adsorbed on the copper surface, is hydrogenated by the addition of hydrogen atoms while the C-O bond remains intact. A second C-O bond is neither formed nor broken. (b) Type II: Carbon monoxide (or a partially hydrogenated intermediate, e.g., HCO) reacts with an oxygen atom on the catalyst surface to give an intermediate, typically a formate, which contains two C-O bonds. Subsequent reaction leads overall to methanol and the reformation of the surface oxygen atom.

The studies were performed in a fixed-bed microreactor system at temperatures in the range 473-523 {Kappa}. Variation of catalyst particle size in the range 0.2.-2.6 mm shows that the conversion of synthesis gas decreases considerably when the average particle size is increased. The effects of variation of particle size and pore diameter have been quantified with the Thiele model for diffusion limitations. Evidence has accumulated that the limited mobility of reactant molecules in the liquid-filled pores of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts is the main cause of retardation of the reaction rates. The experimentally determined reaction rates with various catalysts operated under different conditions show an excellent fit with the theoretical model.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: A.I.Ch.E.

A comparison is made of the emissions benefits achieved when methanol or ethanol is used either in neat form or as the blending agent with gasoline. The primary dependent variable considered is emission level (reported on various bases) with the main independent variables being fuel composition, equivalence ratio, and ignition timing. Brief mention is also made of the potential emissions reduction that may be achieved by using dissociated methanol.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 424-431","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; CODEN: JETPE","10.1115/1.3240271","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","6956268","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6956268","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA)","","111:3"

Tests were conducted on an OEM four-cylinder engine running at different conditions of equivalence ratio and spark timing. Fuel blends with different percentages of alcohol content and different ratios of methanol to ethanol in the alcohol mixture were tested. Results of this investigation indicate that the presence of either or both of the alcohols in fuel blends significantly reduced the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaust emissions (up to 40-50 percent compared to pure gasoline only), with methanol slightly more effective than ethanol. Hydrocarbon emissions were also decreased by increasing the alcohol content of the fuel, with minimum hydrocarbon production occurring at percent alcohol-gasoline blends in conjunction with near-stoichiometric air-fuel ratios. However, aldehyde emissions were found to be markedly higher with alcohol-gasoline blends. The 10 percent alcohol-gasoline blends were found to produce about 50 percent more aldehyde emissions than pure gasoline.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 432-438","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; CODEN: JETPE","10.1115/1.3240272","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7010153","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7010153","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA)","","111:3"

The steady-state increases in catalytic rates are typically a factor of 20 higher than the rate of O{sup 2{minus}} transfer from the catalyst surface. Oxygen anion pumping causes up to sixfold increases in the rates of production of H{sub 2}CO, CO, and CH{sub 4} and induces significant changes in product selectivity. Over a wide range of conditions the rates of the catalytic reactions increase exponentially with catalyst-solid electrolyte interface overpotential {eta}, which is proportional to the induced change in catalyst work function. The phenomena are reversible and show that catalyst work function and catalytic activity and selectivity can be varied deliberately by adjusting the catalyst potential. The observed non-Faradaic rate enhancement for this catalytic system can be interpreted by taking into account the decrease in catalyst work function with decreasing catalyst potential and the consequent changes in the strength of chemisorptive bonds.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 118:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 147-163","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90307-2","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","7271266","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7271266","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","118:1"

Activation procedures using synthesis gas alone and using hydrogen pretreatment with subsequent oxidation in either syngas or N{sub 2}O are evaluated and compared. Reactive frontal chromatography was employed to perform in situ measurements of the specific copper surface area: values for active catalysts are typically less than 0.5 m{sup 2}/g and do not correlate with the synthesis activity. The thermal stability and resistance to poisoning of these materials was also studied. They exhibit irreversible deactivation at temperatures greater than 523 K and the activity of oxidized catalysts cannot be fully regenerated on reduction. Exposure of the active catalysts to CO{sub 2} leads to complete loss of synthesis activity at 473 K and results in the formation of a strongly bound CO{sub 2} complex. This CO{sub 2} cannot be fully desorbed below the thermal sintering temperatures of the catalysts.

The test parameters were alcohol content, intake-air properties, and fuel-air ratio. It was found that the ignition delay of alcohol-diesel blends is prolonged as the alcohol content is increased. Ehthanol-diesel blends developed longer ignition delays than those developed by isopropanol-diesel blends. The results show that ignition delay of alcohol-diesel blends can be effectively shortened using intake-air preheating and/or supercharging. The high activation energy of alcohols with respect to diesel fuel is believed to be responsible for the long ignition delays associated with the use of alcohols as alternate fuels in compression ignition engines.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 439-444","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; CODEN: JETPE","10.1115/1.3240273","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","7226161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7226161","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; (USA)","","111:3"

Very small amounts of propylene and water are also formed. This pattern of reactivity contrasts sharply to the selective oxidation to acrolein observed on Ag(110). On the clean Cu(110) surface allyl alcohol undergoes O-H cleavage to form the surface alkoxide CH{sub 2}{double bond}CHCH{sub 2}O{sub (a)} and H{sub (a)}. The results suggest that the olefin in this species undergoes partial hydrogenation to the surface-bound oxametallacycles ({minus}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O-){sub (a)} and ({minus}CH-(CH{sub 3})CH{sub 2}O-){sub (a)} and complete hydrogenation to CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O{sub (a)}. Propanal forms at 320 K via further reaction of these oxametallacycles. Evidence for a {pi}-bonded allyl oxide CH{sub 2}{double bond}CHCH{sub 2}O{sub (a)}, which is more stable than n-propoxide (CH{sub 3}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O{sub (a)}) toward {beta}-hydride elimination, is presented. This allyl oxide decomposes at 370 K to form acrolein. The interaction of the double bond with the surface apparently restricts the interaction of the {beta}-C-H bond with the surface and increases the stability of this species. Propanal, acrolein, and H{sub 2} are formed at 435 K by a process thought to involve the thermal decomposition of ({minus}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}CH{sub 2}O-){sub (a)} by a {beta}-hydride elimination pathway. This dehydrogenation pathway exhibits an activation energy 8 kcal/mol greater than for acyclic alkoxides. The conversion of allyl alcohol to propanal and propyl alcohol obviously involves the hydrogenation of the double bond which, by comparison, does not occur for propylene coadsorbed with hydrogen under similar conditions on this surface.","","","","","","United States","1989-06-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:13","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4553-4561","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSA","10.1021/ja00195a003","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7157829","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7157829","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA)","","111:13"

The fragmentation pattern strongly suggests that reactions occurring within these triply charged clusters are similar to those previously observed for singly and doubly charged ammonia clusters.

That is, either one, two, three, or none of the ammonia cations may react with the solvating neutrals within the cluster.

Transition states and reaction paths between the pairs of possible isomers, methylacetylene, allene, cyclopropene, propenylidene, vinylmethylene, and cyclopropylidene were determined. In addition, the zero-point energies were calculated, and the activation energies for pertinent reactions were evaluated. The thermal rearrangement of allene to methylacetylene was found to proceed in four steps via vinylmethylene, cyclopropene, and propenylidene with the activation energy of 65.8 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the observed values of 60.5 and 63.8 kcal/mol. The same reaction paths can also apply to pyrolysis of cyclopropene, in which it undergoes conversion to methylacetylene via propenylidene more easily than to allene via vinylmethylene; the calculated activation energies are 38.1 and 43.4 kcal/mol, respectively. These are again in excellent agreement with the observed values of 37.5 and 43.3 kcal/mol. The activation energies for the allene to cyclopropylidene and the reverse conversions were calculated to be 72.2 and 10.2 kcal/mol. This indicates that cyclopropylidene may not be involved in the interconversion of allene, cyclopropene, and methylacetylene. One of the significant findings in this study is the reaction path for the cyclopropene to methylacetylene conversion via propenylidene, which is less energy demanding than that via vinylmethylene. This made the calculated mechanisms in accord with the experimental data. Furthermore, we will present and discuss reaction mechanisms for pyrolysis of singly and doubly substituted cyclopropene in which this particular reaction path is expected to play a dominant role.","","","","","","United States","1989-06-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 4198-4209","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSA","10.1021/ja00194a008","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","7072378","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7072378","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA)","","111:12"

Platinum's catalytic influence on gas phase ignition was found to depend strongly on the fuel-air ratio. Experiments were performed in a flat plate boundary layer configuration at 1 atm pressure and surface temperatures of 1200-1650 K. The hydroxyl measurements were made by planar and pointwise laser-induced fluorescence. Inhibition of ethane-air ignition was observed at equivalence ratios greater than 0.35, with enhancement seen below this value. Depletion of fuel near the catalytic surface by mass transfer-limited oxidation reactions can account for the catalyst's inhibition effect. Catalytic promotion of gas phase ignition was evidenced by significantly higher OH concentration levels over platinum plates (as compared to quartz) for the leanest equivalence ratio tested. The results indicate that catalytic surface-induced production of active intermediates can promote gas phase ignition and offset the effect of reactant depletion near the surface.","","","Yale Univ., New Haven, CT (USA).

We measure the temperature and chemical responses of the system as we change the forcing amplitudes, periods, and equivalence ratios. Using a simple model of a Carnot engine we calculate efficiency changes in an externally varied flux mode (VFM) of operation relative to the constant flux mode (CFM) of operation. We find increases and decreases in the average temperature, efficiency, and unburnt fuel concentrations in the VFM relative to the CFM. For certain constraints we find regions where the average temperature in the VFM is less than that of the CFM and there is an efficiency increase. We find other regions where the entire temperature response in the VFM is greater than that of the CFM and this also can lead to an efficiency increase which is due to changes in extent of combustion and heat losses. The effects of forcing amplitudes, periods, and equivalence ratios on the system are explored, and predictions of numerical calculations agree with much of the data. A simple model of the reaction limited by one reagent, and the absorption of heat by the products and the other reagent predicts for variations of one reagent the number of maxima in the response, and phase relations of external variations and the response.","","","Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305","","","United States","1989-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Therefore, from a process standpoint, there was a significant incentive to conceive a viable form of semi-refrigerated marine transport - particularly for the higher gases such as methane and ethane. The use of multiple cylindrical vessels can improve the space utilization and reduce the individual vessel wall thicknesses to manageable levels.

When the new reboilers were put in service, it was found that they worked at less than 30% of design efficiency. Very little heat was being added to the bottom of the tower and to the bottom product which was a C/sub 2/ + mixture containing high amounts of methane. This resulted in the ethane product being off specification quality. These exchangers act as reboilers for the demethanizer tower by vaporizing the methane out of a liquid C/sub 2/ + mixture. The liquid is taken from a seal pan situated below the bottom tray of the tower and enters the bottom of each reboiler. The bubble point liquid is partially vaporized through heat exchange with inlet gas.

McEligot has suggested that the improved heat flux results from a subcooling created by selective distillation at the liquid-vapor interface. Combining this idea with a recent correlation of subcooled burnout, the authors estimate the extent of the effective subcooling qualitatively and discuss the use of this estimate to correlate burnout in binary mixtures. Two dimensionless groups are proposed to characterize this effective subcooling, both based on appropriate characterizations of the phase equilibrium diagram.","","","","","","United States","1989-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Heat Transfer (Transactions of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), Series C); (United States); Journal Volume: 111:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 480-486","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1481; CODEN: JHTRA","10.1115/1.3250702","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","6083879","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6083879","","Journal of Heat Transfer (Transactions of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers), Series C); (United States)","","111:2"

Precursor activation was carried out in pure hydrogen, N{sub 2}/H{sub 2}, and CO/H{sub 2} under various regimes of temperature and pressure. It is found that the formation of active catalysts depends upon the presence of cerium hydride and transition metal crystallites in the ultimate material, although there is no correlation between XRD-derived metal areas and chemical rates. The corresponding transition metal/cerium dioxide catalysts have a much lower activity for ammonia synthesis. The special activity of the hydride-based catalysts may arise from an intimate interaction between the support phase and the ultradispersed transition metal particles.","","","","","","United States","1989-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 117:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 102-120","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90224-8","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","6404850","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6404850","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","117:1"

The ethylene selectivities steadily increased with the Si/Al ratio and reached a maximum of 99.6% using the silicon-rich H-ZSM-5 zeolites.

Mechanism a and mechanism b have the same set of elementary reactions, but the rate constants for these elementary reactions were obtained from two different references. If mechanism a is used, the authors conclude that at low rates of strain the concentration of CH/sub 2/OH and HCO are in steady state and, if partial equilibrium is assumed for certain reactions, there exist algebraic relations among the concentrations of the radicals OH, H, and O. As the rate of strain is increased, HCO is no longer in steady state and no solution was obtained for a strain rate greater than 521 s/sup -1/.

The reaction was studied in the temperature range 623-773 K, at a total pressure of 204 or 513 kPa, and for a H{sub 2}/N{sub 2} ratio of 3. Dinitrogen chemisorption in the absence of H{sub 2} was also measured at 773 K by the transient kinetic technique. The results suggest that N is the most abundant reactive intermediate. It may be inferred, as expected, that a kinetically significant reaction step exists on the reaction path followed by nitrogen. Hydrogen appears to enhance this step which seems to involve dinitrogen dissociation. The working surface was observed to be heterogeneous with respect to the synthesis reaction. The steady-state isotopic transient curves, at 204 kPa and temperatures of 623 and 673 K, indicate one main pool of nitrogen-containing surface intermediates. At 723 and 773 K, a second less reactive pool of intermediates developed due, perhaps, to the activation of previously dormant or saturated sites or to possible contributions from bulk-phase nitrogen species. Both pools of N-intermediates were kinetically nonuniform. This investigation provides significant new insight into ammonia synthesis catalysis.","","","","","","United States","1989-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 117:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 121-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90225-X","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6348502","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6348502","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","117:1"

The liquid fuels consisted of blends of 3-carene, cyclopentadiene, or norbornadiene with cardanol in the weight ratio 70:30 for the first two and 85:15 for norbornadiene. In all these cases, synergism in ignition was believed to be due to the fast and exothermic oligomerization of 3-carene, cyclopentadiene, and norbornadiene in the presence of acid. The exothermicity of the systems was enhanced by the addition of cardanol to the unsaturation of oligomers, leading to the formation of highly oxidizable phenolic ethers. Two more important reactions at the preignition stage were nitration and oxidation of the ethers leading to the production of gaseous combustibles and heat. In this case, an attempt has been made to extend the range of possible preignition reactions by introducing diene-dienophile Diels-Alder cycloaddition with low activation energy by replacing cardanol with furfuryl alcohol or furfurylideneacetone having a furan ring to behave as acid polymerizable dienes in the above systems.","","","Institute of Armament Technology, Girinagar, Pune (IN)","","","United States","1989-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

Methanol was selectivity produced on all catalysts at 523 K, 5 MPa, and with a feed gas of molar composition H{sub 2}/CO = 2. When normalized with respect to surface area, the methanol synthesis rate was found to increase by an order of magnitude from Li to Cs with the majority of the increase occurring from Na to K. On the basis of apparent activation energy measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy results, activity differences were attributed to differences in the concentration of Cu{sup +} species at the surface and not to electronic effects. Alkali-cuprates, for example LiCuO, were determined not to be the active phase responsible for Cu{sup +} stabilization. Under conditions more favorable for higher alcohol synthesis, 573 K and H{sub 2}/CO = 1, little change in selectivity was observed for the Na-, K-, Rb-, and Cs-promoted catalysts. However, the lithium-promoted catalyst produced an equimolar mixture of normal alcohols and hydrocarbons. Both product distributions were found to give linear Flory plots with propagation constants of 0.3 for alcohols and 0.5 for hydrocarbons.","","","","","","United States","1989-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 116:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 488-497","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90115-2","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","6473145","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6473145","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","116:2"

Three subsets of equations, the gas-phase, the liquid-phase, and the droplet equations, are solved by a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian, explicit-implicit method. Major features of the ignition model are that a zero heat-flux criterion is used to define ignition, a global one-step reaction scheme with nonunity exponents of fuel and oxygen is employed for a multifuel system, and the transient thermal and composition fields inside the droplet are resolved via a diffusion-limit model. Monodisperse and polydisperse size distributions are considered. The results are presented for a bicomponent fuel spray. The ignition behavior exhibits a strong sensitivity to the initial fuel composition. The presence of a volatile component, even in small amounts, can greatly improve the ignitability of nonvolatile fuel sprays. The relative enhancement in ignitability depends strongly on the droplet size, volatility differential, hot wall temperature, and, to a lesser degree, on the equivalence ratio. The results are significant from a practical point of view as the concept may be used to improve the ignitability of liquid fuel sprays.","","","Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL (US)","","","United States","1989-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The lacunary derivatives in which the empty tungsten site is unoccupied show no catalytic activity. The catalytic mechanism involves the intermediate formation of a nitrosyl complex of the Fe(II) form of the catalyst. The pH dependence of the rate of formation of the nitrosyl complex shows that nitrous acid is the reactive form of nitrite between pH 2 and 8. The catalyzed reduction does not produce hydroxylamine as an intermediate and appears to depend upon the ability of the multiply reduced heteropolytungstates to deliver electrons to the NO group bound to the iron center in a concerted, multiple-electron step. The iron-substituted heteropolytungstates are not degraded by repeated cycling between their oxidized and reduced states. A particularly valuable feature of the heteropolytungstate is the ease with which the formal potentials of the several redox couples they exhibit may be shifted by changing the identity of the central heteroatom. Exploitation of this feature provides diagnostic information that can be decisive in establishing the mechanism of electrocatalytic processes.","","","","","","United States","1989-03-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA); Journal Volume: 111:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2444-2451","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7863; CODEN: JACSA","10.1021/ja00189a012","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5271687","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5271687","","Journal of the American Chemical Society; (USA)","","111:7"

The authors report studies of the combustion of cyclohexane + air, in the molar proportions cC/sub 6/H/sub 12/:air = 1:2, using five closed vessels covering a very extensive range of volume (0.2-20 dm/sup 3/). The authors use the minimum ignition temperature measured in each vessel to test scaling rules for the prediction of conditions for criticality. Measurements were also made of the yields of some products, the extent of reaction (and from it the rate), and the accompanying temperature change under both subcritical and supercritical conditions. Characteristic cooling times from hot gases in each vessel were also assessed experimentally. The authors show that fuel-rich compositions undergo isothermal oxidation that follows a quadratic, autocatalytic rate law. Departures from this due to self-heating of the reactants are also reported. Spontaneous ignition occurs as a result of chemical autocatalysis augmented by self-heating. On the basis of the Semenov parameter for criticality in a corrected form of the condition for thermal ignition, the autoignition temperatures in vessels of different size are found to match a linear scaling relationship. This would be expected in systems in which spatially uniform temperatures prevail.","","","Health and Safety Executive, Research and Lab.

The flame jet is produced by an acetylene-air flame in a 0.66 m diameter tube, 11 m long. The composition of the mixture was varied to obtain the critical composition for initiation of detonation in the cloud, with and without obstacles at the end of the tube. Numerical calculations were used to characterize the flame jet. Transition to detonation in the flame jet from an open tube was observed for acetylene-air mixtures with more than 7.9% C/sub 2/H/sub 2/. The mechanism of transition observed on the high-speed film records is analogous to that seen in similar laboratory experiments, with a localized explosion somewhere in the turbulent flame jet leading to the onset of detonation. Transition was facilitated by placing various obstacles at the exit of the tube. With an orifice plate with 50 mm diameter holes, initiation of detonation in a 7.0% C/sub 2/H/sub 2/ mixture occurs uniformly across the flame jet a short distance downstream of the plate. With a circular central obstacle in the tube exit, transition to detonation was observed in a 5.6and C/sub 2/H/sub 2/ mixture. From the results of this investigation, it is concluded that the phenomena of hot gas jet initiation of detonation seen in laboratory experiments with fuel-oxygen mixtures also occur in fuel-air mixtures provided the jet is large enough.","","","Defence Research Establishment Suffield, Ralston, Alberta, T0J 2N0 (CA); Research Center, Norsk Hydro, Porsgrunn (NO); Trondheim (NO); Norwegian Defence Construction Service, Akershus, Oslo (NO); The Chr.

Under high alcohol synthesis conditions, e.g., 583 K, 7.6 MPa, and gas hourly space velocity = 3260 liters (STP)/kg cat/hr with a H{sub 2}/CO = 0.45 synthesis gas, the presence of cesium promoted the formation of higher oxygenates, especially 2-methyl-1-propanol. The yields of products passed through distinct maxima at cesium nominal concentrations of 0.3-0.5%. The principal role of cesium was to increase the ethanol synthesis rate and to provide an even greater enhancement in the rate of ethanol conversion to 1-propanol and subsequently to higher alcohols. To obtain insight into the mechanism of the carbon chain growth and linear versus branched carbon chain growth, a {sup 13}C-NMR study of the C{sub 2}-C{sub 4} product formed over Cu/ZnO and 0.4 mol% Cs/Cu/ZnO catalysts was performed.

The position of the {sup 13}C label in the CH{sub 3} group of propanol provides evidence for retention of oxygen associated with the C{sub 1} intermediate, formed from CO/H{sub 2}, and loss of oxygen associated with {sup 13}CH{sub 2}OH group of ethanol. Mechanistically, such a retention is favored by a {beta}-ketoalkoxide intermediate that is bonded to the cesium centers via its anionic oxygen. This unique mechanism is termed here in as aldol coupling with oxygen retention reversal and is specific to the presence of the cesium salt dopant. 35 refs.","","","","","","United States","1989-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 116:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 195-221","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90086-9","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","6214744","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6214744","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","116:1"

In order to observe the soot formation under high pressure, the premixtures are simultaneously ignited by eight spark plugs located on the chamber circumference at 45/sup 0/ intervals. The eight converging flames compress the end gases to a high pressure, and the soot concentration in the chamber center during the final stage of combustion at the highest pressure is measured by the in situ laser-extinction method. The pressures during soot formation are varied by changing the initial charge pressure, and the temperatures by changing the inert gas compositions. It is found that the soot yield at lower temperatures rises sharply with increasing pressure, but the dependence of pressure gets weaker with higher temperatures, and the pressure and temperature during soot formation mainly influence the soot yield.","","","Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1, Ohokayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo (JP)","","","United States","1989-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The results agree with earlier calculations by P. Stoltze and J.K. Norskov. Furthermore, the kinetic simulations confirm the fact that the dissociation of molecular dinitrogen precursor species is a slow step in the mechanism; however, other steps may also become slow depending on reaction conditions. Atomic nitrogen appears to be the most abundant reactive intermediate on the iron surface, except at the reactor inlet, where a variety of adsorbed species may compete for surface sites.

The atomic ratios R = (Cu + Co)/Al and r = Cu/Co were varied between 12 {ge} R {ge} 1 and 5 {ge} r {ge} 0.5. The thermal decomposition of solid citrate precursors was carried out in air and nitrogen, and characterized by DTA, derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and IR spectroscopy. Results showed that the main steps of the decomposition in air were (i) an exothermic transformation at 135-150{degree}C which represented a mass loss of {Delta}W = 25-35%, (ii) an intermediate decomposition at 220-240{degree}C of {Delta}W = 10-12%, and (iii) a highly exothermic decomposition at 280-300{degree}C of {Delta}W = 20-25%. IR spectra indicated that the low-temperature decomposition was caused by an exothermic reaction between ionic nitrates and free carboxyl groups. The high temperature stage corresponded to the oxidation of the citric acid structure. Above 280{degree}C, the treatment in N{sub 2} caused the breakup of the citrate chains through several consecutive transformations. In all the cases, the main characteristics of the decomposition peaks depended on the metallic composition. The decomposition of the precursors in air showed a high tendency to uncontrolled decomposition. On the other hand, after the N{sub 2} treatment at 500{degree}C a significant content of carbon remained on the samples. The advantage of performing a two-step decomposition procedure using first nitrogen up to 280{degree}C and after that an air atmosphere to oxidize the organic part of precursors at relatively low temperature is particularly discussed in this paper.","","","","","","United States","1989-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 116:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 71-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90076-6","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6355402","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6355402","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","116:1"

The reaction is found to be structure sensitive. The Rh (331) surface is three times more active in the ammonolysis reaction, but poisons faster and produces 8-10 times more cracking products than the Rh (111). Auger electron spectroscopy and thermal desorption spectroscopy results indicate that the reaction takes place on an overlayer which covers 95% of the total surface of the catalyst and contains C, N, and O. On the deactivated catalyst this layer contains more carbon. The mechanism of the reaction is independent of the surface structure of the rhodium catalyst since the apparent activation energies for the two surfaces are practically the same (21-22 kcal/mol). Most of the results are consistent with a model according to which the n-butanol is oxidized first to n-butanal which then reacts with ammonia and then possibly through an imine intermediate the butyronitrile is produced. 34 refs.","","","","","","United States","1989-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 399-409","","","AC03-76SF00098","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90044-4","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","6842486","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6842486","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","115:2"

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of {sup 11}B and {sup 27}Al was used to determine the local structure. Two boron species were identified: a tetrahedral BO{sub 4} and a trigonal BO{sub 3}. The relative amounts of the two boron species were dependent on the B/Al stoichiometry. Three aluminum species were identified: a tetrahedral AlO{sub 4}, an octahedral AlO{sub 6}, and an AlO{sub 4} with four B next-nearest neighbors. The strength and concentration of acid sites present on the surface of the aluminum borates were determined using adsorbed indicators. The presence and coordination of boron were seen to have a dramatic effect on the acidity of these materials with the acidity being closely related to the relative concentration of BO{sub 4}. 2-Propanol dehydration was used as a probe reaction to measure the acidity.

The results of olefin addition study suggest that the alcohol formation from CO-H{sub 2} proceeds by a mechanism including steps identical with those in the hydrocarbonylation of olefins and that KCl suppresses the simple hydrogenation of olefins. Both of the Mo catalysts demonstrate a poor catalytic activity for the homologation of methanol to ethanol. Alcohol homologation seems to be only a minor process in the formation of C{sub 2}{sup +} alcohols. No significant activity of Mo catalysts for incorporation of acetaldehyde into C{sub 3} oxygenated compounds may exclude the intermediacy of aldehydes for the chain growth of alcohols. Hydrogenation of acetaldehyde to ethanol is the fast and predominant reaction, in agreement with the fact that alcohols compose more 90% of the organic oxygenates produced from CO-H{sub 2}. Aldol condensation is apparently unimportant for the chain growth. The contribution of alcohol dehydration to hydrocarbon formation may be insignificant over the KCl-promoted catalyst with K/Mo = 0.4. Consequently, a mechanism including CO insertion into the alkyl-metal bond is proposed for the main reaction path for the higher alcohol formation from CO-H{sub 2}. The role of K is supposed to slow the hydrogenation of surface alkyl species to form alkanes as well as to increase the active sites for alcohol formation by retarding the reduction of Mo.","","","","","","United States","1989-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 388-398","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90043-2","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","6912846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6912846","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","115:2"

Metallic copper by itself is inactive for the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide, while the authors have found that the addition of potassium to copper forms an active and selective (up to 98 wt %) methanol synthesis catalyst. The initiation of catalytic activity correlated with the stabilization of the Cu{sup +} species. The potassium promoter was determined to be in the form of the thermodynamically stable carbonate.

The H-RHO catalysts typically contain chabazite or chabazite and pollucite impurities. SiO{sub 2} is more effective than Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} for improving DMA selectivity. SiO{sub 2} coatings from monosilicic acid (MSA) reduce dimethyl ether (DME) yields over shallow-bed nitrogen (SBN)-calcined H-RHO, whereas Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} coatings and SiO{sub 2} coatings (from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS)) do not. Correlations between thickness of SiO{sub 2} (TEOS or MSA) coatings and DMA selectivity as well as a decrease in the n-hexane rate of sorption suggest a physical hindrance to egress of TMA from RHO channels and cages to the product stream. Coating deep-bed calcined H-pollucite with either Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} or SiO{sub 2} from TEOS reduces activity and increases DMA selectivity through deactivation of nonselective surface sites. Improvement of DMA selectivity by coating DB-calcined H-RHO catalysts occurs primarily from (i) H-RHO port constriction and (ii) deactivation of external acid sites of H-RHO and H-pollucite and secondarily from deactivation of H-chabazite. Improvement of DMA selectivity by coating SBN-calcined H-HO catalysts occurs primarily from (i) H-RHO port constriction and (ii) further deactivation of external acid sites of H-RHO and amorphous H-chabazite and secondarily from the deactivation of H-pollucite. SiO{sub 2} coatings on H-ZK-5 increased DMA selectivity and decreased DME yields, but reduced activity.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 148-158","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(89)90015-8","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7127219","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7127219","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","115:1"

The system accomplishes droplet formation, coalescence, and phase separation utilizing a single electric field while operating under countercurrent flow conditions. The mass-transport capability of this system has been analyzed by observing the transfer of acetic acid from water (dispersed phase) into methyl isobutyl ketone. Results are reported in terms of the number of theoretical transfer stages per centimeter of column. The emulsion-phase contactor, which has 1.7 stages/cm, outperforms laboratory-scale versions of the York-Scheibel column by a factor of 17 and the Podbielniak centrifugal contactor by a factor of 10. The mass-transfer performance along with the minimal energy requirements of this conceptual device combine to make it an attractive possibility for greatly enhanced solvent extraction operations.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab., Oak Ridge, TN (US)","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ind.

Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) were identified using high-resolution capillary column chromatography with a parallel triple detector system for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrogen-containing PAH, and sulphur-containing PAH. Identification of the PAC using retention indexes was confirmed using an ion trap detector, which was also used to quantify the low-concentration (<1 ppm) benzo(a)pyrene. It was conclusively shown for both engines that the bulk of the particulate solvent organic fraction, including the PAH fraction, was unburned fuel. However, there was some evidence that high molecular weight five-ring PAH may have an in-cylinder formation contribution, and it is postulated that this could be due to pyrolysis of lower molecular weight unburned fuel PAH. The contribution of lubricating oil to the particulate PAC is discussed, and evidence is presented that shows the unburned fuel PAC accumulates in the lubricating oil and thus contributes to the particulate PAC via the large lubricating oil component of the particulate PAC.","","","Dept. of Fuel and Energy, Univ. of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT (GB); Dept. of Physical Chemistry, Univ. of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT (GB)","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combust.

The effect is most pronounced among those fuels which contain catalytically cracked light cycle oils. Extraction of four test fuels, 70/30 blends of straight run stocks and light cycle oils, with aqueous base indicated that base extraction had little to no effect on insolubles formation. A fuel blending experiment, which involved blending several straight runs with various light cycle oils, implicates the catalytically cracked light cycle oils as primary repositories of the precursor materials which bring about the formation of insolubles. The methanol extract may serve as a chemical probe for the sediment precursors and may thus function as an indicator for instability under long term storage conditions.","","","Southeastern Massachusetts Univ., Dept. of Chemistry, N.

In a previous paper the authors described the formation required to ensure that a kinetic model extrapolates the rate constants involved over wide ranges of temperature and pressure. This approach is illustrated here for the system centered around the ethane intermediate. It is necessary and sufficient to specify the temperature and pressure dependence of three rate constants k(T,P) and the temperature dependence of two equilibrium constants K(T), viz., C/sub 2/H/sub 6/ ..-->.. CH/sub 3/+CH/sub 3/ k/sub luni/(T,P), K(T); CH/sub 3/+CH/sub 3/ ..-->.. C/sub 2/H/sub 5/+H k/sub bi/(T,P); C/sub 2/H/sub 6/ ..-->.. C/sub 2/H/sub 5/+H k/sub 2uni/(T,P), K(T).

In addition to methane, significant amounts of dimethyl ether were produced. The reaction orders obtained from power rate laws for methanation indicated that the surfaces of the catalytic ensembles were not completely saturated by CO, in contrast to the observations for most conventional CO hydrogenation catalysts. A kinetic analysis and parameter estimation was performed to identify the rate-determining step for methanation. A catalytic cycle was postulated that could account not only for the formation of methane and higher hydrocarbons, but also for dimethyl ether as a primary product.","","","9500103; 4138000","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: A.I.Ch.E.

Around 1984 or so, conventional wisdom shifted to methanol as the fuel of the future. In both cases a driving force was the perception of a lack of adaptability by the oil and automobile industries. Resistance to fuels different from gasoline and diesel fuel eased in light of the economic and environmental problems of synfuels. In this paper, the authors address the following questions: Will economic forces motivate another shift, to natural gas Will environmental forces compel an even more drastic shift, to hydrogen or electric vehicles","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Annual Review of Energy; (USA); Journal Volume: 14","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 375-424","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-1626; CODEN: AREND","10.1146/annurev.eg.14.110189.002111","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","7009052","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7009052","","Annual Review of Energy; (USA)","","14"
