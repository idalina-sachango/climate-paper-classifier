"3D printed triply periodic minimal surfaces as advanced structured packings for solvent-based CO <sub>2</sub> capture","Ellebracht, Nathan C.; Roy, Pratanu; Moore, Thomas; Gongora, Aldair E.; Oyarzun, Diego I.; Stolaroff, Joshuah K.; Nguyen, Du T.","42 ENGINEERING; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS","Point-source CO<sub>2</sub> capture is a critical technology for industrial decarbonization and certain CO<sub>2</sub> removal processes. Solvent-based CO<sub>2</sub> absorption is a mature process, but the capital investment and energy requirements are substantial, especially when economic drivers for its deployment are tenuous. We utilized additive manufacturing and computational fluid dynamics to screen and prototype structured packings in the vast design space accessible via advanced manufacturing and computer-aided design. 3D-printed triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) were tested as advanced packing geometries for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from simulated flue gas (10% CO<sub>2</sub>) and evaluated alongside a representative industrial packing geometry, Mellapak 250Y. 1D model fits of experimental absorption data revealed 49–61% increases in mass transfer performance (k<sub>L</sub>a<sub>eff</sub>) and 91–140% increases in effective gas–liquid interfacial area in TPMS packings (Gyroid and Schwarz-D) compared to 250Y. These advanced structured packings also featured similar or better maximum fluid loads and pressure drops than 250Y, reinforcing their industrial potential. Together with the capability to natively distribute fluid shown by the TPMS geometries, the performance improvements realized could reduce absorber capital costs by more than 30%.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The paper demonstrated that the laser carving of micropatterns on the outer surface of the alumina tubular membranes could greatly increase their outer surface area and enhance gas-liquid turbulence for a reduced diffusion mass transfer resistance. Six kinds of micropattern configurations were fabricated and studied, including random and regular micropatterns. By introducing a 500-μm solid grid micropattern, the outer surface area doubles and enhances carbon dioxide capture efficiency from 61% to 97% after the membrane was hydrophobically modified with fluoroalkylsilane.

"NOx formation from ammonia, and its effects on oxy-combustion of hydrocarbon fuels under supercritical-CO2 conditions","Gokulakrishnan, Ponnuthurai; Shao, Jiankun; Klassen, Michael S.; Davidson, David F.; Hanson, Ronald K.

This effect is investigated computationally and experimentally in the present work. A chemical kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction between NH radical and CO<sub>2</sub> plays an important role in determining the rate of NO<sub>x</sub> formation at these conditions. It was also found that a significant reduction in the NO<sub>x</sub> formation from ammonia oxidation occurs with sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion at 300 atm when compared to traditional gas turbine conditions. A chemical reactor network simulation of realistic sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle conditions confirmed the reduced NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Monte Carlo simulations used to study the sensitivity of model input variables on the emissions showed that CO<sub>2</sub> cooling impacts the CO emissions while most of the NO<sub>x</sub> are generated in the flame zone. Uncertainty analysis showed that the reaction between NH and CO<sub>2</sub> to form HNO radical is an important contributor to the model uncertainty under sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion conditions. The presence of combustion-generated NO<sub>x</sub> in the recycled-CO<sub>2</sub> can impact the fuel oxidation in the primary zone of the combustor. Hence, to understand the effect of NO<sub>x</sub> on ignition, high-pressure shock tube ignition delay time experiments were performed at conditions relevant to sCO<sub>2</sub> oxy-combustion. The ignition delay time measurements were made for syngas and CH<sub>4</sub> fuels with and without NO addition under supercritical conditions using CO<sub>2</sub> as the bulk diluent at nominal pressures around 100 atm. Experimental data showed that the presence of NO promotes ignition at these conditions. The effect is more pronounced for CH<sub>4</sub> compared to syngas. Nitric oxide acts as a chemical catalyst to promote ignition by increasing the combustion radical pool. The catalytic cycle involves the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub> which also contributes to CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation by H-atom abstraction to generate CH<sub>3</sub> radical.","Elsevier","","Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc., Columbia, MD (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

"Evaluating the intrinsic resistance to balling of alloys: A High-throughput physics-informed and data-enabled approach","Vela, Brent; Mehalic, Seth; Sheikh, Sofia; Elwany, Alaa; Karaman, Ibrahim; Arróyave, Raymundo","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Additive manufacturing; Alloy design; CALPHAD; Melting; Balling","To date, the vast majority of work on metal additive manufacturing (AM) has been framed in terms of the need to tune processing conditions for a particular AM technology in order to print conventional alloys, oftentimes developed for fabrication methods other than AM. This approach overlooks the fact that historically, many engineering alloy system has been designed with a particular processing route in mind, e.g., ingot metallurgy, powder metallurgy, rapid quenching, etc. There are thus significant opportunities to design alloys specifically for AM. A key challenge is that alloy design requires performance metrics that can be optimized by exploring the alloy chemistry space. Here, we present a study in which we examine how intrinsic thermophysical properties can be used to estimate performance metrics related to the behavior of a solidifying metal droplet under AM-relevant conditions. By identifying these intrinsic properties, it is possible to directly incorporate ‘intrinsic printability’, specifically ‘intrinsic resistance to balling’, into AM-focused alloy design.","Elsevier","","Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Additive Manufacturing Letters; Journal Volume: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 100085","","","AR0001427; NSF-DGE-1545403","Journal ID: ISSN 2772-3690","10.1016/j.addlet.2022.100085","","2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","1894253","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894253","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894253","Additive Manufacturing Letters","","3"

The split gas flow rate used was 44.75 ton/h and contained 0.0023 mol% SO<sub>2</sub> and 13.33 mol% CO<sub>2</sub>. The process includes a washing unit, a CO<sub>2</sub> absorption unit, a reverse osmosis unit, and a solvent regeneration unit or an ultrafiltration unit. The washing unit uses deionized water to completely remove SO<sub>2</sub> and the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption unit uses SGS to capture at least 90 mol% of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the split flue gas stream. Upon CO<sub>2</sub> and SGS reactions, the resulting liquid products exhibit phase-separation into CO<sub>2</sub>-lean phase and CO<sub>2</sub>-rich phase, allow two distinct pathways. Pathway (i) is to regenerate mostly the CO<sub>2</sub>-rich phase, collect the released CO<sub>2</sub>, and compress it for sequestration purposes. Pathway (ii) is to send the liquid stream from the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption unit to the ultrafiltration unit to separate the solid nanomaterials. The hydraulics and mass transfer characteristics in the washing and CO<sub>2</sub> absorption units were obtained; and techno-economic analysis (TEA) for Pathways (i) and (ii), including Capital Expenditure (CAPEX), Operating Expenditure (OPEX), and Levelized Cost of CO<sub>2</sub> Captured (LCOC), were calculated and compared.

Moreover, in Pathway (ii), 8.19 ton/h of CO<sub>2</sub> were captured to produce 15.62 ton/h NaHCO<sub>3</sub> nanomaterials, which were sold to offset the overall process cost.

The baseline testing shows reliable and consistent results for engine thermal efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), and coefficient of variance of the IMEP over a wide range of operating conditions while achieving effective control of all engine control and operation variables.

We develop the capability of producing dynamic-reservoir-simulation-based geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage supply curves with the Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> Tool (SCO<sub>2</sub>T) and use it with the ReEDS electric sector planning model to investigate the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation and geologic storage representation on energy system planning tool results. We use a locational case study of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region. Our results suggest that the cost of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage may be as low as $3/tCO<sub>2</sub> and that site-level assumptions may affect this cost by several dollars per tonne. At the grid level, the cost of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage has generally smaller effects compared to other assumptions (e.g., natural gas price), but small variations in this cost can change results (e.g., capacity deployment decisions) when policy renders CCS marginally competitive. The cost of CO<sub>2</sub> transportation generally affects the location of geologic CO<sub>2</sub> storage investment more than the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> captured or the location of electricity generation investment. We conclude with a few recommendations for future energy system researchers when modeling CCS.

"A Study of Propane Combustion in a Spark-Ignited Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) Engine","Kar, Tanmay; Fosudo, Toluwalase; Slunecka, Colin; Marchese, Anthony; Windom, Bret; Olsen, Daniel","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS","Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), whose primary composition is propane, is a promising candidate for heavy-duty vehicle applications as a diesel fuel alternative due to its CO<sub>2</sub> reduction potential and high knock resistance. To realize diesel-like efficiencies, spark-ignited LPG engines are proposed to operate near knock-limit over a wide range of operating conditions, which necessitates an investigation of fuel-engine interactions that leads to end-gas autoignition with propane combustion. This work presents both experimental and numerical studies of stoichiometric propane combustion in a sparkignited (SI) cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine. Engine experiments are initially conducted at different compression ratio (CR) values, and the effects of CR on engine combustion are characterized. A three-pressure analysis (TPA) model based on the two-zone combustion concept is developed in GT-Power and validated using test results to estimate in-cylinder wall temperatures, residual gas fraction, etc. This model is further utilized to examine end-gas chemistry by enabling the SI turbulent flame combustion and unburned gas chemical kinetics modules. Finally, a three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the CFR engine is developed in CONVERGE, where the G-equation and SAGE detailed chemical kinetics models are implemented for combustion modeling. Here, a 153 species reduced chemical kinetics mechanism derived from the detailed NUIGMech1.1 mechanism based on the ignition delay and laminar flame speed (LFS) studies is used to generate an LFS lookup table and to describe end-gas autoignition chemistry. Multi-cycle Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are then performed for the tested CRs, and the numerical model is shown to be capable of predicting the propane combustion characteristics, particularly the end-gas autoignition behavior.","SAE International","","Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2022-03-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SAE Technical Paper Series; Conference: SAE WCX 2022","","Medium: ED","","","EE0009198","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-7191","10.4271/2022-01-0404","","2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","1862323","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1862323","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1862323","SAE Technical Paper Series","",""

Here, reaction characteristics of a rich methane-air jet injected into a lean vitiated crossflow were analyzed at an elevated pressure of 5 atm. The jet was pre-heated and enriched with 0%, 15%, 30%, and 50% mass fraction to quantify the effect on pollutant emissions. Simulated results of the full chemistry Star-CCM+CFD model were verified with data taken in the experimental high-pressure combustion facility, which provides pressure, temperature and velocity profiles, as well as line-of-sight chemiluminescence and exit emission measurements. The analysis revealed the significant influence of the diluent to delay axial combustion; this mixing delay increased the axial flame lift-off and controlled any thermal ignition limitations. Increasing the diluent content increased the timescale for the flame to stabilize, which allowed for greater entrainment of crossflow oxidizer into the axial jet stream, and led to decreased pollutant emissions. Hence, crossflow entrainment is a critical driving force at high diluent content. Local nitric oxide (NO) emission formation in the axial stage was predicted numerically, showing the correlation between diluent addition, axial heat release, and the formation of nitric oxide pollution. The high diluent levels leaned out the jet mixture and delayed axial combustion, while reducing prompt and thermal NOx by mitigating flame hotspots and minimizing the timescale that the products remain at high temperatures.","Elsevier","","Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ., Daytona Beach, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2022-02-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 317","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 123481","","","FE0031227","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-2361","10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123481","","2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","1844551","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1844551","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1844551","Fuel","","317"

In this work, location-specific solidification cracking susceptibility has been investigated using an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach for a graded alloy formed by mixing P91 steel and Inconel 740H superalloy. An alloy mixture of 26 wt.% P91 and 74 wt.% Inconel 740H, with high configurational and total entropy, was fabricated using wire arc additive manufacturing. Microstructure characterization revealed intergranular solidification cracks in the FCC matrix, which increased in length along with the enrichment of Nb (~27 to 56 wt.%) and Cu (~87 wt.%) in the middle and top regions. DICTRA simulations to model location-specific solidification cracking susceptibility showed that the top region with the highest cooling rate (270 K/s) has the highest solidification cracking susceptibility in comparison with the middle and bottom regions. This is in good agreement with the experimentally observed varying crack length. From Scheil simulations, it was deduced that enrichment of Nb and Cu affected the solidification range as high as ~77%, in comparison with the matrix composition. The overall solidification cracking susceptibility and freezing range was highest for the 26 wt.% P91 alloy amongst the mixed compositions between P91 steel and 740H superalloy, proving that solidification characteristics play a major role in alloy design for additive manufacturing.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","Switzerland","2022-02-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metals Journal Volume: 12 Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 284","","","DE‐FE0031637; FE0031637","Journal ID: ISSN 2075-4701; MBSEC7; PII: met12020284","10.3390/met12020284","","2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","1843876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843876","","Metals","2","12"

Furthermore, nearly all published research on DAC has been conducted under indoor temperature conditions, i.e. 20 to 30 °C. In contrast, the future global implementation of DAC requires it to be operational across a wide expanse of geographical areas, of which the local temperatures can vary between -30 to 50 °C. Similarly, the absolute humidity can vary from ~0 to 84 g/m<sup>3</sup> in various locations. Due to the massive amount of air that would be processed, it may be impractical to preheat or dehumidify the air before the CO<sub>2</sub> separation. Therefore, it is important to develop DAC materials with good performance at realistic outdoor conditions, especially at sub-ambient conditions, i.e. -30 to 20 °C. In addition to material development, system-level studies at sub-ambient conditions are also needed for the DAC processes to reach optimal designs, which may be very different from those at ambient conditions. In this perspective article, we first assess the literature to identify the technical gaps that need to be filled for DAC to be applicable at realistic outdoor conditions. We then suggest additional research directions needed for DAC to be viable under varied conditions from the perspectives of materials and system designs. For materials, we discuss the expected physical and chemical property changes for the sorbents when the temperature or humidity reaches extremes within their range, and how that will impact performance. Similarly, for system design, we indicate how varied conditions will impact performance and how these changes will impact process optimization.","Springer","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Clean Coal and Carbon Management","","United States","2022-01-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1-19","","","FE0031952","Journal ID: ISSN 0256-1115","10.1007/s11814-021-0976-0","","2023-04-24T00:00:00Z","1970455","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1970455","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1970455","Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering","1","39"

In this work, bimetallic structures of Inconel 740H superalloy and P91 steel are processed using wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) for the first time. P91 steel is directly deposited over 740H with a cooling time of 20 minutes in between the two depositions. During microstructure characterization, a large gradient zone with coarse grains spanning for ~2200 μm is observed. Moreover, the microhardness of the gradient zone is the least in comparison with the P91 and 740H deposits. No deleterious phase formation is found; however, intergranular cracks are observed along the gradient zone. In order to deduce the reason for cracking, non-equilibrium solidification simulations are performed for the mixed compositions of P91 and 740H in the gradient zone. Here, the reasons for crack formation in the gradient zone are the sudden change in the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion due to the formation of MC carbides as well as the development of local strains from the thermal residual stresses. Therefore, altering the deposition sequence and introducing gradient layers with mixed composition between the P91 and 740H deposits will be beneficial in achieving defect-free builds. Through the integration of experiments and simulation, this work gains valuable insights into the processability of dissimilar alloy manufacturing using the WAAM technique.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-10-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Processing Technology; Journal Volume: 300","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 117396","","","FE0031637; DE‐FE0031637","Journal ID: ISSN 0924-0136","10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2021.117396","","2022-10-06T00:00:00Z","1842653","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1842653","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1842653","Journal of Materials Processing Technology","","300"

Future power plant siting costs will depend on a number of factors including the characteristics of the electricity capacity expansion and electricity demand (e.g., fuel mix of future electric power capacity, and the magnitude and geographic distribution of electricity demand growth) as well as the geographic location of power plants. Electricity technology capacity expansion plans modeled to represent alternate future conditions meeting a set of scenario assumptions are traditionally compared against historical trends which may not be consistent with current and future conditions. We present the `cerf` Python package (a.k.a., the Capacity Expansion Regional Feasibility model) which helps evaluate the feasibility and structure of future, scenario-driven electricity capacity expansion plans by siting power plants in areas that have been deemed the least cost option while considering dynamic future conditions. We can use `cerf` to gain insight to research topics such as: 1) under what conditions future projected electricity expansion plans from models such as GCAM-USA are possible to achieve, 2) where and which on-the-ground barriers to siting (e.g., protected areas, cooling water availability) may influence our ability to achieve certain expansions, and 3) how electricity infrastructure build-outs and value may evolve into the future when considering locational marginal pricing (LMP) based on the supply and demand of electricity from a grid operations model.","Open Source Initiative - NumFOCUS","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It is critical to identify novel strategies to mitigate environmental pollutants for both modern turbines operated on natural gas and future turbines projected to use carbon-free fuels (such as hydrogen). In the current study, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions of a reacting methane-air jet in a vitiated crossflow are experimentally investigated in a model axially staged combustor at 5 atm. The combustion products from the main stage combustor flow into the axial stage at temperatures ranging from 1580 to 1650 °C. The axial stage contains a reacting jet in crossflow, which provides an overall temperature rise ranging from 50 to 220 °C to generate exit temperatures similar to gas turbine engines. The focus of this paper is to explore the effects of flame liftoff and ignition timescales on the NO<sub>x</sub> contribution of this secondary jet. This is done by varying the premixed level and preheat temperature of the axial jet. The effects are explored at different momentum flux ratios (J), jet equivalence ratios (φ<sub>jet</sub>), exit temperatures (T<sub>exit</sub>), and main stage (headend) temperatures (T<sub>HE</sub>). High-speed CH* chemiluminescence imaging is employed for each test case to determine the flame stabilization point. For a given temperature rise and combustor exit temperature, an increase in ignition delay was observed with a decrease in jet temperature. This provided a NO<sub>x</sub> benefit, particularly for jets that are injected at or close to an ignitable mixture fraction. Similarly, the coaxial injector caused a significant ignition delay compared to the fully premixed injector; this also led to a NO<sub>x</sub> benefit. Overall, the results show that a thermally driven delay in the axial stage provides a greater NO<sub>x</sub> reduction than a mixing delay.","Elsevier","","Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Cincinnati, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2021-08-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 235; Journal Issue: January 2022","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 111710","","","FE0031227","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180","10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111710","","2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","1844552","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1844552","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1844552","Combustion and Flame","January 2022","235"

It is shown that up to a certain doping level, titania doping enhances the densification behaviour of ytterbia. The effect of titania doping on crystal structure confirms that titania is substitutionally incorporated in ytterbia up to the solubility limit, which corresponds well with the densification results. The increased densification rate of titania-doped ytterbia is attributed to the formation of cation vacancy and lattice distortion. Using constant heating rate experiments, the activation energy for densification has been calculated and it is shown that in the intermediate density range (60% to 85%), the activation energy is independent of the density. Furthermore, titania doping increases the activation energy for densification.","Elsevier","","Clemson Univ., SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-08-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the European Ceramic Society; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 15","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 7828-7834","","","FE0031281","Journal ID: ISSN 0955-2219","10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2021.08.022","","2022-08-16T00:00:00Z","1837653","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1837653","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1837653","Journal of the European Ceramic Society","15","41"

Experiments were conducted in an axially staged combustor, which implements a reacting jet in crossflow (RJIC) configuration and operates over a pressure range of 1–5 atmospheres. Simultaneous CH* chemiluminescence and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are used to study the flow field and flame behavior. The results show that the reacting jet trajectory exhibits greater penetration with elevated pressure, which is a novel finding compared to available data in the literature. However, the flame liftoff point and ignition delay time both decreased with elevated pressure, which was attributed to decreased vorticity along the flame boundary which corresponds to increased Damköhler numbers (Da). Emissions measurements confirm the NOx increase with pressure as reported in the literature for single-stage gas turbine combustors. Concurrently, emission measurements for the staged configuration show the strong NOx benefit of the RJIC system: the data prove a reduction of global outlet emission levels at elevated pressure with the axially staged configuration. Here, the axial emission reduction was attributed to the decreasing liftoff at elevated pressure levels. Hence, the research emphasizes that the flame and emission characteristics are coupled; they are not only dependent on the geometric parameters and momentum flux ratios but are also a function of pressure.","ASME","","Embry-Riddle Aeronautical Univ., Daytona Beach, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 5; Conference: AIAA SciTech Forum, Orlando, FL (United States), 6-10 Jan 2020","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 052301","","","FE0031227","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738","10.1115/1.4051741","","2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","1844553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1844553","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1844553","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","5","144"

To avoid these emissions, precombustion and postcombustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture alongside oxy-fuel combustion were considered in the literature. However, because of additional energy requirements, these options generally induce an approximately 7–10% decrease in net heat-to-power efficiencies regarding regular NG-air-fired stations without CO<sub>2</sub> capture. To compensate for this declination, in this study, a simultaneous generation of power and syngas (CO and H<sub>2</sub>) was proposed in an integrated NG-oxygen-fired gas turbine unit (GTU). Hence, the combustion chamber in the NG-oxygen-fired gas turbine cycle was replaced by an NG partial oxidation reactor, which converts it into syngas. The syngas was separated from the working fluid of the cycle by the condensation of water vapor (steam), and a part of it was withdrawn from the GTU to be utilized as a chemical feedstock. A benchmark thermodynamic analysis at the same input–output conditions and requirements for carbon capture was conducted to compare the proposed unit with NG-air and NG-oxygen-fired power plants. The integration effect was shown by increasing the heat-to-power efficiency from 48 to 54%. With carbon monoxide (CO) as an intermediate, the author proposed capturing carbon in NG (methane) in liquid formic acid, which is a good commodity for transportation to a place where it can be reconverted into CO or H<sub>2</sub> to manufacture various industrial chemicals. Simple economic considerations show that because of a substantially higher cost of formic acid than an equivalent power, CO conversion into formic acid substantiates the integrated approach as economically attractive.","American Chemical Society","","Southern Research, Birmingham, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM); USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Omega Journal Volume: 6 Journal Issue: 25","","Medium: X; Size: p. 16336-16342","","","FE0031531","Journal ID: ISSN 2470-1343","10.1021/acsomega.1c00743","","2023-04-27T00:00:00Z","1788295","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1788295","","ACS Omega","25","6"

The investigated designs which differ in the configuration of the secondary flow ports, exhibit bubbling and turbulent fluidization regimes within similar spatial regions. The most substantial differences in the hydrodynamics was in the turbulent fluidized regions near the secondary inlets. The mechanical stressing environments undergone by the particles were analyzed using the collision energy spectra, reconstructed using the local flow field properties (i.e. granular temperature and particle number density). The spectra show that the increase in the specific collision power is associated with the regions near the secondary injector ports, which are in a turbulent fluidization regime. A simple analysis relying upon a partitioning of the energy spectrum, showed that attrition rate may be reduced by about 34% over the original design.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2021-06-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Powder Technology; Journal Volume: 391; Journal Issue: NA","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 142-156","","","89243318CFE000003","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5910","10.1016/j.powtec.2021.06.010","","2022-06-09T00:00:00Z","1842287","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1842287","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1842287","Powder Technology","NA","391"

While there is evidence that premixing between the main burner products and secondary stream reduces NO<sub>x</sub>, it is important to characterize the specific requirements needed to achieve low emissions at gas turbine conditions. This study examines the sensitivity of NO<sub>x</sub> to finite-rate, large-scale entrainment of the main and secondary streams under the simplifying assumption of infinitely-fast small-scale mixing. Essentially, this allows us to isolate the effects of limited large-scale entrainment rates by using a homogeneous/uniform condition for the entrained and reacting gases. We use a reduced-order reactor network model to examine a generic staged-combustor whose inputs are physical time scales that embody the finite-rate entrainment characteristics. With simulations conducted over a large parameter space at typical operating conditions (25 atm, 650 K air), the results show that, even when small-scale mixing is infinitely fast and the reaction zone is uniform, entrainment significantly affects NO<sub>x</sub> emissions due to its influence on the equivalence ratio — and thus the temperature and time — at which the entrained mixture ignites. Fuel-air staging is shown to be vital to NO<sub>x</sub> reduction in most practical cases where entrainment times exceed roughly 1 ms and the secondary stream finishes entraining before the main burner products. A constrained NO<sub>x</sub> minimization indicates that using the leanest possible main burner and re-routing as much air as possible to the secondary stage is key to low NO<sub>x</sub> with finite-rate entrainment; for example, less than 10 ppm NO<sub>x</sub> can be achieved if the secondary stage contains 20% of the total mass flow.","Elsevier","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-04-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 230","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 111434","","","FE0025344; -FE0025344","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180","10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111434","","2022-09-22T00:00:00Z","1779290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1779290","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1779290","Combustion and Flame","","230"

A key strategy for meeting China’s 2060 carbon neutrality goal and the global 1.5 °C climate goal is to rapidly shift away from unabated coal use. Here we detail how to structure a high-ambition coal phaseout in China while balancing multiple national needs. We evaluate the 1037 currently operating coal plants based on comprehensive technical, economic and environmental criteria and develop a metric for prioritizing plants for early retirement. We find that 18% of plants consistently score poorly across all three criteria and are thus low-hanging fruits for rapid retirement. We develop plant-by-plant phaseout strategies for each province by combining our retirement algorithm with an integrated assessment model. With rapid retirement of the low-hanging fruits, other existing plants can operate with a 20- or 30-year minimum lifetime and gradually reduced utilization to achieve the 1.5 °C or well-below 2 °C climate goals, respectively, with complete phaseout by 2045 and 2055.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Enhancing membrane performance for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from flue gas with ultrahigh MW polyvinylamine","Chen, Kai K.; Han, Yang; Zhang, Zhien; Ho, W. S. Winston","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CO2 capture; Polyvinylamine; Facilitated transport membrane; Piperazine glycinate loading","Membranes for post-combustion CO2 capture are required to have a high CO2 permeance due to the limited driving force. For facilitated transport membranes synthesized with polyvinylamine (PVAm), a defect-free selective layer of <200 nm is usually required to render sufficient permeance with high CO2/N2 selectivity. In order to meet such a demand through the knife-coating process, the coating solution needs to have a high viscosity at a relatively low concentration to minimize its penetration into the substrate. The demand was met by synthesizing PVAm with an ultrahigh molecular weight (MW) via inverse emulsion polymerization (IEP) in this study. Compared to solution polymerization, IEP isolates the reaction in inverse micelles suspended in a continuous organic phase, which allows excellent dissipation of the heat generated by the reaction and reduces gel formation drastically. The polymerization parameters, including monomer concentration, initiator concentration, and reaction temperature, were investigated to obtain the optimal MW of PVAm for membrane performance. As compared to solution polymerization, IEP enhanced the MW of PVAm from 1.2 to 12.7 MDa, which minimized the penetration of the coating solution into the substrate and hence the extra mass transfer resistance. The effect of MW and degree of hydrolysis of PVAm on the membrane transport properties were studied. Furthermore, by employing PVAm with a MW of 12.7 MDa to strengthen the polymer matrix, the loading of piperazine glycinate in the membrane was increased up to 85 wt.%. The resultant membrane achieved a CO2 permeance of 839 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 161 at the typical flue gas temperature of 57°C.","Elsevier","","The Ohio State Univ., Columbus, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2021-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Membrane Science; Journal Volume: 628","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 119215","","","FE0026919; FE0031635; FE0031731","Journal ID: ISSN 0376-7388","10.1016/j.memsci.2021.119215","","2022-03-10T00:00:00Z","1778637","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1778637","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1778637","Journal of Membrane Science","","628"

For absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> into aqueous monoethanolamine under industrial conditions, intercooling via heat exchange packings placed along 10–20% of the column could reduce the column height by ~15%. The height of these columns was close to the minimum theoretical value, calculated by numerically optimizing the temperature profile. Effective intercooling could also be achieved by using the cool, rich solvent as the cooling fluid. This reduces the cooling load and facilitates recovery of waste heat. Heat exchange packings could also be used to redistribute heat within the column, reducing the column height with no net cooling load. However, this approach requires larger heat transfer coefficients than have been experimentally observed.","American Institute of Chemical Engineers","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A detailed chemistry Star-CCM+ computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used with 53 species considered and the result of turbulence-governed finite-rate modeling was validated with in-house experimental data. An optically accessible test section features three side windows, allowing local flow and flame analysis with particle image velocimetry (PIV) and CH* chemiluminescence as well as pressure, temperature, and species exit measurements. The research objective was to predict and verify NO<sub>x</sub> formation of the premixed 12.7 mm axial jet. Three headend temperature levels were investigated along with three premixed jets at lean (φ<sub>Jet</sub> = 0.75), near-stoichiometric (φ<sub>Jet</sub> = 1.07), and rich (φ<sub>Jet</sub> = 1.78) axial fuel line equivalence ratio. Based on the matching exit emission concentration, global emission benefits were investigated by adjustment of the fuel stratification. The perfectly premixed methane/air flames of this study were shown to ignite at the lee-side of the jet. For the elevated headend temperature level T = 1800 K, the flame extended beyond the windward jet trajectory and caused high axial NO production. For industry application, a firing temperature of 1920 K was achieved with a NO<sub>x</sub> optimized fuel split of 25%, combining a lean headend (φ<sub>Headend</sub> = 0.61) with a rich (φ<sub>Jet</sub> = 1.78) jet equivalence ratio.

Simulated exit nitrogen oxide levels were validated with experimental emission data, and a global emission trend for the NO reduction at elevated pressure and constant turbine inlet temperature level was defined. The nitrogen oxide benefit at elevated operating pressure was justified with the significantly smaller flame surface area: the analysis of the simulated spanwise and top-view profiles showed a relatively short receded core flame with nitrogen oxide production in the center at high pressure relative to a longer and larger shear layer flame at atmospheric condition that produced NO toward the inner and outer side of the flame.

This study attempts to expand the data to relatively high pressure and could significantly aid scaling to real gas turbine engine conditions at 20–30 atm. High-speed camera, particle image velocimetry (PIV), CH* chemiluminescence, temperature, and pressure measurements were taken and processed to allow accurate reconstruction of six operating points relative to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under minimal adjustments. Variation of lean main stage (φ = 0.575 and 0.73) and rich jet (φ = 1.1, 4, and 8) equivalence ratio has been investigated for a four mm axial jet. The fully premixed flames were found to be controlled by the crossflow temperature before ignition and the crossflow oxygen content during combustion. Analysis of flame shape and position for the partially premixed operating points describes a lee stabilized as well as a more unsteady windward flame branch. Adjustment of added jet fuel and crossflow temperature along with its corresponding oxygen level is required to attain a compact flame body. Here, the risk of delaying combustion progress is significantly increased at a richer jet φ = 8 and an overshooting, spatially divided flame was attained with a main stage φ = 0.73.

The facility consists of a dump style headend burner that provides a crossflow with a quasi-uniform velocity and temperature profile to the axial stage to isolate the effects of the jet-in-crossflow. The headend burner is run with methane and air at a lean equivalence ratio to match industry emission standards. For this work, the total air to the headend and axial stage is kept constant, and fuel is split between the headend and axial stage to represent different gas turbine loading conditions. For the cases analyzed, the fuel split to the axial stage went up to 25%. The axial stage consists of an optically accessible test section with a coaxial injector that provides variability to how long the methane and air can mix before entering the facility. Three different premixed levels are studied: fully premixed, nonpremixed, and partially premixed.

The leak occurrences are currently escalating since the existing plants must satisfy faster-ramping rates to support grid operation.

The combined approach was shown to be highly effective in the fault investigation that would not have been easily achieved by an individual technique. The variability in both training and validation datasets was first evaluated using PCA. Then, the CV-FDA was employed to discriminate among faults, and to categorize the processed data into two main groups: no-leak (0) and leak (1), providing the timeframe and location of the leak occurrence. Furthermore, about 8,014 observations from 81 process variables were initially included in the calculation, while the variable count was reduced to 4 with less than 1% misclassification rate in total observations. Finally, the leak was isolated in the waterwall section. Thus, the outcome of this research may provide early detection and isolation of faulty operations in the coal-fired power plant that involves a considerable number of process variables.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-12-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy; Journal Volume: 220; Journal Issue: NA","","Medium: ED","","RSS318","89243318CFE000003","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-5442","10.1016/j.energy.2020.119667","","2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","1843179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843179","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1843179","Energy","NA","220"

In this study, by employing computational techniques including density functional theory calculations and molecular simulations, the role of mobile carriers has been systematically studied at a molecular level from the perspectives of the amine–CO2 reaction chemistry, diffusivities of carriers and gases, and N2 solubility. The latter two properties were also investigated as a function of water uptake. The water uptake values of FTMs were experimentally quantified too. The introduction of mobile carriers was shown to substantially enhance the diffusivities of CO2 reaction products compared to FTMs without mobile carriers. The choice of mobile carriers was also demonstrated to influence the separation performance. Computationally, 2-(1-piperazinyl)ethylamine sarcosinate (PZEA-Sar) exhibited a faster reaction kinetics and slightly higher CO2 absorption capacity as compared to piperazine glycinate (PZ-Gly). Experimentally, the FTM incorporating PZEA-Sar mobile carriers also showed a higher CO2 permeance. The good agreement validated the computational models employed and insights generated in this study.

Here, the thrust produced by the combustor was measured to characterize its work output potential. High-frequency pressure transducers and broadband chemiluminescence measurements of the flame provided information about the wave structure and dynamics. Analysis of common performance metrics demonstrated the necessity of normalizing any RDE performance parameter by the driving system potential, typically the reactant manifold pressure. Application of a thermodynamic performance model to a generic RDE identified the area ratio between the RDE exhaust and injection throats as the primary parameter affecting delivered pressure gain. The model was further applied to draw comparison with experimental measurements of net pressure gain for identical flow conditions. Only one of the two tested injector configurations followed the predicted trends, suggesting that performance of the second was governed by physical processes other than the reactant thermodynamics. Although an absolute pressure gain was not demonstrated, it is promising that the natural gas–air RDE delivered up to 90% of the theoretical performance.","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Oil & Natural Gas","","United States","2020-10-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online); Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 292-304","","","FE0025343","Journal ID: ISSN 1533-3876","10.2514/1.b38087","","2021-10-18T00:00:00Z","1774972","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1774972","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774972","Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online)","2","37"

Cycling causes transients of properties such as pressure and temperature within various components of the steam generation system.These transients cause increased damage because of fatigue and creep-fatigue interactions shortening the life of components. An algorithm is developed to identify cycling operations from the gross power data. The data-driven model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) is developed using 10 years data from Coal Creek Station power plant located in North Dakota, USA to estimate properties of the steam generator components during cycling operations. Furthermore, the uniqueness of this model is the ability to predict component properties for the cycling as well as base-load operations and is reported for the first time. The ANN model estimates the component properties, for a given gross power profile and initial conditions, as they vary during cycling operations. As a representative example, the ANN estimates are presented for the superheater outlet pressure, reheater inlet temperature, and flue gas temperature at the air heater inlet.

These columnar grains evolve from the partly molten grains in the substrate or the solidified metal. This work proposes an efficient model to simulate the competitive growth of epitaxial columnar dendritic grains. The proposed model tracks the dynamic changes in the dendrites emanating from discrete points along the solid/liquid interface of a quasi-steady melt pool (MP). These dynamic changes include convergence and divergence of growing dendrites. The model is extended to predict the microstructure of large 3D parts and experimentally validated by comparing the simulation results for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) processes. The microstructure and pole figures are predicted for Inconel 718 samples produced by L-PBF and Inconel 740H samples produced by WAAM processes. Finally, the model predictions compare well with the observed microstructure and pole figures results for both the L-PBF and WAAM processes.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2020-09-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Additive Manufacturing; Journal Volume: 36","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 101611","","","FE0031637","Journal ID: ISSN 2214-8604","10.1016/j.addma.2020.101611","","2022-02-03T00:00:00Z","1842652","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1842652","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1842652","Additive Manufacturing","","36"

However, achieving such rapid reductions may depend on early retirement of coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. Here, we analyze future fossil fuel electricity demand in 171 energy-emissions scenarios from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), evaluating the implicit retirements and/or reduced operation of generating infrastructure. Although IAMs calculate retirements endogenously, the structure and methods of each model differ; we use a standard approach to infer retirements in outputs from all six major IAMs and—unlike the IAMs themselves—we begin with the age distribution and region-specific operating capacities of the existing power fleet. We find that coal-fired power plants in scenarios consistent with international climate targets (i.e. keeping global warming well-below 2 °C or 1.5 °C) retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case. If plants are built to meet projected fossil electricity demand and instead allowed to operate at the level and over the lifetimes they have historically, the roughly 200 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> of additional emissions this century would be incompatible with keeping global warming well-below 2 °C. Thus, ambitious climate mitigation scenarios entail drastic, and perhaps un-appreciated, changes in the operating and/or retirement schedules of power infrastructure.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In such cases, heat rejection occurs in a shell and tube heat exchanger by film-wise condensation of low-pressure steam on stainless steel, titanium, brass, or copper-nickel tubing. To improve the thermal performance of steam surface condensers, a replenishable film-forming substance (FFS) can be ap-plied to the condenser tubing to promote efficient dropwise condensation. Conventionally, film-forming amine prod-uct (FFAP) coatings protect boiler surfaces from oxidative corrosion, which substantially reduces the operation and maintenance costs. To quantify the technical and economic benefits of FFAP coatings applied to condenser tubing due to the promotion of dropwise condensation, a thermal resistance network model was established. Using a rep-resentative steam surface condenser, the improvements in thermal performance (overall heat transfer coefficient) and process parameters (net plant efficiency, cooling water flowrate, and turbine backpressure) were determined due to the enhancement in the condensation heat transfer coefficient. Experimentally measured condensation heat transfer coefficients for common condenser materials were compared with the modeling results and were found to be within attainable bounds. Lastly, the trend in total heat exchanger cost reduction is generalized to understand the trade-off between reduced surface area for heat rejection and increase in coating application costs for a re-plenishable coating system.","","","Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc., Lancaster, PA (United States)","USDOE","Advanced Cooling Technologies","United States","2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PPCHEM Journal; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: 4-16","","","FE0031657","","","","2023-01-13T00:00:00Z","1772345","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1772345","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1772345","PPCHEM Journal","1","23"

In a stoichiometric C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> mixture, plasma decay was also studied in a repetitively pulsed discharge for varing numbers of discharge pulses (varying degrees of fuel oxidation). The rate of plasma decay was determined from the temporal evolution of electron density measured using the microwave interferometer. It was observed that gas heating to 600 K leads to a decrease in the rate of plasma decay in all cases. The effect of heating on plasma decay was most profound in the H<sub>2</sub>O:N<sub>2</sub> mixture (after a single discharge pulse) and in the C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> mixture for high degrees of fuel oxidation. A kinetic scheme was developed to numerically simulate the plasma decay in hydrocarbons and combustible mixtures. Numerical analysis showed that, under the conditions studied, plasma decay was controlled by dissociative electron recombination with simple molecular and cluster ions. Gas heating led to a decrease in the rate of the electron-ion recombination and the rate of conversion of molecular ions to cluster ions. As a result, the gas temperature increase caused a decrease in the fraction of cluster ions for which the recombination coefficients are an order of magnitude higher than the recombination coefficients for molecular ions. The influence of gas heating on the decrease of the amount of cluster ions was more important when the ion composition was dominated by hydrated H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>k</sub> ions. The rates of the formation of these ions are extremely sensitive to any variations in gas temperature. A result, in agreement with our observations, gas heating led to an anomalous decrease in the rates of plasma decay in the H<sub>2</sub>O:N<sub>2</sub> mixture, as well as in the C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> mixture when H<sub>2</sub>O molecules were produced due to fuel oxidation.","Elsevier","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-06-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 219; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 393-404","","","FE0026825","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; PII: S0010218020302364","10.1016/j.combustflame.2020.06.018","","2022-05-13T00:00:00Z","1799861","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799861","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799861","Combustion and Flame","C","219"

Detonation dynamics were studied to characterize the operability of rotating detonation-based pressure gain combustion systems for this application. Measurements of chamber wave dynamics were performed using high-frequency pressure transducers and high-speed imaging of broadband combustion chemiluminescence. The rotating detonation engine was tested with two injector configurations across a broad range of mass flux (200–500 kg/m<sup>2</sup>/s), equivalence ratio (0.85–1.2), and oxygen mass fraction (23.2–35%) conditions to determine the effect of operating parameters on the propagation of detonation waves in the combustor. Wave propagation speeds of up to 70% of the mixture Chapman–Jouguet detonation velocity and chamber pressure fluctuations greater than 4 times the mean chamber pressure were observed. Supplementing the air with additional oxygen, varying the equivalence ratio, and enriching the fuel with hydrogen revealed that combustor operability is sensitive to the chemical kinetics of the propellant mixture. Comparing the operational trends of the two injector configurations suggests that one design mixes the incoming propellants more effectively. Although most test conditions exhibited counter-rotating detonation waves within the chamber, the injector design with superior mixing characteristics was able to support single-wave propagation.","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)","","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE), Oil & Natural Gas","","United States","2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online); Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 453-464","","","FE0025343","Journal ID: ISSN 1533-3876","10.2514/1.b37735","","2022-09-22T00:00:00Z","1774971","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1774971","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1774971","Journal of Propulsion and Power (Online)","3","36"

Two microbe immobilization systems (PEGDA) microbe beads and Si sol-gels) were examined for their efficiency in immobilizing Arthrobacter nicotianae to selectively recover REEs. Techno-economic analysis revealed that North Dakota lignite could be a profitable feedstock when Si sol-gel is used due to its high cell loading and REE adsorption capacity. Life cycle analysis revealed that Si sol-gel based biosorption could be more environmental friendly than the prevailing REE production in China due to use of less toxic chemicals. However, fly ash sourced from Powder River Basin coals was neither profitable or environmentally sustainable, primarily due to low solublity of high-value scandium at an economical pulp density (100 ash/L).

The objective of the present study is to perform a parametric analysis, investigating the effect of different recirculation ratios at different pressures on the efficiencies of the cycle named for the company, ENEL, and the thermo energy power system, TIPS, cycles using aspen plus® software. Variables include the flue gas recycle flow rate, the combustor temperature, and the operational pressure. Five recirculation ratios were investigated, ranging from 20% to 75%. It was determined that as the amount of recycled gas into the combustor increased, the thermal efficiency increased for both the TIPS and ENEL cycles. Here, the highest thermal efficiency for TIPS is 37% and for ENEL is 38%, both occurring at a 75% recirculation ratio. After investigation, since combustion temperature and specific heat capacity decreases at higher recirculation ratios, the mass flow rate was the dominant factor that contributes to the increase in thermal efficiency of the cycle. At each recirculation ratio, the effect of pressure is also determined. For ENEL, the increase in cycle efficiency is 10% over the pressure range of 1–12 bar at a recirculation ratio of 20%, while the increase in cycle efficiency is only 1.5% at a higher recirculation ratio of 75%. For TIPS, the cycle efficiency increases by 4% at the recirculation ratio of 20% and increases by 3% at the recirculation ratio of 75% for a pressure range of 50–80 bar.","ASME","","Univ. of Texas at El Paso, TX (United States); University of Texas, El Paso, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 062601","","","FE0029113","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-0738","10.1115/1.4045539","","2023-04-12T00:00:00Z","1867412","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1867412","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1867412","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","6","142"

A rigorous vapor–liquid equilibrium model is developed for the Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>–CO<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>O system, where liquid-phase nonideality is modeled by the electrolyte nonrandom two-liquid model. The data from the experiments conducted at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is used to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the initial solvent concentration inside the capsules and the parameters for the capsule model. A nonisothermal, dynamic model of a fixed bed contactor filled with these capsules is then developed. In addition to direct steam injection, indirect heating using an embedded heat exchanger is modeled for desorption. Finally, the model is used to simulate temperature swing absorption and desorption cycles. The results of these studies indicate that there is an optimal residence time or superficial flue gas velocity to minimize the bed volume. However, the total energy requirement for desorption monotonically decreases with increased residence time as the proportion of the sensible heat to the total regeneration heat keeps decreasing. Furthermore, heat recovery from the bed is crucial to keep energy penalty for regeneration low. A techno-economic analysis is conducted, and the equivalent annual operating cost (EAOC) is analyzed for two different reactor materials (concrete and carbon-steel) and compared with a system using a conventional monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent. In this work, the minimum EAOC for the MECS fixed bed configuration is approximately 1.8–2.7 times higher than the EAOC for an MEA system with a similar amount of heat recovery (85%). The impact of ±50% uncertainty in the capital cost estimate is also evaluated, and the minimum EAOC is 1.5 times higher than the MEA technology for 85% heat recovery. These results using microencapsulated sodium carbonate solution are a starting point that sets an upper limit on the cost of the MECS carbon-capture system. Improvements to the MECS capsules (e.g., using a higher carbonate concentration and lowering the shell mass transfer resistance) and also exploring other contactor technologies are expected to decrease the system cost and make it more competitive.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Thermodynamic and transport properties are obtained through a table look-up procedure with specialized features for subcritical conditions. Phase change is triggered by the difference between the local values of pressure and saturation pressure, and both vaporization and condensation can be modeled. Rigorous validation of the framework is presented for condensation in high pressure CO<sub>2</sub> using test data in a De Laval nozzle. The comparisons between computations and test data include: condensation onset locations, Wilson line, and nozzle pressure profiles as a function of inlet pressures. The framework is applied to the Sandia compressor that has been modeled over broad range of conditions spanning the saturation dome including: near critical inlet conditions (305.4 K, and 7.843 MPa), pure liquid inlet conditions (at 295 K), pure vapor inlet conditions (at 302 K), and two-phase inlet conditions (at 290 K). Multiphase effects ranging from cavitation at the liquid line to condensation at the vapor line have been simulated. Here, the role of real fluid effects in enhancing multiphase effects at elevated temperatures closer to the critical point has been identified. The performance of the compressor has been compared with test data; the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results also show that the head-flow coefficient curve collapses with relatively minor scatter, similar to the test data, when the flow coefficient is defined on the impeller exit meridional velocity.","ASME","","Combustion Research and Flow Technology Inc., Huntsville, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

However, compared to ECT, the high correlation between the measurements in ECVT exacerbates the ill-conditioning of the associated image reconstruction problem. Previous studies have suggested that neglecting mutual capacitance data between the ECVT electrodes located at cross-planes that are well separated along the sensor axis can be done without significantly affecting the reconstructed image.

Oxy-coal combustion has been extensively investigated at ambient pressure, but limited experimental data is available regarding this combustion method at elevated pressures at pilot or full scale. The study presented here investigates the operational performance of a high pressure, high temperature pilot-scale oxy-fuel combustor. Pulverized Utah bituminous coal in form of coal-water slurry was combusted at pressures up to 14 bar, temperatures up to 1600 °C and firing rates up to 300 kW. Eight different runs were selected for presentation and the measurements include flue gas composition (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>), carbon and sulfur content of fly ash, combustor temperature profile and flame radiation profile. The flame radiation measurements were carried out with a novel narrow beam radiometer which measures local radiant heat flux at a specific location in the combustor. The radiation ranged from 108 to 279 kW/m<sup>2</sup> depending mainly on combustor temperature. Additionally, the temperature significantly impacted the carbon content of fly ash: 2.66% was measured near 1600 °C, while the concentration increased to 36.7% when the temperature was decreased to 1300°C. Furthermore, the successful experimental demonstrations showed that increasing pressure is a viable combustion method and a step towards enhancing the efficiency in oxy-fuel firing based power plants.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 252; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 113450","","","FE0025168","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113450","","2020-08-21T00:00:00Z","1644034","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1644034","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1644034","Applied Energy","C","252"

The methodology is a simple, yet comprehensive, integration of environmental and economic carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) performance. Understanding the interplay between the environmental and economic conditions allows the EOR operator to manage the CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR flood so it remains within the limits of carbon balance neutrality and favorable economics under given prices and costs. The environmental performance and the main operational inputs (fluid production, CO<sub>2</sub> injection, and purchase requirements) were taken from a dynamic carbon Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study previously performed for a CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR site in Cranfield, Mississippi. The LCA study accounts for greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions within a gate-to-grave CCUS system boundary, considering four different CO<sub>2</sub> injection strategies and four gas separation processes. The economic performance assessment was made through a marginalist analysis (Marginalist Production Theory), which determines important technical and economic relations through basic differential calculus derived from production, cost, and income functions. This method allows to define the operational economic optimum (optimum profit). The assessment considers four CO<sub>2</sub> price scenarios and uses World Bank estimated oil prices. In a first step of the proposed methodology, environmental limits of the operation are estimated. These limits are then compared with operative maximum productivity as well as with the economic optimum. According to the methodology, the EOR operation is sustainable as long as the environmental optimum is greater, or lasts longer, than the economic optimum along the project’s life. Results show that for this operation and assumed parameters, CO<sub>2</sub>-EOR could be classified as a sustainable activity depending on the operator’s strategic decision-making. In the case study, all injection strategies reach the environmental optimum after maximum productivity is reached. As a result, only two strategies (continuous gas injection and water alternating gas) find their economic optimum within the environmental limits, fulfilling the defined necessary and sufficient condition for CCUS sustainability.","Elsevier","","The Univ. of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX (United States).

Before scaling up MECS for pilot testing, modeling is needed to design a MECS absorber and quantify its size and energy penalty. To that end, a multi-scale model for MECS- that ranges from a single capsule to a 500 MWe power plant absorber- is developed and presented here in this paper. First, the individual capsule model is developed and fitted to experimental CO<sub>2</sub> absorption data collected on a 0.1 g sample of capsules filled with sodium carbonate solution. This capsule model is then validated against data collected on a 25 g batch of capsules exposed to flue gas conditions in a fluidized column. This model is then scaled up to represent two absorber designs: a multi-stage, counter-flow fluidized bed and a hollow, cylindrical packed bed with radial gas flow. These two absorber bed models are first optimized for a 1 MWe pilot-scale absorber, and then optimized for a 500 MWe coal plant. This model predicts absorbers of similar dimensions and smaller energy penalties than previously modeled absorbers filled with amine solvent capsules. Furthermore, it is demonstrated here that a few reasonable improvements to capsule design would result in absorber sizes and energy penalties lower than those of a benchmark amine solvent tower. These results demonstrate that micro-encapsulated carbonate solution can compete with faster-acting amine solvents for post-combustion carbon capture.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The combustor geometry consists of a mixing duct followed by a sudden expansion and a combustion chamber, which represents a geometrically simplified version of Ansaldo Energia’s GT26/GT36 sequential combustor design. In this configuration, a very lean blend of hydrogen and vitiated air is prepared in the mixing duct and convected into the combustion chamber, where the residence time from the inlet of the mixing duct to the combustion chamber is designed to coincide with the ignition delay time of the mixture. The results show that when the flame is stabilized at its design position, combustion occurs due to both autoignition and flame propagation (deflagration) modes at different locations within the combustion chamber. A chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) reveals that most of the fuel is consumed due to autoignition in the bulk-flow along the centerline of the combustor, and lower amounts of fuel are consumed by flame propagation near the corners of the sudden expansion, where the unburnt temperature is reduced by the thermal wall boundary layers. An unstable operating condition is also identified, wherein periodic auto-ignition events occur within the mixing duct. These events appear upstream of the intended stabilization position, due to positive temperature fluctuations induced by pressure waves originating from within the combustion chamber. This DNS investigation represents the initial step of a comprehensive research effort aimed at gaining detailed physical insight into the rate-limiting processes that govern the sequential combustor behavior and avoid the insurgence of the off-design auto-ignition events.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"The effect of variable fuel staging transients on self-excited instabilities in a multiple-nozzle combustor","Culler, Wyatt; Chen, Xiaoling; Samarasinghe, Janith; Peluso, Stephen; Santavicca, Domenic; O'Connor, Jacqueline","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Flame interaction; Transients; Fuel staging; Combustion instability; Gas turbines","Combustion instability in gas turbine engines is often mitigated using fuel staging. Fuel staging, sometimes referred to as fuel splitting, is a strategy by which fuel is unevenly distributed between different nozzles of a multiple-nozzle combustor. These fuel splits are conducted in a transient manner in real engines, and the effects of these transients on instability are not well characterized. This work fills this gap by systematically studying the effects of transient fuel staging on self-excited combustion instability by varying the amount of staging fuel (staging amplitude), timescale in which the fuel is added (transient duration), and whether staging fuel is added or subtracted (transient direction). In this work, three staging amplitudes, five transient durations, and both transient directions are considered. The transient timescales are broadly divided into “short” duration transients, which have fuel delivery timescales shorter than the characteristic instability decay or onset timescales, and “long” duration transients, which have fuel delivery timescales longer than the characteristic instability decay or onset timescales. For short duration transients, we find the instability decay timescale depends on staging amplitude but does not depend on transient duration. For long duration transients, we find the instability decay timescale does not strongly depend on staging amplitude. The instability onset timescale is found to be longer and more variable between runs than the instability decay timescale for a given fuel delivery timescale. The onset timescale is also longer in duration and more variable than the decay timescale at a given fuel delivery timescale, implying that the instability rise process is overall more variable and slower than the instability decay process. Analysis of combustor damping rates show a strong dependence of damping rate on staging amplitude but no strong dependence on transient duration or direction. Instantaneous phase difference images between p' and are used to differentiate regions in the combustor that have constructive versus destructive interference between heat release rate oscillations and pressure fluctuations. Furthermore, the phase images show that p' and q<sup>.</sup>' become in-phase early in the transient for the onset transients.","Elsevier","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 194; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 472-484","","","FE0025495","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2180; PII: S0010218018301834","10.1016/j.combustflame.2018.04.025","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1462982","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1462982","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1462982","Combustion and Flame","C","194"

These cooling concepts are based on a review of literature and patents, as well as, interactions with academic and industry turbine cooling experts. The cooling configuration selected and described in this paper is referred to as the “baseline” design, since this design will simultaneously be tested with other more advanced blade cooling designs in a rotating turbine test facility using a “rainbow turbine wheel” configuration. For the baseline design, the leading edge is cooled by internal jet impingement and showerhead film cooling. The midchord region of the blade contains a three-pass serpentine passage with internal discrete V-shaped trip strips to enhance the internal heat transfer coefficient (HTC).

This advanced reactor concept uses configurable zirconium hydride moderator rod assemblies to shift the neutron spectrum in the core from intermediate at beginning of life to thermal at end of life. With a harder spectrum during the early years of reactor operation, this spectral shift design drives captures in fertile <sup>238</sup>U. The converted fissile plutonium makes up over 50% of the fissile material in the fuel salt over the last half (~15 years) of reactor operation. A softer spectrum late in reactor life helps drive the fuel to a burnup of 90 GWd/MTU. Continuously changing physics necessitates time-dependent analyses resolved over long timescales (i.e., months to years), as this concept does not meet an equilibrium condition. The spectral shift and molten salt reactor material feeds and removals enable this concept to perform better in fuel cycle metrics, increasing resource utilization by more than 50% compared with a typical light water reactor (i.e., from ~0.6% to ~1%). Finally, these metrics are compared to similar fuel cycles using alternate technologies. Additional core design and analysis challenges associated with the spectral shift and use of molten salt reactor technology are identified and discussed.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Applying image processing methods to study hydrodynamic characteristics in a rectangular spouted bed","Yang, Jingsi; Breault, Ronald W.; Rowan, Steven L.","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Image analysis; bed expansion ratio; jet height; fountain height; rectangular spouted bed","This paper presents systematic image processing methods for investigating hydrodynamic characteristics in a rectangular spouted bed (30.2 mm × 101.6 mm). The objective is to provide a non-intrusive technique to determine the bed expansion ratio, the jet height and the fountain height due to their significant influence on the hydrodynamics of the entire bed. A high-speed video camera is used in the experiment with Geldart D particles as the bed material. After the image acquisition, image denoising, thresholding, logical and mask operations are applied correspondingly for the boundary discrimination, based on which an algorithm has been developed to determine the bed height successfully. With the discriminated boundary, morphological operations viz. erosion and dilation have been used to accurately determine the jet height and the fountain height. The feasibility of the technique is proven through profiles of bed expansion ratio, jet height and fountain height under three initial bed heights (0.0762 m, 0.102 m, and 0.127 m) for two different nozzle sizes (0.0096 m and 0.0127 m). Depending on the determination of the hydrodynamic characteristics, different flow regimes can be distinguished comprehensively through profiles of the bed expansion ratio and bed pressure drop in combination with the standard deviation of jet/fountain height. The proposed flow regime discrimination verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the image processing methods in assessing the solids behavior in the spouted beds. Results about the variation of the jet height and the fountain height under current operating conditions as determined by the new technique are also discussed.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chemical Engineering Science; Journal Volume: 188; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 238-251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0009-2509; PII: S0009250918303543","10.1016/j.ces.2018.05.057","","2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","1477165","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1477165","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1477165","Chemical Engineering Science","C","188"

Before starting a development project in Bangladesh, both government organizations (GOs) and non-government organizations (NGOs) need to conduct an EIA. However, in most of the governmental projects, there is still no significant influence of public participation in EIA. Contrarily, under NGO administered projects, the systematic participation in EIA is quite unknown and often goes without being acknowledged. This paper, thus, studies public participation practice in EIA through an investigation of two NGO governed projects (i.e., BRAC's fisheries and sericulture project and CARE's integrated food for work program) and compares with two projects by GOs (i.e., Rampal coal-based thermal power plant project and Jamuna multipurpose bridge project) to critically understand the prevailing differences. As well, pivotal factors responsible for differentiated nature and type of public participation being practiced within a certain institutional context are examined. The study indicates that NGOs tend to ensure participation of the pertinent stakeholders at different stages of an EIA while harnessing their inputs to successfully complete a project. By contrast, public participation in government's run projects is mostly found to be carried out towards the end of an EIA exercise, which severely limits the stakeholders' ability to contribute and questions the legitimacy of such attempt. This process of neglect systematically overlooks stakeholders' concerns, critics, and suggestions while pre-emptive motive of the project gets glorified and implemented. By tapping these voids, this study attempts to offer an insightful understanding of the gap between conventional ‘practice’ and formal ‘pledge’ when comes to ensuring public participation in various stages of EIA. This study expects to benefit other countries where NGOs are considerably involved in development projects.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.05.001","","","","United States","2018-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 72; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 12-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925517304195; TRN: US19W4067071151","10.1016/J.EIAR.2018.05.001","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","22826050","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22826050","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","72"

However, chemical looping combustion process optimization is hindered by the lack of online sensors for measurements of OCP oxidation states at temperatures up to 1,000 °C and pressures up to 10 atm. We are investigating Raman spectroscopy as a potential solution, as this technique is known for its ability to provide noninvasive, molecularly specific information in real time in a wide variety of applications. As a case study, Raman spectra from high–temperature (>1,000 °C) anhydrite, a potential OCP, are presented using pulsed and continuous wave excitation at 532 nm. When pulsed excitation is coupled with time–gated detection, background signal from thermal radiation can be significantly reduced from single pulse spectra, outperforming results using an ungated detector. Also, laser heating of the sample is not observed but laser–induced breakdown spectra increasingly appear with increasing temperature and pulse intensity. Compared with pulsed excitation, continuous wave excitation with longer acquisition time, offers higher signal to noise and avoids the risk for laser–induced breakdown spectra but demonstrates minor sample heating. Finally, the data demonstrate practical utility by (a) providing a calibration of anhydrite's ν<sub>1</sub> (1,017 cm<sup>–1</sup>) Raman temperature–dependent band position and by (b) providing estimates of temperature using the ratios of the Stokes/anti–Stokes ν<sub>1</sub> integrated intensities. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the first high–temperature, pulsed Raman spectra from anhydrite while evaluating challenges associated with high–temperature, Raman measurements of OCP materials in general.","Wiley","","Washington State Univ., Pullman, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Raman Spectroscopy; Journal Volume: 49; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 862-871","","","FE0027840","Journal ID: ISSN 0377-0486","10.1002/jrs.5356","","2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","1782241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1782241","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1782241","Journal of Raman Spectroscopy","5","49"

To utilize a model to describe the complex and dynamic changes taking place during these two treatments for process design, optimization and scale-up, detailed data is needed on the property evolution during treatment of well-defined individual biomass particles. The objectives of this study are to investigate the influence of thermal pretreatment temperatures on wood biomass biochemical compositions, physical properties and microstructure. Wild cherry wood was selected as a model biomass and prepared for this study. The well-defined wood particle samples were consecutively heated at 220, 260, 300, 350, 450 and 550 °C for 0.5 h under nitrogen. Untreated and treated samples were characterized for biochemical composition changes (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) by thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), physical properties (color, dimensions, weight, density and grindablity), chemical property (proximate analysis and heating value) and microstructural changes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hemicellulose was mostly decomposed in the samples treated at 260 and 300 °C and resulted in the cell walls weakening resulting in improved grindability. The dimensions of the wood were reduced in all directions and shrinkage increased with increased treatment temperature and weight loss. With increased treatment temperature, losses of weight and volume increased and bulk density decreased. The low temperature pyrolyzed wood samples improved solid fuel property with high fuel ratio, which are close to lignite/bituminous coal. Morphology of the wood remained intact through the treatment range but the cell walls were thinner. Lastly, these results will improve the understanding of the property changes of the biomass during pretreatment and will help to develop models for process simulation and potential application of the treated biomass.","MDPI AG","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel); Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 25","","NETL-PUB-21616","","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en11010025","10.3390/en11010025","","2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","1419428","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1419428","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1419428","Energies (Basel)","1","11"

A protective Cr-rich oxide layer formed after only 5 min at 700 °C and persisted for longer exposures up to 500 h. Voids formed and grew over time by the condensation of metal vacancies generated during oxidation, while the alloy surface recrystallized after sufficient oxidation had occurred. The oxygen potential established at the oxide/alloy interface led to oxidation along the newly formed grain boundaries as well as adjacent to and inside of the voids. Al, the most stable oxide-former and present at low concentration in the alloy, was preferentially oxidized in these regions. Furthermore, the results provide an improved understanding of the internal oxidation of Al and its role in enhancing scale adhesion for this class of Ni alloys.","Springer","","National Energy Technology Lab.

In this study, austenitic stainless steel 347H (UNS S34709) was exposed to sCO2 containing H2O and O2 at 8 MPa and 50 °C or 250 °C, and separately to the aqueous phase in equilibrium with the sCO2 at 50 °C, to simulate conditions expected in sCO2 based power cycles and carbon capture and storage pipelines.

"Tightening polybenzimidazole (PBI) nanostructure <i>via</i> chemical cross-linking for membrane H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> separation","Zhu, Lingxiang; Swihart, Mark T.; Lin, Haiqing","08 HYDROGEN; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS","Membranes that permeate H<sub>2</sub> and reject CO<sub>2</sub> at temperatures above 150 °C are of great interest for low-cost H<sub>2</sub> purification and pre-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> capture. One of the leading polymers for this separation is poly[2,2'-(<i>m</i>-phenylene)-5,5'-bisbenzimidazole] (PBI), which has good thermal stability and high H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity can be significantly enhanced by chemical cross-linking of PBI in solid state, in distinct contrast with the literature where cross-linking PBI in solutions decreased H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity. We prepared a series of cross-linked PBIs by immersing PBI thin films in terephthaloyl chloride solutions for varying times to achieve different degrees of cross-linking, and then systematically investigated the effect of cross-linking on physical properties including gel content, thermal stability, cross-linking density, fractional free volume (FFV) and inter-chain spacing. Gas sorption and pure- and mixed-gas permeation properties were determined at temperatures ranging from 35 to 200 °C. Cross-linking decreased CO<sub>2</sub> sorption and significantly increased H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity with a slight decrease in H<sub>2</sub> permeability. For example, after cross-linking of PBI, the H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity increased from 15 to 23 while the H<sub>2</sub> permeability decreased from 45 to 39 Barrers at 200 °C. As a result, the performance of this cross-linked PBI surpasses the Robeson's upper bound estimated at 200 °C, indicating its promise for H<sub>2</sub> purification and CO<sub>2</sub> capture.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. at Buffalo, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2017-09-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Chemistry.

"The effect of fuel staging on the structure and instability characteristics of swirl-stabilized flames in a lean premixed multi-nozzle can combustor","Samarasinghe, Janith; Culler, Wyatt; Quay, Bryan D.; Santavicca, Domenic A.; O'Connor, Jacqueline","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Pressure; Fuels; Combustion chambers; Flames; Heat; Nozzles; Combustion; Combustors; Experimental; Flame; Swirling; Temperature; Thermoacoustics","Fuel staging is a commonly used strategy in the operation of gas turbine engines. In multinozzle combustor configurations, this is achieved by varying fuel flow rate to different nozzles. The effect of fuel staging on flame structure and self-excited instabilities is investigated in a research can combustor employing five swirl-stabilized, lean-premixed nozzles. At an operating condition where all nozzles are fueled equally and the combustor undergoes a self-excited instability, fuel staging successfully suppresses the instability: both when overall equivalence ratio is increased by staging as well as when overall equivalence ratio is kept constant while staging. Increased fuel staging changes the distribution of time-averaged heat release rate in the regions where adjacent flames interact and reduces the amplitudes of heat release rate fluctuations in those regions. Increased fuel staging also causes a breakup in the monotonic phase behavior that is characteristic of convective disturbances that travel along a flame. In particular, heat release rate fluctuations in the middle flame and flame–flame interaction region are out-of-phase with those in the outer flames, resulting in a cancelation of the global heat release rate oscillations. The Rayleigh integral distribution within the combustor shows that during a self-excited instability, the regions of highest heat release rate fluctuation are in phase-with the combustor pressure fluctuation. In conclusion, when staging fuel is introduced, these regions fluctuate out-of-phase with the pressure fluctuation, further illustrating that fuel staging suppresses instabilities through a phase cancelation mechanism.","ASME","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 121504","","","FE0025495","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795","10.1115/1.4037461","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1462983","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1462983","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1462983","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","12","139"

While conventional resistive based metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors suffer from strong cross-sensitivity, optical sensing approaches offer intrinsic advantages to achieve gas selectivity based on wavelength specific interactions. This manuscript describes a novel method to achieve multicomponent gas sensing during gas exposure of H2, CO2, CH4and CO in humid high temperature environments. A single sensor element comprised of a perovskite La0.3Sr0.7TiO3(LSTO) oxide thin film layer coated on silica optical fiber was used. The sensing responses consisted of two wavelength-specific near infrared (NIR) mechanisms, namely broadband absorption associated with the metal oxide layer, and wavelength localized thermal emission responses associated with the hydroxyl defects within the silica fiber. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to couple the two mechanisms to achieve selective gas identification. Successful discrimination of H2and CO2on a single fiber sensor was achieved, where the results are both stable and reversible. This design demonstrates that by coupling multiple optical mechanisms on a single oxide coated fiber sensor, simple platforms can also achieve multi-component sensing functionality without the added complexity of a sensor array. Thus, it suggests a new approach to construct simple, robust and functional sensor designs capable of gas discrimination and quantification in multi-component gas streams.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Therefore, it is of interest to maximize the amount of learning and the efficiency of the test campaign given the limited number of experiments that can be conducted. This work investigates the use of sequential design of experiments (SDOE) to overcome these challenges by demonstrating its usefulness for a recent solvent-based CO2 capture plant test campaign. Unlike traditional design of experiments methods, SDOE regularly uses information from ongoing experiments to determine the optimum locations in the design space for subsequent runs within the same experiment. However, there are challenges that need to be addressed, including reducing the high computational burden to efficiently update the model, and the need to incorporate the methodology into a computational tool. We address these challenges by applying SDOE in combination with a software tool, the Framework for Optimization, Quantification of Uncertainty and Surrogates (FOQUS) (Miller et al., 2014a, 2016, 2017). The results of applying SDOE on a pilot plant test campaign for CO2 capture suggests that relative to traditional design of experiments methods, SDOE can more effectively reduce the uncertainty of the model, thus decreasing technical risk. Future work includes integrating SDOE into FOQUS and using SDOE to support additional large-scale pilot plant test campaigns.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

The method uses packing specific liquid holdup and pressure drop data to find model coefficients that both minimize relative error in the two-phase momentum equations and ensure correct limiting single phase behavior of the model. The approach is demonstrated for three phenomenological drag models from the literature using data from a random Bialecki ring packing under counterflow conditions. Calibration results in a 2-3 fold reduction in the mean relative error for predicted pressure gradient/liquid holdup, relative to predictions with “standard” Ergun coefficients, when an idealized set of momentum equations are solved. The calibrated models are then implemented into a two-fluid CFD solver and used to perform a two-dimensional time accurate simulation of the same packed bed at high gas and liquid flowrates. The predicted mean flow properties are in very good agreement with macroscale experimental data, while the instantaneous liquid distributions show significant transient, axial and lateral nonuniformities.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Experiments were conducted to fundamentally understand the effects of water injection on heat release in LTC. Our results show that water injection retards the start of combustion due to the latent heat of vaporization of the injected water. Furthermore, for start of water injection timings between 20 and 70 degrees before top dead center, combustion is significantly elongated compared to without water injection. The 10–90% burn duration with 6.6 and 9.0 mg of water per cycle was 77% and 146% longer than without water injection, respectively. Forced thermal stratification result from a direct water injection which reduces the heat release rate by local evaporative cooling. Finally, the load limits with and without water injection were determined experimentally. Without water injection, the load range was 2.3–3.6 bar gross IMEP. By using water injection to control heat release, the load range in TSCI was 2.3–8.4 bar gross IMEP, which is a range expansion of over 350%. These results demonstrate that direct water injection can provide significant improvements to both controllability and the range of operability of LTC, thereby resolving the major challenges associated with HCCI.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In order to directly utilize the high gas temperatures associated with oxy-combustion and offset any oxygen separation penalties, a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator has been proposed as a plant topping cycle. Accurately predicting the electrical conductivity of combustion products with the addition of potassium “seed” compound is necessary to evaluate the performance of this modern approach to MHD. In order to make these predictions, improved species collisional cross-section data (momentum transfer cross-section, MTCS) are needed at relevant conditions. A gas electrical conductivity model for use in open-cycle MHD power generation applications is presented, which makes use of updated MTCS data not represented in previous legacy publications. Based on the results of a detailed review and analysis of currently available MTCS data relevant to open-cycle MHD combustion systems, recommendations have been provided for relevant species and a gas temperature range of 1500-3500 K (~0.13-0.3 eV electron energy). Model predictions utilizing updated MTCS data are validated against limited experimental data found in literature for oxy-combustion with potassium seed compound.

One of the unique feature of the UKy-CAER integrated process is a two-stage stripping unit for solvent regeneration. The secondary stripper is empowered by the heat rejection from a conventional steam-heated (primary) stripper. The secondary stripper outlet stream at the commercial scale can be used as boiler secondary combustion air, consequently enriching the flue gas with CO<sub>2</sub>, resulting in less energy penalty required by the CO2 capture system. The primary goal of this study was to form an initial assessment of the impact on the amine solvent from coal combustion flue gas contaminants and the potential higher oxygen content in the solvent due to incorporation of the secondary air stripper into the conventional amine scrubber/stripper system. The overall oxidative degradation was comparable to previous reports with 30 wt% MEA solvent at similar flue gas run hours. This suggests that the addition of the secondary air stripper appears to be negligible with regards to solvent oxidation.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington, KY (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Procedia; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: C; Conference: 13th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, GHGT-13, 14-18 November 2016, Lausanne, Switzerland","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1297-1306","","","FE0007395","Journal ID: ISSN 1876-6102; PII: S1876610217314182","10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1242","","2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","1485413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1485413","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1485413","Energy Procedia","C","114"

The osmotic coefficient dependency of the surface tension of an electrolyte solution has been employed to estimate the surface tension. In order to calculate the osmotic coefficients, the Pitzer equation for the excess Gibbs energy was applied. According to the results of this study, molecular MEA, and to some extent protonated MEA and the MEA-carbamate have surface propensity and will accumulate at the surface phase. The carbonate ion shows nearly even distribution between bulk and surface phases, and bicarbonate displays a tendency to remain in the bulk phase that increases with CO<sub>2</sub> loading. The differences in the behaviors of protonated MEA, MEA-carbamate, carbonate and bicarbonate are due to differences among their sizes and polarizabilities. Using first principles calculations, the static isotropic dipole polarizabilities for bicarbonate, carbonate, MEA carbamate and protonated MEA were calculated. The bulk and surface phases’ ionic strengths reasonably represent this behavior of ionic species at the surface phase.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV (United States)","USDOE; Duke Energy, Charlotte, NC (United States); Electric Power Research Inst.

While holding the coal input flow rate and the CO<sub>2</sub> captured flow rates constant, it was determined that the H<sub>2</sub>-selective membrane case had a higher net power output (584 MW) compared to the baseline (564 MW) and compared to the CO<sub>2</sub>-selective membrane case (550 MW).

The model forms included three modified one-step models, a simple two-step model, and two new modified two-step models. These simple model forms were compared over a wide range of heating rates (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> K/s) at final temperatures up to 1600 K. Comparisons were made of total volatiles yield as a function of temperature, as well as the ultimate volatiles yield. Advantages and disadvantages for each simple model form are discussed.

One particular carrier is hematite as it is readily available and relatively inexpensive as well as being non-toxic. The objective of this paper is to present a new particle model and reaction kinetics that can be applied to Barracuda® simulations of the fuel reactor. This was done since Barracuda does not allow for the JMA (nucleation and growth) type kinetics that were developed from analytical study the results from TGA and fixed bed experiments. This paper summarizes the analytical analysis of the fixed bed reduction experiments conducted in a cycling fixed bed reactor and subsequently modeled with Barracuda® CFD software to develop the new model. The experiments were conducted using nominally 1000 g of hematite material. The cyclic processing began with the reduction step then proceeded to the oxidation step repeating this analysis for several cycles (5 to 10). The effects of fuel partial pressure (8.4, 7.2 and 5 mole %) on the conversion were investigated. The JMA analysis assumed the reactions to occur in the shell surrounding the particle grains with diffusion of oxygen to the grain surface from the core. In contrast, working with the particle kinetics allowed in Barracuda®, the reactions occur with different hematite species (surface and core) homogeneously mixed. Therefore it is necessary to develop a new particle model with the rates being related to the amount of reactant (surface or core) in the particle. This paper presents the development of such a particle model and compares the results with experimental results. ","Wiley","","National Energy Technology Lab.

This was accomplished by positioning a plunger at various heights above the exit from zero to 0.38 m. A dimensionless expression used to predict smooth exit voidage was modified to account for the effect of the depth of the blind-T. The new correlation contains the solids-gas load ratio, solids-to-gas density ratio, bed-to-particle diameter ratio, gas Reynolds Number, as well as a term for the exit geometry. This study also found that there was a minimum riser roof height above the blind-T exit beyond which the riser exit voidage was not affected by the exit geometry.

At equilibrium, aqueous AMP reacts with CO<sub>2</sub> to give bicarbonate in a 1:1 ratio. While this is the same stoichiometry as a tertiary amine, the reaction rate of AMP is 100 times faster. This work aims to explain the mass transfer behavior of AMP, specifically the stoichiometry and kinetics. An eNRTL thermodynamic model was used to regress wetted-wall column mass transfer data with two activity-based reactions: formation of carbamate and formation of bicarbonate. Data spanned 40–100 C and 0.15–0.60 mol CO<sub>2</sub>/mol alk). The fitted carbamate rate constant is three orders of magnitude greater than the bicarbonate rate constant. Rapid carbamate formation explains the kinetics, while the stoichiometry is explained by the carbamate reverting in the bulk liquid to allow CO<sub>2</sub> to form bicarbonate. Understanding the role of carbamate formation and diffusion in hindered amines enables optimizing solvent amine concentration by balancing viscosity and free amine concentration.

The results clearly showed that Li2CuO<sub>2</sub> can be used as a bifunctional material; it is able to catalyze the CO oxidation, producing CO<sub>2</sub>, and, subsequently, it can chemically capture the CO<sub>2</sub>. Both processes occur in the presence or absence of oxygen and follow the Mars–van Krevelen reaction mechanism.","American Chemical Society","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2016-02-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

"Applications of tribology to determine attrition by wear of particulate solids in CFB systems","Bayham, Samuel C.; Breault, Ronald; Monazam, Esmail","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; tribology; attrition; CFB systems","In recent years, much attention has been focused on the development of novel technologies for carbon capture and chemicals production that utilize a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) configuration; examples include chemical looping combustion and circulation of temperature swing adsorbents in a CFB configuration for CO<sub>2</sub> capture. A major uncertainty in determining the economic feasibility of these technologies is the required solids makeup rate, which, among other factors, is due to impact and wear attrition at various locations, including standpipes, cyclones, and the gas jets in fluid beds. While correlations have been developed that estimate the attrition rates at these areas, these correlations are dependent on constants that are uncertain without extensive experiment in the corresponding unit operation. Thus, it is difficult to determine the attrition rate a priori without performing extensive experiments on the materials or scaling up entirely. In this work, the authors outline a methodology for predictive attrition based on fundamental material properties from fields of tribology—specifically, the study of wear—to the knowledge of forces and sliding distances determined from hydrodynamic models to develop basic attrition models for novel CFB systems. The equations are derived for the standpipe and cyclone, which are common components found in CFBs, and the cyclone equation is compared to experimental data of attrition in the literature. The cyclone equation derived in this work results in an abrasion rate based on (1) material properties such as particle density and hardness, (2) inlet velocity, and (3) cyclone geometry. According to this equation, increasing the diameter of the cyclone and the solids inlet velocity tends to increase the rate of abrasion of the catalyst, while decreasing the hardness increases the abrasion rate. The functionality of the increasing attrition rate with velocity increase implies that increasing the efficiency of the cyclone may also increase the attrition rate via abrasion. With modifications to the severity coefficient term to include the solids loading, the cyclone equation derived in this work fits data from Reppenhagen and Werther with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 92%.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Uranium uptake was reduced by up to 30 %, in the presence of simulated sunlight, which also increased biomass accumulation and altered the microbial community composition on the fibers.

The photothermal release of CO<sub>2</sub> from monoethanolamine mediated by nanoparticles is a unique solution to this problem. When combined with light-absorbing nanoparticles, vapor bubbles form inside the capture solution and release the CO<sub>2</sub> without heating the bulk solvent. The mechanism by which CO<sub>2</sub> is released remained unclear, and understanding this process would improve the efficiency of photothermal CO<sub>2</sub> release. Here we report the use of different cosolvents to improve or reduce the photothermal regeneration of CO<sub>2</sub> captured by monoethanolamine. We found that properties that reduce the residence time of the gas bubbles (viscosity, boiling point, and convection direction) can enhance the regeneration efficiencies. The reduction of bubble residence times minimizes the reabsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> back into the capture solvent where bulk temperatures remain lower than the localized area surrounding the nanoparticle. These properties shed light on the mechanism of release and indicated methods for improving the efficiency of the process. We used this knowledge to develop an improved photothermal CO<sub>2</sub> regeneration system in a continuously flowing setup. Finally, using techniques to reduce residence time in the continuously flowing setup, such as alternative cosolvents and smaller fluid volumes, resulted in regeneration efficiency enhancements of over 200%.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"The effect of model fidelity on prediction of char burnout for single-particle coal combustion","McConnell, Josh; Sutherland, James C.","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; char oxidation; coal combustion; devolatilization","In this study, practical simulation of industrial-scale coal combustion relies on the ability to accurately capture the dynamics of coal subprocesses while also ensuring the computational cost remains reasonable. The majority of the residence time occurs post-devolatilization, so it is of great importance that a balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy of char combustion models is carefully considered. In this work, we consider the importance of model fidelity during char combustion by comparing combinations of simple and complex gas and particle-phase chemistry models. Detailed kinetics based on the GRI 3.0 mechanism and infinitely-fast chemistry are considered in the gas-phase. The Char Conversion Kinetics model and nth-Order Langmuir–Hinshelwood model are considered for char consumption. For devolatilization, the Chemical Percolation and Devolatilization and Kobayashi-Sarofim models are employed. The relative importance of gasification versus oxidation reactions in air and oxyfuel environments is also examined for various coal types. Results are compared to previously published experimental data collected under laminar, single-particle conditions. Calculated particle temperature histories are strongly dependent on the choice of gas phase and char chemistry models, but only weakly dependent on the chosen devolatilization model. Particle mass calculations were found to be very sensitive to the choice of devolatilization model, but only somewhat sensitive to the choice of gas chemistry and char chemistry models. High-fidelity models for devolatilization generally resulted in particle temperature and mass calculations that were closer to experimentally observed values.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)","","United States","2016-07-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","","Medium: ED; Size: 8 p.","","DOE-UTAH-MCCONNELL-0001","NA0002375","Journal ID: ISSN 1540-7489; PII: S1540748916301948","10.1016/j.proci.2016.06.136","","2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","1326226","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1326226","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1326226","Proceedings of the Combustion Institute","",""

It generates a CO<sub>2</sub> enriched flue gas, which will greatly benefit CO<sub>2</sub> capture, utilization or sequestration. Both chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and chemical-looping gasification (CLG) have the potential to be used to generate power, chemicals, and liquid fuels. Chemical-looping is an oxygen transporting process using oxygen carriers. Recently, attention has focused on solid fuels such as coal. Coal chemical-looping reactions are more complicated than gaseous fuels due to coal properties (like mineral matter) and the complex reaction pathways involving solid fuels. The mineral matter/ash and sulfur in coal may affect the activity of oxygen carriers. Oxygen carriers are the key issue in chemical-looping processes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been widely used for the development of oxygen carriers (e.g., oxide reactivity). Two proposed processes for the CLC of solid fuels are in-situ Gasification Chemical-Looping Combustion (iG-CLC) and Chemical-Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU). The objectives of this review are to discuss various chemical-looping processes with coal, summarize TGA applications in oxygen carrier development, and outline the major challenges associated with coal chemical-looping in iG-CLC and CLOU.","MDPI AG","","National Energy Technology Lab.

A case study with two distinct types of particles is focused on. When feeding solids using a standard solids inlet design, a dense and uniform rotating fluidized bed is formed, guaranteeing intense gas-solids contact. The presence of both types of particles near the chimney region reduces, however, the strength of the central vortex and is detrimental for separation and segregation. Optimization of the solids inlet design is required, as illustrated by stopping the solids feeding. High-G separation and segregation of the batch of particles is demonstrated, as the strength of the central vortex is restored. The flexibility with respect to the gas flow rate of the bed density and uniformity and of the gas-solids separation and segregation is demonstrated, a unique feature of vortex chamber generated rotating fluidized beds. With the particles considered in this case study, turbulent dispersion by large eddies in the gas phase is shown to have only a minor impact on the height of the inner bed of small/light particles.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Additionally, treatment and reuse of oil and gas produced waters for hydraulic fracturing will conserve scarce fresh-water resources. Each treatment step, including transportation and waste disposal, generates economic and engineering challenges and risks; these steps should be factored into a comprehensive assessment. We expand the water treatment model (WTM) coupled within the sequestration system model CO<sub>2</sub>-PENS and use chemistry data from seawater and proposed injection sites in Wyoming, to demonstrate the relative importance of different water types on costs, including little-studied effects of organic pretreatment and transportation. We compare the WTM with an engineering water treatment model, utilizing energy costs and transportation costs. Specific energy costs for treatment of Madison Formation brackish and saline base cases and for seawater compared closely between the two models, with moderate differences for scenarios incorporating energy recovery. Transportation costs corresponded for all but low flow scenarios (<5000 m<sup>3</sup>/d). Some processes that have high costs (e.g., truck transportation) do not contribute the most variance to overall costs. Other factors, including feed-water temperature and water storage costs, are more significant contributors to variance. These results imply that the WTM can provide good estimates of treatment and related process costs (AACEI equivalent level 5, concept screening, or level 4, study or feasibility), and the complex relationships between processes when extracted waters are evaluated for use during CCUS and EOR site development.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

We quantitatively characterize three alternative processes for DSR: distillation, steam stripping, and air stripping. We then construct a mathematical model of the distillation process for DSR that incorporates hydrodynamics, mass and heat transport resistances, and reaction kinetics, and we integrate this into a model for the full FO process. Finally, we utilize this FO process model to derive a first-order approximation of the water production capacity given the rejected heat quantity and quality available at U.S. electric power facilities.

We theorize and outline potential advantages of CO₂ including enhanced fracturing and fracture propagation, reduction of flow-blocking mechanisms, increased desorption of methane adsorbed in organic-rich parts of the shale, and a reduction or elimination of the deep re-injection of flow-back water that has been linked to induced seismicity and other environmental concerns. We also examine likely disadvantages including costs and safety issues associated with handling large volumes of supercritical CO₂.

Evaluation of the storage resources and cost of potential CO₂-EOR projects is an essential step before the commencement of large-scale deployment of such activities. In this paper, a hybrid techno-economic evaluation method, including a performance model and cost model for onshore CO₂-EOR projects, has been developed based on previous studies. Total 296 onshore oil fields, accounting for about 70% of total mature onshore oil fields in China, were evaluated by the techno-economic method. The key findings of this study are summarized as follows: (1) deterministic analysis shows there are approximately 1.1 billion tons (7.7 billion barrels) of incremental crude oil and 2.2 billion tons CO₂ storage resource for onshore CO₂-EOR at net positive revenue within the Chinese oil fields reviewed under the given operating strategy and economic assumptions. (2) Sensitivity study highlights that the cumulative oil production and cumulative CO₂ storage resource are very sensitive to crude oil price, CO₂ cost, project lifetime, discount rate and tax policy. High oil price, short project lifetime, low discount rate, low CO₂ cost, and low tax policy can greatly increase the net income of the oil enterprise, incremental oil recovery and CO₂ storage resource.

Under a current project with the U.S. Department of Energy, PNNL is developing an integrated solar thermochemical reaction system that combines solar concentrators with micro- and meso-channel reactors and heat exchangers to accomplish more than 20% solar augment of methane higher heating value. The objective of our three-year project is to develop and prepare for commercialization such solar reforming system with a high enough efficiency to serve as the frontend of a conventional natural gas (or biogas) combined cycle power plant, producing power with a levelized cost of electricity less than 6¢/kWh, without subsidies, by the year 2020.

We suggest that developing a large-scale, visible, and financially viable CCUS network could potentially overcome many barriers to deployment and jumpstart commercial-scale CCUS. To date, substantial effort has focused on technology development to reduce the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> capture from coal-fired power plants. Here, we propose that near-term investment could focus on implementing CO<sub>2</sub> capture on facilities that produce high-value chemicals/products. These facilities can absorb the expected impact of the marginal increase in the cost of production on the price of their product, due to the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> capture, more than coal-fired power plants. A financially viable demonstration of a large-scale CCUS network requires offsetting the costs of CO<sub>2</sub> capture by using the CO<sub>2</sub> as an input to the production of market-viable products. As a result, we demonstrate this alternative development path with the example of an integrated CCUS system where CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from ethylene producers and used for enhanced oil recovery in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.","Society of Chemical Industry, Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

It is also considered a prospective material for the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant for application in reactor pressure vessels at temperatures up to 650°C. In this paper, heat treatment of the modified 9Cr-1Mo steel was studied by normalizing and tempering the steel at various temperatures and times, with the ultimate goal of improving its creep resistance and optimizing material hardness. The microstructural evolution of the heat treated steels was correlated with the differential scanning calorimetric results. Optical microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with microhardness profiles and calorimetric plots were used to understand the evolution of microstructure including precipitate structures in modified 9Cr-1Mo steel and relate it to the mechanical behavior of the steel. Thermo-CalcTM calculations were used to support experimental work and provide guidance in terms of the precipitate stability and microstructural evolution. Furthermore, the carbon isopleth and temperature dependencies of the volume fraction of different precipitates were constructed. The predicted and experimentally observed results were found to be in good agreement.","MDPI","","Idaho National Lab.

The method falls into the general category of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian methods; it is based on a fixed mesh that is locally adapted in the immediate vicinity of the moving interfaces and reverts to its original shape once the moving interfaces go past the elements. The moving interfaces are defined by separate sets of marker points so that the global mesh is independent of interface movement and the possibility of mesh entanglement is eliminated. The results is a fully robust formulation capable of calculating on domains of complex geometry with moving boundaries or devises that can also have a complex geometry without danger of the mesh becoming unsuitable due to its continuous deformation thus eliminating the need for repeated re-meshing and interpolation. Moreover, the boundary conditions on the interfaces are imposed exactly. This work is intended to support the internal combustion engines simulator KIVA developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. The model's capabilities are illustrated through application to incompressible flows in different geometrical settings that show the robustness and flexibility of the technique to perform simulations involving moving boundaries in a three-dimensional domain.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

High temperature H₂ selective glassy polymer membranes are an attractive option for energy efficient H₂/CO₂ separations in advanced power production schemes with integrated carbon capture.

Polybenzimidazole (PBI)-based materials have demonstrated commercially attractive H₂/CO₂ separation characteristics and exceptional tolerance to hydrocarbon fuel derived synthesis (syngas) gas operating conditions and chemical environments.

"Flue gas cleanup using the Moving-Bed Copper Oxide Process","Pennline, Henry W; Hoffman, James S","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Flue gas cleanup; Copper oxide sorbent; Desulfurization; Oxy-firing","The use of copper oxide on a support had been envisioned as a gas cleanup technique to remove sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) and nitric oxides (NO{sub x}) from flue gas produced by the combustion of coal for electric power generation. In general, dry, regenerable flue gas cleanup techniques that use a sorbent can have various advantages, such as simultaneous removal of pollutants, production of a salable by-product, and low costs when compared to commercially available wet scrubbing technology. Due to the temperature of reaction, the placement of the process into an advanced power system could actually increase the thermal efficiency of the plant. The Moving-Bed Copper Oxide Process is capable of simultaneously removing sulfur oxides and nitric oxides within the reactor system. In this regenerable sorbent technique, the use of the copper oxide sorbent was originally in a fluidized bed, but the more recent effort developed the use of the sorbent in a moving-bed reactor design. A pilot facility or life-cycle test system was constructed so that an integrated testing of the sorbent over absorption/regeneration cycles could be conducted. A parametric study of the total process was then performed where all process steps, including absorption and regeneration, were continuously operated and experimentally evaluated. The parametric effects, including absorption temperature, sorbent and gas residence times, inlet SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x} concentration, and flyash loadings, on removal efficiencies and overall operational performance were determined. Although some of the research results have not been previously published because of previous collaborative restrictions, a summary of these past findings is presented in this communication. Additionally, the potential use of the process for criteria pollutant removal in oxy-firing of fossil fuel for carbon sequestration purposes is discussed.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

The methodology is employed to evaluate the economic viability of using treated municipal wastewater (MWW) to replace the use of freshwater as makeup water to power plant cooling systems. Cost analyses are presented for a reference power plant and five different tertiary treatment scenarios to reduce the scaling tendencies of MWW. Results indicate that a 550 MW sub-critical coal fired power plant with a makeup water requirement of 29.3 ML/day has a TCC of $3.0 - 3.2 million/yr associated with the use of treated MWW for cooling. (All costs USD 2009). This translates to a freshwater conservation cost of $0.29/kL, which is considerably lower than that of dry air cooling technology, $1.5/kL, as well as the 2020 conservation cost target set by the U.S. Department of Energy, $0.74/kL. Results also show that if the available price of freshwater exceeds that of secondary-treated MWW by more than $0.13-0.14/kL, it can be economically advantageous to purchase secondary MWW and treat it for utilization in the recirculating cooling system of a thermoelectric power plant.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

We use Aspen Plus, with the electrolyte-NRTL thermodynamic model for the solvent CO{sub 2} interactions, coupled with a multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to determine the best process design and operating conditions for each solvent. This ensures that the processes utilized for the comparison are those which are best suited for the specific solvent. We evaluate and compare the process performance of monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) in a 90% CO{sub 2} capture process from a 550 MW coal fired power plant.

This low-permeability sample was characterized in detail using X-ray computed microtomography before and after exposure to CO <sub>2</sub>-acidified brine, allowing mineral phase and voidspace distributions to be quantified in three dimensions. Solution chemistry indicated that CO <sub>2</sub>-acidified brine preferentially dissolved dolomite until saturation was attained, while anhydrite remained unreactive. Dolomite dissolution contributed to increases in bulk permeability through the formation of a localized channel, guided by microfractures as well as porosity and reactive phase distributions aligned with depositional bedding. An indirect effect of carbonate mineral reactivity with CO <sub>2</sub>-acidified solution is voidspace generation through physical transport of anhydrite freed from the rock matrix following dissolution of dolomite. The development of high permeability fast pathways in this experiment highlights the role of carbonate content and potential fracture orientations in evaporite caprock formations considered for both geologic carbon sequestration and CO <sub>2</sub>-enhanced oil recovery operations.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This work explores nitrogen dilution of hydrogen diffusion flames to reduce thermal NO{sub x} emissions and avoid problems with premixing hydrogen at gas turbine pressures and temperatures. The burner design includes an array of high-velocity coaxial fuel and air injectors, which balances stability and ignition performance, combustor pressure drop, and flame residence time. Testing of this array injector at representative gas turbine conditions (16 atm and 1750 K firing temperature) yields 4.4 ppmv NO{sub x} at 15% O{sub 2} equivalent. NO{sub x} emissions are proportional to flame residence times, though these deviate from expected scaling due to active combustor cooling and merged flame behavior.

"Mass transfer effects in a gasification riser","Breault, Ronald W.; Li, Tingwen; Nicoletti, Phillip","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 42 ENGINEERING; Mass transfer; Gasification; Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology; Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI)","In the development of multiphase reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes, a number of simplifications were incorporated into the codes and models. One of these simplifications was the use of a simplistic mass transfer correlation for the faster reactions and omission of mass transfer effects completely on the moderate speed and slow speed reactions such as those in a fluidized bed gasifier. Another problem that has propagated is that the mass transfer correlation used in the codes is not universal and is being used far from its developed bubbling fluidized bed regime when applied to circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser reactors. These problems are true for the major CFD codes. To alleviate this problem, a mechanistic based mass transfer coefficient algorithm has been developed based upon an earlier work by Breault et al. This fundamental approach uses the local hydrodynamics to predict a local, time varying mass transfer coefficient. The predicted mass transfer coefficients and the corresponding Sherwood numbers agree well with literature data and are typically about an order of magnitude lower than the correlation noted above. The incorporation of the new mass transfer model gives the expected behavior for all the gasification reactions evaluated in the paper. At the expected and typical design values for the solid flow rate in a CFB riser gasifier an ANOVA analysis has shown the predictions from the new code to be significantly different from the original code predictions. The new algorithm should be used such that the conversions are not over predicted. Additionally, its behaviors with changes in solid flow rate are consistent with the changes in the hydrodynamics.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

The physical properties of the IL, including density, viscosity, surface tension, vapor pressure and heat capacity were obtained from literature and modeled as a function of temperature. Also, available experimental solubility values for CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO, and CH<sub>4</sub> in this IL were compiled and their binary interaction parameters (Δ<sub>ij</sub> and l<sub>ij</sub>) were optimized and correlated as functions of temperature.

CLC produces sequestration-ready CO{sub 2}-streams without a significant energy penalty. Development of efficient oxygen carriers is essential to successfully operate a CLC system. Copper and iron oxides are promising candidates for CLC. Copper oxide possesses high reactivity but it has issues with particle agglomeration due to its low melting point. Even though iron oxide is an inexpensive oxygen carrier it has a slower reactivity. In this study, mixed metal oxide carriers containing iron and copper oxides were evaluated for coal and methane CLC. The components of CuO and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} were optimized to obtain good reactivity while maintaining physical and chemical stability during cyclic reactions for methane-CLC and solid-fuel CLC. Compared with single metal oxygen carriers, the optimized Cu–Fe mixed oxide oxygen carriers demonstrated high reaction rate, better combustion conversion, greater oxygen usage and improved physical stability. Thermodynamic calculations, XRD, TGA, flow reactor studies and TPR experiments suggested that there is a strong interaction between CuO and Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} contributing to a synergistic effect during CLC reactions. The amount of oxygen release of the mixed oxide carrier in the absence of a fuel was similar to that of the single metal oxides. However, in the presence of fuels, the oxygen consumption and the reaction profiles of the mixed oxide carriers were significantly better than that of the single metal oxides. The nature of the fuel not only influenced the reactivity, but also the final reduction status of the oxygen carriers during chemical looping combustion. Cu oxide of the mixed oxide was fully reduced metallic copper with both coal and methane. Fe oxide of the mixed oxide was fully reduced Fe metal with methane but it was reduced to only FeO with coal. Possible mechanisms of how the presence of CuO enhances the reduction of Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} are discussed.","Elsevier","","National Energy Technology Lab.

"Avoiding compressor surge during emergency shutdown hybridturbine systems","Pezzini, Paolo; Tucker, David; Traverso, Alberto","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 30 DIRECT ENERGY CONVERSION","A new emergency shutdown procedure for a direct-fired fuel cell turbine hybrid power system was evaluated using a hardware-based simulation of an integrated gasifier/fuel cell/turbine hybrid cycle (IGFC), implemented through the Hybrid Performance (Hyper) project at the National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy (NETL). The Hyper facility is designed to explore dynamic operation of hybrid systems and quantitatively characterize such transient behavior. It is possible to model, test, and evaluate the effects of different parameters on the design and operation of a gasifier/fuel cell/gas turbine hybrid system and provide a means of quantifying risk mitigation strategies. An open-loop system analysis regarding the dynamic effect of bleed air, cold air bypass, and load bank is presented in order to evaluate the combination of these three main actuators during emergency shutdown. In the previous Hybrid control system architecture, catastrophic compressor failures were observed when the fuel and load bank were cut off during emergency shutdown strategy. Improvements were achieved using a nonlinear fuel valve ramp down when the load bank was not operating. Experiments in load bank operation show compressor surge and stall after emergency shutdown activation. The difficulties in finding an optimal compressor and cathode mass flow for mitigation of surge and stall using these actuators are illustrated.","","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Here a modified MECC CO{sub 2} capture process is analyzed that supplements retentate pressurization and permeate evacuation as a means to create a CO{sub 2} driving force with a process assisted by the catalytic combustion of syngas on the permeate side of the membrane. The combustion reactions consume transported oxygen, making it unavailable for the backwards transport reaction. With this change, the MECC capture system becomes exothermic, and steam for electricity production may be generated from the waste heat. Greater than 90% of the CO{sub 2} in the flue gas may be captured, and a compressed CO{sub 2} product stream is produced. A fossil-fueled power plant using this process would consume 14% more fuel per unit electricity produced than a power plant with no CO{sub 2} capture system, and has the potential to meet U.S. DOE's goal that deployment of a CO{sub 2} capture system at a fossil-fueled power plant should not increase the cost of electricity from the combined facility by more than 30%.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Membrane Science; Journal Volume: 401-402","","Medium: ED; Size: 323-332","","SRNL-STI-2012-00206","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0376-7388; JMESDO; TRN: US201216%%95","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","1046160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1046160","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1046160","Journal of Membrane Science","","401-402"

Once the water vapor is condensed, it is relatively easy to sequester the CO2 so that it does not escape into the atmosphere.

"Rigorous Kinetic Modeling and Optimization Study of a Modified Claus Unit for an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plant with CO{sub 2} Capture","Jones, Dustin; Bhattacharyya, Debangsu; Turton, Richard; Zitney, Stephen E.","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS","The modified Claus process is one of the most common technologies for sulfur recovery from acid gas streams. Important design criteria for the Claus unit, when part of an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant, are the ability to destroy ammonia completely and the ability to recover sulfur thoroughly from a relatively low purity acid gas stream without sacrificing flame stability. Because of these criteria, modifications to the conventional process are often required, resulting in a modified Claus process. For the studies discussed here, these modifications include the use of a 95% pure oxygen stream as the oxidant, a split flow configuration, and the preheating of the feeds with the intermediate pressure steam generated in the waste heat boiler (WHB). In the future, for IGCC plants with CO{sub 2} capture, the Claus unit must satisfy emission standards without sacrificing the plant efficiency in the face of typical disturbances of an IGCC plant, such as rapid change in the feed flow rates due to load-following and wide changes in the feed composition because of changes in the coal feed to the gasifier. The Claus unit should be adequately designed and efficiently operated to satisfy these objectives. Even though the Claus process has been commercialized for decades, most papers concerned with the modeling of the Claus process treat the key reactions as equilibrium reactions. Such models are validated by manipulating the temperature approach to equilibrium for a set of steady-state operating data, but they are of limited use for dynamic studies. One of the objectives of this study is to develop a model that can be used for dynamic studies. In a Claus process, especially in the furnace and the WHB, many reactions may take place. In this work, a set of linearly independent reactions has been identified, and kinetic models of the furnace flame and anoxic zones, WHB, and catalytic reactors have been developed. To facilitate the modeling of the Claus furnace, a four-stage method was devised so as to determine which set of linearly independent reactions would best describe the product distributions from available plant data. Various approaches are taken to derive the kinetic rate expressions, which are either missing in the open literature or found to be inconsistent. A set of plant data is used for optimal estimation of the kinetic parameters. The final model agrees well with the published plant data. Using the developed kinetics models of the Claus reaction furnace, WHB, and catalytic stages, two optimization studies are carried out. The first study shows that there exists an optimal steam pressure generated in the WHB that balances hydrogen yield, oxygen demand, and power generation. In the second study, it is shown that an optimal H{sub 2}S/SO{sub 2} ratio exists that balances single-pass conversion, hydrogen yield, oxygen demand, and power generation. In addition, an operability study has been carried out to examine the operating envelope in which both the H{sub 2}S/SO{sub 2} ratio and the adiabatic flame temperature can be controlled in the face of disturbances typical for the operation of an IGCC power plant with CO{sub 2} capture. Impact of CO{sub 2} capture on the Claus process has also been discussed.","","","National Energy Technology Lab. (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, and Morgantown, WV (United States).

Vehicle fuel is the only current energy use large enough to absorb all the energy capacity that might be diverted from the power industry, and its ease of storage obviates problems with discontinuous synfuel production. The potential benefits and challenges of synfuels integration are illustrated by the production of methanol from natural gas (as a source of carbon) using steam from a light water nuclear power reactor which is assumed to be available in accord with a year's worth of power demand data. Methanol's synthesis process is easily adapted to using 300 C heat from a light water reactor and this simple compound can be further processed into gasoline, biodiesel, or dimethyl ether, fuels which can be used with the current vehicle fleet. A supplemental feed to the methanol process of natural gas (for energy) allows operation at constant full rate when the nuclear heat is being used to produce electrical power. The higher capital costs of such a system are offset by a lower cost of heat and power production from a large base load type of plant and by reduced costs associated with much lower CO2 emissions. Other less tangible economic benefits of this and similar hybrid systems include better use of natural resource for fuels and greater energy services security from the domestic production of vehicle fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Rigorous Kinetic Modeling and Optimization Study of a Modified Claus Unit for an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plant with CO <sub>2</sub> Capture","Jones, Dustin; Bhattacharyya, Debangsu; Turton, Richard; Zitney, Stephen E.","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Modified Claus; IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle); Kinetic modeling; Optimization; Operability","The modified Claus process is one of the most common technologies for sulfur recovery from acid gas streams. Important design criteria for the Claus unit, when part of an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant, are the ability to destroy ammonia completely and the ability to recover sulfur thoroughly from a relatively low purity acid gas stream without sacrificing flame stability. Because of these criteria, modifications to the conventional process are often required, resulting in a modified Claus process. For the studies discussed here, these modifications include the use of a 95% pure oxygen stream as the oxidant, a split flow configuration, and the preheating of the feeds with the intermediate pressure steam generated in the waste heat boiler (WHB). In the future, for IGCC plants with CO{sub 2} capture, the Claus unit must satisfy emission standards without sacrificing the plant efficiency in the face of typical disturbances of an IGCC plant, such as rapid change in the feed flow rates due to load-following and wide changes in the feed composition because of changes in the coal feed to the gasifier. The Claus unit should be adequately designed and efficiently operated to satisfy these objectives. Even though the Claus process has been commercialized for decades, most papers concerned with the modeling of the Claus process treat the key reactions as equilibrium reactions. Such models are validated by manipulating the temperature approach to equilibrium for a set of steady-state operating data, but they are of limited use for dynamic studies. One of the objectives of this study is to develop a model that can be used for dynamic studies. In a Claus process, especially in the furnace and the WHB, many reactions may take place. In this work, a set of linearly independent reactions has been identified, and kinetic models of the furnace flame and anoxic zones, WHB, and catalytic reactors have been developed. To facilitate the modeling of the Claus furnace, a four-stage method was devised so as to determine which set of linearly independent reactions would best describe the product distributions from available plant data. Various approaches are taken to derive the kinetic rate expressions, which are either missing in the open literature or found to be inconsistent. A set of plant data is used for optimal estimation of the kinetic parameters. The final model agrees well with the published plant data. Using the developed kinetics models of the Claus reaction furnace, WHB, and catalytic stages, two optimization studies are carried out. The first study shows that there exists an optimal steam pressure generated in the WHB that balances hydrogen yield, oxygen demand, and power generation. In the second study, it is shown that an optimal H{sub 2}S/SO{sub 2} ratio exists that balances single-pass conversion, hydrogen yield, oxygen demand, and power generation. In addition, an operability study has been carried out to examine the operating envelope in which both the H{sub 2}S/SO{sub 2} ratio and the adiabatic flame temperature can be controlled in the face of disturbances typical for the operation of an IGCC power plant with CO{sub 2} capture. Impact of CO{sub 2} capture on the Claus process has also been discussed.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2012-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 51; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2362-2375","","TPR-3755","FE0004000","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885","10.1021/ie201713n","","2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","1052846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1052846","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","51"

"Modeling energy in an Integrated Pollutant Removal (IPR) system with CO{sub 2} capture integrated with oxy-fuel combustion","Harendra, Sivaram; Oryshchyn, Danylo B.; Gerdemann, Stephen J.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS","Oxy-coal combustion is one of the technical solutions for mitigating CO{sub 2} in thermal power plants. Many processes have been evolved in past the decade to capture CO{sub 2} from process industries. Researchers at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) have patented a process, integrated pollutant removal (IPR), that uses off the shelf technology to produce a sequestration-ready CO{sub 2} stream from an oxy-combustion power plant. The IPR process as it is realized at the Jupiter Oxygen Burner Test Facility is a spray tower (direct-contact heat exchanger) followed by four stages of compression with intercooling. To study the energy flows of the oxy-combustion process, a 15 MW{sub t}h oxy-combustion pulverized-coal-fired plant integrated with the IPR system was simulated and analyzed using ASPEN Plus and ASPEN energy analyzer. This paper discusses flue-gas recycle, energy flow, recovery, and optimization of IPR systems. ASPEN models of heat- and mass-transfer processes in aflue-gas-condensing heat-exchanger system were developed to predict the heat transferred from flue gas to cooling water. The flue-gas exit temperature, cooling water outlet temperature, and energy flows of IPR streams were computed using ASPEN models. Pinch principles are deployed for targeting design and operation-guiding purposes and balancing the heat and mass transfer in the IPR system. The results are expected to support sophistication of the IPR system design, improving its application in a variety of settings. They open the door for valuable IPR efficiency improvements and generalization of methodology for simultaneous management of energy resources.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Energy Technology Lab.

Here a modified MECC CO2 capture process is analyzed that supplements retentate pressurization and permeate evacuation as a means to create a CO2 driving force with a process assisted by the catalytic combustion of syngas on the permeate side of the membrane. The combustion reactions consume transported oxygen, making it unavailable for the backwards transport reaction. With this change, the MECC capture system becomes exothermic, and steam for electricity production may be generated from the waste heat. Greater than 90% of the CO2 in the flue gas may be captured, and a compressed CO2 product stream is produced. A fossil-fueled power plant using this process would consume 14% more fuel per unit electricity produced than a power plant with no CO2 capture system, and has the potential to meet U.S. DOE s goal that deployment of a CO2 capture system at a fossil-fueled power plant should not increase the cost of electricity from the combined facility by more than 30%.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The presented approach has led to the development of the Oak Ridge Siting Analysis for power Generation Expansion (OR-SAGE) tool. The tool takes inputs such as population growth, water availability, environmental indicators, and tectonic and geological hazards to provide an in-depth analysis for siting options. To the utility and energy companies, the tool can quickly and effectively provide feedback on land suitability based on technology specific inputs. However, the tool does not replace the required detailed evaluation of candidate sites.

In this study, innovative amine-multilayered sorbents were fabricated using layer-by-layer (LbL) nanoassembly technology via alternate deposition of a CO{sub 2}-adsorbing amine polymer (e.g. polyethylenimine or PEI) and an oppositely-charged polymer (e.g. polystyrene sulfonate or PSS). We found that the developed sorbents could be used for CO{sub 2} capture and that LbL nanoassembly allows us to engineer their CO{sub 2} capture performance through the fabrication variables (e.g. deposition polymers, deposition media, and number of bilayers). PEI/PSS was found to be the best polymer combination for developing sorbents with relatively high CO{sub 2} capture capacity. The amine-multilayered solid sorbents possessed fine microstructures and may have similar polymer deposition within and on the surface of solid sorbents. These amine-multilayered sorbents had much faster CO{sub 2} desorption rates compared to sorbents prepared using the current PEI-impregnation approach.

The outcome depends on the competition between sequestration and leakage processes. Leakages may occur from failure of manmade material or through faults in the formations above the reservoir. A simple and computationally efficient simulator was constructed based on the CQUESTRA model (LeNeveu, 2008). To assess the risk associated with uncertainty in the values of uncertain parameters in this model, thousands of runs were carried out with the simulator on a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU implementation was up to 64 times faster compared to a CPU implementation. In the absence of active faults around a single injection well, the model suggests that leakages of more than 1% of the total CO{sub 2} are unlikely during the 1000 year period after dissipation of temperature and pressure transients associated with injection. Leakage amounts for ten leaky wells are considerably higher, suggesting the critical importance of monitoring equipment after sequestration.","","","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2011-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Computers and Chemical Engineering; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1631-1644","","TPR-3322","DE-FE-0004000","Journal ID: ISSN 0098-1354","10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.03.023","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","1053617","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1053617","","Computers and Chemical Engineering","8","35"

The need for further improvement is reflected by new German legislation effective as of 27 January 2009, requiring 100mg/m{sup 3}{sub s}. Other countries are expected to follow this example due to the national emission ceilings of the Gothenburg protocol and the concluding EU directive 2001/81/EC.

This is why there is a need for new technologies that make it possible to reconcile both requirements: reduced emissions and increased energy efficiency. A new process combining the internal recirculation of flue gas with ammonia or urea injection in order to achieve less then 80mg/m{sup 3}{sub s} of NO{sub x} is described.

This study examined a homogeneous photocatalytic oxidation process using concentrated solar UV energy (UV/Fe(II)/H{sub 2}O{sub 2}) in a Solar Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) pilot plant. The efficiency of the process was evaluated by analysis of the oxidation of cyanides and Total Organic Carbon (TOC).

The estimates include detailed modeling of supply systems for corn stover or mixed prairie grasses (MPG) and of feedstock conversion facilities. Biomass feedstock costs in Illinois (delivered at a rate of one million tonnes per year, dry basis) are $ 3.8/GJ{sub HHV} for corn stover and $ 7.2/GJ{sub HHV} for MPG. Under a strong carbon mitigation policy, the economics of co-producing low-carbon fuels and electricity from a co-feed of biomass and coal in Illinois are promising. An extrapolation to the United States of the results for Illinois suggests that nationally significant amounts of low-carbon fuels and electricity could be produced this way.","","","","","","United States","2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Environmental Science; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1754-5692; TRN: 100200078","10.1039/b911529c","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21262009","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21262009","","Energy and Environmental Science","3","1"

Those ''smart grids'' should be designed and managed by model based methods, which are elaborated within these projects. Cogeneration plants (CHP) can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by locally producing heat and electricity. The integration of thermal storage devices is suitable to get more flexibility for the cogeneration operation. If several power plants are bound to centrally managed clusters, it is called ''virtual power plant''. To operate smart grids optimally, new optimisation and model reduction techniques are necessary to get rid with the complexity. There is a great potential for the optimised management of CHPs, which is not yet used. Due to the fact that electrical and thermal demands do not occur simultaneously, a thermally driven CHP cannot supply electrical peak loads when needed. With the usage of thermal storage systems it is possible to decouple electric and thermal production. We developed an optimisation method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) for the management of local heat supply systems with CHPs, heating boilers and thermal storages. The algorithm allows the production of thermal and electric energy with a maximal benefit. In addition to fuel and maintenance costs it is assumed that the produced electricity of the CHP is sold at dynamic prices. This developed optimisation algorithm was used for an existing local heat system with 5 CHP units of the same type. An analysis of the potential showed that about 10% increase in benefit is possible compared to a typical thermally driven CHP system under current German boundary conditions. The quality of the optimisation result depends on an accurate prognosis of the thermal load which is realised with an empiric formula fitted with measured data by a multiple regression method. The key functionality of a virtual power plant is to increase the value of the produced power by clustering different plants. The first step of the optimisation concerns the local operation of the individual power generator, the second step is to calculate the contribution to the virtual power plant. With small extensions the suggested MILP algorithm can be used for an overall EEX (European Energy Exchange) optimised management of clustered CHP systems in form of the virtual power plant. This algorithm has been used to control cogeneration plants within a distribution grid.

The estimations are made separately for each one of the thirteen plants that produced electricity in 2007, because the lignite-fired thermal plants in Turkey are installed near the regions where the lignite is mined, and characteristics and composition of lignite used in each power plant are quite different from a region to another. Emission factors methodology is used for the estimations. The emission factors obtained from well-known literature are then modified depending on local moisture content of lignite. Emission rates and specific emissions (per MWh) of the pollutants from the plants without electrostatic precipitators and flue-gas desulfurization systems are found to be higher than emissions from the plants having electrostatic precipitators and flue -gas desulfurization systems. Finally a projection for the future emissions due to lignite-based power plants is given. Predicted demand for the increasing generation capacity based on the lignite-fired thermal power plant, from 2008 to 2017 is around 30%. 39 refs., 13 figs., 10 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Policy; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 243-252","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0301-4215; ENPYAC; TRN: 100200008","10.1016/j.enpol.2009.09.011","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21261946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21261946","","Energy Policy","1","38"

Most commercial electricity system planning software is limited to only transmission planning. An application of the model to India's national power grid, for 2008-2028, indicates substantial transmission expansion is the cost-effective means of meeting the needs of the nation's growing economy. An electricity demand growth rate of 4% over the 20-year planning horizon requires more than a 50% increase in the Government's forecasted transmission capacity expansion, and 8% demand growth requires more than a six-fold increase in the planned transmission capacity expansion. The model minimizes the long-term expansion costs (operational and capital) for the nation's five existing regional power grids and suggests the need for large increases in load-carrying capability between them.

The objective of this study is to gain a fundamental understanding of the effect of syngas on the LSI flame behavior, the emissions, and the flowfield characteristics for adaptation to the combustion turbines in integrated gasification combined cycle clean coal power plants. The experiments were conducted in two facilities. Open atmospheric laboratory flames generated by a full size (6.35 cm) LSI were used to investigate the lean blow-off limits, emissions, and the flowfield characteristics. Verification of syngas operation at elevated temperatures and pressures were performed with a reduced scale (2.54 cm) LSI in a small pressurized combustion channel. The results show that the basic LSI design is amenable to burning syngases with up to 60% H{sub 2}. Syngases with high H{sub 2} concentration have lower lean blow-off limits. From particle image velocimetry measurements, the flowfield similarity behavior and the turbulent flame speeds of syngases flames are consistent with those observed in hydrocarbon and pure or diluted hydrogen flames. The NOx emissions from syngas flames show log-linear dependency on the adiabatic flame temperature and are comparable to those reported for the gaseous fuels reported previously. Successful firing of the reduced-scale LSI at 450 K &lt;T &lt;505 K and 8 atm verified the operability of this concept at gas turbine conditions.","","","","","","United States","2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 11502","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 091200004","10.1115/1.3124662","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21240204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21240204","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","132"

The effects of the pretreatment of coal using supercritical CO{sub 2} on its physical structure and combustion properties have been studied at the bench-scale level. Emphasis has been placed on NO reburning, NO emissions during air-fired and oxy-fired combustion, and loss on ignition (LOI). Pretreatment was found to increase porosity and to significantly alter the fuel nitrogen reaction pathways. Consequently, NO reduction during reburning using bituminous coal increased, and NO emissions during oxidation of lignite decreased.

Normal emittance spectra in the near to medium infrared (2.5-25 {mu}m) region and total normal emittances were measured on four kinds of ground ash deposits. Measurements were conducted in the 570-1460 K temperature range which is common for boiler furnaces, by both heating and cooling the ash samples, with the aim to study the effect of their thermal history. Dependence of emittance on wavelength, temperature and chemical composition was studied, too. Samples were tested for transparency (opacity) to verify the accuracy of results. It was determined that the thicknesses used for the ash powders are opaque for infrared radiation for thicknesses in the order of a millimeter. Tests have shown that spectral emittance increases with an increase of wavelength with a characteristic pattern common for all samples. Spectral normal emittance increases strongly with temperature at shorter wavelengths and remains high and unchanged at longer ones. Emittance spectra are not very sensitive to chemical composition of ashes especially beyond {lambda} {approx} 5 {mu}m. With an increase of temperature, total emittance of the powdered sample decreases to a minimum value around 1200 K. Further temperature rise induces an increase of total emittance due to sintering in the ash. On cooling, the emittance increases monotonically following the hysteresis. Quantitative directions for evaluating thermal radiation characteristics of ash deposits for the merits of the safety design of boiler furnaces were proposed. That comprises correlating the experimentally obtained emittance spectra with curves of simple analytical form, i.e., a continuous function of minimum emittance vs. wavelength. The proposed method can be extended to other specimens from the same furnace and used to determine correlations for thermal calculation of old and design of new furnaces - with similar geometry and combusting similar coal. The method is potentially applicable to completely different boiler furnaces combusting different coal, and the authors recommend running the tests with new deposit samples. The data will then be applicable to the thermal design of a whole new class of furnaces, having similar geometry and combusting similar coal. This is expected to greatly enhance the accuracy and precision of thermal calculation as well as the efficiency of thermal design of steam boilers.

"MWm-array sensors for in situ monitoring of high-temperature components in power plants","Sheiretov, Y; Grundy, D; Zilberstein, V; Goldfine, N; Maley, S","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; MONITORING; SUPERCRITICAL STATE; TEMPERATURE MONITORING; MATERIALS; ALLOYS; SENSORS","Utilization of America's substantial coal reserves for energy production has become a national priority. Advanced coal-fired power plants offer an environmentally friendly means to achieve that goal. These power plants, such as ultrasupercritical power plants, will provide high thermal efficiency along with greatly reduced emissions of CO and other pollutants. Life cycle costs for the advanced coal-fired plants can be reduced by enhanced observability in support of condition-based maintenance. The enhanced observability can be achieved by using networks of condition-monitoring sensors that would provide component-level material condition information and through-wall temperature monitoring. This would reduce uncertainties in knowledge of material condition, at the level of individual components, and improve capability to predict remaining life of critical components. One approach being developed under the U.S. Department of Energy Small Business Innovation Research Program is to develop and implement high-temperature versions of the meandering winding magnetometer (HT-MWM) for temperatures up to 1000{sup o}C. These patented sensors, coupled with multivariate inverse methods, would provide superior performance for in situ material condition monitoring (material degradation, flaw detection, stress relaxation, and/or creep monitoring) and through-wall temperature measurement. Networks of HT-MWMs will generate material condition information to be used by adaptive life-management algorithms for remaining life prediction and decision support.","","","","","","United States","2009-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Sensors Journal; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1527-1536","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1530-437X; TRN: 091200224","10.1109/JSEN.2009.2019335","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21240409","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21240409","","IEEE Sensors Journal","11","9"

The HTAS removed 65, 83, and 92% of Hg captured with PAC when ran at 900{sup o}F, 1,000{sup o}F, and 1,200 {sup o}F, respectively, while the TGA removed 46 and 100% of Hg at 800 {sup o}F and 900{sup o}F, respectively. However, addition of CuO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} mixture and CuCl catalysts enhanced Hg removal and PAC regeneration at lower temperatures. CuO-Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3} mixture performed better than CuCl in PAC regeneration. Scanning electron microscopy images and energy dispersive X-ray analysis show no change in PAC particle aggregation or chemical composition. Thermally treated sorbents had higher surface area and pore volume than the untreated samples indicating regeneration. The optimum temperature for PAC regeneration in the HTAS was 1,000{sup o}F. At this temperature, the regenerated sorbent had sufficient adsorption capacity similar to its virgin counterpart at 33.9% loss on ignition. Consequently, the regenerated PAC may be recycled back into the system by blending it with virgin PAC.","","","","","","United States","2009-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering (New York); Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1032-1040","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9372; JOEEDU; TRN: 091100334","10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000074","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21233750","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21233750","","Journal of Environmental Engineering (New York)","10","135"

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects (if any) on data quality when the following aspects of the sorbent trap method are varied: (a) sorbent trap configuration; (b) sampling time; and (c) analytical technique. Also, the performance of a speciating sorbent trap (i.e., a trap capable of separating elemental Hg from oxidized Hg), was evaluated by direct comparison against the Ontario Hydro (OH) reference method. Flue gas samples were taken using both 'regular' and modified sorbent trap measurement systems. Both short-term (1.5 h) and long-term (18 h to 10 days) samples were collected. The in-stack and out-of-stack sampling methods produced satisfactory relative accuracy results for both the short-term and long-term testing. For the short-term tests, the in-stack sampling results compared more favorably to the OH method than did the out-of-stack results. The relative deviation between the paired traps was considerably higher for the short-term out-of-stack tests than for the long-term tests. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), showed a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.1) between the direct combustion and wet-chemistry analytical methods used in the study; the results from the direct combustion method were consistently higher than the wet-chemistry results. The evaluation of the speciating mercury sorbent trap demonstrated that the trap is capable of providing reasonably accurate total mercury concentrations and speciation data that are somewhat comparable to data obtained with the OH method. 5 refs., 4 figs., 8 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4831-4839","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 100100417","10.1021/ef900294s","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21261838","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21261838","","Energy and Fuels","10","23"

"Mercury control challenge for industrial boiler MACT affected facilities","","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; MERCURY; COAL; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; BOILERS; SORBENT INJECTION PROCESSES; FLUE GAS; REMOVAL","An industrial coal-fired boiler facility conducted a test program to evaluate the effectiveness of sorbent injection on mercury removal ahead of a fabric filter with an inlet flue gas temperature of 375{sup o}F. The results of the sorbent injection testing are essentially inconclusive relative to providing the facility with enough data upon which to base the design and implementation of permanent sorbent injection system(s). The mercury removal performance of the sorbents was significantly less than expected. The data suggests that 50 percent mercury removal across a baghouse with flue gas temperatures at or above 375{sup o}F and containing moderate levels of SO{sub 3} may be very difficult to achieve with activated carbon sorbent injection alone. The challenge many coal-fired industrial facilities may face is the implementation of additional measures beyond sorbent injection to achieve high levels of mercury removal that will likely be required by the upcoming new Industrial Boiler MACT rule. To counter the negative effects of high flue gas temperature on mercury removal with sorbents, it may be necessary to retrofit additional boiler heat transfer surface or spray cooling of the flue gas upstream of the baghouse. Furthermore, to counter the negative effect of moderate or high SO{sub 3} levels in the flue gas on mercury removal, it may be necessary to also inject sorbents, such as trona or hydrated lime, to reduce the SO{sub 3} concentrations in the flue gas. 2 refs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-5","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 091200134","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21240332","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21240332","","EM","",""
"Proposal of a novel multifunctional energy system for cogeneration of coke, hydrogen, and power - article no. 052001","Jin, H G; Sun, S; Han, W; Gao, L","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 08 HYDROGEN; HYDROGEN PRODUCTION; COKE; ELECTRIC POWER; COAL; COAL GAS; POWER GENERATION; COMBINED-CYCLE POWER PLANTS; COKE OVENS; SEPARATION PROCESSES; THERMAL EFFICIENCY; EXERGY","This paper proposes a novel multifunctional energy system (MES), which cogenerates coke, hydrogen, and power, through the use of coal and coke oven gas (COG). In this system, a new type of coke oven, firing coal instead of COG as heating resource for coking, is adopted. The COG rich in H{sub 2} is sent to a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to separate about 80% of hydrogen first, and then the PSA purge gas is fed to a combined cycle as fuel. The new system combines the chemical processes and power generation system, along with the integration of chemical conversion and thermal energy utilization. In this manner, both the chemical energy of fuel and thermal energy can be used more effectively. With the same inputs of fuel and the same output of coking heat, the new system can produce about 65% more hydrogen than that of individual systems. As a result, the thermal efficiency of the new system is about 70%, and the exergy efficiency is about 66%. Compared with individual systems, the primary energy saving ratio can reach as high as 12.5%. Based on the graphical exergy analyses, we disclose that the integration of synthetic utilization of COG and coal plays a significant role in decreasing the exergy destruction of the MES system. The promising results obtained may lead to a clean coal technology that will utilize COG and coal more efficiently and economically.","","","","","","United States","2009-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 52001","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 090900092","10.1115/1.3078791","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21212679","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21212679","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","5","131"

Because oxidized mercury is readily captured by the wet FGD scrubber, and coal-fired power plants equipped with wet scrubbers desire to benefit from the partial mercury control that these systems provide, some mercury is likely to be bound in with the FGD gypsum and wallboard. In this study, the feasibility of identifying mercury species in the FGD gypsum and wallboard samples was investigated using a large sample size thermal desorption method and samples from power plants in Pennsylvania. Potential candidates of pure mercury standards including mercuric chloride, mercurous chloride, mercury oxide, mercury sulfide, and mercuric sulfate were analyzed to compare their results with those obtained from FGD gypsum and dry wallboard samples. Although any of the thermal evolutionary curves obtained from these pure mercury standards did not exactly match with those of the FGD gypsum and wallboard samples, it was identified that Hg{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} and HgCl{sub 2} could be candidates. An additional chlorine analysis from the gypsum and wallboard samples indicated that the chlorine concentrations were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the mercury concentrations, suggesting possible chlorine association with mercury. 21 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 972-979","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 091100108","10.3155/1047-3289.59.8.972","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","21233573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21233573","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","59"

In this work, three iron aluminum alloys were exposed to simulated coal combustion environments at 500 and 700{sup o}C for short (100 h) and long (5000 h) isothermal durations. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the corrosion products. All alloys exhibited excellent corrosion resistance during short term exposures. For longer test times, increasing the aluminum concentration improved alloy corrosion resistance. The addition of chromium to the binary iron aluminum alloy prevented the formation iron sulfide and resulted in slower corrosion kinetics. A general classification of the scales developed on these alloys is presented.","","","","","","United States","2009-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oxidation of Metals; Journal Volume: 72; Journal Issue: 1/2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-86","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0030-770X; OXMEAF; TRN: 090900124","10.1007/s11085-009-9148-z","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21212701","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21212701","","Oxidation of Metals","1/2","72"

A new technology promises to get used there, but at a price. This is a mixture of chemical approaches, including activated carbon injection into the gases coming off the combustor along with injection of trona or calcium carbonate to reduce sulfur trioxide in the exhaust gases. The trick according to Babcock and Wilcox's manager Sam Kumar, to 'capture the mercury as a particulate on the carbon and then capture the particulate' in an electrostatic precipitator or a fabric filter baghouse. 2 figs.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 153; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 52,54","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 091000051","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21222265","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21222265","","Power (New York)","7","153"

Two sulfur-chlorine compounds, sulfur dichloride (SCl{sub 2}) and sulfur monochloride (S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2}), were investigated as oxidants for Hg{sup 0} by gas-phase reaction and by surface-involved reactions in the presence of flyash or activated carbon. The gas-phase reaction between Hg{sup 0} and SCl{sub 2} is shown to be more rapid than the gas-phase reaction with chlorine, and the second order rate constant was 9.1({+-}0.5) x 10{sup -18} mL-molecules{sup -1}.s{sup -1} at 373 K. The presence of flyash or powdered activated carbon in flue gas can substantially accelerate the reaction. The predicted Hg{sup 0} removal is about 90% with 5 ppm SCl {sub 2} or S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} and 40 g/m{sup 3} of flyash in flue gas. The combination of activated carbon and sulfur-chlorine compounds is an effective alternative. We estimate that co-injection of 3-5 ppm of SCl{sub 2} (or S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2}) with 2-3 Lb/MMacf of untreated Darco-KB is comparable in efficiency to the injection of 2-3 Lb/MMacf Darco-Hg-LH. Extrapolation of kinetic results also indicates that 90% of Hg{sup 0} can be removed if 3 Lb/MMacf of Darco-KB pretreated with 3% of SCl{sub 2} or S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} is used. Mercuric sulfide was identified as one of the principal products of the Hg{sup 0}/SCl{sub 2} or Hg{sup 0}/S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} reactions. Additionally, about 8% of SCl{sub 2} or S{sub 2}Cl{sub 2} in aqueous solutions is converted to sulfide ions, which would precipitate mercuric ion from FGD solution. 14 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 14","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5410-5415","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 091000058","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21222272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21222272","","Environmental Science and Technology","14","43"

This investigation was designed to highlight the potential for corrosion risks associated with once-through units and advanced cycles. The research took the form of a detailed literature investigation to evaluate chlorine in solid fuels: coals of various ranks and origins, biomass fuels of a variety of types, petroleum cokes, and blends of the above. The investigation focused upon an extensive literature review of documents dating back to 1991. The focus is strictly corrosion and deposition. To address the deposition and corrosion issues, this review evaluates the following considerations: concentrations of chlorine in available solid fuels including various coals and biomass fuels, forms of chlorine in those fuels, and reactions - including reactivities - of chlorine in such fuels. The assessment includes consideration of alkali metals and alkali earth elements as they react with, and to, the chlorine and other elements (e.g., sulfur) in the fuel and in the gaseous products of combustion. The assessment also includes other factors of combustion: for example, combustion conditions including excess O{sub 2} and combustion temperatures. It also considers analyses conducted at all levels: theoretical calculations, bench scale laboratory data and experiments, pilot plant experiments, and full scale plant experience. Case studies and plant surveys form a significant consideration in this review. The result of this investigation focuses upon the concentrations of chlorine acceptable in coals burned exclusively, in coals burned with biomass, and in biomass cofired with coal. Values are posited based upon type of fuel and combustion technology. Values are also posited based upon both first principles and field experience. 86 refs., 8 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3379-3391","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 091100581","10.1021/ef801024s","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21233877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21233877","","Energy and Fuels","7","23"

Often this is an area where plant personnel can find 'low hanging fruit' with great return on investment, especially high energy valve leakage. This type of leakage leads to increased heat rate, potential valve damage and lost generation. The fundamental question to ask is 'What is 100 Btu/kW-hr of heat rate worth to your plant? On a 600 MW coal-fired power plant, a 1% leakage can lead to an 81 Btu/kW-hr impact on the main steam cycle and a 64 Btu/kW-hr impact on the hot reheat cycle.

This article summarises the successful removal of mercury emissions achieved with activated carbon injection and boiler bromide addition, technologies nearing commercial readiness, as well as several novel control concepts currently under development. It also discusses some of the issues standing in the way of confident performance and cost predictions. In testing conducted on western coal-fired units with fabric filters or TOXECON to date, ACI has generally achieved mercury removal rates &gt; 90%. At units with ESPs, similar performance requires brominated ACI. Alternatively, units firing western coals can use boiler bromide addition to increase flue gas mercury oxidation and downstream capture in a wet scrubber, or to enhance mercury removal by ACI. At eastern bituminous fired units with ESPs, ACI is not as effective, largely due to SO{sub 3} resulting from the high sulfur content of the coal or the use of SO{sub 3} flue gas conditioning to improve ESP performance. 7 refs., 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5-9","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 091200189","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21240382","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21240382","","EM","",""

The authors estimate that upcoming federal and state regulations will result in tripling the annual US demand for activated carbon to nearly 1.5 billion lb from approximately 450 million lb. Rapid expansion of US production capacity is required. Many PAC manufacturers are discussing expansion of their existing production capabilities. One company, ADA Carbon Solutions, is in the process of constructing the largest activated carbon facility in North America to meet the future demand for PAC as a sorbent for mercury control. Emission control technology development and commercialization is driven by regulation and legislation. Although ACI will not achieve &gt; 90% mercury control at every plant, the expected required MACT legislation level, it offers promise as a low-cost primary mercury control technology option for many configurations and an important trim technology for others. ACI has emerged as the clear mercury-specific control option of choice, representing over 98% of the commercial mercury control system orders to date. As state regulations are implemented and the potential for a federal rule becomes more imminent, suppliers are continuing to develop technologies to improve the cost effectiveness and limit the balance of plant impacts associated with ACI and are developing additional PAC production capabilities to ensure that the industry's needs are met. The commercialisation of ACI is a clear example of industry, through the dedication of many individuals and companies with support from the DOE and EPRI, meeting the challenge of developing cost-effectively reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants. 7 refs., 1 fig.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 10-14","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 091200190","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21240383","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21240383","","EM","",""

To explore these patterns in a lotic environment, we transplanted Corbicula fluminea from a reference stream to a stream receiving CFPP discharge. We assessed trace element accumulation and glutathione concentration in clam tissue, shell growth, and condition index at five sites along a contamination gradient. Clams at the most upstream and contaminated site had the highest growth rate, condition index, glutathione concentrations, and concentrations of arsenic (7.85 {+-} 0.25 {mu} g/g (dry mass)), selenium (17.75 {+-} 0.80 {mu} g/g), and cadmium (7.28 {+-} 0.34 {mu} g/g).

There are three options for capturing CO{sub 2} from point sources: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. Several processes are available to capture CO{sub 2}, and new or improved processes are under development. However, CO{sub 2} capture is the most expensive part of CCS, typically accounting for 75% of overall cost. CCS will benefit significantly from the development of a lower cost post-combustion CO{sub 2} capture process that can be retrofitted to existing power plants. Once captured, the CO{sub 2} is compressed to about 150 atm and pipelined at supercritical conditions to a suitable storage site. Oil and gas reservoirs, because they have assured seals and are well characterized, are promising early opportunity sites. Saline formations are much more extensive and have a huge potential storage capacity, but are much less characterized. Several commercial and a number of pilot CCS projects are underway around the world.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 123-138","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0735-2689; TRN: 090700228","10.1080/07352680902776440","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21187139","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21187139","","Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences","3","28"

Temperature, pressure, and flow measurements and gas analysis data are used to perform heat transfer analysis in the boiler furnace and evaporator. Power boiler efficiency is calculated using an indirect method. The on-line calculation of the exit flue gas temperature in a combustion chamber allows for an on-line heat flow rate determination, which is transferred to the boiler evaporator. Based on the energy balance for the boiler evaporator, the superheated steam mass flow rate is calculated taking into the account water flow rate in attemperators. Comparing the calculated and the measured superheated steam mass flow rate, the effectiveness of the combustion chamber water walls is determined in an on-line mode. Soot-blower sequencing can be optimized based on actual cleaning requirements rather than on fixed time cycles contributing to lowering of the medium usage in soot blowers and increasing of the water-wall lifetime.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Transfer Engineering; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 10/11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 903-911","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0145-7632; HTEND2; TRN: 090600244","10.1080/01457630902754175","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176910","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176910","","Heat Transfer Engineering","10/11","30"

Therefore, the oxidation behaviour of a number of martensitic 9-12%Cr steels in a model gas mixture containing 70% CO{sub 2}-30% H{sub 2}O was studied in the temperature range 550-700{sup o}C. The results were compared with the behaviour in air, Ar-CO{sub 2} and Ar-H{sub 2}O. It was found that in the CO{sub 2}- and/or H{sub 2}O-rich gases, the mentioned steels tended to form iron-rich oxide scales with significantly higher growth rates than the Cr-rich surface scales formed during air exposure. The iron-rich scales were formed as a result of a decreased flux of chromium in the bulk alloy toward the surface because of enhanced internal oxidation of chromium in the H{sub 2}O-containing gases and carbide formation in the CO{sub 2}-rich gases. Additionally, the presence of water vapour in the exposure atmosphere led to buckling of the outer haematite layer, apparently as a result of compressive oxide growth stresses. The Fe-base oxide scales formed in CO{sub 2}(-H{sub 2}O)-rich gases appeared to be permeable to CO{sub 2} molecules resulting in substantial carburization of the steel.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials at High Temperatures; Journal Volume: 26; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 63-72","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-3409; MHTEEM; TRN: 090800286","10.3184/096034009X438185","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21197972","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21197972","","Materials at High Temperatures","1","26"

Turkey has 9th order in lignite reserve, 8th order in lignite production, and 12th order in total coal (hard coal and lignite) consumption. While hard coal production meets only 13% of its consumption, lignite production meets lignite consumption in Turkey. Sixty-five percent of produced hard coal and 78% of produced lignite are used for electricity generation. Lignites are generally used for electricity generation due to their low quality. As of 2003, total installed capacity of Turkey was 35,587 MW, 19% (6,774 MW) of which is produced from coal-based thermal power plants.

During July-September 2006, an intensive study was undertaken to discern the degree of local source influence. Source-receptor relationships were explored by establishing a set of wet deposition sites in and around Steubenville, Ohio. For the three month period of study, volume-weighted mean Hg concentrations observed at the eight sites ranged from 10.2 to 22.3 ng L{sup -1}, but this range increased drastically on an event basis with a maximum concentration of 89.4 ng L{sup -1} and a minimum concentration of 4.1 ng L{sup -1}. A subset of events was explored in depth, and the degree of variability in Hg concentrations between sites was linked to the degree of local source enhancement. Samples collected at sites less than 1 km from coal-fired utility stacks (near-field) exhibited up to 72% enhancement in Hg concentrations over regionally representative samples on an event basis. Air mass transport and precipitating cell histories were traced in order to evaluate relationships between local point sources and receptor sites. It was found that the interaction of several dynamic atmospheric parameters combined to favor local Hg concentration enhancement over the more regional contribution. When significant meteorological factors (wind speed at time of maximum rain rate, wind speed 24 h prior to precipitation, mixing height, and observed ceiling) were explored, it was estimated that during summertime precipitation, 42% of Hg concentration in near-field samples could be attributed to the adjacent coal-fired utility source. 28 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 13","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4946-4953","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090900213","10.1021/es803214h","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21212762","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21212762","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","43"

A methodology to calculate Cr evaporation rates from chromia scales was developed and combined with Cr diffusion calculations within the alloy (with a constant flux of Cr leaving the alloy from evaporation) to predict Cr concentration profiles and to predict the time until breakaway oxidation. At the highest temperatures and pressures, the time until breakaway oxidation was quite short for the turbine blade, and of concern within the steam pipe and the higher temperature portions of the superheater tube. Alloy additions such as Ti may allow for a reduction in evaporation rate with time, mitigating the deleterious effects of chromia evaporation.","","","","","","United States","2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 156; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) C292-C297","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-4651; JESOAN; TRN: 091000128","10.1149/1.3155442","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21222338","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21222338","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","9","156"

This paper reviews the likely flexibility of power plants with postcombustion capture, with a focus on an improved characterization of the dynamic performance of power plants with CO{sub 2} capture. The literature has focused on design and optimization for steady state operation of power plants with capture, often at a single design point. When dynamic behavior is considered, it is possible that designs should be altered for best overall plant performance. Economic trade-offs between improving transport and storage scheme flexibility and constraining power plant operations should also be carefully analyzed, particularly if the captured CO{sub 2} is to be used in another process such as enhanced oil recovery. Another important aspect of real plant operation will be adhering to legislative requirements. Further work is required to identify mechanisms that allow flexible operation without undermining any targets set for storing CO{sub 2} and/or restricting global CO{sub 2} emissions.","","","","","","United States","2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering (New York); Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 449-458","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9372; JOEEDU; TRN: 090800051","10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000007","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21197792","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21197792","","Journal of Environmental Engineering (New York)","6","135"

The model simulates load growth, resource planning, and economic dispatch of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (ISO), Inc., Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and PJM under a ban on new coal generation and uses an economic dispatch model to calculate the resulting changes in dispatch order, CO{sub 2} emissions, and fuel use under three near-term (until 2030) future electric power sector scenarios. A national ban on new coal-fired power plants does not lead to CO{sub 2} reductions of the scale required under proposed federal legislation such as Lieberman-Warner but would greatly increase the fraction of time when natural gas sets the price of electricity, even with aggressive wind and demand response policies. 50 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3995-4001","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 091000055","10.1021/es801729r","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21222269","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21222269","","Environmental Science and Technology","11","43"

Specifically, the levels of acid gases and mercury vapor were estimated for the monoethanolamine (MEA)-based absorption process on the basis of published performance parameters of existing systems. Among the flue gas constituents considered, sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) is known to have the most adverse impact on MEA absorption. When a flue gas contains 3000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) SO{sub 2} and a wet flue gas desulfurization system achieves its 95% removal, approximately 2400 parts per million by weight (ppmw) SO{sub 2} could be included in the separated CO{sub 2} stream. In addition, the estimated concentration level was reduced to as low as 135 ppmw for the SO{sub 2} of less than 10 ppmv in the flue gas entering the MEA unit. Furthermore, heat-stable salt formation could further reduce the SO{sub 2} concentration below 40 ppmw in the separated CO{sub 2} stream. In this study, it is realized that the formation rates of heat-stable salts in MEA solution are not readily available in the literature and are critical to estimating the levels and compositions of flue gas impurities in sequestered CO{sub 2} streams. In addition to SO{sub 2}, mercury, and other impurities in separated CO{sub 2} streams could vary depending on pollutant removal at the power plants and impose potential impacts on groundwater. Such a variation and related process control in the upstream management of carbon separation have implications for groundwater protection at carbon sequestration sites and warrant necessary considerations in overall sequestration planning, engineering, and management. 63 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 725-732","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 091100061","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21233529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21233529","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","59"

This study evaluated the suitability of the magnetic composites as sorbents for the removal of elemental mercury vapor from flue gases of coal-fired power plants. The sorbents were found to completely capture mercury at temperatures up to 200{sup o}C, and the mercury capacity of the sorbents was found to be affected by the state, content, and size of the silver particles in the composite. Cumulative or extended thermal treatments at 400{sup o}C were found to improve the mercury capture capacity, allowing the sorbent to be regenerated and recycled multiple times without performance degradation. The magnetic sorbent was readily separated from fly ash by magnetic separation, leaving the fly ash essentially free of sorbent contamination. In initial in-plant tests, the sorbents were able to capture mercury from the flue gases of an operational, full-scale, coal-fired power plant. The combination of mercury capacity, ease of separation and regeneration, and recyclability makes these multifunctional magnetic composites excellent candidate sorbents for the control of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. 35 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3266-3271","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090700109","10.1021/es803306n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21187033","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21187033","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","43"

In 2005, the US EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), setting performance standards for new coal-fired power plants and nominally capping mercury emissions form new and existing plants at 38 tons per year from 2010 to 2017 and 15 tpy in 2018 and thereafter; these down from 48.5 tpy in 1999. To implement the CAMR, 21 states with non-zero emissions adopted EPA's new source performance standards and cap and trade program with little or no modification. By December 2007, 23 other states had proposed or adopted more stringent requirements; 16 states prohibited or restricted interstate trading of mercury emissions. On February 2008, the US Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously vacated the CAMR. This article assesses the status of mercury emission control requirements for coal-fired power plants in the US in light of this decision, focusing on state actions and prospects for a new federal rule. 34 refs., 1 fig.","","","","","","United States","2009-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2669-2673","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090700032","10.1021/es802649u","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21186962","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21186962","","Environmental Science and Technology","8","43"

To develop a cost-effective approach to mercury capture in a full-scale coal-fired utility boiler burning PRB coal, experiments were conducted adding hydrogen bromide (HBr) or simultaneously adding HBr and selected fly ashes in a slipstream reactor (0.152 x 0.152 m) under real flue gas conditions. The residence time of the flue gas inside the reactor was about 1.4 s. The average temperature of the slipstream reactor was controlled at about 155{sup o}C. Tests were organized into two phases. In Phase 1, only HBr was added to the slipstream reactor, and in Phase 2, HBr and selected fly ash were added simultaneously. HBr injection was effective (&gt;90%) for mercury oxidation at a low temperature (155{sup o}C) with an HBr addition concentration of about 4 ppm in the flue gas. Additionally, injected HBr enhanced mercury capture by PRB fly ash in the low-temperature range. The mercury capture efficiency, at testing conditions of the slipstream reactor, reached about 50% at an HBr injection concentration of 4 ppm in the flue gas. Compared to only the addition of HBr, simultaneously adding bituminous-derived fly ash in a minimum amount (30 lb/MMacf), together with HBr injection at 4 ppm, could increase mercury capture efficiency by 30%. Injection of lignite-derived fly ash at 30 lb/MMacf could achieve even higher mercury removal efficiency (an additional 35% mercury capture efficiency compared to HBR addition alone). 25 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2812-2817","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090700033","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21186963","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21186963","","Environmental Science and Technology","8","43"

The bench-scale experimental system has been operated with the conditions of a residence time of 0.75 s and a gas temperature of 140{sup o}C to simulate typical conditions in the duct of coal-fired exhaust gas. In addition, sorbent deposition on walls which can occur in a laboratory-scale system more than in a full-scale system was significantly reduced so that additional mercury capture by the deposited sorbent was minimized. In the entrained-flow system, CuCl{sub 2}-ACs demonstrated similar performance in Hg adsorption and better performance in Hg{sup 0} oxidation than Darco Hg-LH. In addition, the carbon content of those sorbents was found to determine their Hg adsorption capability in the entrained-flow system.

We find it likely that Hg emissions will increase in the future. The range of 2050 global Hg emissions is projected to be 2390-4860 Mg, compared to 2006 levels of 2480 Mg, reflecting a change of -4% to +96%. The main driving force for increased emissions is the expansion of coal-fired electricity generation in the developing world, particularly Asia. Our ability to arrest the growth in Hg emissions is limited by the relatively low Hg removal efficiency of the current generation of emission control technologies for coal-fired power plants (flue-gas desulfurization). Large-scale deployment of advanced Hg sorbent technologies, such as activated carbon injection, offers the promise of lowering the 2050 emissions range to 1670-3480 Mg, but these technologies are not yet in commercial use. The share of elemental Hg in total emissions will decline from today's levels of about 65% to about 50-55% by 2050, while the share of divalent Hg will increase. This signals a shift from long-range transport of elemental Hg to local deposition of Hg compounds though emissions of both species could increase under the worst case. 33 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2983-2988","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090700487","10.1021/es802474j","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21187211","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21187211","","Environmental Science and Technology","8","43"

These different models are used in combination to test model limitations. These data were 24-hr average mass concentrations and compositions obtained for samples taken every third day from 2001 to 2003. The Multilinear Engine (ME) was used to solve an expanded model to estimate the source profiles and source contributions and also to investigate the wind speed, wind direction, time-of-day, weekend/weekday, and seasonal effects. PMF2 was applied to the same dataset. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF) analyses were used to locate the regional and local sources using the resolved source contributions and appropriate meteorological data. Very little difference was observed between the results of the expanded model and the PMF2 values for the profiles and source contribution time series. The identified sources were as ferrous smelter, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, soil/combustion mixture, steel mill, traffic, wood smoke, and coal burning. The CPF analysis was useful in helping to identify local sources, whereas the PSCF results were only useful for regional source areas. Both of these analyses were more useful than the wind directional factor derived from the expanded factor analysis. However, the expanded analysis provided direct information on seasonality and day-of-week behavior of the sources. 28 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 321-331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 090600266","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176927","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176927","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","3","59"

In addition to its contribution to the enhancement of reliable indigenous resources, the introduction of renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power systems reduces the emission of GHGs and air pollutants by substituting a part of the carbon- and pollutant-intensive power with power generated by methods that are cleaner and less carbon-intensive. To evaluate the reduction potentials, consequential changes in the operation of different types of existing power plants have to be taken into account. In this study, a linear mathematical programming model is constructed to simulate a power mix for a given power demand in a power market sharing a cost-minimization objective. By applying the model, the emission reduction potentials of capacity extension case studies, including the enhancement of PV and wind power introduction at different scales, were assessed. In particular, the consequences of power mix changes in carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates were discussed. Seasonally varying power demand levels, solar irradiation, and wind strength were taken into account. In this study, we have found that the synergetic reduction of carbon dioxide emission induced by PV and wind power introduction occurs under a certain level of additional installed capacity. Investigation of a greater variety of case studies on scenario development with emerging power sources becomes possible by applying the model developed in this study. 15 refs., 8 figs., 11 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 360-372","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 090600267","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176928","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176928","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","3","59"

Subnational efforts to cut emissions will inform policy development nationally and globally. We projected GHG mitigation strategies for Minnesota, which has adopted a strategic goal of 80% emissions reduction by 2050. A portfolio of conservation strategies, including electricity conservation, increased vehicle fleet fuel efficiency, and reduced vehicle miles traveled, is likely the most cost-effective option for Minnesota and could reduce emissions by 18% below 2005 levels. An 80% GHG reduction would require complete decarbonization of the electricity and transportation sectors, combined with carbon capture and sequestration at power plants, or deep cuts in other relatively more intransigent GHG-emitting sectors. In order to achieve ambitious GHG reduction goals, policymakers should promote aggressive conservation efforts, which would probably have negative net costs, while phasing in alternative fuels to replace coal and motor gasoline over the long-term. 31 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: schm2105@umn.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1696-1703","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090600128","10.1021/es801171a","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176817","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176817","","Environmental Science and Technology","6","43"

Toward that end, much research has been ongoing seeking to develop new processes for reducing coal combustion mercury emissions. Among air pollution control processes that can be applied to coal-fired boilers, electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are by far the most common, both on a global scale and among the principal countries of India, China, and the U.S. that burn coal for electric power generation. A previously reported theoretical model of in-flight mercury capture within ESPs is herein evaluated against data from a number of full-scale tests of activated carbon injection for mercury emissions control. By using the established particle size distribution of the activated carbon and actual or estimated values of its equilibrium mercury adsorption capacity, the incremental reduction in mercury concentration across each ESP can be predicted and compared to experimental results. Because the model does not incorporate kinetics associated with gas-phase mercury transformation or surface adsorption, the model predictions represent the mass-transfer-limited performance. Comparing field data to model results reveals many facilities performing at or near the predicted mass-transfer-limited maximum, particularly at low rates of sorbent injection. Where agreement is poor between field data and model predictions, additional chemical or physical phenomena may be responsible for reducing mercury removal efficiencies. 26 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: clack@iit.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1460-1466","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090600087","10.1021/es8015183","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176782","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","43"

Recent studies have shown that carcinogens and other contaminants in piles of waste ash from coal-fired power plants can leach into water supplies at concentrations exceeding drinking water standards. Last year an ash dam broke at the 55-year old power plant in Kingston, TN, destroying homes and rising doubts about clean coal. Despite the huge amounts of ash generated in the USA (131 mtons per year) no federal regulations control the fate of ash from coal-fired plants. 56% of this is not used in products such as concrete. The EPA has found proof of water contamination from many operating ash sites which are wet impoundments, ponds or reservoirs of some sort. Several member of Congress have show support for new ash-handling requirements and an inventory of waste sites.

Recent studies suggest that coal combustion has become an important source of Pb in aerosols in urban and remote areas. Lead concentration and isotopic composition is reported for 59 coal samples representing major coal deposits worldwide in an attempt to characterize this potential source. The average concentration in these coals is 35 {mu}g Pb g{sup -1}, with the highest values in coals from Spain and Peru and the lowest in coals from Australia and North America. The {sup 206}Pb/{sup 207}Pb isotope ratios range between 1.15 and 1.24, with less radiogenic Pb in coals from Europe and Asia compared to South and North America. Comparing the Pb isotopic signatures of coals from this and previous studies with those published for Northern and Southern Hemisphere aerosols, we hypothesize that coal combustion might now be an important Pb source in China, the eastern U.S., and to some extent, in Europe but not as yet in other regions including South Africa, South America, and western U.S. This supports the notion that 'old Pb pollution' from leaded gasoline reemitted into the atmosphere or long-range transport (i.e., from China to the western U.S.) is important. Comparing the isotope ratios of the coals, the age of the deposits, and Pb isotope evolution models for the major geochemical reservoirs suggests that the lead isotope ratios (PbIC) in coals is strongly influenced by the depositional coal forming environment. 47 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2009-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: mercedes@incar.csic.es","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1078-1085","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090400105","10.1021/es801818r","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","21150582","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21150582","","Environmental Science and Technology","4","43"

This mismatch leads to decreased boiler efficiency and increased emissions. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of a fossil power plant wind box was performed. The model solved the three-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-epsilon turbulence model. The CFD results were validated by the experimental data taken from a 1/8th scale model of a wall-fired fossil unit. Simulations under various mass flow rates specified at inlet, various baffle positions and two opening conditions of the burners were obtained to identify the optimum design in terms of the equalization of the secondary airflow through the burners. This study demonstrated that the combination of experimental and CFD approach can be an effective tool in the research of burner secondary airflow balancing.","","","","","","United States","2009-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Mathematical Modelling; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1126-1140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0307-904X; AMMODL; TRN: 090200253","10.1016/j.apm.2008.01.007","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126119","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126119","","Applied Mathematical Modelling","2","33"

The dominating albeit somewhat optimistic public perception is that hundreds of years worth of coal available for power generation will offset the decline of oil and gas reserves. Although use of coal accounts for half of U.S. electricity generation and for a quarter of world energy consumption, it has been perceived until recently as unwelcomed by environmentalists and legislators. For coal power generation to be properly considered, CO2 and other greenhouse gas (GHG) generation and deposition must be addressed to assuage global climate change concerns. Capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions is one of the principal modes of carbon management. Herein we will suggest a novel process that includes capturing GHG in abundant materials, which can be facilitated by controlled sequential heating and cooling of these solids. By taking advantage of the properties of waste materials generated during coal production and the exhaust heat generated by the power plants, such an approach permits the integration of the entire CO2 cycle, from generation to deposition. Coupling coal extraction/preparation with power generation facilities would improve the economics of “zero-emission” power plants due to the proximity of all the involved facilities.","American Chemical Society, Washington, DC","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2009-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science & Technology; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: 561-564","","DOE/NETL-TPR-2198","DE-AC26-04NT41817","Journal ID: ISSN: 0013-936X; eISSN: 1520-5851; TRN: US200904%%500","10.1021/es801730v","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","947192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/947192","","Environmental Science & Technology","3","23"

Measurements and simulations were performed in a duct and an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). A four-hole cobra probe was used for the measurement of velocity distribution. The flow simulation was performed by using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT. Numerical calculations for the air flow were carried out by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the realizable k-{epsilon} turbulence model equations. Simulations were performed with two different velocity profiles at the inlet boundary - one with a uniform (ideal) velocity profile and the other with a non-uniform (real) velocity profile to demonstrate the effect of velocity inlet boundary condition on the flow simulation results inside an ESP. The real velocity profile was obtained from the velocity measured at different points of the inlet boundary whereas the ideal velocity profile was obtained by calculating the mean value of the measured data. Simulation with the real velocity profile at the inlet boundary was found to predict better the velocity distribution inside the ESP suggesting that an experimentally measured velocity profile could be used as velocity inlet boundary condition for an accurate numerical simulation of the ESP.

Va. The program was focused on both the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst capability to oxide mercury as well as the scrubber's capability to capture and retain the oxidized mercury. This article focuses on the SCR catalyst performance aspects. The Mount Storm site consists of three units totaling approximately 1,660 MW. All units are equipped with SCR systems for NOx control. A full-scale test to evaluate the effect of the SCR was performed on Unit 2, a 550 MWT-fired boiler firing a medium sulfur bituminous coal. This test program demonstrated that the presence of an SCR catalyst can significantly affect the mercury speciation profile. Observation showed that in the absence of an SCR catalyst, the extent of oxidation of element a mercury at the inlet of the flue gas desulfurization system was about 64%. The presence of a Cornertech SCR catalyst improved this oxidation to levels greater than 95% almost all of which was captured by the downstream wet FGD system.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) emission inventory is used in the 36- (East Asia), 12- (East China), and 4-km (greater Beijing area) domains. Furthermore, we develop a local Beijing emission inventory that is used in the 4-km domain. We also construct a corroborated mapping of chemical species between the TRACE-P inventory and the Carbon Bond IV (CB-IV) chemical mechanism before the integrated modeling system is applied to study ozone (O{sub 3}) and particulate matter (PM) in Beijing. Meteorological data for the integrated modeling runs are extracted from MM5. Model results show O{sub 3} hourly concentrations in the range of 80-159 parts per billion (ppb) during summer in the urban areas and up to 189 ppb downwind of the city. High fine PM (PM2.5) concentrations (monthly average of 75 {mu}g.m{sup -3} in summer and 150 {mu}g.m{sup -3} in winter) are simulated over the metropolitan and down-wind areas with significant secondary constituents. Major sources of particulates were biomass burning, coal combustion and industry. A comparison against available O{sub 3} and PM measurement data in Beijing is described. We recommend refinements to the developed local Beijing emission inventory to improve the simulation of Beijing's air quality. The 4-km modeling configuration is also recommended for the development of air pollution control strategies. 31 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-44","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 090900322","10.3155/1047-3289.59.1.37","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","21212853","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21212853","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","1","59"
"Estimation of uncertainty bounds for the future performance of a power plant","Odgaard, P F; Stoustrup, J","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; FORECASTING; PERFORMANCE; COAL; SIMULATION; OPERATION; STATISTICS","Prediction of the future performance of large-scale power plants can be very relevant for the operators of these plants, as the predictions can indicate possible problems or failures due to current operating conditions and/or future possible operating conditions. A problem in predicting the future performance of these plants is that available models of the plants are uncertain. In this brief, three schemes for predicting uncertain dynamical systems are presented. The schemes estimate upper and lower bounds on the system performance. Two of the schemes are statistically based, one only based on recent data and the other is based on operating points as well. The third proposed scheme uses dynamical models of the prediction uncertainties. The proposed schemes are subsequently applied to experimental data from a coal-fired power plant. Two sets of data from an actual power plant are used, one containing normal plant operation and in the second set, coal is accumulating in the coal mill due to an unbalance in the operating conditions. These tests showed that Schemes II and III did bound the real system performance, while Scheme I failed doing so. In addition, the plant was simulated operating under the same conditions with additional large disturbances. These simulations were used to investigate the robustness and conservatism of the proposed schemes. In this test, Schemes I and II failed, while Scheme III succeeded.","","","","","","United States","2009-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 199-206","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-6536; IETTE2; TRN: 090300125","10.1109/TCST.2008.922576","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21149575","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21149575","","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","1","17"

Such differences can yield changes in the temperature, pressure, and corrosive species that are experienced by critical components in the hot gas path, with important implications in the design, operation, and reliability of the turbine. A new data structure and computational methodology is presented for the numerical simulation of a turbine thermodynamic cycle for various fuel types. The approach used allows efficient handling of turbine components and different variable constraints due to fuel changes. Examples are presented for a turbine with four stages. The vanes and blades were considered to be cooled in an open circuit, with air provided from the appropriate compressor stages. A constraint was placed on the maximum metal temperature and values were calculated for the fuel flow rates, airflow ratios, and coolant flow rates for cases where the turbine was fired with natural gas, NG, or syngas, SG. One NG case was conducted to assess the effect of coolant pressure matching between the compressor extraction points and corresponding turbine injection points. It was found that pressure matching is a feature that must be considered for high combustion temperatures. The first series of SG simulations was conducted using the same inlet mass flow and pressure ratios as those for the NG case. The results showed that higher coolant flow rates and a larger number of cooled turbine rows were needed for the SG case to comply with imposed temperature constraint. Thus, for this first case, the turbine size would be different for SG than for NG. In order to maintain the original turbine configuration (i.e., geometry, diameters, blade heights, angles, and cooling circuit characteristics) for the SG simulations, a second series of simulations was carried out in which the inlet mass flow was varied while keeping constant the pressure ratios and the amount of hot gas passing the first vane of the turbine. The effects of turbine matching between the NG and SG cases were increases for the SG case of approximately 7 and 13 % for total cooling flows and cooling flows for the first vane, respectively. In particular, for the SG case, the vane in the last stage of the turbine experienced inner wall temperatures that approached the maximum allowable limit.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The model is applied to the continental United States to investigate the subgrid-scale effects associated with Hg emissions from large elevated point sources on atmospheric Hg concentrations and deposition. The top thirty Hg-emitting power plants in the U.S. were selected for explicit plume-in-grid treatment. Two new processes are included in the Hg chemical mechanism: the gas-phase adsorption of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) on atmospheric particulate matter and the reduction of RGM to elemental Hg by sulfur dioxide. The plume-in-grid treatment results in improved performance for Hg wet deposition over a purely Eulerian grid-based model, partial correction of overpredictions of wet deposition downwind of coal-fired power plants in the northeastern U.S., and decreases of approximately 10% in simulated dry and wet deposition over large parts of the eastern U.S., with larger decreases near the plants selected for plume-in-grid treatment. On average, 23% of ambient RGM is modeled to adsorb on atmospheric particulate matter.","","","","","","United States","2008-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; Journal Volume: 113","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24305","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; JGREA2; TRN: 090300134","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21149584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21149584","","Journal of Geophysical Research","","113"

NOx is an ozone (O{sub 3}) precursor, NOx and SO{sub 2} are precursors to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and PM2.5 impairs visibility, contributing to regional haze. Thus, reductions in these emissions are important to achieving the 8-hr O{sub 3} and PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and for improving visibility. With the vacatur of CAIR, the reductions States counted on in the near-term (2009-2011) are in jeopardy. Ultimately, Congress will hopefully enact stringent multipollutant legislation targeting EGUs. However, in the meantime, to protect public health from deadly air pollution, states will need to step in to fill the gap and act quickly to restrict air pollutant emissions from EGUs. 1 ref.","","","","","","United States","2008-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-19","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 091100075","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21233543","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21233543","","EM","",""

Member jurisdictions include Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Manitoba, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Observer jurisdictions - those who are participating in the program design, but will decide later whether to be full members-include Indiana, Ohio, Ontario, and South Dakota. To date, the advisory group has proposed target ranges for GHG emissions reductions of 15-25% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 60-80% by 2050.

California's mandatory GHG reporting regulation is the first rule adopted as a requirement of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, passed by the California Legislature as Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32; Nunez, Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006) and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in September 2006. The regulation is the first of its kind in the United States to require facilities to report annual GHG emissions. In general, all facilities subject to reporting are required to report their on-site stationary source combustion emissions of CO{sub 2}, nitrous oxide (N{sub 2}O), and methane (CH{sub 4}). Some industrial sectors, such as cement producers and oil refineries, also must report their process emissions, which occur from chemical or other noncombustion activities. Fugitive emissions from facilities are required to be reported when specified in the regulation. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF{sub 6}) and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) use is prevalent in electricity facilities and must be reported. CO{sub 2} emissions from biomass-derived fuels must be separately identified during reporting, and reporters must also provide their consumption of purchased or acquired electricity and thermal energy; these requirements will assist facilities in evaluating changes in their fossil fuel carbon footprints. 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 17-20","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 090600271","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176932","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176932","","EM","",""

We also determined PCDD/Fs in surface agricultural soils from several provinces in China for comparison with soils from e-waste facilities. Concentrations of total PCDD/Fs were high in all of the matrices analyzed and ranged from 30.9 to 11,400 pg/g for shredder waste, 3460 to 9820 pg/g dry weight for leaves, 2560 to 148,000 pg/g dry weight for workshop-floor dust, and 854 to 10200 pg/g dry weight for soils. We also analyzed surface soils from a chemical industrial complex (a coke-oven plant, a coal-fired power plant, and a chlor-alkali plant) in Shanghai. Concentrations of total PCDD/Fs in surface soil from the chemical industrial complex were lower than the concentrations found in soils from e-waste recycling plants, but higher than the concentrations found in agricultural soils. Agricultural soils from six cities in China contained low levels of total PCDD/Fs. Profiles of dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs) of 2,3,7,8-PCDD/Fs in soils from e-waste facilities in Taizhou differed from the profiles found in agricultural soils. The estimated daily intakes of TEQs of PCDD/Fs via soil/dust ingestion and dermal exposure were 2 orders of magnitude higher in people at e-waste recycling facilities than in people at the chemical industrial site, implying greater health risk for humans from dioxin exposures at e-waste recycling facilities. The calculated TEQ exposures for e-waste workers from dust and soil ingestion alone were 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than the exposures from soils in reference locations. 37 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: kkannan@wadsworth.org","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8252-8259","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090200213","10.1021/es8017573","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126089","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126089","","Environmental Science and Technology","22","42"

Using state and country level data, net emissions of mercury from the marginal use of fluorescent lightbulbs are examined for a base year of 2004 for each of the 50 United States and 130 countries. Combustion of coal for electric power generation is generally the largest source of atmospheric mercury pollution; reduction in electricity demand from the substitution of incandescent bulbs with fluorescents leads to reduced mercury emissions during the use of the bulb. This analysis considers the local mix of power sources, coal quality, thermal conversion efficiencies, distribution losses, and any mercury control technologies that might be in place. Emissions of mercury from production and end-of-life treatment of the bulbs are also considered, providing a life-cycle perspective. Net reductions in mercury over the entire life cycle range from -1.2 to 97 mg per bulb depending on the country. The consequences for atmospheric mercury emissions of several policy scenarios are also discussed. 46 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: julie.zimmerman@yale.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8564-8570","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 090200217","10.1021/es800117h","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126093","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126093","","Environmental Science and Technology","22","42"

Four kinds of sorbents were used in this study. Darco Hg-LH (lignite-based) served as a benchmark sorbent with which Hg control capability of other sorbents could be compared. Also, Darco-FGD (lignite-based) was used as a representative raw activated carbon sorbent. Two different copper chloride-impregnated sorbents were developed in the laboratory and tested in the entrained-flow system to examine the possibility of using these sorbents at coal-fired power plants.

Because the time horizon of such a distant projection is beyond that of EIs used in typical modeling studies, it is necessary to identify a practical approach that allows the emission projections to account for emission controls and climatic and energy-use changes. However, a technical challenge arises because this requires integration of various different types of information with which emissions from human activities are associated. The method developed here is based on data availability, spatiotemporal coverage and resolution, and future-scenario consistency (i.e., Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1B), and consists of two major steps: (1) near-future EI projection (to the year 2020), and (2) longer-term EI projection (to mid-century). For the United States, the year-2050 emissions for nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), PM2.5, anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia are projected to change by 55, 55, 30, 40, and 20%, respectively, compared with 2001. NOx and SO{sub 2} Emission changes are very similar in total amount but different in sectoral contribution. The projected emission trends for Canada and Mexico differ considerably. After taking into account the modeled climate changes, biogenic VOC emission increases from three countries overwhelm the decreases in anthropogenic VOC emissions, leading to a net small increase (2%) in overall VOC emissions. 16 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: parnar@nescaum.org","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1483-1494","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 090200059","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21125953","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21125953","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","11","58"

Did more stringent environmental policy motivate electric power plants to switch to less polluting fuels? Or, did greater use of PRB coal occur because relative price changes altered input markets in favor of this fuel. A key finding is that factors other than environmental policy such as the decline in railroad freight rates together with elastic demand by power plants were major contributors to the increased utilization of this fuel.","","","","","","United States","2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Journal of Agricultural Economics; Journal Volume: 90; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 933-950","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-9092; AJAEBA; TRN: 090100037","10.1111/j.1467-8276.2008.01147.x","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21116251","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21116251","","American Journal of Agricultural Economics","4","90"

An example of this is Boryeong Unit 3's outstanding achievement of 3,000 days of trouble-free operation. The Complex also has a dozen 150 MW combined cycle units burning imported liquefied natural gas for electrical system peaking. 4 photos.","","","","","","United States","2008-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34,36-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 081200434","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21107730","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21107730","","Power (New York)","10","152"

Dissolved arsenic in runoff from upland forest ecosystems is one of the ecotoxicological risks resulting from power plant emissions. Maxima in As concentrations in runoff from four forest catchments have increased 2-5 times between 1995 and 2006, and approach the drinking water limit (10 {mu}g L{sup -1}). To assess the fate of anthropogenic As, we constructed input/output mass balances for three polluted and one relatively unpolluted forest catchment in the Czech Republic, and evaluated the pool size of soil As. The observation period was 11 years, and the sites spanned a 6-fold As pollution gradient. Two of the polluted sites exhibit large net As export via runoff solutes (mean of 4-5 g As ha{sup -1} yr{sup -1} for the 11-year period; up to 28 g As ha{sup -1} yr{sup -1} in 2005). This contrasts with previous studies which concluded that forest catchments are a net sink for atmogenic arsenic both at times of increasing and decreasing pollution. The amount of exported As is not correlated with the total As soil pool size, which is over 78% geogenic in origin, but correlates closely with water fluxes via runoff. Net arsenic release is caused by an interplay of hydrological conditions and retreating acidification which may mobilize arsenic by competitive ligand exchange. The effects of droughts and other aspects of climate change on subsequent As release from soil were not investigated. Between-site comparisons indicate that most pollutant As may be released from humus. 24 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: lucie.erbanova@geology.cz","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7187-7192","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 081200451","10.1021/es800467j","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21107747","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21107747","","Environmental Science and Technology","19","42"

The facility matches the gas temperature and velocity of modern first stage high pressure turbine vanes while accelerating the deposition process. Particle size was found to have a significant effect on capture efficiency with larger particles causing significant thermal barrier coating (TBC) spallation during a 4 h accelerated test. In the second series of tests, particle deposition rate was found to decrease with decreasing gas temperature. The threshold gas temperature for deposition was approximately 960{sup o}C. In the third and fourth test series, impingement cooling was applied to the back side of the target coupon to simulate internal vane cooling. Capture efficiency was reduced with increasing mass flow of coolant air; however, at low levels of cooling, the deposits attached more tenaciously to the TBC layer. Postexposure analyses of the third test series (scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy) show decreasing TBC damage with increased cooling levels.","","","","","","United States","2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51503","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080900446","10.1115/1.2903901","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073803","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","5","130"

Partial gasification adopts cascade conversion of the composition of coal. Active composition of coal is simply gasified, while inactive composition, that is char, is burnt in a boiler. Oxy-fuel combustion of syngas produces only CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O, so the CO{sub 2} can be separated through cooling the working fluid. This decreases the amount of energy consumption to separate CO{sub 2} compared with conventional methods. The novel system integrates the above two key technologies by injecting steam from a steam turbine into the combustion chamber of a gas turbine to combine the Rankine cycle with the Brayton cycle. The thermal efficiency of this system will be higher based on the cascade utilization of energy level. Compared with the conventional integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), the compressor of the gas turbine, heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and gasifier are substituted for a pump, reheater, and partial gasifier, so the system is simplified. Furthermore, the novel system is investigated by means of energy-utilization diagram methodology and provides a simple analysis of their economic and environmental performance. As a result, the thermal efficiency of this system may be expected to be 45%, with CO{sub 2} recovery of 41.2%, which is 1.5-3.5% higher than that of an IGCC system. At the same time, the total investment cost of the new system is about 16% lower than that of an IGCC. The comparison between the partial gasification technology and the IGCC technology is based on the two representative cases to identify the specific feature of the proposed system.","","","","","","United States","2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51801","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080900447","10.1115/1.2938273","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073804","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073804","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","5","130"

Silver nanoparticles were engineered on zeolite through ion-exchange of sodium ions with silver ions, followed by thermal annealing. Mercury sorption test using AgMC was performed at various temperatures by exposing it to either pulse injection of mercury or continuous mercury flow. A complete capture of mercury by AgMC was achieved up to a capture temperature of 250{sup o}C. Nano silver particles were shown to be the main active component for mercury capture by amalgamation mechanism. Compared with activated carbon-based sorbents, the sorbent prepared in this study showed a much higher mercury capture capacity and upper temperature limit for mercury capture. More importantly, the mercury captured by the spent AgMC could be easily released for safe disposal and the sorbent regenerated by simple heating at 400{sup o}C. Mercury capture tests performed in real flue gas environment showed a much higher level of mercury capture by AgMC than by other potential mercury sorbents tested. In our mercury capture tests, the AgMC exposed to real flue gases showed an increased mercury capture efficiency than the fresh AgMC. 38 refs., 6 figs.","","","","","","United States","2008-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: zhenghe.xu@ualberta.ca","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6205-6210","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 081200274","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21107579","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21107579","","Environmental Science and Technology","16","42"

It is indirect combustion by the use of an oxygen carrier, which can be used for CO{sub 2} capture in power-generating processes. The possibility of CLC using a calcium-based oxygen carrier is investigated in this paper. In the air reactor air is supplied to oxidize CaS to CaSO{sub 4}, where oxygen is transferred from air to the oxygen carrier; the reduction of CaSO{sub 4} to CaS takes place in the fuel reactor. The exit gas from the fuel reactor is CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O. After condensation of water, almost pure CO{sub 2} could be obtained. The thermodynamic and kinetic problem of the reduction reactions of CaSO{sub 4} with CO and H{sub 2} and the oxidization reactions of CaS with O{sub 2} is discussed in the paper to investigate the technique possibility. To prevent SO{sub 2} release from the process of chemical looping combustion using a calcium-based oxygen carrier, thermochemical CaSO{sub 4} reduction and CaS oxidation are discussed. Thermal simulation experiments are carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The properties of the products are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and the optimal reaction parameters are evaluated. The effects of reaction temperature, reductive gas mixture, and oxygen partial pressure on the composition of flue gas are discussed. The suitable temperature of the air reactor is between 1050 and 1150 C and the optimal temperature of the fuel reactor between 900 and 950 C.

The goal of this article is to explore possible bottlenecks in applying both the EIA and SEA procedures on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities in the Netherlands, as experience is currently minimal or lacking. In this study we focus mainly on the institutional and procedural aspects of the screening and scoping phases of both procedures. This is achieved by reviewing EIA and SEA procedures for analogue projects for the three distinctive process steps of a CCS project, namely the power plant with capture, the transport and finally the underground storage of the CO{sub 2}. Additionally, EIA and SEA or similar procedures on CCS in other countries are reviewed and the legal framework for the Dutch EIA and SEA is studied. This article shows a concise overview of the EIA and SEA procedure in the Netherlands and the relation between both procedures. Based on our findings we have constructed a conceptual taxonomy for the scope of both procedures for CCS in the Netherlands. This taxonomy conceptualizes the possible integration of assessing the environmental impacts for tiered levels of decision making. This integration might be needed for first CCS projects as decisions on the strategic (spatial planning) level are currently absent for CCS in the Netherlands. Perpendicular to such integration is the integration of linked activities in the CCS chain and their alternatives, into one procedure. We argue that it would be beneficial to combine the separate EIA procedures for CCS activities into one procedure or at least provide close linkage between them.","","","","","","United States","2008-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 392-414","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; EIARDK; TRN: 081000027","10.1016/j.eiar.2007.08.003","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21084874","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21084874","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","6","28"

We compared two data sets that report power-plant CO{sub 2} emissions in the conterminous U.S. for 2004, the most recent year reported in both data sets. The data sets were obtained from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the Environmental Protection Agency's eGRID database. Conterminous U.S. total emissions computed from the data sets differed by 3.5% for total plant emissions (electricity plus useful thermal output) and 2.3% for electricity generation only. These differences are well within previous estimates of uncertainty in annual U.S. fossil-fuel emissions. However, the corresponding average absolute differences between estimates of emissions from individual power plants were much larger, 16.9% and 25.3%, respectively. By statistical analysis, we identified several potential sources of differences between EIA and eGRID estimates for individual plants. Estimates that are based partly or entirely on monitoring of stack gases (reported by eGRID only) differed significantly from estimates based on fuel consumption (as reported by EIA). Differences in accounting methods appear to explain differences in estimates for emissions from electricity generation from combined heat and power plants, and for total and electricity generation emissions from plants that burn nonconventional fuels (e.g., biomass). Our analysis suggests the need for care in utilizing emissions data from individual power plants, and the need for transparency in documenting the accounting and monitoring methods used to estimate emissions. 19 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: kackerman@usgs.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5688-5693","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 081100069","10.1021/es800221q","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21095739","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21095739","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","42"
"Development and performance of Cu-based oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion","Chuang, S Y; Dennis, J S; Hayhurst, A N; Scott, S A","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CARBON DIOXIDE; CARBON MONOXIDE; COPPER OXIDES; COPRECIPITATION; COMBUSTION; SOLUTIONS; CARRIERS; FLUIDIZED BEDS; OXIDATION; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; PH VALUE; SOLID FUELS; THERMAL STRESSES; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; FLUE GAS; SEPARATION PROCESSES; SAND; NITROGEN; AIR","Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) has the inherent property of separating the product CO{sub 2} from flue gases. Instead of air, it uses an oxygen carrier, usually in the form of a metal oxide, to provide oxygen for combustion. This paper focuses on the development and performance of a suitable Cu-based oxygen carrier for burning solid fuels using CLC. Carriers were made from CuO and Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} (as a support) in three different ways: mechanical mixing, wet impregnation, and co-precipitation. The reactivity of these solids was assessed by measuring their ability to oxidize CO, when in a hot bed of sand fluidized by a mixture of CO and N{sub 2}. After that, the Cu in the carrier was oxidized back to CuO by fluidizing the hot bed with air. These oxygen carriers were tested over many such cycles of reduction and oxidation. This work confirms that supporting CuO on Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} enhances the ability of the resulting particles to withstand mechanical and thermal stresses in a fluidized bed. Also, only co-precipitation produces particles that have a high loading of copper and do not agglomerate at 800-900 C. The performance of co-precipitated particles of CuO/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} at oxidizing CO to CO{sub 2} was significantly affected by the pH of the solution in which precipitation occurred: a high pH (9.7) gave particles that reacted completely and rapidly. After 18 cycles, such a co-precipitated carrier with 82.5 wt% CuO yielded all its oxygen when oxidizing CO. X-ray analysis showed that when heated, CuO reacted with Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} to form CuAl{sub 2}O{sub 4}, which was fully reducible, so CuO experienced no loss in extent of reaction after forming this mixed oxide. An increase in operating temperature from 800 to 900 C led to the CuO providing slightly less oxygen; this was because a little of the CuO decomposed to Cu{sub 2}O between its reduction and oxidation, when the bed was fluidized by pure N{sub 2}.

Gasification of these coals was simulated in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) application and associated preliminary economics compared. A simple method of coal characterization was developed for simulation purposes. The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of the coal was represented by a three component vapor solid system of carbon, methane, and water, the composition of which was derived from proximate analysis data on fixed carbon and volatile matter, and the gross calorific value, both on a dry, ash free basis. The gasification process was modeled using Gibb's free energy minimization. Data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Shell Gasifier base cases using Illinios No. 6 coal was used to verify both the gasifier and the IGCC flowsheet models. The H:C and O:C ratios of the NZ coals were adjusted until the simulated gasifier output composition and temperature matched the values with the base case. The IGCC power output and other key operating variables such as gas turbine inlet and exhaust temperatures were kept constant for study of comparative economics. The results indicated that 16% more lignite than sub-bituminous coal was required. This translated into the requirement of a larger gasifier and air separation unit, but smaller gas and steam turbines were required. The gasifier was the largest sole contributor (30%) to the estimated capital cost of the IGCC plant. The overall cost differential associated with the processing of lignite versus processing sub-bituminous coal was estimated to be of the order of NZ $0.8/tonne. 13 refs., 9 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: b.young@auckland.ac.nz","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2687-2692","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 081000129","10.1021/ef700704n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21084951","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21084951","","Energy and Fuels","4","22"
"Development of silica/vanadia/titania catalysts for removal of elemental mercury from coal-combustion flue gas","Li, Ying; Murphy, Patrick D; Wu, Chang-Yu; Powers, Kevin W; Bonzongo, Jean-Claude J","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; REMOVAL; MERCURY; FLUE GAS; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; CATALYSTS; VANADIUM OXIDES; TITANIUM OXIDES; SILICON OXIDES; OXIDATION; SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION","SiO{sub 2}/V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} catalysts were synthesized for removing elemental mercury (Hg{sup 0}) from simulated coal-combustion flue gas. Experiments were carried out in fixed-bed reactors using both pellet and powder catalysts. In contrast to the SiO{sub 2}-TiO{sub 2} composites developed in previous studies, the V{sub 2}O{sub 5} based catalysts do not need ultraviolet light activation and have higher Hg{sup 0} oxidation efficiencies. For Hg{sup 0} removal by SiO{sub 2}-V{sub 2}O{sub 5} catalysts, the optimal V{sub 2}O{sub 5} loading was found between 5 and 8%, which may correspond to a maximum coverage of polymeric vanadates on the catalyst surface. Hg{sup 0} oxidation follows an Eley-Rideal mechanism where HCl, NO, and NO{sub 2} are first adsorbed on the V{sub 2}O{sub 5} active sites and then react with gas-phase Hg{sup 0}. HCl, NO, and NO{sub 2} promote Hg oxidation, while SO{sub 2} has an insignificant effect and water vapor inhibits Hg{sup 0} oxidation. The SiO{sub 2}-TiO{sub 2}-V{sub 2}O{sub 5} catalysts exhibit greater Hg{sup 0} oxidation efficiencies than SiO{sub 2}-V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, may be because the V-O-Ti bonds are more active than the V-O-Si bonds. This superior oxidation capability is advantageous to power plants equipped with wet-scrubbers where oxidized Hg can be easily captured. The findings in this work revealed the importance of optimizing the composition and microstructures of SCR (selective catalytic reduction) catalysts for Hg{sup 0} oxidation in coal-combustion flue gas. 33 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: cywu@ufl.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5304-5309","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 081000237","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21085059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21085059","","Environmental Science and Technology","14","42"

A carbonation/calcination system is composed essentially of two reactors (an absorber and a regenerator) with Ca-based sorbent circulating between the two reactors (assumed here as fluidized beds). CO{sub 2} is, therefore, transferred from the absorber to the regenerator. Because of the endothermicity of the calcination reaction, a certain amount of coal is burned with pure oxygen in the regenerator. Detailed mass balance, heat balance and cost of electricity and CO{sub 2} mitigation for the carbonation/calcination cycles with three Ca-based sorbents in dual fluidized beds were calculated and analyzed to study the effect of the Ca-based sorbent activity decay on CO{sub 2} capture from flue gas. The three sorbents considered were: limestone, dolomite and CaO/Ca{sub 12}Al{sub 14}O{sub 33} (75/25 wt %) sorbent. All results, including the amount of coal and oxygen required, are presented with respect to the difference in calcium oxide conversion between the absorber and the regenerator, which is an important design parameter. Finally, costs of electricity and CO{sub 2} mitigation costs using carbonation/calcination cycles for the three sorbents were estimated. The results indicate that the economics of the carbonation/calcination process compare favorably with competing technologies for capturing CO{sub 2}.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1912-1925","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-1541; AICEAC; TRN: 080900396","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073757","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073757","","AIChE Journal","7","54"
"Full operating range robust hybrid control of a coal-fired boiler/turbine unit - article no. 041011","Zheng, K; Bentsman, J; Taft, C W","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; BOILERS; TURBINES; CONTROL SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE","Multi-input-multi-output robust controllers recently designed for the megawatt output/throttle pressure control in a coal-fired power plant boiler/turbine unit have demonstrated performance robustness noticeably superior to that of the currently employed nonlinear PID-based controller. These controllers, however, have been designed only for the range of 150-185 MW around the 185 MW nominal operating point, exhibiting a significant loss of performance in the lower range of 120-150 MW. Through system identification, the reason for this performance loss is demonstrated in the current work to be a pronounced dependence of the boiler/turbine unit steady state gains on the operating point. This problem is addressed via a hybrid control law consisting of two robust controllers and a robust switch between them activated by the set point change. The controllers are designed to cover the corresponding half-ranges of the full operating range. This permits attainment of the desired overall performance as well as reduction of modeling uncertainty induced by the operating point change to approximately 25% of that associated with the previous designs. Robust switching is accomplished through a novel hybrid mode of behavior-robustly controlled discrete transition.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement and Control; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 41011","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-0434; TRN: 080900432","10.1115/1.2907367","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073790","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073790","","Journal of Dynamic Systems Measurement and Control","4","130"

In addition, global climate change concerns may dictate the generation of a CO{sub 2} product stream for end-use or sequestration, with potential impacts on the oxidizer used in the gas turbine. In this study the operation at atmospheric pressure of a small, optically accessible swirl-stabilized premixed combustor, burning fuels ranging from pure methane to conventional and H{sub 2}-rich and H{sub 2}-lean syngas mixtures is investigated. Both air and CO{sub 2}-diluted oxygen are used as oxidizers. CO and NOx emissions for these flames have been determined from the lean blowout limit to slightly rich conditions {phi} about 1.03). In practice, CO{sub 2}-diluted oxygen systems will likely be operated close to stoichiometric conditions to minimize oxygen consumption while achieving acceptable NOx performance. The presence of hydrogen in the syngas fuel mixtures results in more compact, higher temperature flames, resulting in increased flame stability and higher NOx emissions. Consistent with previous experience, the stoichiometry of lean blowout decreases with increasing H{sub 2} content in the syngas. Similarly, the lean stoichiometry at which CO emissions become significant decreases with increasing H{sub 2} content. For the mixtures investigated, CO emissions near the stoichiometric point do not become significant until {phi} &gt; 0.95. At this stoichiometric limit, CO emissions rise more rapidly for combustion in O{sub 2}-CO{sub 2} mixtures than for combustion in air.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 180; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 64-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-2202; CBSTB9; TRN: 080300308","10.1080/00102200701487061","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004700","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004700","","Combustion Science and Technology","1","180"

Lignite extraction is expected to increase as the government feels pressure to close down unprofitable hard coal mines that are geologically difficult, increasing the cost of extraction.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources Part B: Economics, Planning and Policy; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 13-25","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1556-7257; TRN: 080900149","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073607","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073607","","Energy Sources Part B: Economics, Planning and Policy","1","3"
"Efficiency dilution: long-term exergy conversion trends in Japan","Williams, Eric; Warr, Benjamin; Ayres, Robert U","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; EXERGY; JAPAN; POWER GENERATION; EFFICIENCY; HISTORICAL ASPECTS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; FOSSIL FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER; TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; SMELTING; STEELS; SPACE HEATING; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS","This analysis characterizes century-scale trends in exergy efficiency in Japan. Exergy efficiency captures the degree to which energy inputs (such as coal) are converted into useful work (such as electricity or power to move a vehicle). This approach enables the estimation of net efficiencies which aggregate different technologies. Sectors specifically analyzed are electricity generation, transport, steel production, and residential space heating. One result is that the aggregate exergy efficiency of the Japanese economy declined slightly over the last half of the 20th century, reaching a high of around 38% in the late 1970s and falling to around 33% by 1998. The explanation for this is that while individual technologies improved dramatically over the century, less exergy-efficient ones were progressively adopted, yielding a net stabilization or decline. In the electricity sector, for instance, adoption of hydropower was followed by fossil-fired plants and then by nuclear power, each technology being successively less efficient from an exergy perspective. The underlying dynamic of this trend is analogous to declining ore grades in the mining sector. Increasing demand for exergy services requires expended utilization of resources from which it is more difficult to extract utility (e.g., falling water versus coal). We term this phenomenon efficiency dilution. 30 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 13; Other Information: ericwilliams@asu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4964-4970","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080900395","10.1021/es0716756","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073756","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073756","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","42"

This paper shows that firms have extensively modified capital equipment in the Nitrogen Oxides Budget Trading Program, which covers power plants in the eastern United States. The empirical strategy uses geographic and temporal features of the program to estimate counterfactual emissions, finding that modifications have reduced emission rates by approximately 10-15 percent. The modifications would not have occurred under command-and-control regulation and have reduced regulatory costs.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 153-176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574; ENJODN; TRN: 080900412","10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol29-No3-8","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","21073770","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073770","","Energy Journal","3","29"

It utilizes a multiple-criteria linear programming to incorporate cost and environmental objectives into the planning. To treat the uncertainties embedded in definition of model parameters, the concept of decision-maker degree of optimism will be used. Optimization of the model provides different planning scenarios. To determine the best compromise plan, a post-optimization assessment based on fuzzy set theory concepts is developed. The proposed methodology is employed for a medium-term capacity planning in Canada's electricity generation sector. The results approve a major capacity growth for natural gas facilities accompanied by retirement of most coal-burning facilities.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources Part B: Economics, Planning and Policy; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 259-279","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1556-7257; TRN: 080900416","10.1080/15567240701231958","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","21073774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073774","","Energy Sources Part B: Economics, Planning and Policy","3","3"

To overcome these problems, a single-riser no-distributor-fluidized-bed heat exchanger is devised and studied. Fouling and cleaning tests are performed for a uniquely designed fluidized bed-type heat exchanger to demonstrate the effect of particles on the fouling reduction and heat transfer enhancement. The tested heat exchanger model (1 m high and 54 mm internal diameter) is a gas-to-water type and composed of a main vertical tube and four auxiliary tubes through which particles circulate and transfer heat. Through the present study, the fouling on the heat transfer surface could successfully be simulated by controlling air-to-fuel ratios rather than introducing particles through an external feeder, which produced soft deposit layers with 1 to 1.5 mm thickness on the inside pipe wall. Flue gas temperature at the inlet of heat exchanger was maintained at 450{sup o}C at the gas volume rate of 0.738 to 0.768 CMM (0.0123 to 0.0128 m{sup 3}/sec). From the analyses of the measured data, heat transfer performances of the heat exchanger before and after fouling and with and without particles were evaluated. Results showed that soft deposits were easily removed by introducing glass bead particles, and also heat transfer performance increased two times by the particle circulation. In addition, it was found that this type of heat exchanger had high potential to recover heat of waste gases from furnaces, boilers, and incinerators effectively and to reduce fouling related problems.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Transfer Engineering; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 822-829","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0145-7632; HTEND2; TRN: 080900422","10.1080/01457630802053884","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073780","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073780","","Heat Transfer Engineering","9","29"

The net energy content in Ocimum canum was found to be slightly higher than that in Tridax procumbens. In spite of having higher ash contents, the barks from both the plant species exhibited higher calorific values. The results have shown that approximately 650 and 1,270 hectares of land are required to generate 20,000 kWh/day electricity from Ocimum canum and Tridax procumbens biomass species. Coal samples, obtained from six different local mines, were also examined for their qualities, and the results were compared with those of studied biomass materials. This comparison reveals much higher power output with negligible emission of suspended particulate matters (SPM) from biomass materials.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 765-773","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1556-7036; TRN: 080500393","10.1080/15567030701436206","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21017357","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21017357","","Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects","8","30"

Generators with the price-setting technology will face less risk to their profit margins than those with costs that are not correlated with price, even if those costs are not volatile. Emissions permit prices may respond to relative fuel prices, further increasing volatility. This paper simulates the impact of this on generators' profits, comparing an emissions trading scheme and a carbon tax against predictions for the UK in 2020. The carbon tax reduces the volatility faced by nuclear generators, but raises that faced by fossil fuel stations. Optimal portfolios would contain a higher proportion of nuclear plant if a carbon tax was adopted.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-89","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574; ENJODN; TRN: 080900411","10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol29-No3-4","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","21073769","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073769","","Energy Journal","3","29"

The global average temperature is already approximately 0.8{sup o}C above its preindustrial level, and present atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases will contribute to further warming of 0.5-1{sup o}C as equilibrium is re-established. Warming has been and will be greater in mid and high latitudes compared with low latitudes, over land compared with oceans, and at night compared with day. As emissions continue to increase, both warming and the commitment to future warming are presently increasing at a rate of approximately 0.2{sup o}C per decade, with projections that the rate of warming will further increase if emission controls are not put in place. Such warming and the associated changes are likely to result in severe impacts on key societal and environmental support systems. Present estimates are that limiting the increase in global average surface temperature to no more than 2-2.5{sup o}C above its 1750 value of approximately 15{sup o}C will be required to avoid the most catastrophic, but certainly not all, consequences of climate change. Accomplishing this will require reducing emissions sharply by 2050 and to near zero by 2100. This can only be achieved if: (1) developed nations move rapidly to demonstrate that a modem society can function without reliance on technologies that release carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) and other non-CO{sub 2} greenhouse gases to the atmosphere; and (2) if developing nations act in the near-term to sharply limit their non-CO{sub 2} emissions while minimizing growth in CO{sub 2} emissions, and then in the long-term join with the developed nations to reduce all emissions as cost-effective technologies are developed. 183 refs., 13 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 735-786","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 081000143","10.3155/1047-3289.58.6.735","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","21084965","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21084965","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","58"

This study focuses on the synergy between H{sub 2} separation membrane reactors (HSMRs) and syngas cooling with radiant and convective heat exchanges; such 'syngas coolers' invariably boost system efficiency over that obtained with quench-cooled gasification. Conventional H{sub 2} separation requires a relatively high steam-to-carbon ratio (SIC) to achieve a high level of H{sub 2} production, and thus is well matched to relatively inefficient quench cooling. In contrast, HSMRs shift the WGS equilibrium by continuously extracting reaction product H{sub 2}, thereby allowing a much lower SIC ratio and consequently a higher degree of heat recovery and (potentially) system efficiency. We first present a parametric analysis illuminating the interaction between the syngas coolers, high temperature WGS reactor and HSMR. We then compare the performance and cost of six different plant configurations, highlighting (1) the relative merits of the two syngas cooling methods in membrane-based systems, and (2) the comparative performance of conventional versus HSMR-based H{sub 2} separation in, plants with syngas coolers.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 31401","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080800073","10.1115/1.2795763","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21058959","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21058959","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","130"

The LSI is a novel ultralow emission dry-low NOx combustion method that has been developed for gas turbines operating on natural gas. It is being developed for fuel-flexible turbines burning a variety of hydrocarbon fuels, biomass gases, and refinery gases. The adaptation of the LSI to accept H{sub 2} flames is guided by an analytical expression derived from the flow field characteristics and the turbulent flame speed correlation. The evaluation of the operating regimes of nine LSI configurations for H{sub 2} shows an optimum swirl number of 0.51, which is slightly lower than the swirl number of 0.54 for the hydrocarbon LSI. Using particle image velocimetry (PIV), the flow fields of 32 premixed H{sub 2}-air and H{sub 2}-N{sub 2}-air flames were measured. The turbulent flame speeds deduced from PIV show a linear correlation with turbulence intensity. The correlation constant for H{sub 2} is 3.1 and is higher than the 2.14 value for hydrocarbons. The analysis of velocity profiles confirms that the near field flow features of the H{sub 2} flames are self-similar. These results demonstrate that the basic LSI mechanism is not affected by the differences in the properties of H{sub 2} and hydrocarbon flames and support the feasibility of the LSI concept for hydrogen fueled gas turbines.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 31503","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080800075","10.1115/1.2836480","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21058961","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21058961","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","130"

There has been extensive research on this theme, though our ability to predict the impact of environmental variables on service life is still constrained because early research had focused on environments that were not always representative of condensates formed in service. More recent research has yielded insight into the evolution of damage from pits and has provided more detailed long crack growth rates, but the growth of cracks in the short crack regime is largely undetermined. For coal-fired plants, the advent of two-shifting (switching on- and off-load on a daily basis) will lead to a reduction in remnant life due to transients in stress and environment. Since the number of cycles is small, the impact of load cycling is predicted to be modest. However, there may be an effect of the transient exposure to oxygen off-load on the subsequent crack growth rate on-load, and this also needs to be accounted for in life assessment.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 64; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 420-438","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: 080800138","10.5006/1.3278482","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","21059024","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21059024","","Corrosion (Houston)","5","64"
"Emission projections for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Section 812 Second Prospective Clean Air Act cost/benefit analysis","Wilson, Jr, James H; Mullen, Maureen A; Bollman, Andrew D","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; USA; CLEAN AIR ACTS; COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS; EMISSION; FORECASTING; US EPA; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; NITROGEN OXIDES; SULFUR DIOXIDE; POWER GENERATION; ELECTRIC POWER; IMPLEMENTATION; DATA ANALYSIS; AIR QUALITY; AMENDMENTS; VOLATILE MATTER; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; COAL; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; PRICES; SUBBITUMINOUS COAL; VEHICLES; PARTICULATES","This paper describes the analysis, methods, and results of the recently completed emission projections. There are several unique features of this analysis. One is the use of consistent economic assumptions from the Department of Energy's Annual Energy Outlook 2005 (AEO 2005) projections as the basis for estimating 2010 and 2020 emissions for all sectors. Another is the analysis of the different emissions paths for both with and without CAAA scenarios. Other features of this analysis include being the first EPA analysis that uses the 2002 National Emission Inventory files as the basis for making 48-state emission projections, incorporating control factor files from the Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs) that had completed emission projections at the time the analysis was performed, and modeling the emission benefits of the expected adoption of measures to meet the 8-hr ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the Clean Air Visibility Rule, and the PM2.5 NAAQS. This analysis shows that the 1990 CAAA have produced significant reductions in criteria pollutant emissions since 1990 and that these emission reductions are expected to continue through 2020. CAAA provisions have reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by approximately 7 million t/yr by 2000, and are estimated to produce associated VOC emission reductions of 16.7 million t by 2020. Total oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission reductions attributable to the CAAA are 5, 12, and 17 million t in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) emission benefits during the study period are dominated by electricity-generating unit (EGU) SO{sub 2} emission reductions. These EGU emission benefits go from 7.5 million t reduced in 2000 to 15 million t reduced in 2020. 16 refs., 6 figs., 13 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 657-672","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 081000421","10.3155/1047-3289.58.5.657","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","21085150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21085150","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","5","58"
"Improvement of load-following capacity based on the flame radiation intensity signal in a power plant","Wang, Fei; Huang, Qunxing; Liu, Dong; Yan, Jianhua; Cen, Kefa","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; FLAMES; CONTROL SYSTEMS; LOAD MANAGEMENT; BOILERS; THERMAL RADIATION; COAL","The capability to perform fast load changes has been an important issue due to the increasing commercialization of the power market. In the traditional boiler control system, the feedback signals come from the variations of the steam pressure and the steam flow, which leads to a large time delay. Therefore, a new method for the boiler control system based on radiation intensity for improving the load-following capacity of a coal-fired power plant has been developed in this paper. The system is implemented by adding the radiation intensity of the flame to the existing boiler control system as a complement. The radiation intensity obtained by the sensor can directly reflect the input heat in the boiler, with a faster response and higher sensitivity. Field tests on a 300 MW coal-fired power plant reveal that the improved boiler control system increases the load-following capacity. At the same time, the steam pressure variations are smaller as compared with those of the existing control system. 14 refs., 19 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: wangfei@zju.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1731-1738","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 080900062","10.1021/ef700620n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073532","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073532","","Energy and Fuels","3","22"

The biological reduction of NO to nitrogen gas (N{sub 2}) and regeneration of the absorbent Fe(II)EDTA (EDTA:ethylenediaminetetraacetate) take place under thermophilic conditions (50 {+-} 0.5{sup o}C). The performance of a laboratory-scale biofilter was investigated for treating NOx gas in this study. Shock loading studies were performed to ascertain the response of the biofilter to fluctuations of inlet loading rates (0.48-28.68 g NO m{sup 3} h{sup -1}). A maximum elimination capacity (18.78 g NO m{sup 3} h{sup -1}) was achieved at a loading rate of 28.68 g NO m{sup 3} h{sup -1} and maintained 5 h operation at the steady state. Additionally, the effect of certain gaseous compounds (e.g., O{sub 2} and SO{sub 2}) on the NO removal was also investigated. A mathematical model was developed to describe the system performance. The model has been able to predict experimental results for different inlet NO concentrations. In summary, both theoretical prediction and experimental investigation confirm that biofilter can achieve high removal rate for NO in high inlet concentrations under both steady and transient states. 21 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: w_li@zju.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3814-3820","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080900134","10.1021/es800200g","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073601","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073601","","Environmental Science and Technology","10","42"
"Short run effects of a price on carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. electric generators","Newcomer, Adam; Blumsack, Seth A; Apt, Jay; Lave, Lester B; Morgan, M Granger","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; PRICES; EMISSION; CARBON DIOXIDE; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; USA; ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY; ELECTRIC POWER; ECONOMIC IMPACT; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; COST; POWER DEMAND","The price of delivered electricity will rise if generators have to pay for carbon dioxide emissions through an implicit or explicit mechanism. There are two main effects that a substantial price on CO{sub 2} emissions would have in the short run (before the generation fleet changes significantly). First, consumers would react to increased price by buying less, described by their price elasticity of demand. Second, a price on CO{sub 2} emissions would change the order in which existing generators are economically dispatched, depending on their carbon dioxide emissions and marginal fuel prices. Both the price increase and dispatch changes depend on the mix of generation technologies and fuels in the region available for dispatch, although the consumer response to higher prices is the dominant effect. We estimate that the instantaneous imposition of a price of $35 per metric ton on CO{sub 2} emissions would lead to a 10% reduction in CO{sub 2} emissions in PJM and MISO at a price elasticity of -0.1. Reductions in ERCOT would be about one-third as large. Thus, a price on CO{sub 2} emissions that has been shown in earlier work to stimulate investment in new generation technology also provides significant CO{sub 2} reductions before new technology is deployed at large scale. 39 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: apt@cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3139-3144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080900392","10.1021/es071749d","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073753","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","42"
"The impact of climate policies on the operation of a thermal power plant","Rosnes, Orvika","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; CARBON DIOXIDE; OPERATION; COST; PRICES; EMISSION; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY","Climate policy measures aimed at power markets influence the cost structure of producers and price patterns, and are therefore likely to influence the production decision of power plants, even in the short run. When power plants have costs related to starting and stopping, decisions on short-term production are intertemporal, and the conventional 'price vs. marginal cost' rule is not sufficient to predict production in thermal power plants. This paper analyzes how the optimal production decision is influenced by climate policies: namely, CO{sub 2} trading mechanisms, the expansion of renewables and the interaction between these policies. The main result is that higher power price variation (as a result of increased wind power production) makes the thermal power producer less flexible, but the effect on emissions is ambiguous. A CO{sub 2} cost (as a result of an emission trading system) increases the flexibility of the producer and the operation decision resembles the conventional 'price vs. marginal cost' rule more. This implies lower emissions. However, when the CO{sub 2} price is coupled with higher power price variation, the positive effects may be reversed since the two policies have opposing effects.","","","","","","United States","2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-22","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574; ENJODN; TRN: 090600049","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176744","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176744","","Energy Journal","2","29"

A low sulfur Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coal combustion fly ash was injected into the entrained-flow reactor along with sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen chloride (HCl), and trace Hg{sup 0}. Concentrations of Hg{sup 0} and total mercury (Hg) upstream and downstream of the SCR catalyst were measured using a Hg monitor. The effects of HCl concentration, SCR operating temperature, catalyst space velocity, and feed rate of PRB fly ash on Hg0 oxidation were evaluated. It was observed that HCl provides the source of chlorine for Hg{sup 0} oxidation under simulated PRB coal-fired SCR conditions. The decrease in Hg mass balance closure across the catalyst with decreasing HCl concentration suggests that transient Hg capture on the SCR catalyst occurred during the short test exposure periods and that the outlet speciation observed may not be representative of steady-state operation at longer exposure times. Increasing the space velocity and operating temperature of the SCR led to less Hg{sup 0} oxidized. Introduction of PRB coal fly ash resulted in slightly decreased outlet oxidized mercury (Hg{sup 2+}) as a percentage of total inlet Hg and correspondingly resulted in an incremental increase in Hg capture. The injection of ammonia (NH{sub 3}) for NOx reduction by SCR was found to have a strong effect to decrease Hg oxidation. The observations suggest that Hg{sup 0} oxidation may occur near the exit region of commercial SCR reactors. Passage of flue gas through SCR systems without NH{sub 3} injection, such as during the low-ozone season, may also impact Hg speciation and capture in the flue gas. 18 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: lee.chun-wai@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 484-493","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 080700117","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21049754","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21049754","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","4","58"

Two emission scenarios represent best estimates of 2002 and 2004 emissions; they allow assessment of the impact of the NOx emissions reductions imposed on the utility sector by the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call. The third scenario represents a hypothetical rendering of what NOx emissions would have been in 2002 if no emission controls had been imposed on the utility sector. Examination of the modeled median and 95th percentile daily maximum 8-hr average ozone concentrations reveals that median ozone levels estimated for the 2004 emission scenario were less than those modeled for 2002 in the region most affected by the NOx SIP Call. Comparison of the 'no-control' with the '2002' scenario revealed that ozone concentrations would have been much higher in much of the eastern United States if the utility sector had not implemented NOx emission controls; exceptions occurred in the immediate vicinity of major point sources where increased NO titration tends to lower ozone levels. 13 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 580-588","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 080700120","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21049757","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21049757","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","4","58"

Coal is also readily converted to liquid fuels and/or hydrogen for the transportation industry. However, energy extracted from coal comes at a large environmental price: coal combustion can produce large quantities of ash and CO{sub 2}, as well as other pollutants. Advanced technologies can increase the efficiencies and decrease the emissions associated with burning coal and provide an opportunity for CO{sub 2} capture and sequestration. However, these advanced technologies increase the severity of plant operating conditions and thus require improved materials that can stand up to the harsh operating environments. The materials challenges offered by advanced coal conversion technologies must be solved in order to make burning coal an economically and environmentally sound choice for producing energy.","","","","","","United States","2008-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: MRS Bulletin; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 309-315","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0883-7694; TRN: 080600147","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21036985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21036985","","MRS Bulletin","4","33"

For example, generating electricity from the most abundant fossil fuel, coal, efficiently and with no environmental damage, presents notable challenges to develop higher performance materials. Technologies exist to transform one fossil fuel to other uses, such as coal to a gas or liquid. New materials that increase the efficiency of the transformation and lower its cost would provide valuable flexibility. Materials should be evaluated in terms of their entire life-cycle in order to discern which will make the greatest contribution.

By integrating the methane steam reforming reaction and combustion of coal, the natural gas and coal are utilized synthetically, and coal is burned to provide high-temperature thermal energy to the methane steam reforming reaction. Afterwards, the resulting syngas enters a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to separate about 70% of hydrogen, thereby significantly increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide from nearly 20% to 43% in the PSA tail gas. As a result, the overall efficiency of the new system becomes 63.2%. Compared to a conventional natural gas-based hydrogen plant and a coal-firing steam power plant without CO{sub 2} removal (the overall efficiency of the two systems is 63.0%), the energy penalty for CO{sub 2} removal in the new system is almost totally avoided. Based on the graphical exergy analysis, we propose that the integration of synthetic utilization of fossil fuel (natural gas and coal) and the CO{sub 2} removal process plays a significant role in zero energy penalty for CO{sub 2} removal and its liquefaction in the MES. The result obtained here provides a new approach for CO{sub 2} removal with zero or low thermal efficiency reduction (energy penalty) within an energy system.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 21401","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080800074","10.1115/1.2799532","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21058960","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21058960","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","130"

The technique involves the use of a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier, which transfers oxygen from the combustion air to the fuel, and the avoidance of direct contact between fuel and combustion air. The fuel gas is oxidized by an oxygen carrier, an oxygen-containing compound, in the fuel reactor. The oxygen carrier in this study is NiO. The reduced oxygen carrier, Ni, in the fuel reactor is regenerated by the air in the air reactor. In this way, fuel and air are never mixed, and the fuel oxidation products CO{sub 2} and water vapor leave the system undiluted by air. All that is needed to get an almost pure CO{sub 2} product is to condense the water vapor and to remove the liquid water. When the technique is combined with gas turbine and heat recovery steam generation technology, a new type of combined cycle is formed which gives a possibility of obtaining high net power efficiency and CO{sub 2} separation. The performance of the combined cycle is simulated using the ASPEN software tool in this paper. The influence of the water/coal ratio on the gasification and the influence of the CLC process parameters such as the air reactor temperature, the turbine inlet supplementary firing, and the pressure ratio of the compressor on the system performance are discussed. Results show that, assuming an air reactor temperature of 1200{sup o}C, a gasification temperature of 1100 {sup o}C, and a turbine inlet temperature after supplementary firing of 1350{sup o}C, the system has the potential to achieve a thermal efficiency of 44.4% (low heating value), and the CO{sub 2} emission is 70.1 g/(kW h), 90.1% of the CO{sub 2} captured. 22 refs., 7 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: wgxiang@seu.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 961-966","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 080700348","10.1021/ef7007002","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21049883","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21049883","","Energy and Fuels","2","22"

Input included the concentrations of PM2.5 mass determined with a Federal Reference Method (FRM) sampler, semi-volatile PM2.5 organic material, elemental carbon (EC), and trace element components of PM2.5. A total of 11 factors were identified. The results of potential source contributions function analysis using PMF2 factors and HYSPLIT-calculated back-trajectories were used to identify those factors associated with specific meteorological transport conditions. The 11 factors were identified as being associated with emissions from various specific regions and facilities including crustal material, gasoline combustion, diesel combustion, and three nearby sources high in trace metals. Three sources associated with transport from coal-fired power plants to the southeast, a combination of point sources to the northwest, and a steel mill and associated sources to the west were identified. In addition, two secondary-material-dominated sources were identified, one was associated with secondary products of local emissions and one was dominated by secondary ammonium sulfate transported to the NETL site from the west and southwest. Of these 11 factors, the four largest contributors to PM2.5 were the secondary transported material, local secondary material, diesel combustion emissions, and gasoline combustion emissions. 26 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 357-368","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 080700359","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21049890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21049890","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","3","58"

In their discussion of fly ash and Hg adsorption, Lu et al. (Energy Fuels 2007, 21, 2112-2120) had some fundamental flaws in their techniques, which, in turn, impact the validity of analyzed parameters. First, they used mechanical sieving to segregate fly ash size fractions. Mechanical sieving does not produce representative size fractions, particularly for the finest sizes. If the study samples were not obtained correctly, the subsequent analyses of fly ash carbon and Hg cannot accurately represent the size fractions. In the analysis of carbon forms, it is not possible to accurately determine the forms with scanning electron microscopy. The complexity of the whole particles is overlooked when just examining the outer particle surface. Examination of elements such as Hg, present in very trace quantities in most fly ashes, requires careful attention to the analytical techniques. 36 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: hower@caer.uky.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1055-1058","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 080700078","10.1021/ef700683q","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21049723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21049723","","Energy and Fuels","2","22"

As discussed in this communication, resonating silicon-based cantilevers coated with thin films of gold change their resonant frequency when exposed to mercury vapors and could serve as the basis for such sensing devices. Two different types of commercial AFM cantilevers, which differed by physical dimensions and surface finish, were coated with a 10 nm film of gold and were tested in streams of argon containing mercury. The argon flow rates ranged from 5.7 to 57.4 mL/min, carrying mercury vapors at concentrations between 37 and 700 {mu}g/m{sup 3}. The results show that smaller cantilevers (about 140 {mu}m x 40 {mu}m x 4 {mu}m) with a resonant frequency of 270-275 kHz were sensitive to less than 10 picograms of mercury, whereas larger cantilevers (about 245 {mu}m x 50 {mu} x 7 {mu}m) with a resonant frequency of 155-165 kHz have a sensitivity about 10 times lower. The results indicate that the kinetics of mercury capture by the gold coating follows a simple power law-correlation with the mass change ({delta}m) being proportional to t{sup n}, where t is the capture time and n depends strongly on the concentration of mercury in the gas. It is also demonstrated that the mercury can be stripped off the gold coating by heating to 350{sup o}C, which would allow the cantilevers to be regenerated and reused. 20 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: jwdrelic@mtu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2072-2078","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080600032","10.1021/es071724e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21036892","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21036892","","Environmental Science and Technology","6","42"

This makes it possible to separate the ash particles according to size without introducing additional components. Formulas are given for calculating the structural and dynamic parameters of this system and measurements of indirect dynamic parameters are used to calculate the input-output characteristics of the system. In order to optimize the system, configurations for summing several ducts into a single transport duct for pneumatic ash transport are proposed.

The approach involves an oxygen-blown coal gasification unit. The resulting synthetic gas (syngas) is combusted with oxygen in a gas generator to produce the working fluid for the turbines. The combustion produces a gas mixture composed almost entirely of steam and carbon dioxide. These gases drive multiple turbines to produce electricity. The turbine discharge gases pass to a condenser where water is captured. A stream of carbon dioxide then results that can be used for enhanced oil recovery or for sequestration. The term zero emission steam technology is used to describe this technology We present the analysis of a 400 MW electric power plant. The power plant has a net thermal efficiency of 39%. This efficiency is based on the lower heating value of the coal, and includes the energy necessary for coal gasification, air separation, and for carbon dioxide separation and sequestration. This paper also presents an analysis of the cost of electricity and the cost of conditioning carbon dioxide for sequestration. Electricity cost is compared for three different gasification processes (Texaco, Shell, and Koppers-Totzek) and two types of coals (Illinois 6 and Wyodak). COE ranges from 5.95/kW h to 6.15/kW In, indicating a 3.4% sensitivity to the gasification processes considered and the coal types used.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 23005","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080800072","10.1115/1.2771255","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21058958","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21058958","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","130"

The capture of these elements in the flue gas desulphurization (FGD) scrubber unit has resulted in generation of a metal-laden residue. With increasing reuse of the FGD residues in beneficial applications, it is important to determine metal speciation and mobility to understand the environmental impact of its reuse. In this paper, we report the solid phase speciation of As, Se, and Hg in FGD residues using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and sequential chemical extraction (SCE) techniques. The SCE results combined with XRF data indicated a strong possibility of As association with iron oxides, whereas Se was distributed among all geochemical phases. Hg appeared to be mainly distributed in the strong-complexed phase. XRF images also suggested a strong association of Hg with Fe oxide materials within FGD residues. XAS analysis indicated that As existed in its oxidized state (As(V)), whereas Se and Hg was observed in primarily reduced states as selenite (Se(IV)) and Hg(I), respectively. The results from the SCE and variable pH leaching tests indicated that the labile fractions of As, Se, and Hg were fairly low and thus suggestive of their stability in the FGD residues. However, the presence of a fine fraction enriched in metal content in the FGD residue suggested that size fractionation is important in assessing the environmental risks associated with their reuse. 34 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: al-abed.souhail@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1693-1698","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080600029","10.1021/es702479n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21036889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21036889","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","42"

Semidry FGD with a rapidly hydrated sorbent was studied in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) experimental facility. The sorbent was made from lumps of lime and coal fly ash. The desulfurization efficiency was measured for various operating parameters, including the sorbent recirculation rate and the water spray method. The experimental results show that the desulfurization efficiencies of the rapidly hydrated sorbent were 1.5-3.0 times higher than a commonly used industrial sorbent for calcium to sulfur molar ratios from 1.2 to 3.0, mainly due to the higher specific surface area and pore volume. The Ca(OH){sub 2} content in the cyclone separator ash was about 2.9% for the rapidly hydrated sorbent and was about 0.1% for the commonly used industrial sorbent, due to the different adhesion between the fine Ca(OH){sub 2} particles and the fly ash particles, and the low cyclone separation efficiency for the fine Ca(OH){sub 2} particles that fell off the sorbent particles. Therefore the actual recirculation rates of the active sorbent with Ca(OH){sub 2} particles were higher for the rapidly hydrated sorbent, which also contributed to the higher desulfurization efficiency. The high fly ash content in the rapidly hydrated sorbent resulted in good operating stability. The desulfurization efficiency with upstream water spray was 10-15% higher than that with downstream water spray. 20 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: youcf@tsinghua.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1705-1710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080600030","10.1021/es702208e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21036890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21036890","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","42"

Several writers address the issue from various perspectives. This paper attempts to add relative realism to discussions on CO{sub 2} capture costs and the deployment of carbon capture technology in the UK by using publicly available company data on the long term capacity expansion and CO{sub 2} capture investment programmes of selected power plants in the UK. With an estimated 8 billion plan to install a generation capacity of GW and capture capability of 44 Mt CO{sub 2}/year, it is imperative to optimise this huge potential investment. A least-cost optimisation model was formulated and solved with the LP algorithm available in GAMS. The model was then applied to address a number of issues, including the choice of an optimal carbon abatement policy within the EU-ETS framework. The major findings of the study include (a) the long term total cost curve of CO{sub 2} capture has three phases rising, plateau, rising; (b) alternative capture technologies do not have permanent relative cost advantages or disadvantages; (c) Government incentives encourage carbon capture and the avoidance of emission penalty charges; and (d) the goals of EU-ETS are more effectively realised with deeper cuts in the EUA ratios than merely hiking the emission penalty, as proposed in EU-ETS Phase II.","","","","","","United States","2008-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 29; Other Information: Special Issue","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 99-134","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574; ENJODN; TRN: 090600048","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176743","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176743","","Energy Journal","","29"

The article explains the technology of CFB and discusses development of CFB units since the late 1990s. China is seeing an explosion in the number of utility-size CFBs. Alstom, Foster Wheeler, Babcock and Wilson and Alex Kvaener are today's major CFB boiler manufacturers. Alstom is testing and developing oxy-firing and post-combustion carbon capture strategies on CFB boilers. One CFB asset is its ability to burn a variety of fuels including waste coal, high sulfur coal and even discarded tires. The article mentions successful CFB projects at the Seward Station using waste coal and at the Gilbert 3 plant in the USA. Lamar is converting its Light and Power Plant from natural gas to burn coal in a 38.5 MW CFB boiler. 1 tab., 3 photos.","","","","","","United States","2008-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 112; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24-25,30-31,38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080500344","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21017310","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21017310","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","2","112"

The discrete phase method is used to simulate the coal slurry flow. The physical and chemical processing of coal slurry gasification is implemented by calculating the discrete phase trajectory using a Lagrangian formulation. The particle tracking is coupled with specific physical processes, in which the coal particles sequentially undergo moisture release, vaporisation, devolatilisation, char oxidation and char gasification. Using specified plant boundary conditions, the gasification model predicts a synthesis gas composition that is very close to the values calculated by a restricted equilibrium reactor model tuned to represent typical experimental data. The char conversions are 100 and 86% for the first stage and second stage respectively.","Maney Publishing on behalf of the Energy Institute","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2006-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Institute of Energy; Journal Volume: 79; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: Fourth International Conference on Computational Heat and Mass Transfer, Paris-Cachan, France, May 17-20, 2005; Related Information: Also published in proceedings set: Progress in computational heat and mass transfer, Lavoisier, ISBN 2-7430-0801-6, v. 1, pp. 593-598","","Medium: X; Size: 217-221","","DOE/NETL-IR-2005-076","","Journal ID: ISSN 0144-2600; TRN: US200722%%257","10.1179/174602206X148865","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","900294","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/900294","","Journal of the Institute of Energy","4","79"

As more stringent emission limits are phased in, utilities will likely need supplemental measures such as activated carbon injection (ACI) to further reduce emissions. However, SO{sub 3} could foul this strategy and potentially jeopardize the ability of some coal-fired power plants to meet future mercury emission limits. A growing consensus exists among emissions control engineers and researchers that the presence of SO{sub 3} in the flue gas from coal-fired boilers reduces the capacity of fly ash and/or activated carbon to adsorb gaseous mercury species. The impact of SO{sub 3}, which is actually a combination of SO{sub 3} and H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} vapor, has been investigated on a fundamental level using approaches such as fixed-bed reactors and activated carbons. Pilot testing has provided mercury removal efficiency data on actual flue gas over a wide range of SO{sub 3} concentrations. If SO{sub 3} threatens the feasibility of low capital-cost approaches involving activated carbon, utilities will be forced to explore other more costly options. One example is the use of mercury catalytic oxidation to boost mercury removal efficiencies in wet scrubbers. However, catalytic oxidation of mercury using SCR catalysts may have unintended consequences. A better alternative may be to remove the SO{sub 3} so it does not interfere with the removal of mercury via the fly ash and/or activated carbon for example using sodium sorbents. The article outlines research projects on alternatives. 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 112; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 54,56,58,60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080500342","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21017308","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21017308","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","1","112"

Syngas from entrained bed coal gasification was used as feedstock of the low-temperature slurry phase Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Raw synthetic liquid produced was fractioned and upgraded to diesel, gasoline, and liquid petrol gas (LPG). Tail gas composed of unconverted syngas and FT light components was fed to the gas turbine. Supplemental fuel (NG, or refinery mine gas) might be necessary, which was dependent on gas turbine capacity expander through flow capacity, etc. FT yield information was important to the simulation of this co-production system. A correlation model based on Mobil's two step pilot plant was applied. User models that can predict product yields and cooperate with other units were embedded into Aspen plus simulation. Performance prediction of syngas fired gas turbine was the other key of this system. The increase in mass flow through the turbine affects the match between compressor and turbine operating conditions. The calculation was carried out by GS software developed by Politecnico Di Milano and Princeton University. Various cases were investigated to match the FT synthesis island, power island, and gasification island in co-production systems. Effects of CO{sub 2} removal/LPG recovery, co-firing, and CH{sub 4} content variation were studied. Simulation results indicated that more than 50% of input energy was converted to electricity and FT products. Total yield of gasoline, diesel, and LPG was 136-155 g/N m{sup 3} (CO+H{sub 2}). At coal feed of 21.9 kg/s, net electricity exported to the grid was higher than 100 MW. Total production of diesel and gasoline (and LPG) was 118,000 t (134,000 t)/year. Under the economic analysis conditions assumed in this paper the co-production system was economically feasible.","","","","","","United States","2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 011401, 1-10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 080500376","10.1115/1.2747644","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21017342","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21017342","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","130"

Model results consistently resolved 10 factors that are interpreted as two secondary, five industrial, one motor vehicle, one road dust, and one biomass burning sources. It was found that most PMF factors did not cleanly represent single source types and instead are 'contaminated' by other sources. Secondary particulate matter formed by atmospheric processes, such as sulfate and secondary OC, contribute the majority of ambient PM2.5 and exhibit strong seasonality 37 {+-} 10% winter vs. 55 {+-} 16% summer average. Motor vehicle emissions constitute the biggest primary PM2.5 mass contribution. In summary, this study demonstrates the utility of the EC tracer method to effectively blank-correct the OC concentrations in the STN dataset. In addition, examination of the effect of input uncertainty estimates on model results indicates that the estimated uncertainties currently being provided with the STN data may be somewhat lower than the levels needed for optimum modeling results.

Using a probabilistic analysis, we have calculated the plant-level return on investment (ROI) and the value of syngas storage for IGCC facilities located in the U.S. Midwest using a range of storage configurations. Adding a second turbine to use the stored syngas to generate electricity at peak hours and implementing 12 h of above-ground high-pressure syngas storage significantly increases the ROI and net present value.

Allowance prices are uncertain, as are the timing and stringency of requirements for control of mercury and carbon emissions. We model the evolution of allowance prices for SO{sub 2}, NOx, Hg, and CO{sub 2} using geometric Brownian motion with drift, volatility, and jumps, and use an options-based analysis to find the value of the alternatives. In the absence of a carbon price, only if the owners have a planning horizon longer than 30 years would they replace a conventional coal-fired plant with a high-performance unit such as a supercritical plant; otherwise, they would install SO{sub 2} and NOx controls on the existing unit. An expectation that the CO{sub 2} price will reach $50/t in 2020 makes the installation of an IGCC with carbon capture and sequestration attractive today, even for planning horizons as short as 20 years. A carbon price below $40/t is unlikely to produce investments in carbon capture for electric power. 1 ref., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 23; Other Information: dpe{at}andrew.cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7980-7986","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080300046","10.1021/es0711009","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004454","","Environmental Science and Technology","23","41"

In this study, degradation reactions of free-standing air plasma-sprayed (APS) yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in contact with V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, P{sub 2}O{sub 5}, and Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} were investigated at temperatures up to 1200{sup o}C. Phase transformations and microstructural development were examined using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Molten V{sub 2}O{sub 5} reacted with solid YSZ to form ZrV{sub 2}O{sub 7} at temperatures below 747{sup o}C. However, at temperatures above 747{sup o}C, molten V{sub 2}O{sub 5} reacted with YSZ to form yttrium vanadate (YVO{sub 4}). The formation of YVO{sub 4} led to the depletion of the Y2O{sub 3} stabilizer and deleterious transformation to the monoclinic ZrO{sub 2} phase. In addition, studies on YSZ degradation by Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} and a Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}+V{sub 2}O{sub 5} mixture (50-50 mol%) showed that Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} itself had no effect on the degradation of YSZ. However, in the presence of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} at high temperatures, Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} forms vanadate compounds having a lower melting point such as sodium metavanadate (610{sup o}C), which was found to degrade YSZ by the formation of YVO{sub 4} at a relatively lower temperature of 700{sup o}C. P{sub 2}O{sub 5} was found to react with APS YSZ by the formation of ZrP{sub 2}O{sub 7} at all the temperatures studied. At temperatures as low as 200{sup o}C and as high as 1200{sup o}C, molten P{sub 2}O{sub 5} was observed to react with solid YSZ to yield ZrP{sub 2}O{sub 7}, which led to the depletion of ZrO{sub 2} in YSZ that promoted the formation of the fluorite-cubic ZrO{sub 2} phase.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Ceramic Society; Journal Volume: 90; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3601-3607","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-7820; JACTAW; TRN: 080200417","10.1111/j.1551-2916.2007.01941.x","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20978431","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20978431","","Journal of the American Ceramic Society","11","90"

While transportation energy is an important consideration, the focus of this paper is on electric power. Today, the United States generates just over half of its electric power from coal. The average size-weighted age of the fleet of U.S. coal plants is 35 y, and many will have to be replaced in the next few years. If that capacity were to be replaced with new conventional coal plants, it would commit the nation (and the world) to many more decades of high carbon-dioxide emissions, or it would make the cost of meeting a future carbon-dioxide emission constraint much higher than it needs to be. A range of low- and no-carbon energy technologies offers great potential to create a portfolio of options that can dramatically reduce emissions. A few of the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies are discussed. Policy and regulatory advances that will be needed to move the energy system to a low-carbon future are identified.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Health Physics; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 568-570","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0017-9078; HLTPAO; TRN: 080100318","10.1097/01.HP.0000282108.31580.87","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","20970009","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20970009","","Health Physics","5","93"
"The effect of jet velocity ratio on aerodynamics of a rectangular slot-burner in the presence of cross-flow","Ahmed, S; Hart, J; Naser, J; Nikolov, J; Solnordal, C; Yang, W","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; COAL; JETS; AERODYNAMICS; BURNERS; VELOCITY; AIR; BOILERS; COMBUSTION; WALLS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; SCALE MODELS; FURNACES; IGNITION; MIXING; NOZZLES; TURBULENCE; VORTICES; RECTANGULAR CONFIGURATION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; CROSSFLOW SYSTEMS; FLOW VISUALIZATION","In a typical coal-fired power station boiler the ignition and the combustion of the fuel is largely controlled by burner aerodynamics. An experimental and numerical study of the rectangular slot-burners widely used on power stations in Victoria, Australia has been conducted to improve understanding of jet development within the boiler. The 1:15 scale model burner consisted of a central (primary) rectangular fuel nozzle with two (secondary) rectangular air jets positioned above and below it. The burner jets entered the measurement vessel at an angle of 60 deg to the wall. A cross-flow jet was attached to the wall of the vessel to simulate the recirculation prevalent in power station boilers. Experiments were conducted using a primary to cross-flow jet velocity ratio ({phi}) of 1.0 and secondary to primary jet velocity ratios ({phi}) of 1.0 and 3.0. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) was used to measure mean and turbulent velocity components in the near field and downstream regions of the jets. Cross-flow significantly influenced the near field flow development from the slot-burner by deviating both primary and secondary jets from their geometric axes towards the wall. The degree of deviation was greater for {phi} = 1.0 since the higher velocity secondary jets increased the overall momentum of the primary jet for {phi} = 3.0. A numerical investigation of the rectangular slot-burner was also performed. First, the numerical results were validated against the experimental results and then visualization of the developing flow field was used to reveal the finer details of the cross-flow/burner jet interaction. Agreement between numerical and experimental jet features was good, although the numerical results predicted a primary jet that was marginally too narrow. Also the predicted downstream behaviour for {phi} = 3.0 deviated more significantly from experimental observation. Using the SST turbulence model, the numerical results suggested that a twin vortex was generated behind the initial region of the primary jet and this would aid in mixing of gas and fuel between primary and secondary jets.

New coal-fired boiler permits may well be opposed and delayed by interveners. However, more and more utilities are negotiating with interveners regarding their construction permit in an attempt to avoid or resolve lawsuits. Recent deals settling contesting issues include specifying requirements for control devices and emissions limits, promoting renewable energy, offsetting carbon dioxide, and improving emission limits on several existing facilities. Crucial to these agreements is a stipulation that the environmental groups will not block the issuance of construction permits. Settlements can be cost effective and in the best interest of rate payers. 7 refs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18,20","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400192","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004920","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004920","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","11","111"

Mist eliminators are an integral part of most wet FGD systems. These are available in a variety of materials - polypropylene, fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP), polysulfone and stainless steel. The article discusses the material properties, performance attributes and relative cost differences associated with each of these four materials. It describes the common problems with mist eliminators - fouling and corrosion. These can be minimised by routine cleaning and use of chemical additives to prevent deposition. An analysis was carried out to compare the four materials at APS Cholla power plant. As a result the facility is retrofitting its remaining wet scrubber towers in Unit 2 with mist eliminators constructed from polysulfone as each of the current ones of the existing polypropylene needs replacing. Polysulfone is cheaper to clean and components require replacing less frequently than polypropylene. Switching from stainless steel to polypropylene has proved advantageous on 22 wet scrubbers operated by PPL Montana. 5 figs. 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 118,120,122,124,126,128,130","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400197","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004925","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004925","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","11","111"

PRB coals can become fragmented and form coal dust that is highly volatile and easily self-ignited. Coal handling systems incorporate features to minimise dust, such as totally enclosed chute works, 'spoon drops' to reduce impact turbulence, and overflow hoods. Conveyors have extended skirtboards and tight clearances between the wear plates and the belts. Storage piles are designed to have high compaction to deprive oxygen and dust suppression monitor hydrants to minimise dust and assist in compaction. The coal silo filling bay is designed to minimise dust once the coal is crushed, and attention is paid to cleaning and lighting. The silos are designed to ensure mass flow to the feeder and incorporate a carbon monoxide monitor and an F-500 fire suppressant. 3 photos.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 206,208,210,212","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400200","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004928","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004928","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","11","111"

With the lack of space for new landfills, waste-to-energy incineration is playing an increasingly important role in waste management. Incineration of MSW from Chinese cities presents some unique challenges because of its low calorific value (3000-6700 kJ/kg) and high water content (about 50%). This study reports a novel waste-to-energy incineration technology based on co-firing of MSW with coal in a grate-circulating fluidized bed (CFB) incinerator, which was implemented in the Changchun MSW power plant. In 2006, two 260 ton/day incinerators incinerated 137,325 tons, or approximately one/sixth of the MSW generated in Changchun, saving more than 0.2 million m{sup 3} landfill space. A total of 46.2 million kWh electricity was generated (38,473 tons lignite was also burned as supplementary fuel), with an overall fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 14.6%. Emission of air pollutants including particulate matters, acidic gases, heavy metals, and dioxins was low and met the emission standards for incinerators. As compared to imported incineration systems, this new technology has much lower capital and operating costs and is expected to play a role in meeting China's demands for MSW disposal and alternative energy. 34 refs., 1 fig., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 21; Other Information: cheng553@stanford.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7509-7515","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080100217","10.1021/es071416g","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20969918","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20969918","","Environmental Science and Technology","21","41"

The aims of this study carried out at pilot plant scale were to assess the use of high-efficiency structured packing and to validate the positive results obtained previously in laboratory studies. A comparison between a packed tower and a spray column was made by maintaining the same desulfurization efficiency. A 47% reduction in seawater flow can be obtained with a packed tower. This option seems to be more economical, with a reduction in operation costs of least of 33%. With the appropriate activated carbon, it is possible to reach a greater oxidation rate at a low pH level than by operating conventionally at a high pH level without a catalyst. A preliminary technical and financial comparison between the advanced seawater desulfurization process (equipped with a packed tower and a catalytic oxidation plant) and the conventional process (spray tower and noncatalytic oxidation) was carried out. 18 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: vidal@esi.us.es","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7114-7119","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 080100081","10.1021/es0706899","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20969805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20969805","","Environmental Science and Technology","20","41"

The article explains the three basic approaches to capturing CO{sub 2} - post-combustion, oxyfuel combustion and pre-combustion. Researchers at US DOE labs and utilities are investigating new solvents that capture CO{sub 2} more efficiently than amines and take less energy. Ammonium carbonate has been identified by EPRI as one suitable solvent. Field research projects on this are underway in the USA. Oxyfuel combustion trials are also being planned. Pre-combustion, or gasification is a completely different way of pulling energy from coal and, for electricity generation, this means IGCC systems. AEP, Southern Cinergy and Xcel are considering IGCC plants but none will capture CO{sub 2}. Rio Tinto and BP are planning a 500 MW facility to gasify coke waste from petroleum refining and collect and sequester CO{sub 2}. However, TECO recently dropped a project to build a 789 MW IGCC coal fired plant even though it was to receive a tax credit to encourage advanced coal technologies. The plant would not have captured CO{sub 2}.

The three biggest threats to air heater performance deterioration are corrosion of the heat exchange surfaces, plugging, and air heater leakage through the seals. The article concentrates on the vastly increased level of corrosion and plugging issues associated with installing selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) systems for controlling nitrogen oxide emissions. Some injected ammonia in the SCR process reacts with SO{sub 2} to form ammonium sulphate and bisulphate (ABS) which is deposited on the air heater element surfaces. This can be overcome by applying coatings, using corrosion-resistant steels, reconfiguring the air heaters to a two layer design, improving air heater blowers, improving technologies for removing ammonia 'slip' before it enters the air heater, and using new catalysts that reduce the oxidation of SO{sub 2} to SO{sub 3}. 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 84,86,89","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400191","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004919","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004919","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","10","111"

Input to the PMF2 analysis included the concentrations of PM2.5 nonvolatile and semivolatile organic material, elemental carbon (EC), ammonium sulfate, trace element components, gas-phase organic material, and NOx, NO{sub 2}, and O{sub 3} concentrations. A total of 10 factors were identified. These factors are associated with emissions from various sources and facilities including crustal material, gasoline combustion, diesel combustion, and three nearby sources high in trace metals. In addition, four secondary sources were identified, three of which were associated with secondary products of local emissions and were dominated by organic material and one of which was dominated by secondary ammonium sulfate transported to the CMU site from the west and southwest. The three largest contributors to PM2.5 were secondary transported material (dominated by ammonium sulfate) from the west and southwest from sources including coal-fired power plants, coke processing plants and steel mills, (49%), secondary material formed during midday photochemical processes (24%), and gasoline combustion emissions (11%). The other seven sources accounted for the remaining 16% of the PM2.5. Results obtained at the CMU site were comparable to results previously reported at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), located approximately 18 km south of downtown Pittsburgh. The major contributor at both sites was material transported from the west and southwest. Some difference in nearby sources could be attributed to meteorology as evaluated by HYSPLIT model back-trajectory calculations. 27 refs., 16 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2007-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: donald.martello@netl.doe.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1251-1267","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 080200412","10.3155/1047-3289.57.10.1251","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","20978426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20978426","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","10","57"
"State-level infrastructure and economic effects of switchgrass cofiring with coal in existing power plants for carbon mitigation","Morrow, William R; Griffin, W Michael; Matthews, H Scott","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 09 BIOMASS FUELS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GRAMINEAE; COCOMBUSTION; COAL; MITIGATION; CARBON DIOXIDE; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COST ESTIMATION; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; USA; IOWA; PENNSYLVANIA; ECONOMIC IMPACT; REGIONAL ANALYSIS; LINEAR PROGRAMMING; ECONOMETRICS","This paper presents a linear programming (LP) methodology for estimating the cost of reducing a state's coal-fired power plant carbon dioxide emissions by cofiring switchgrass and coal. LP modeling allows interplay between regionally specific switchgrass production forecasts, coal plant locations, and individual coal plant historic performance data to determine an allocation of switchgrass minimizing cost or maximizing carbon reduction. The LP methodology is applied to two states, Pennsylvania (PA) and Iowa (IA), and results are presented with a discussion of modeling assumptions, techniques, and carbon mitigation policy implications. The LP methodology estimates that, in PA, 4.9 million tons of CO{sub 2}/year could be mitigated at an average cost of less than $34/ton of CO{sub 2} and that, in IA, 7 million tons of CO{sub 2}/year could be mitigated at an average cost of mitigation of $27/ton of CO{sub 2}. Because the factors determining the cofiring costs vary so much between the two states, results suggest that cofiring costs will also vary considerably between different U.S. regions. A national level analysis could suggest a lowest-cost cofiring region. This paper presents techniques and assumptions that can simplify biomass energy policy analysis with little effect on analysis conclusions. 20 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: william.morrow@or.netl.doe.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6657-6662","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071200116","10.1021/es070335h","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20961351","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20961351","","Environmental Science and Technology","19","41"

The fundamental challenge is to develop a portfolio of options that is technically feasible and can provide affordable electricity to customers. As the US industry considers its investments in research, development and demonstration projects, EPRI's PRISM and MERGE analyses address this challenge and point toward a solution that EPRI describes as 'The Full Portfolio'. The PRISM results show much greater use of nuclear power, renewable energy and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) towards 2030, and a sharply lower contribution from natural gas and coal without CCS. The MERGE analysis shows that, assuming CCS would not be available, the use of coal would fall off sharply in favour of natural gas and there would be a fall in electricity demand driven by very high prices. With the Full Portfolio, nuclear power and advanced coal generation with CCS reduce emissions to a point where a much lower demand reduction is needed. By 2050 the Full Portfolio will have decarbonized the electricity sector and reduced the impact on electricity prices to below a fifth that of the limited portfolio. 2 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-19","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 080200194","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20978396","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20978396","","EPRI Journal","",""

If the Full Portfolio of technology options becomes the industry's ultimate destination, then the question to be answered is, how does the industry arrive there? EPRI has identified four technology pathways to answer that question and serve as the framework for a robust RD & D agenda. The first two pathways constitute the creation of a smart grid that will enable contributions to CO{sub 2} reductions from renewables, energy efficiency, distributed energy resources, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The latter two pathways are designed to ensure the viability of coal and the accelerated expansion of nuclear power - the two workhorses of electricity supply which account for more than 70% of current US electricity generation. The meting concluded that, in coal, there is a need to pursue multiple demonstrations of key technologies - advanced PC and IGCC systems, pre-and post-combustion capture and CO{sub 2} storage - in parallel, but we are already late. The possibility of failure to adequately demonstrate CO{sub 2} capture and storage could prove to be a showstopper for coal. Each technology pathway involves an ambitious sequence of RD & D steps that achieve critical targets in the 2015-2030 period.","","","","","","United States","2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 20-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 080200195","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20978397","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20978397","","EPRI Journal","",""

Using emission factors that were calculated from the relationship between the electricity produced and amount of treated wastes, the GHC emissions in the Oeiras municipality were estimated for a time series of 6 yr (1998 - 2003). The obtained results showed that the electricity sector accounts for approximately 75% of the municipal emissions in 2003.

In order to gain a more complete understanding of the impact of SOx on ACI, mercury capture was tested under varying conditions of SO{sub 2} and SO{sub 3} concentrations using a packed bed reactor and simulated flue gas (SFG). The final mercury content of the activated carbons is independent of the SO{sub 2} concentration in the SFG, but the presence of SO{sub 3} inhibits mercury capture even at the lowest concentration tested (20 ppm). The mercury removal capacity decreases as the sulfur content of the used activated carbons increases from 1 to 10%. In one extreme case, an activated carbon with 10% sulfur, prepared by H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} impregnation, shows almost no mercury capacity. The results suggest that mercury and sulfur oxides are in competition for the same binding sites on the carbon surface. 30 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: evan.granite@netl.doe.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6579-6584","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071200115","10.1021/es0708316","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20961350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20961350","","Environmental Science and Technology","18","41"

Estimates also suggest that NG supply will increasingly come from imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). Additional supplies of NG could come domestically from the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) via coal gasification-methanation. The objective of this study is to compare greenhouse gas (GHG), SOx, and NOx life-cycle emissions of electricity generated with NG/LNG/SNG and coal. This life-cycle comparison of air emissions from different fuels can help us better understand the advantages and disadvantages of using coal versus globally sourced NG for electricity generation. Our estimates suggest that with the current fleet of power plants, a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have lower GHG emissions than coal. If advanced technologies with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) are used, however, coal and a mix of domestic NG, LNG, and SNG would have very similar life-cycle GHG emissions. For SOx and NOx we find there are significant emissions in the upstream stages of the NG/LNG life-cycles, which contribute to a larger range in SOx and NOx emissions for NG/LNG than for coal and SNG. 38 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: pjaramil@andrew.cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6290-6296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071200259","10.1021/es063031o","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20961483","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20961483","","Environmental Science and Technology","17","41"

The following conclusions were drawn from these estimates: (1) Total SO{sub 2} emissions from pulp and paper mills were 340,000 t in 2005. Since 1980, SO{sub 2} emissions have decreased steadily. The decline over the 25-yr period was over 60%. Paper production increased by 50% over the same period. (2) Boilers burning coal and oil are the primary source of SO{sub 2} emissions, with minor contributions from black liquor combustion in kraft recovery furnaces and the burning of noncondensable gases in boilers at kraft pulp mills. Factors contributing to the decline in boiler SO{sub 2} emissions include large reductions in residual oil use, recent decreases in coal use, declines in the average sulfur content of residual oil and coal being burned, and increasing use of flue gas desulfurization systems.(3) NOx emissions from pulp and paper mills were 230,000 t in 2005. NOx emissions were fairly constant through 1995, but then declined by 12% in 2000 and an additional 17% between 2000 and 2005. (4) In 2005, boilers accounted for two-thirds of the NOx emissions, and kraft mill sources approximately 30%. Boiler NOx emissions exhibited very little change through 1995, but decreased by one third in the next 10 yr. The lower emissions resulted from declines in fossil fuel use, a reduction in the EPA emission factors for natural gas combustion in boilers without NOx controls, and more widespread use of combustion modifications and add-on NOx control technologies, particularly on coal-fired boilers subject to EPA's NOx SIP call. Total NOx emissions from kraft mill sources changed little over the 25-yr period. 7 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 901-906","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 071000178","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939552","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939552","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","57"

One of the solutions is the conversion of fossil fuel into carbon-free energy carriers, hydrogen, and electricity with CO{sub 2} capture and storage. In this paper, the main purpose is to investigate the thermodynamics performance of converting coal to a hydrogen and electricity system with chemical-looping reactors and to explore the influences of operating parameters on the system performance. Using FeO/Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4} as an oxygen carrier, we propose a carbon-free coproduction system of hydrogen and electricity with chemical-looping reactors. The performance of the new system is simulated using ASPEN PLUS software tool. The influences of the chemical-looping reactor's temperature, steam conversion rate, and O{sub 2}/coal quality ratio on the system performance, and the exergy performance are discussed. The results show that a high-purity of H{sub 2} (99.9%) is reached and that CO{sub 2} can be separated. The system efficiency is 57.85% assuming steam reactor at 815 C and the steam conversion rate 37%. The system efficiency is affected by the steam conversion rate, rising from 53.17 to 58.33% with the increase of the steam conversion rate from 28 to 41%. The exergy efficiency is 54.25% and the losses are mainly in the process of gasification and HRSG. 14 refs., 12 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: wgxiang@seu.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2272-2277","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 071000018","10.1021/ef060517h","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939426","","Energy and Fuels","4","21"

These plumes were found to result in extremely high mercury concentrations at ground level that were composed of a wide distribution of mercury species. Ground level concentrations as high as 235 ng m{sup -3} for elemental mercury (Hg{sup 0}) and 38,300 pg m{sup -3} for reactive mercury species (reactive gaseous (RGM) plus particulate (PHg) mercury) were measured. The highest mercury concentrations observed during the study were associated with plumes that contained high concentrations of all mercury species (Hg{sup 0}, RGM, and PHg) and originated from a source located southwest of the sampling site. Variations in proportions of Hg{sup 0}/RGM/PHg among plumes, with Hg{sup 0} dominating some plumes and RGM and/or PHg dominating others, were attributed to differences in emissions from different sources. Correlations between mercury plumes and elevated NOx were not observed; however, a correlation between elevated SO{sub 2} and mercury plumes was observed during some but not all plume events. Despite the presence of six coal-fired power plants within 60 km of the study site, wind direction data along with Hg/SO{sub 2} and Hg/NOx ratios suggest that high-concentration mercury plumes impacting the St. Louis-Midwest Particle Matter Supersite are attributable to local point sources within 5 km of the site. 35 refs., 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: jschauer@eng.wisc.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5626-5633","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071100009","10.1021/es0700348","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20947224","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20947224","","Environmental Science and Technology","16","41"

However, episodic mercury accumulation events were recorded in some of these lakes, but not investigated in detail. Recent decreases had been attributed to the reduction of regional Hg consumption and secondary removal during process waste treatment. In addition to regional sources, local sources, including watershed disturbance, might significantly contribute to Hg loading. Here, mercury chronologies of Hg loadings based on dated sediment cores are presented for 26 inland Michigan lakes. Although spatial trends of anthropogenic inventories suggest a regional pattern dominated by human activities, sub-regional to local scale sources are also found to be significant. Temporal trends show episodic Hg accumulation events superimposed on a more general, long-term trend. Episodic increases common to lakes suggest a common source or processes common to lakes. Episodic increases unique to a lake indicate a more local scale source. Similar Hg profiles from lakes that are geographically proximal provide evidence for sub-regional to regional scale sources. Local sources and pathways for mercury to inland lakes need to be more fully understood to effectively reduce Hg loading to the environment. 48 refs., 7 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: parson65@msu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5634-5640","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071100010","10.1021/es0701356","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20947225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20947225","","Environmental Science and Technology","16","41"

Sequential images were captured for each experiment. The results indicate the existence of two ignition regimes. In one domain, ignition is rapid, typically less than 76 {mu}s, and ignition occurs simultaneously throughout the test volume. In the other domain, reaction fronts form and propagate within the test volume prior to volumetric ignition. The data span equivalence ratios from {phi}=0.20 to 1.98, with inert/O{sub 2} gas ratios from 1.38 to 5.89, pressures from 8.7 to 16.6 atm, and temperatures from 903 to 1020 K. The transition between the two regimes is discussed in the context of the mixture composition and experimental conditions. The analysis shows that the fuel mole fraction is a key parameter dictating the boundary between the modes of ignition. Below a critical mole fraction limit, volumetric ignition is observed; above the critical limit, reaction fronts are consistently present prior to volumetric ignition. The ignition delay times for both ignition regimes are well reproduced using a homogeneous simulation with detailed reaction chemistry, when the state conditions are modified to account for the presence of the reaction fronts. The results are discussed in terms of proposed reaction chemistry, ignition theory, and previous studies of iso-octane ignition.

The MACT provision also requires affected facilities to develop startup, shutdown and malfunction plans (SSMP). The original date for Boiler MACT compliance for existing units had been 13 September 2007. However, on 8 June the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order effectively killing all existing MACT rules for industrial boilers. The Court instructed the US EPA to rewrite two sets of regulations. (Prior to April 2006 the MACT general provisions said the SSMPs needed to be 'developed and implemented'.) It seems unlikely that any new revision of the Boiler MACT by the EPA will take effect before mid-2008.

Absorber vessel shells and internal components comprise the third largest use. The most common FRP absorber vessels are known as jet bubbling reactors (JBRs). One of the largest JBRs at a plant on the Ohio River removes 99% of sulphur dioxide from high sulphur coal flue gas. FRPs last twice as long as wood structures when used for cooling towers and require less maintenance. 1 tab., 2 photos.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36,38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400182","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004910","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004910","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","8","111"

The complete system includes three key cost components: a full combustion power plant, a second power plant working as an oxy-fired fluidized bed calciner, and a fluidized bed carbonator interconnected with the calciner and capturing CO{sub 2} from the combustion power plant. The simplicity in the economic analysis is possible because the key cost data for the two major first components are well established in the open literature. It is shown that there is clear scope for a breakthrough in capture cost to around 15 $/t of CO{sub 2} avoided with this system. This is mainly because the capture system is generating additional power (from the additional coal fed to the calciner) and because the avoided CO{sub 2} comes from the capture of the CO{sub 2} generated by the coal fed to the calciner and the CO{sub 2} captured (as CaCO{sub 3}) from the flue gases of the existing power plant, that is also released in the calciner. 8 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: abanades@incar.csic.es","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5523-5527","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071000200","10.1021/es070099a","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939566","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939566","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","41"

A six-step sequential extraction process was applied to laboratory-synthesized materials with known mercury concentrations and binding mechanisms. These materials were calcite, hematite, goethite, and titanium dioxide. Fly ash from a full-scale coal-fired power plant was also investigated. The concentrations of mercury were measured using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry, whereas the major elements were measured by ICP atomic emission spectrometry. The materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. The sequential extraction procedure provided information about the solid phases with which mercury was associated in the solid sample. The procedure effectively extracted mercury from the target phases. The procedure was generally selective in extracting mercury. However, some steps in the procedure extracted mercury from nontarget phases, and others resulted in mercury redistribution. Iron from hematite and goethite was only leached in the reducible and residual extraction steps. Some mercury associated with goethite was extracted in the ion exchangeable step, whereas mercury associated with hematite was extracted almost entirely in the residual step. Calcium in calcite and mercury associated with calcite were primarily removed in the acidsoluble extraction step. Titanium in titanium dioxide and mercury adsorbed onto titanium dioxide were extracted almost entirely in the residual step. 42 refs., 13 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 856-867","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 071000048","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939450","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939450","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","57"

To cope with mandatory carbon caps, utilities will have to step up efforts to reduce demand, build or buy more renewable energy capacity, increase the efficiency of their existing fleets, and find ways to capture and sequester massive amounts of CO{sub 2} from new and old plants alike. The next 20 years are sure to be exciting, and they will require new skills to identify and manage the considerable risks involved. The article compares America's CO{sub 2} emissions profile to other nations. It then examines how the electric power sector's strategies for coping with carbon caps might differ from those of other major economic sectors, the residential and commercial, industrial and transportation sector. It then goes into more detail about clean power generation. It says that the simplest and fastest way for utilities to reduce their CO{sub 2} emissions is to replace inefficient coal-fired plants at the end of their lives by gas-fired combined cycle units. Carbon sequestration will take decades rather than years to be commercially viable. The biggest risk to the electric power sector is a lack of legislative guidance on and certainty of the technology. 8 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: ggrothen@burnsmcd.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34,38,40,42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 071000052","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939454","","Power (New York)","7","151"

"Use of micro-XANES to speciate chromium in airborne fine particles in the Sacramento Valley","Werner, Michelle L; Nico, Peter S; Marcus, Matthew A; Anastasio, Cort","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CHROMIUM; USA; CALIFORNIA; PARTICULATES; URBAN AREAS; X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY; RURAL AREAS; VALLEYS; ABSORPTION SPECTRA; CHEMICAL STATE; QUANTITATIVE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; ELEMENT ABUNDANCE; SULFUR; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; TOXICITY; ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITION ELEMENTS; SAMPLING; FLUORESCENCE; STATIONARY POLLUTANT SOURCES","While particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere can lead to a wide array of negative health effects, the cause of toxicity is largely unknown. One aspect of PM that likely affects health is the chemical composition, in particular the transition metals within the particles. Chromium is one transition metal of interest due to its two major oxidation states, with Cr(III) being much less toxic compared to Cr(VI). Using microfocused X-ray absorption near edge structure (micro-XANES), we analyzed the Cr speciation in fine particles (diameters {le} 2.5 {mu}m) collected at three sites in the Sacramento Valley of northern California: Sacramento, a large urban area, Davis, a small city, and Placerville, a rural area. These are several major stationary sources of Cr within 24 km of the site including chrome-plating plants, power plants and incinerators. The microfocused X-ray beam enables us to look at very small areas on the filter with a resolution of typically 5-7 micrometers. With XANES we are able to not only distinguish between Cr(VI) and Cr(III), but also to identify different types of Cr(III) and more reduced Cr species. At all of our sampling sites the main Cr species were Cr(III), with Cr(OH){sub 3} or a Cr-Fe, chromite-like, phase being the dominant species. Cr(VI)-containing particles were found only in the most urban site. All three sites contained some reduced Cr species, either Cr(0) or Cr{sub 3}C{sub 2}, although these were minor components. This work demonstrates that micro-XANES can be used as a minimally invasive analytical tool to investigate the composition of ambient PM. 32 refs., 6 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 140; Other Information: canastasio@ucdavis.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4919-4924","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 071000072","10.1021/es070430q","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939474","","Environmental Science and Technology","140","41"

In 2005, the generation of electricity in China resulted in the emissions of 2290 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (approximately 53% of the nation's total) and required 779 million metric tonnes of coal (approximately 50% of China's total coal consumption). These figures are expected to increase with China's economic growth. In order to gauge the range in which fuel consumption and CO{sub 2} emissions could grow a scenario-based conceptual model has been developed by the authors (published in this journal). The application and analysis of this shows that under a business as usual (BAU) scenario, electricity generation could contribute upwards of 56% of China's energy related greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Meanwhile, consumption of coal will also increase, growing to nearly 60% of total national demand by 2020. However, variations in a number of key drivers could produce significant deviation from the BAU scenario. With accelerated economic output, even with greater technological advances and greater potential to bring natural gas on stream, carbon dioxide emissions would rise 10% above the BAU. Alternatively, in a scenario where China's economy grows at a tempered pace, less investment would be available for advanced technologies, developing natural gas infrastructure, or nuclear energy. In this scenario, reduced economic growth and electricity demand would thereby be countered by reduced efficiency and a higher contribution of coal.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Technological Forecasting and Social Change; Journal Volume: 74; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 779-797","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0040-1625; TFSCB3; TRN: 071100270","10.1016/j.techfore.2006.09.004","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20947420","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20947420","","Technological Forecasting and Social Change","6","74"
"Effects of surface deposition, hole blockage, and thermal barrier coating spallation on vane endwall film cooling","Sundaram, N; Thole, K A","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINES; FUEL GAS; TURBINE BLADES; COAL GASIFICATION; FLY ASH; DEPOSITION; DEPOSITS; PERFORMANCE","With the increase in usage of gas turbines for power generation and given that natural gas resources continue to be depleted, it has become increasingly important to search for alternate fuels. One source of alternate fuels is coal derived synthetic fuels. Coal derived fuels, however, contain traces of ash and other contaminants that can deposit on vane and turbine surfaces affecting their heat transfer through reduced film cooling. The endwall of a first stage vane is one such region that can be susceptible to depositions from these contaminants. This study uses a large-scale turbine vane cascade in which the following effects on film cooling adiabatic effectiveness were investigated in the endwall region: the effect of near-hole deposition, the effect of partial film cooling hole blockage, and the effect of spallation of a thermal barrier coating. The results indicated that deposits near the hole exit can sometimes improve the cooling effectiveness at the leading edge, but with increased deposition heights the cooling deteriorates. Partial hole blockage studies revealed that the cooling effectiveness deteriorates with increases in the number of blocked holes. Spallation studies showed that for a spalled endwall surface downstream of the leading edge cooling row, cooling effectiveness worsened with an increase in blowing ratio.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 599-607","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: 080300167","10.1115/1.2720485","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004567","","Journal of Turbomachinery","3","129"

Adding a biomass gasifier to an older coal-fired plant would inject gas with up to 10% of the fuel value in the coal and increase steam generation by the same amount. Sawdust can be injected as a reburn fuel without the need for gasification. A pre-scrubber would be added before the existing SO{sub 2} scrubber and waste heat from the boiler in the form of low-pressure steam would be sent to a co-located ethanol plant. This would lead to a decrease in emissions of NOx, mercury and SO{sub 2}, less mercury in the gypsum, a large greenhouse gas reduction, reduced net fuel cost, and revenue from hydrochloric acid by- product and from selling low-pressure steam to the ethanol plant. The Blue Flint Ethanol facility uses waste heat from Grand River Energy's 1,100 MW Coal Creek Station in South Jordan, Utah. The new generation of US ethanol plants is likely to use switchgrass and other cellulosic materials as feedstock. Straw and other forms of biomass have high chlorine content. PVC waste can be added to optimise the chlorine content of the scrubber.

Stabilizing firing rate, furnace draft and air flow can improve the heat rate by 1 or 2% in most units. The 75 MW Unit 3 and 109 MW Unit 4 of Kentucky Utilities' Green River Generation Station had difficulty maintaining combustion control operations. To improve this, the strategy was adopted similar to that used at the sister unit Tyrone 3 developed for firing rate/throttle pressure stability to ensure that the boiler control remained on automatic at all times. The system logic transfers control of the furnace draft to the units' induced draft (ID) fans. The modifications improved temperature and pressure control as well as unit response while opacity excursion, NOx emission and heat rate decreased by 3% in Unit 3 and 5.4% in Unit 4. 1 photo.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 44,46,48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 080400179","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004907","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004907","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","7","111"

The methodology stems from a joint project with a Danish energy consortium. During the course of the project we encountered several problems that we believe are common for projects of this type. Most notably there was a lack of both knowledge and data concerning possible faults, and it therefore turned out to be infeasible to learn/construct a standard classification model for doing fault detection. As an alternative we propose a method for doing on-line fault detection using only a model of normal system operation. Faults are detected by measuring the conflict between the model and the sensor readings, and knowledge about the possible faults is therefore not required. We illustrate the proposed method using real-world data from a coal driven power plant as well as simulated data from an oil production facility.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Approximate Reasoning; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 255-270","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-613X; TRN: 071100106","10.1016/j.ijar.2006.06.010","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20947313","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20947313","","International Journal of Approximate Reasoning","2","45"

There are a number of avenues to consider. One is to use dry-cooling and dry-scrubbing technologies. Another is to find innovative ways to recycle water within the power plant itself. A third is to find and use alternative sources of water, including wastewater supplies from municipalities, agricultural runoff, blackish groundwater, or seawater. Dry technologies are usually more capital intensive and typically exact a penalty in terms of plant performance, which in turn raises the cost of power generation. On the other hand, if the cost of water increases in response to greater demand, the cost differences between dry and wet technologies will be reduced. EPRI has a substantial R & D programme evaluating new water-conserving power plant technologies, improving dry and hybrid cooling technologies, reducing water losses in cooling towers, using degraded water sources and developing resource assessment and management decision support tools. 5 refs., 10 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal; Other Information: rogoldst@epri.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 26-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 071000451","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939733","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939733","","EPRI Journal","",""

They can travel with the flow in the furnace and settle on key places such as catalyst surfaces. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are often used in the design process to prevent the carryover and settling of these particles on catalysts. Particle size, density, and drag coefficient are the most important aerodynamic parameters needed in CFD modeling of particle flow. The objective of this study was to experimentally determine particle size, shape, apparent density, and drag characteristics for popcorn ash particles from a coal-fired power plant. Particle size and shape were characterized by digital photography in three orthogonal directions and by computer image analysis. Particle apparent density was determined by volume and mass measurements. Particle terminal velocities in three directions were measured in water and each particle was also weighed in air and in water. The experimental data were analyzed and models were developed for equivalent sphere and equivalent ellipsoid with apparent density and drag coefficient distributions. The method developed in this study can be used to characterize the aerodynamic properties of popcorn-like particles.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Particulate Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 275-287","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0272-6351; PTCHDS; TRN: 071100092","10.1080/02726350701375899","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20947300","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20947300","","Particulate Science and Technology","3","25"

We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model of firm investment decisions that minimizes the expected present value of future power generation costs under uncertain natural gas and carbon prices. We explore the implications of regulatory uncertainty on generation technology choice and the optimal timing of investment, and assess the implications of these choices for regulators. We find that interaction of regulatory uncertainty with irreversible investment always raises the social cost of carbon abatement. Further, the social cost of regulatory uncertainty is strongly dependent on the relative competitiveness of IGCC plants, for which the cost of later carbon capture retrofits is comparatively small, and on the firm's ability to use investments in natural gas generation as a transitional strategy to manage carbon regulation uncertainty. Without highly competitive IGCC or low gas prices, regulatory uncertainty can increase the expected social cost of reducing emissions by 40 to 60%.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 101-127","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-6574; ENJODN; TRN: 080100583","10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol28-No4-5","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","20970020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20970020","","Energy Journal","4","28"

Coal is undoubtedly part of the greenhouse problem. The main emissions from coal combustion are sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulates, carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}), and mercury (Hg). Since 1980, despite a 36% increase in electricity generation and more than a 50% increase in coal use, electric utility SO{sub 2} and NOx emissions have declined significantly. Globally, the largest source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is CO{sub 2} from the combustion of fossil fuels - around 75% of total GHG emissions covered under the Kyoto Protocol.

Coal and biomass can be pyrolyzed or gasified by using concentrated solar radiation for generating power. Conventional energy will not be enough to meet the continuously increasing need for energy in the future. In this case, renewable energy sources will become important. Solar energy is an increasing need for energy in the future. Solar energy is a very important energy source because of its advantages.

In particular, concentrations of two secondary pollutants, ozone and particulate matter, are often above regulated levels and can be dependent on emissions from upwind states. Here, impacts of statewide emissions on concentrations of local and downwind states' ozone and fine particulate matter are simulated for three seasonal periods in the eastern United States using a regional Eulerian photochemical model. Impacts of ground level NOx (e.g., mobile and area sources), elevated NOx (e.g., power plants and large industrial sources), and SO{sub 2} emissions are examined. An average of 77% of each state's ozone and PM2.5 concentrations that are sensitive to the emissions evaluated here are found to be caused by emissions from other states. Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia, Kentucky, and West Virginia are shown to have high concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 caused by interstate emissions. When weighted by population, New York receives increased interstate contributions to these pollutants and contributions to ozone from local emissions are generally higher. When accounting for emission rates, combined states from the western side of the modeling domain and individual states such as Illinois, Tennessee, Indiana, Kentucky, and Georgia are major contributors to interstate ozone. Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois are the major contributors to interstate PM2.5. When accounting for an equivalent mass of emissions, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and Alabama contribute large fractions of these pollutants to other states. 46 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 13; Other Information: michelle_bergin@dnr.state.ga.us","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4677-4689","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 070900134","10.1021/es062302s","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20923841","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20923841","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","41"

This paper addresses the modelling and prediction of type II hot corrosion in industrial gas turbines within the aim of given acceptable and predictable lifetimes. A matrix of corrosion tests have been undertaken using the 'deposit recoat' test procedure, with samples cooled periodically to re-apply controlled amounts of salt deposit.

Previous papers have shown that the main cause of the increased corrosion is the deposition of corrodants, iron sulfides and alkali chlorides, which occurs under reducing conditions. In this paper, the contribution of various variables such as the amount of corrodant in the deposit, the flue gas composition and the metal temperature, is further quantified in laboratory tests, using a test furnace allowing thermal gradients across the deposit and the metal tube samples. Approximate deposit compositions were calculated from the coal composition, its associated ash constituents and corrosive impurities. A commercially available thermochemical equilibrium package was used, after modifications to reflect empirical alkali availability data. Predictions from these calculations agreed reasonably well with the alkali chloride and FeS content found in actual boiler deposits. Thus approximate corrosion rates can be predicted from the chemical composition of the coal using corrosion rates from laboratory tests, adjusted to account for the short duration (100 hours) of the laboratory tests. Reasonable agreement was again obtained between actual and predicted results.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials at High Temperatures; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 275-284","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-3409; MHTEEM; TRN: 090200200","10.3184/096034007X278356","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126078","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126078","","Materials at High Temperatures","4","24"
"Field test corrosion experiences when co-firing straw and coal: 10 year status within Elsam","Frandsen, R B; Montgomery, M; Larsen, O H","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 09 BIOMASS FUELS; COCOMBUSTION; STRAW; COAL; BIOMASS; CORROSION; DENMARK; POTASSIUM CHLORIDES; SULFUR DIOXIDE; FLUE GAS; CORROSIVE EFFECTS; TUBES; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; SUPERHEATERS; MATERIALS TESTING; ALLOYS; FIELD TESTS","In Denmark, straw is utilised for the generation of energy and district heating in power plants. Combustion of straw gives rise to high contents of potassium chloride and some sulphur dioxide in the flue gas. These compounds can lead to deposits with high content of potassium chloride and potassium sulphate on superheater tubes resulting in increased corrosion rates. From field experimental results this paper show, that by co-firing straw with coal, corrosion rates can be brought down to an acceptable level. This paper firstly deals with the results from a demonstration program co-firing coal and straw at the 150 MW pulverized coal fired boiler Studstrup unit 1. Two exposure series lasting 3000 hours each were performed for co-firing 10 and 20% of straw (% energy basis) with coal. Using built in test tubes in the hot end of the actual superheaters and air/water cooled corrosion probes, the corrosion during these experiments was monitored. Various ferritic and austenitic materials were investigated at steam temperatures ranging from 520 to 580{degree}C and flue gas temperatures ranging from 925 to 1100{degree}C. The results obtained in the demonstration program led to the rebuilding of the 350 MW pulverized coal fired boiler, Studstrup unit 4, into a co-firing boiler with straw in 2002. During the rebuilding, test tube sections of X20CrMoV12 1 and TP347H FG were built into the superheater and the reheater loops. The temperature ranges during these exposures was for the steam from 470 to 575{degree}C and for the flue gas from 1025 to 1300{degree}C. All these test tubes have been removed during the last three years at one year intervals for corrosion studies. The corrosion studies performed on all investigated tubes included measurements of the corrosion attack, light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of the corrosion products.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials at High Temperatures; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 343-349","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-3409; MHTEEM; TRN: 090200201","10.3184/096034007X278365","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126079","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126079","","Materials at High Temperatures","4","24"

This paper reports the results of assessments carried out to evaluate the potential operating conditions of heat exchangers in combustion systems with biomass (wood or straw) and coal co-firing, as well as laboratory corrosion tests that have been carried out to give an initial assessment of potential effects of biomass co-firing. The corrosion tests have been carried out using the deposit recoat method in controlled atmosphere furnaces. A series of 1000 hour tests have been carried out at typical superheater and evaporator metal temperatures using simulated deposit compositions and gaseous environments (selected on the basis of plant experience and potential fuel compositions). Five materials were exposed in these tests: 1Cr steel, T22 steel, X20CrMoV121, TP347HFG and alloy 625. In order to produce statistically valid data on the actual metal loss from the materials, the performance of the materials in these tests was determined from dimensional metrology before and after exposure. For each material, these data have been used to determine the sensitivity of the corrosion damage to changes in the exposure conditions (e.g. deposit composition, gas composition) thereby producing initial models of the corrosion performance of the materials. The corrosion data and model outputs have been compared with data available from power plants operating on coal, straw or wood fuels.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials at High Temperatures; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 333-342","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-3409; MHTEEM; TRN: 090200202","10.3184/096034007X281640","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126080","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126080","","Materials at High Temperatures","4","24"

A component test facility designed to evaluate operation of major steam generator components at 700{degree}C (1292{degree}F) will soon be operational in Germany, and the first demonstration plant incorporating advanced ultra-supercritical technology could be constructed as soon as the year 2010. The question posed by those who will be responsible for the operation of these new ultra-supercritical power plants is obvious: will they perform reliably under the conditions of flexible operation that are likely to be imposed by modern de-regulated markets? The real intent of this question is more subtle: do the materials and methods of construction exist to build these advanced coal-fired boilers. In large part, the answer to that question lies in a US power plant located not far from the Philadelphia airport. The plant is Exelon's Eddystone plant. The steam generator for Unit I at that plant has operated successfully for over 44 years at steam conditions more advanced than any other coal-fired unit in operation today. This paper reviews salient features of the operating history of Eddystone 1, focussing on the materials-related problems that forced a modest retreat from the original and unprecedented design conditions, emphasizing the record of many years of reliable operation at aggressive steam conditions. It then discusses a few of the more significant materials-related issues involved in operating a steam generator at Eddystone-like conditions as a basis for arguing that there exists today the materials and manufacturing understanding necessary to construct an advanced ultra-supercritical unit that will operate efficiently and reliably.","","","","","","United States","2007-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials at High Temperatures; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 249-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-3409; MHTEEM; TRN: 090200421","10.3184/096034007X277924","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21126153","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126153","","Materials at High Temperatures","4","24"

Over 250 samples and 24 species were used, including the organic carbon and elemental carbon analytical temperature fractions from the thermal optical reflectance method. A two-step approach was used. First, the species excluding the carbon fractions were used, and initially eight factors were identified; non-soil potassium was calculated and included to better refine the burning factor. Next, the mass associated with the burning factor was removed, and the data set rerun with the carbon fractions. Results were very similar (i.e., within a few percent), but this step enabled a separation of the mobile factor into gasoline and diesel vehicle emissions. The identified factors were burning (on average 2% of the mass), secondary transport (7%), regional power generation (13%), dust (25%), nitrate (9%), industrial As/Pb/Se (2%), Cu/Ni/V (7%), diesel (9%), and general mobile (26%). Most of the long-range transport of emissions emanates from south of Phoenix in Southeastern Arizona, West Texas, and Mexico, which are significant source regions of SO{sub 2} emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants. The overall contribution from mobile sources also increased, as some mass (OC and nitrate) from the nitrate and regional power generation factors were apportioned with the mobile factors. This approach allowed better apportionment of carbon as well as total mass. Additionally, the use of multiple supporting analyses, including air mass trajectories, activity trends, and emission inventory information, helped increase confidence in factor identification. 86 refs., 10 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 741-752","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 071000033","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939440","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939440","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","57"

The current CAA system is a hybrid of several distinct air pollution control philosophies. The paper looks at several periods in the history of the U.S. program, including: (1) 1900-1970, spanning the early smoke abatement and smog control programs, the first federal involvement, and the development of a hybrid AQM approach in the 1970 CAA; (2) 1971-1976, when the first National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were set and implemented; (3) 1977-1993, a period of the first revisions to the standards, new CAA Amendments, delays in implementation and decision-making, and key science/policy/legislative developments that would alter both the focus and scale of air pollution programs and how they are implemented; and (4) 1993-2006, the second and third wave of NAAQS revisions and their implementation in the context of the 1990 CAA. This discussion examines where NAAQS have helped drive implementation programs and how improvements in both effects and air quality/control sciences influenced policy and legislation to enhance the effectiveness of the system over time. The review concludes with a look toward the future of AQM, emphasizing challenges and ways to meet them.

AEP has utility-scale integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants in the works for Ohio and West Virginia. Duke Energy Indiana plans to build a 630 MW IGCC plant at Edwardsport to replace the existing 160 MW coal-fired unit there. NRG hopes to build utility-scale IGCC plants in New York and Delaware. Tampa Electric has announced plans to build a 630 MW IGCC at its Polk site, already the location of a 260 MW IGCC. In Taylorville, IL, another power-oriented IGCC is under development, owned by individuals from original developer ERORA and Omaha-based Tenaska. And yet another power producing IGCC is being proposed by Tondu Corporation at Corpus Christi, Texas to be fired by petroleum coke, also known as petcoke. The article gives an overview of these developments and moves on to discuss the popular question of the economic viability of IGCC making marketable byproducts in addition to power. Several projects are under way to make synthetic natural gas for coal. These are reported. Although the versatility of gasification may well give the ability to swing from various levels of power production to various levels of co-producing one or more products, for the time being it appears the IGCCs being built will produce power only, along with elemental sulphur and slag.","","","","","","United States","2007-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34-36,38,40","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 071000056","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939458","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","6","111"

Although these alloys could potentially be good coating candidates due to their excellent high-temperature corrosion resistance, Fe-Al weld cladding is susceptible to cracking due to hydrogen embrittlement at elevated aluminum concentrations. Additions of chromium to these iron-aluminum alloys have been shown to improve the corrosion resistance of the alloys and could potentially increase the lifetimes of the coatings.

Sensitivity and life-cycle cost analyses are conducted to assess the impact of system parameters on the production of 1 MW of electrical power using a theoretical binary-cycle power plant. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the average underground temperature has the greatest impact on the exiting fluid temperatures from the ground followed by fluid flow rate and ground thermal conductivity.

The boiler system is divided into seven subcomponents, and for each section, models based on conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are formulated. The pressure drop at various sections and the heat transfer coefficients are computed using empirical correlations. Solutions are obtained by using SIMULINK. The model is validated by comparing its steady state and dynamic responses with the actual plant data. Open loop responses of the model to the step changes in the operating parameters, such as pressure, temperature, steam flow, feed water flow, are also analyzed.

In this article, we present the design of a new photochemical chamber that can be used to form secondary sulfuric acid particles from diluted coal-fired power plant emissions. The chamber is a relatively small, well-mixed flow reactor that can fit in a mobile reaction laboratory. It produces high concentrations of hydroxyl radical (OH) from the photolysis of ozone (O{sub 3}) in the presence of water vapor. Two chambers were built and tested. A pilot chamber was tested in the laboratory, using mixtures of NO and SO{sub 2} in air, at concentrations that are approximately 100 times lower than those in power plant stack emissions. This chamber was able to oxidize about 20% of the SO{sub 2}, thereby producing 1350 {mu}g m{sup -3} of H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} particles. Further tests showed that increasing O{sub 3} concentrations and residence time increased the H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} production. A field chamber was built subsequently and used in a toxicological study. Diluted coal-fired power plant emissions were introduced in the chamber. Over 19 days of exposure, the chamber, on average, converted 17% of the supplied SO{sub 2} emissions and produced an average of 350 {mu}g m{sup -3} of H{sub 2}SO{sub 4} particles. Particle losses were determined for the pilot chamber, using artificial particles whose size ranged from 50 to 1000 nm. The determined losses ranged from 21 to 42%, with no trend between the amount of particle loss and particle size. Losses for the field chamber, estimated using model calculations, were found to be similar to those of the pilot chamber.","","","","","","United States","2007-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Inhalation Toxicology; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 597-606","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0895-8378; INHTE5; TRN: 071000136","10.1080/08958370701353361","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20939521","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20939521","","Inhalation Toxicology","8","19"

In fact, you could argue that other technologies are further down the evolutionary timeline. Case in point: Clean Energy Systems' adaptation of rocket engine technology to radically change the way fuel is burned. The result is a true zero-emissions power plant. Its most distinctive element is an oxy-combustor, similar to one used in rocket engines, that generates steam by burning clean, gaseous fuel in the presence of gaseous oxygen and water. The clean fuel is prepared by processing a conventional fossil fuel such as coal-derived syngas, refinery residues, biomass or biodigester gas, or natural or landfill gas. Combustion takes place at near-stoichiometric conditions to produce a mixture of steam and CO{sub 2} at high temperature and pressure. The steam conditions are suitable for driving a conventional or advanced steam turbine-generator, or a gas turbine modified to be driven by high-temperature steam or to do work as an expansion unit at intermediate pressure. After pressure through the turbine(s), the steam/CO{sub 2} mixture is condensed, cooled, and separated into water and CO{sub 2}. The CO{sub 2} can be sequestered and/or purified and sold for commercial use. Durability and performance tests carried out between March 2005 and March 2006 produced excellent results. CO and NOx emissions are considerably low than those of combined-cycle power plants fuelled by natural gas and using selective catalytic reduction for NOx control. Work is continuing under an NETL grant. Progress and plans are reported in the article. 7 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: klpronske@cleanenergysystems.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-40","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 070900261","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20923945","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20923945","","Power (New York)","6","151"

An optimum plan is necessary for catalyst replacement or addition. SCR systems should be inspected and evaluated at least once a year. Levels of deactivation agents, most often arsenic and calcium oxide, need to match the particular coals used. Tools such as Cormetech's FIELD Guide are available to quantify the effect on catalyst life under various fuel-firing scenarios. Tests should be conducted to evaluate the NH{sub 3}/NOx distribution over time to maximise catalyst performance.

The U.S. has large coal resources, the cheapest fuel in most areas. Coal fired power plants are likely to continue to provide much of U.S. electricity. However, the type of power plant that should be built is unclear. Technology can reduce pollutant discharges and capture and sequester the CO{sub 2} from coal-fired generation. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides incentives for large scale commercial deployment of Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems (e.g., loan guarantees and project tax credits). This analysis examines whether a new coal plant should be pulverized coal (PC) or IGCC. Do stricter emissions standards (PM, SO{sub 2}, NOx, Hg) justify the higher costs of IGCC over PC? How does potential future carbon legislation affect the decision to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology? Finally, can the impact of uncertain carbon legislation be minimized? We find that SO{sub 2}, NOx, PM, and Hg emission standards would have to be far more stringent than twice current standards to justify the increased costs of the IGCC system. A CO{sub 2} tax less than $29/ton would lead companies to continuing to choose PC, paying the tax for emitted CO{sub 2}. The earlier a decision-maker believes the carbon tax will be imposed and the higher the tax, the more likely companies will choose IGCC with CCS. Having government announce the date and level of a carbon tax would promote more sensible decisions, but government would have to use a tax or subsidy to induce companies to choose the technology that is best for society. 14 refs., 6 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: jbergers@ucalgary.ca","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3431-3436","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 070800080","10.1021/es062198e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20905840","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20905840","","Environmental Science and Technology","10","41"

We simulated various ways by which emission reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) could be distributed to reach national emissions caps. We applied a source-receptor matrix to determine the PM2.5 concentration changes associated with each control scenario and estimated the mortality reductions. We estimated changes in the spatial inequality of health risk using the Atkinson index and other indicators, following previously derived axioms for measuring health risk inequality. In our baseline model, benefits ranged from 17,000-21,000 fewer premature deaths per year across control scenarios. Scenarios with greater health benefits also tended to have greater reductions in the spatial inequality of health risk, as many sources with high health benefits per unit emissions of SO{sub 2} were in areas with high background PM2.5 concentrations. Sensitivity analyses indicated that conclusions were generally robust to the choice of indicator and other model specifications. Our analysis demonstrates an approach for formally quantifying both the magnitude and spatial distribution of health benefits of pollution control strategies, allowing for joint consideration of efficiency and equity.","","","","","","United States","2007-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Health Perspectives; Journal Volume: 115; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 743-750","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0091-6765; EVHPAZ; TRN: 070800448","10.1289/ehp.9712","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","20906021","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20906021","","Environmental Health Perspectives","5","115"

This process which produces sequestration ready CO2 systems is a promising technology to be utilized with coal gasification systems. In the present work, chemical-looping combustion has been studied with an oxygen carrier, NiO/bentonite (60 wt % NiO) for the gasification systems utilizing simulated synthesis gas. Global reaction rates of reduction and oxidation as a function of conversion were calculated for oxidation-reduction cycles utilizing the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data on multicycle tests conducted with NiO/bentonite at atmospheric pressure between 700 and 900 °C. The rate of reduction increased slightly with an increase in temperature, while the rate of oxidation decreased at 900 °C. The effect of particle size of the oxygen carrier on CLC was studied for the particle size between 20 and 200 mesh. The rates of reactions depended on the particle size of the oxygen carrier. The smaller the particle size, the higher the reaction rates. The multicycle CLC tests conducted in a high-pressure flow reactor showed stable reactivity for the production of CO2 from fuel gas at 800 and 900 °C and full consumption of hydrogen during the reaction. The data from a one cycle test on the effect of the pressure on the performance with NiO/bentonite utilizing the tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) showed a positive effect of the pressure on the global rates of reduction-oxidation reactions at higher fractional conversions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of the NiO phase in NiO/bentonite with the oxidized sample in the highpressure reactor and Ni phase with the reduced sample. The presence of a small amount of NiO in the reduced sample detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) may be due to its exposure to air during sample transfer from the reactor to XPS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed no significant changes in morphology of NiO/bentonite reacted in the temperature range 700-800 °C in an atmospheric TGA for 10 oxidation-reduction cycles, but some loss of surface area and porosity was observed at 900 °C. This effect was found to be greater with increase in the particle size of the oxygen carrier.","American Chemical Society","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2007-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: 1582-1591","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-136","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624","10.1021/ef0604947","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","915399","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/915399","","Energy and Fuels","3","21"

Further investigation performed on the samples using electronic microscopy (SEM) coupled with X-ray analysis (EDX) evidenced the presence of solid spherical particles, plerosphere, with typical dimensions ranging between 200 nm and 2-3 {mu}m, whose atomic composition contains a large amount of the trace metals present in the parent oils (Fe, V, Ni, etc.). EDX analyses revealed that the metal concentration increases as the plerosphere dimension decreases. We also observed that the use of emulsion slightly reduce the emission of fine particles (D{sub 50} &lt; 8 {mu}m) in the large scale plant.

This new system consumes coal and natural gas as fuel simultaneously, and cogenerates methanol and power. Coal and natural gas are utilized synthetically based on the method of dual-fuel reforming, which integrates the methane/steam reforming and the combustion of coal. During the dual-fuel reforming process, combustion of coal provides high-temperature thermal energy to methane/steam reforming reaction to product syngas. Then, the chemical energy of syngas is used efficiently since the new system integrates the chemical process and power plant. In this manner the energy including both chemical energy of fuels and thermal energy can be used more, effectively from the viewpoint of the whole system. As a result, the total energy efficiency of this new system was about 60-66%. Compared with the conventional systems, the new system provides an energy savings of about 8-15%. The results obtained here indicate that this new system may provide a new way to utilize coal and natural gas more efficiently and economically.","","","","","","United States","2007-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 331-337","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 070800177","10.1115/1.2432895","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20905923","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20905923","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","129"

This natural cycle of uptake and release of carbon is roughly in balance. However, the global industrialization of the past two centuries has released carbon to the atmosphere, mostly in the form of CO{sub 2} that had been locked up in underground coal, oil, and natural gas deposits for millions of years. It is primarily combustion of these long-stored fossil fuels that threatens to tip the balance of the carbon cycle, leading to a substantial buildup of CO{sub 2} in the upper atmosphere. Scientists believe that one key to stabilizing future atmospheric CO{sub 2} concentrations will be essentially to close the fuel carbon cycle, to capture the carbon from fossil fuels before it is released to the atmosphere and return it to permanent reservoirs in the earth or oceans. The article summarises the various options for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and looks at the state of development of technologies. It also addresses regulatory uncertainties, legal issues risks and perceptions of CCS. 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4-13","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 070600047","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20885843","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20885843","","EPRI Journal","",""

Several technological approaches have been proposed, but all options currently available would, indeed, impose substantial costs and impact plant efficiencies. Ongoing research promises to provide a suite of improved technologies that will give plant owners viable options to meet their specific needs. The article discusses the options for CO{sub 2} capture by precombustion based on IGCC systems, post combustion, or oxyfuel combustion. EPRI's work to develop a process to capture CO{sub 2} using chilled ammonia (rather than the more usual MEA) as a solvent is described. A 5 MW pilot plant is to be built at the We Energies Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. Other research programs (in Europe and Australia) are also mentioned. Deployment of a new generation of ultrasuperciritcal pulverized coal power plants designed to have greater efficiency and hence lower CO{sub 2} emissions is under development. Efforts to improve precombustion capture are reported in the article. Also noted are two recent studies (one by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R & D Programme and another by CPS Energy) comparing the performance of IGCC and supercritical PC plants incorporating CO{sub 2} capture. 3 figs., 3 photos.","","","","","","United States","2007-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 070600048","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20885844","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20885844","","EPRI Journal","",""

In this paper, a numerical technique for determining the heat flux absorbed by the water-wall tubes, water-steam temperature, and thermal resistance on the inner tube surface from a temperature measured at several interior locations of the tube wall is developed. The scale deposition tube is capable of monitoring changes in the flow of heat transfer caused by scale depositions and changes due to varying furnace conditions. It can work for a long time in the destructive high-temperature atmosphere of a coal-fired boiler.

Five notable plumes of SO{sub 2}, apparently from coal-fired power plants, were intercepted, and had NH{sub 4}{sup +}/SO4{sup 2-} molar ratios ranging from approximately 0.8 to 1.4 compared to molar ratios near 2 outside of the plumes. Sulfate aerosol concentrations increased from a regional background of 5 - 8 {mu} g m{sup -3} to as high as 19.5 {mu} g m{sup -3} within these plumes. No increase in WSOC concentrations was observed in plumes compared to out-of-plumes within a WSOC measurement uncertainty of 8%. These measurements suggest that secondary organic aerosol formation via heterogeneous acid-catalyzed reactions within power plant plumes are not likely a significant contributor to the ambient aerosol mass loading in Atlanta and the surrounding region. Because this region is rich in both biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic carbon (VOC), the results may be widely applicable.","","","","","","United States","2007-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6801","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; GPRLAJ; TRN: 070700051","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20892699","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20892699","","Geophysical Research Letters","6","34"

In many instances, the key to a successful process operation is how well the solids transfer and control system has been designed. This is particularly true in a transport gasifier and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustors, which are dependent upon the rapid and reliable circulation of solids to maintain a constant solids concentration in the CFB. Proper design and operation of solids returning systems are essential to the performance and operation of CFB combustion systems. An experimental investigation was conducted at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to study the flow and control of a light material (cork), which has a particle density of 189 kg/m3 and a mean diameter of 812 ím, through a nonmechanical valve, or loopseal, in a 0.3 m diameter CFB cold model. Fluidizing this material in ambient air approximates the same gas:solids density ratio as coal and coal char in a pressurized gasifier. The loopseal is composed of the lower section of the standpipe, an upward-flowing fluidized-bed section, and a downwardly angled overflow tube which is connected to the desired return point at the bottom of the riser. In the nonmechanical valve, both the standpipe and the fluidized-bed up-flow section of the loopseal were aerated and fluidized with air, respectively. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of standpipe aeration, loopseal aeration, solids inventory, and superficial gas velocity through the riser on the flow rate of circulating solids. A correlation that predicts the solids flow rate as a function of these variables was developed. Comparison of the correlation with the experimental data is discussed. Pressure drop across the fluidized-bed up-flow section of the loopseal was found to increase slightly with the solid flow rates.","American Chemical Society","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2007-03-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 46; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: 1843-1850","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-094","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: US200802%%518","10.1021/ie0606486","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","913017","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/913017","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","46"

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to determine information about the speciation and binding of mercury on two commercially available brominated activated carbons. The results are compared with similar analysis of a conventional (non-halogenated) and chlorinated activated carbon. Both the XAS and XPS results indicate that the mercury, though introduced as elemental vapor, is consistently bound on the carbon in the oxidized form. The conventional and chlorinated activated carbons appeared to contain mercury bound to chlorinated sites and possibly to sulfate species that have been incorporated onto the carbon from adsorbed SO{sub 2}. The mercury-containing brominated sorbents appear to contain mercury bound primarily at bromination sites. The mechanism of capture for the sorbents likely consists of surface-enhanced oxidation of the elemental mercury vapor via interaction with surface-bound halide species with subsequent binding by surface halide or sulfate species. 22 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: hutson.nick@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1747-1752","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 070500212","10.1021/es062121q","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20885662","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20885662","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","41"

The economic analyses are reported on a plant-specific basis in terms of the cost required to achieve low (50%), mid (70%), and high (90%) levels of mercury removal 'above and beyond' the baseline mercury removal achieved by existing emission control equipment. In other words, the levels of mercury control are directly attributable to ACI. Mercury control costs via ACI have been amortized on a current dollar basis. Using a 20-year book life, levelized costs for the incremental increase in cost of electricity (COE), expressed in mills per kilowatt-hour (mills/kWh), and the incremental cost of mercury control, expressed in dollars per pound of mercury removed ($/lb Hg removed), have been calculated for each level of ACI mercury control. For this analysis, the increase in COE varied from 0.14 mills/kWh to 3.92 mills/kWh. Meanwhile, the incremental cost of mercury control ranged from $3810/lb Hg removed to $166 000/lb Hg removed. 13 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Andrew.Jones@netl.doe.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1365-1371","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000400380","10.1021/es0617340","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20862368","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20862368","","Environmental Science and Technology","4","41"

The gas-phase oxidation rates of Hg{sup 0} by Br{sub 2} decreased with increasing temperatures. SO{sub 2}, CO, HCl, and H{sub 2}O had insignificant effect, while NO exhibited a reverse course of effect on the Hg{sup 0} oxidation: promotion at low NO concentrations and inhibition at high NO concentrations. A reaction mechanism involving the formation of van der Waals clusters is proposed to account for NO's reverse effect. The apparent gas-phase oxidation rate constant, obtained under conditions simulating a flue gas without flyash, was 3.61 x 10{sup -17} cm{sup 3}molecule{sup -1}s{sup -1} at 410 K corresponding to a 50% Hg{sup 0} oxidation using 52 ppm Br{sub 2} in a reaction time of 15 s. Flyash in flue gas significantly promoted the oxidation of Hg{sup 0} by Br{sub 2}, and the unburned carbon component played a major role in the promotion primarily through the rapid adsorption of Br{sub 2} which effectively removed Hg{sup 0} from the gas phase. At a typical flue gas temperature, SO{sub 2} slightly inhibited the flyash-induced Hg{sup 0} removal. Conversely, NO slightly promoted the flyash induced Hg{sup 0} removal by Br{sub 2}. Norit Darco-Hg-LH and Darco-Hg powder activated carbons, which have been demonstrated in field tests, were inferred for estimating the flyash induced Hg{sup 0} oxidation by Br{sub 2}. Approximately 60% of Hg{sup 0} is estimated to be oxidized with the addition of 0.4 ppm of gaseous Br{sub 2} into full scale power plant flue gas. 21 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: sgchang@lbl.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1405-1412","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000400381","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20862369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20862369","","Environmental Science and Technology","4","41"

In 2006 the company completed another strategic view research report covering the electric power, oil, gas and unconventional energy industries and manufacturing industry. This article summarises the strategic view findings and then revisits some of the scenarios presented in 2003. The cost per megawatt-hour of the alternatives is given for plants ordered in 2005 and then in 2025. The issue of greenhouse gas regulation is dealt with through carbon sequestration and carbon allowances or an equivalent carbon tax. Results reveal substantial variability through nuclear power, hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass remain competitive through every scenario. Greenhouse gas scenario analysis shows coal still be viable, albeit less competitive against nuclear and renewable technologies. A carbon tax or allowance at $24 per metric ton has the same effect on IGCC cost as a sequestration mandate. However, the latter would hurt gas plants much more than a tax or allowance. Sequestering CO{sub 2} from a gas plant is almost as costly per megawatt-hour as for coal. 5 refs., 5 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 20,22,24,26,28,30","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 070600050","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20885846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20885846","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","2","111"
"Dilution-based emissions sampling from stationary sources: part 1 - compact sampler methodology and performance","England, G C; Watson, J G; Chow, J C; Zielinska, B; Chang, M C.O.; Loos, K R; M, Hidy G","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 03 NATURAL GAS; 02 PETROLEUM; AIR SAMPLERS; STATIONARY POLLUTANT SOURCES; EMISSION; SAMPLING; MEASURING METHODS; PERFORMANCE; AIR POLLUTION MONITORING; DESIGN; US EPA; NATURAL GAS; COMBUSTORS; DIESEL FUELS; EXHAUST GASES; FLUE GAS; PARTICULATES; VOLATILE MATTER; PARTICLE SIZE; DILUTION; BENCH-SCALE EXPERIMENTS; FIELD TESTS; REFINERY GASES; FUEL GAS; CHEMICAL EFFLUENTS; GASEOUS WASTES; COAL","The paper presents the design and performance of a compact dilution sampler (CDS) for characterizing fine particle emissions from stationary sources. The sampler is described, along with the methodology adopted for its use. Dilution sampling has a number of advantages, including source emissions that are measured under conditions simulating stack gas entry and mixing in the ambient atmosphere. This is particularly important for characterizing the semivolatile species in effluents as a part of particulate emissions. The CDS characteristics and performance are given, along with sampling methodology. The CDS was compared with a reference dilution sampler. The results indicate that the two designs are comparable for tests on gas-fired units and a diesel electrical generator. The performance data indicate that lower detection limits can be achieved relative to current regulatory methods for particulate emissions. Test data for the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions are provided for comparison with US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Conditional Test Method 040 for filterable particulate matter (FPM) and the EPA Method 202 for condensable particulate matter. This comparison showed important differences between methods, depending on whether a comparison is done between in situ FPM determinations or the sum of such values with condensable PM from liquid filled impingers chilled in an ice bath. These differences are interpretable in the light of semivolatile material present in the stack effluent and, in some cases, differences in detection and quantification limits. Determination of emissions from combustors using liquid fuels can be readily achieved using 1-hr sampling with the CDS. Emissions from gas-fired combustors are low, requiring careful attention to sample volumes. 41 refs., 9 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: dhidy113@comcast.net","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 65-78","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000300071","10.1080/10473289.2007.10465291","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","20847485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20847485","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","1","57"

Emissions data for gas-fired combustors are presented, using dilution sampling as the reference. The sampling and analysis of the collected particles in the presence of precursor gases, SO{sub 2}, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compound, and NH{sub 3} is discussed; the results include data from eight gas fired units, including a dual- fuel institutional boiler and a diesel engine powered electricity generator. These data are compared with results in the literature for heavy-duty diesel vehicles and stationary sources using coal or wood as fuels. The results show that the gas-fired combustors have very low PM2.5 mass emission rates in the range of {approximately}10{sup -4} lb/million Btu (MMBTU) compared with the diesel backup generator with particle filter, with {approximately} 5 x 10{sup -3} lb/MMBTU. Even higher mass emission rates are found in coal-fired systems, with rates of {approximately} 0.07 lb/MMBTU for a bag-filter-controlled pilot unit burning eastern bituminous coal. The characterization of PM2.5 chemical composition from the gas-fired units indicates that much of the measured primary particle mass in PM2.5 samples is organic or elemental carbon and, to a much less extent, sulfate. Metal emissions are low compared with the diesel engines and the coal- or wood-fueled combustors. The metals found in the gas- fired combustor particles are low in concentration. The interpretation of the particulate carbon emissions is complicated by the fact that an approximately equal amount of particulate carbon is found on the particle collector and a backup filter. It is likely that measurement artifacts are positively biasing 'true' particulate carbon emissions results. 49 refs., 1 fig., 12 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: dhidy113@comcast.net","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 79-93","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000300072","10.1080/10473289.2007.10465304","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","20847486","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20847486","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","1","57"

A predictive tool capable of assessing corrosion potential and aiding in the design of problem solutions could help alleviate the utility downtime and cost associated with waterwall wastage. Waterwall wastage has been associated with various mechanisms, including gaseous phase reducing sulfur species, wall deposition of unoxidized sulfur fuel, and fuel chlorine. Integration of predictive correlations for corrosion into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code can provide a framework for evaluation of corrosion potential. In this paper, CFD studies and predictions of corrosion in five utility boilers are examined and compared with observed wastage. The CFD code makes use of approximations of empirically developed corrosion correlations for gaseous phase reducing sulfur species, wall deposition of unoxidized sulfur fuel, and fuel chlorine. Model corrosion predictions are compared with observed or measured wastage in several coal-fired utility boilers, including tangentially fired, wall-fired, and cyclone-fired units. 15 refs., 12 figs.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: valentine@reaction-eng.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 242-249","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 000400123","10.1021/ef0602067","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20862168","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20862168","","Energy and Fuels","1","21"

The facility matches the gas temperature and velocity of modern first-stage high-pressure turbine vanes. A natural gas combustor was seeded with finely ground fuel ash particulate from four different fuels: straw, sawdust, coal, and petroleum coke. The entrained ash particles were accelerated to a combustor exit flow Mach number of 0.31 before impinging on a thermal barrier coating (TBC) target coupon at 1150{sup o}C. Postexposure analyses included surface topography, scanning electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. Due to significant differences in the chemical composition of the various fuel ash samples, deposit thickness and structure vary considerably for fuel. Biomass products (e.g., sawdust and straw) are significantly less prone to deposition than coal and petcoke for the same particle loading conditions. In a test simulating one turbine operating year at a moderate particulate loading of 0.02 parts per million by weight, deposit thickness from coal and petcoke ash exceeded 1 and 2 mm, respectively. These large deposits from coal and petcoke were found to detach readily from the turbine material with thermal cycling and handling. The smaller biomass deposit samples showed greater tenacity, in adhering to the TBC surface. In all cases, corrosive elements (e.g., Na, K, V, Cl, S) were found to penetrate the TBC layer during the accelerated deposition test. Implications for the power generation goal of fuel flexibility are discussed.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 135-143","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: 000400257","10.1115/1.2181181","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20862297","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20862297","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","129"

However transmissions constraints are great, especially in the Northwest and upper Midwest, where abundant wind resources span sparsely populated regions. These areas also hold major deposits of coal. Partnerships are being developed to share transmission to accommodate both new wind and new coal-fired capacity. Wyoming may well be the epicentre of the issue. Another idea, in wind-prone Texas, is to further integrate wind with baseload fossil power resources by creation of competitive renewable energy zones (CREZs). New transmission corridors will be set up linking the renewable energy zones to power markets in ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. There are problems of co-developing coal and wind capacity with common transmission. If coal gasification technology emerges on a commercial scale there would be a good opportunity for integrated gasification combined cycle which can cycle to firm up variable wind generation. Several coal companies in Wyoming are considering gasifying coal and putting it into the pipeline. 2 photos.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 111; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-20,22","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 070600014","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20885816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20885816","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","1","111"

"Results of heat tests of the TGE-435 main boiler in the PGU-190/220 combined-cycle plant of the Tyumen' TETs-2 cogeneration plant","Kurochkin, A V; Kovalenko, A L; Kozlov, V G; Krivobok, A I","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; COMBINED-CYCLE POWER PLANTS; COGENERATION; BOILERS; FURNACES; BURNERS; COMBUSTION; PERFORMANCE TESTING; FLUE GAS; SUPERHEATERS; LOADING; RECYCLING","Special features of operation of a boiler operating as a combined-cycle plant and having its own furnace and burner unit are descried. The flow of flue gases on the boiler is increased due to feeding of exhaust gases of the GTU into the furnace, which intensifies the convective heat exchange. In addition, it is not necessary to preheat air in the convective heating surfaces (the boiler has no air preheater). The convective heating surfaces of the boiler are used for heating the feed water, thus replacing the regeneration extractions of the steam turbine (HPP are absent in the circuit) and partially replacing the preheating of condensate (the LPP in the circuit of the unit are combined with preheaters of delivery water). Regeneration of the steam turbine is primarily used for the district cogeneration heating purposes. The furnace and burner unit of the exhaust-heat boiler (which is a new engineering solution for the given project) ensures utilization of not only the heat of the exhaust gases of the GTU but also of their excess volume, because the latter contains up to 15% oxygen that oxidizes the combustion process in the boiler. Thus, the gas temperature at the inlet to the boiler amounts to 580{sup o}C at an excess air factor a = 3.50; at the outlet these parameters are utilized to T{sub out} = 139{sup o}C and a{sub out} = 1.17. The proportions of the GTU/boiler loads that can actually be organized at the generating unit (and have been checked by testing) are presented and the proportions of loads recommended for the most efficient operation of the boiler are determined. The performance characteristics of the boiler are presented for various proportions of GTU/boiler loads. The operating conditions of the superheater and of the convective trailing heating surfaces are presented as well as the ecological parameters of the generating unit.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Technology and Engineering; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: TN: Translation of Elektricheskie Stantsii, (12); p 26-21; Dec 2006; Related Information: Translation of Elektricheskie Stantsii, (12); p 26-21; Dec 2006","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 50-56","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1570-145X; TRN: 080200169","10.1007/s10749-007-0012-5","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20978372","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20978372","","Power Technology and Engineering","1","41"
"The effect of IGFC warm gas cleanup system conditions on the gas–solid partitioning and form of trace species in coal syngas and their interactions with SOFC anodes","Trembly, J P; Gemmen, R S; Bayless, D J","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; Syngas; Coal; Solid oxide; Fuel cell; Trace specie","The U.S. Department of Energy is currently working on coupling coal gasification and high temperature fuel cell to produce electrical power in a highly efficient manner while being emissions free. Many investigations have already investigated the effects of major coal syngas species such as CO and H2S. However coal contains many trace species and the effect of these species on solid oxide fuel cell anode is not presently known.Warm gas cleanup systems are planned to be used with these advanced power generation systems for the removal of major constituents such as H2S and HCl but the operational parameters of such systems is not well defined at this point in time. This paper focuses on the effect of anticipated warm gas cleanup conditions has on trace specie partitioning between the vapor and condensed phase and the effects the trace vapor species have on the SOFC anode. Results show that Be, Cr, K, Na, V, and Z trace species will form condensed phases and should not effect SOFC anode performance since it is anticipated that the warm gas cleanup systems will have a high removal efficiency of particulate matter. Also the results show that Sb, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, P, and Se trace species form vapor phases and the Sb, As, and P vapor phase species show the ability to form secondary Ni phases in the SOFC anode.","Elsevier","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Power Sources; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: Fuel Processing for Hydrogen Production Symposium at the 230th American Chemical Society National Meeting Washington, DC, Aug. 28-Sept. 1, 2005; Related Information: This issue of journal was for selected papers presented at the FUEL PROCESSING FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYMPOSIUM at the 230th American Chemical SocietyNational Meeting Washington, DC, USA, 28 August-1 September 2005","","Medium: X; Size: 986-996","","DOE/NETL-IR-2005-134","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-7753","10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.10.020","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","912830","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/912830","","Journal of Power Sources","2","163"

Advanced concepts for IGCC systems that incorporate state-of-the-art gas turbine systems, however, are not commercially demonstrated. Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding the future commercial-scale performance, emissions, and cost of such technologies. The Frame 7F gas turbine represents current state-of-practice, whereas the Frame 7H is the most recently introduced advanced commercial gas turbine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risks and potential payoffs of IGCC technology based on different gas turbine combined cycle designs. Models of entrained-flow gasifier-based IGCC systems with Frame 7F (IGCC-7F) and 7H gas turbine combined cycles (IGCC-7H) were developed in ASPEN Plus. An uncertainty analysis was conducted. Gasifier carbon conversion and project cost uncertainty are identified as the most important uncertain inputs with respect to system performance and cost. The uncertainties in the difference of the efficiencies and costs for the two systems are characterized. Despite uncertainty, the IGCC-7H system is robustly preferred to the IGCC-7F system. Advances in gas turbine design will improve the performance, emissions, and cost of IGCC systems. The implications of this study for decision-making regarding technology selection, research planning, and plant operation are discussed. 38 refs., 11 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: frey@enos.ncsu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1649-1661","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200023","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838179","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","12","56"

The water-soluble elemental compositions of PM2.5 samples collected at four satellite monitoring sites in the surrounding region were also determined. Fe was the most abundant but least water soluble of the elements determined at the Steubenville site. Fe solubility and its correlations with SO{sub 4}{sup 2-} and temperature varied by season. Higher ambient concentrations were observed at Steubenville than at each of the four satellite sites for 10 of the 18 elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, and Zn) determined in the water-soluble PM2.5 fraction. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Zn at Steubenville were substantially higher than concentrations reported recently for larger U.S. cities. An (NH{sub 4}){sub 2}SO{sub 4}-dominated source, likely representing secondary PM2.5 from coal-fired plants to the west and southwest of Steubenville, accounted for 42% of the PM2.5 mass, and two sources likely dominated by emissions from motor vehicles and from iron and steel facilities in the immediate Steubenville vicinity accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively. Other sources included a primary coal combustion source (3%). Results suggest the importance of very different regional and local source mechanisms in contributing to PM2.5 mass at Steubenville and reinforce the need for further research to elucidate whether metals such as Fe, Mn, and Zn play a role in the PM2.5 health effects observed previously there. 76 refs., 8 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: danielconnel@consolenergy.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1750-1766","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200028","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464580","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","20838184","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838184","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","12","56"

The pressurized pulverized coal combustion (PPCC) combined cycle is a coal fired combined cycle concept which is able to achieve efficiencies in excess of 53%. The direct use of the hot flue gas for driving a gas turbine requires a hot gas cleanup to achieve corrosion prevention of the turbine blading. One of the main problems is the release of alkalis during the coal combustion process. Therefore, the thermodynamic basics for the control of alkali vapor pressures in the hot flue gas of PPCC have been investigated by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and Knudsen effusion mass spectrometric measurements on alkali oxide activities in and alkali partial pressures over coal ash slags with and without additives and alkali laden model sorbents. The obtained results reveal that the requirements of the gas turbine manufacturers regarding alkali concentration in the hot flue gas should be satisfiable by certain aluminosilicate sorbents. On the basis of these results, a concept for alkali vapor removal is proposed. 20 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: mic.mueller@fz-juelich.de","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2593-2598","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 000200117","10.1021/ef060305k","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838264","","Energy and Fuels","6","20"

Microcosm experiments were performed in which Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 8806 and Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 8807 were tested for their ability to calcify when exposed to a fixed calcium concentration of 3.4 mM and bicarbonate concentrations of 0.5, 1.25 and 2.5 mM. Disappearance of soluble calcium was used as an indicator of CaCO3 formation; results from metabolically active microcosms were compared to controls with no cells or no carbonate added. Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 8806 removed calcium continuously over the duration of the experiment with approximately 18.6 mg of calcium in the solid phase. Calcium removal occurred over a two-day time period when Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 8807 was tested and only 8.9 mg of calcium was removed in the solid phase. The ability of the cyanobacteria to create an alkaline growth environment appeared to be the primary factor responsible for CaCO3 precipitation in these experiments.

This is one of several sorbent injection technologies under development by the U.S. Department of Energy for capturing mercury from coal-fired electric utility boilers. A unique feature of the Thief Process involves the production of a thermally activated sorbent in situ at the power plant. The sorbent is obtained by inserting a lance, or thief, into the combustor, in or near the flame, and extracting a mixture of partially combusted coal and gas. The partially combusted coal or sorbent has adsorptive properties suitable for the removal of vapor-phase mercury at flue gas temperatures that are typical downstream of a power plant preheater. One proposed scenario, similar to activated carbon injection (ACI), involves injecting the extracted sorbent into the downstream ductwork between the air preheater and the particulate collection device of the power plant. Initial laboratory-scale and pilot-scale testing, using an eastern bituminous coal, focused on the concept validation. Subsequent pilot-scale testing, using a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal, focused on the process development and optimization. The results of the experimental studies, as well as an independent experimental assessment, are detailed. In addition, the results of a preliminary economic analysis that documents the costs and the potential economic advantages of the Thief Process for mercury control are discussed.","Elsevier B.V.","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2006-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel Processing Technology; Journal Volume: 87; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: X; Size: 1071-1084","","DOE/NETL-IR-2007-056","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0378-3820; TRN: US200804%%1359","10.1016/j.fuproc.2006.05.006","","2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","923628","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/923628","","Fuel Processing Technology","12","87"

A one-dimensional model has been developed to predict the behavior of arsenic in the postcombustion region of a coal-fired boiler as a function of gas residence time. The purpose of the model is to calculate the partitioning of arsenic between the vapor phase from volatilization and arsenic on the ash particles due to surface reaction and/or condensation at temperatures characteristic of SCR systems. The model accounts for heterogeneous condensation of arsenic on the fly ash, as well as surface reaction for two regimes: (1) the free molecular regime (submicrometer ash particles) and (2) the continuum regime (supermicrometer ash particles). All gas properties are computed as functions of gas temperature, pressure, and composition, which are allowed to vary. The arsenic model can be used to calculate the impact of coal composition on vapor-phase arsenic at SCR inlet temperatures, which will help utilities better manage coal quality and increase catalyst lifetimes on units operating with SCR. The arsenic model has been developed and implemented and was tested against experimental data for several coals.

Compared with commercial PACs (CPACs), an alternative PAC derived from waste tires (WPAC) was prepared for this study. The equilibrium adsorptive capacity of mercury chloride (HgCl{sub 2}) vapor onto the WPAC was further evaluated with a self-designed bench-scale adsorption column system. The adsorption temperatures investigated in the adsorption column were controlled at 25 and 150{sup o}C. The superficial velocity and residence time of the flow were 0.01 m/sec and 4 sec, respectively. The adsorption column tests were run under nitrogen gas flow. Experimental results showed that WPAC with higher Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area could adsorb more HgCl{sub 2} at room temperature. The equilibrium adsorptive capacity of HgCl{sub 2} for WPAC measured in this study was 1.49 x 10{sup -1} mg HgCl{sub 2}/g PAC at 25{sup o}C with an initial HgCl{sub 2} concentration of 25 {mu}g/m{sup 3}. With the increase of adsorption temperature {le} 150{sup o}C, the equilibrium adsorptive capacity of HgCl{sub 2} for WPAC was decreased to 1.34 x 10{sup -1} mg HgCl{sub 2}/g PAC. Furthermore, WPAC with higher sulfur contents could adsorb even more HgCl{sub 2}. It was demonstrated that the mechanisms for adsorbing HgCl{sub 2} onto WPAC were physical adsorption and chemisorption at 25 and 150{sup o}C, respectively. 35 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: ycsngi@mail.nsycu.edu.tw","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1558-1566","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200037","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464562","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","20838193","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838193","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","11","56"

The U.S. Office of Management and Budget found that the Acid Rain Program has accounted for the largest quantified human health benefits of any federal regulatory program implemented in the last 10 yr, with annual benefits exceeding costs by {gt} 40 to 1. The authors believe that the elements described in this paper greatly contributed to this success. EPA has used the ARP fundamental elements as a model for other cap-and-trade programs, including the NBTP, which went into effect in 2003, and the recently published Clean Air Interstate Rule and Clean Air Mercury Rule. The authors believe that using these fundamental elements to develop and implement the MRV portion of their cap-and-trade programs has resulted in public confidence in the programs, highly accurate and complete emissions data, and a high compliance rate. 2 refs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: schakenbach.john@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1576-1583","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200038","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464565","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","20838194","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838194","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","11","56"

The air quality monitoring data used for this study are from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments network for the period of 2001-2003 for the Underhill site. The main source-receptor modeling techniques used are the positive matrix factorization (PMF) and potential source contribution function (PSCF). This new study is intended as a comparison to a previous study of the 1988-1995 Underhill data that successfully revealed a total of 11 types of emission sources with significant contributions to this rural site. This new study has identified a total of nine sources: nitrate-rich secondary aerosol, wood smoke, East Coast oil combustion, automobile emission, metal working, soil/dust, sulfur-rich aerosol type I, sulfur-rich aerosol type II, and sea salt/road salt. Furthermore, the mass contributions from the PMF identified sources that correspond with sampling days with either good or poor visibility were analyzed to seek possible correlations. It has been shown that sulfur-rich aerosol type I, nitrate aerosol, and automobile emission are the most important contributors to visibility degradation. Soil/dust and sea salt/road salt also have an added effect. 38 refs., 17 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: ngao@stlawu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1607-1620","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200039","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838195","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838195","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","11","56"

State environmental agencies typically issue such permits, either under state law or by exercising delegated authority to implement the federal PSD program. To fully comply with the CAA, the emissions limits identified as BACT must incorporate consideration of more than just add-on emissions control technology, they must also reflect appropriate considerations of fuel quality (e.g. low-sulfur coal) and process changes (e.g. advanced combustion techniques) as a means of controlling emissions, and must consider the other environmental and public welfare benefits of the identified emissions control options. Several states including New Mexico and Illinois have already determined that innovated technologies, such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), must be considered in connection with the BACT analysis for new coal-fired power plants. Even the notion that BACT is categorically limited in scope to the general type of facility proposed is contrary to EPA precedent. For example, the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) has explained that permitting authorities retain the discretion under the definition of BACT to require dramatically different facility designs (e.g. a natural gas plant instead of a coal-fired power plant). The best advice for any permit applicant is to include in the BACT analysis a careful and honest examination of better performing alternative processes and/or innovative combustion techniques and to aggressively pursue such options wherever feasible. 17 refs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM; Other Information: psimms@nrdc.org","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 20-23","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 000200162","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838305","","EM","",""

The PSD regulations also impose BACT requirements on modifications to existing major sources that result in significant net emissions increases. Rather than a specific technology, BACT is an achievable emissions limitation (or work practice) determined by the permitting authority on a case-by- case basis, taking into account available technologies and energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT determinations are generally made by a state environmental agency after an opportunity for public comment. Increasingly, advocacy groups are challenging BACT decisions in administrative and judicial proceedings. As a result, the permitting process has been substantially delayed, even for facilities that have agreed to install state-of-the-art emissions control technology. This article outlines the key statutory and regulatory elements of BACT, how to analyze alternative technologies and emissions limitations, and prepare an application for an appropriate and final BACT determination. It is based largely on the regulatory definition of BACT and recent Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) decisions. Case-by-case BACT analyses do not necessarily yield a single, objectively correct BACT determination. The permitting agency must exercise a high degree of technical judgment in any BACT analysis, particularly for coal-fired plants, which use a wide variety of coals, combustion techniques, and other site-specific factors. 12 refs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EM; Other Information: kfinto@hunton.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1088-9981; TRN: 000200163","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838306","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838306","","EM","",""

The crucial economic decision whether to build supercritical or subcritical units often depends on assumptions concerning the reliability/availability of each technology, the cost of on-fuel operations including maintenance, the generation efficiencies and the potential for emissions credits at some future value. Modeling the influence of these key factors requires analysis and documentation to assure the assets actually meet the projected financial performance. This article addresses some of the issue related to the trade-offs that have the potential to be driven by the supercritical/subcritical decision. Solomon Associates has been collecting cost, generation and reliability data on coal-fired power generation assets for approximately 10 years using a strict methodology and taxonomy to categorize and compare actual plant operations data. This database provides validated information not only on performance, but also on alternative performance scenarios, which can provide useful insights in the pro forma financial analysis and models of new plants. 1 ref., 1 fig., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 10,12,14,16,18,20,228","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 000200191","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20838333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20838333","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","11","110"

John Hofmeister, president and CEO of Shell Oil Company chided lawmakers and regulators for hindering progress by not adopting uniform regulations for carbon dioxide emissions. Among Shell's IGCC projects is Australia's equivalent of the United States' FutureGen Project - a 275 MW power production facility in Queensland that is expected to achieve 99.8% CO{sub 2} capture with sequestration and produce hydrogen. Randy Zwirn, president nd CEO of Siemens Power Generation, said OEMs must develop a philosophy for IGCC that he terms RAM - reliability, availability and maintainability.

Lower molecular weight PAHs, including fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthrene, and pyrene, were dominant in the vapor phase, and higher molecular weight PAHs, including chrysene, benzo(a)pyrene, and coronene, were dominant in the particle phase. The highest PAH concentrations in both the vapor and particle phases were observed in Chicago followed by the semiurban site at Sturgeon Point, NY. The major sources of PAHs in and around Chicago are vehicle emissions, coal and natural gas combustion, and coke production. The spatial difference of PAH concentrations can be explained by the local population density. Long-term decreasing trends of most PAH concentrations were observed in both the vapor and particle phases at Chicago, with half-lives ranging from 3-10 years in the vapor phase and 5-15 years in the particle phase. At Eagle Harbor, Sleeping Bear Dunes, and Sturgeon Point, total PAH concentrations in the vapor phase showed significant, but slow, long-term decreasing trends. At the Sturgeon Point site, which was impacted by a nearby city, particle-phase PAH concentrations also declined.

Previous work has shown that combustion of a coal + tire blend rather than pure coal increased bulk emissions of various elements (e.g., Zn, As, Sb, Pb). The aim of this study is to characterize the chemical and structural properties of emitted single particles with dimensions &lt;2.5 {mu}m (PM2.5). This transmission electron microscope (TEM)-based study revealed that, in addition to phases typical of coal fly ash (e.g., aluminum-silicate glass, mullite), the emitted PM2.5 contains amorphous selenium particles and three types of crystalline metal sulfates never reported before from stack emissions. Anglesite, PbSO{sub 4}, is ubiquitous in the PM2.5 derived from both fuels and contains nearly all Pb present in the PM. Gunningite, ZnSO{sub 4}H{sub 2}O, is the main host for Zn and only occurs in the PM derived from the coal + tire blend, whereas yavapaiite, KFe{sup 3+}(SO{sub 4}){sub 2}, is present only when pure coal was combusted. It is concluded that these metal sulfates precipitated from the flue gas may be globally abundant aerosols and have, through hydration or dissolution, a major environmental and health impact. 66 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2006-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: giere@uni-freiburg.de","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6235-6240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000100081","10.1021/es060423m","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20823814","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20823814","","Environmental Science and Technology","20","40"
"Role of moisture in adsorption, photocatalytic oxidation, and reemission of elemental mercury on a SiO{sub 2}-TiO{sub 2} nanocomposite","Li, Ying; Wu, Chang-Yu","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; MERCURY; CAPTURE; SILICON OXIDES; TITANIUM OXIDES; COMPOSITE MATERIALS; ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION; MOISTURE; ADSORPTION; OXIDATION; WATER VAPOR; NANOSTRUCTURES; EMISSION; BENCH-SCALE EXPERIMENTS; PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS; CATALYSIS; MERCURY OXIDES; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL","A novel silica-titania (SiO{sub 2}-TiO{sub 2}) nanocomposite has been developed to effectively capture elemental mercury (Hg{sup 0}) under UV irradiation. Moisture has been reported to have an important impact on this nanocomposite's performance. In this work, the role of moisture on Hg{sup 0} removal and reemission as well as the corresponding mechanisms was investigated. Hg{sup 0} removal experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor at 65{sup o}C using air as the carrier gas. Without UV irradiation, Hg{sup 0} adsorption was found to be insignificant, but it could be enhanced by the photocatalytic oxidation product, mercuric oxide (Hg{sup 0}), possibly due to the high affinity between Hg{sup 0} and Hg{sup 0}. Under dry conditions 95% of Hg{sup 0} can be removed; however, increased humidity levels remarkably suppress both Hg{sup 0} adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation. Introducing water vapor can also result in significant reemission of captured Hg{sup 0} from the nanocomposite, which may be ascribed to the repellant effect of water vapor adsorbed on the superhydrophilic TiO{sub 2} surface. Exposure to UV light was found either to prohibit Hg{sup 0} reemission when photocatalytic oxidation of reemitted Hg{sup 0} prevailed or to promote Hg{sup 0} reemission when photocatalytic reduction of Hg{sup 0} to Hg{sup 0} dominated later on. The results indicate that minimization of Hg{sup 0} reemission can be achieved by appropriate application of UV irradiation. 25 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: cywu@ufl.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 6444-6448","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000100083","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20823816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20823816","","Environmental Science and Technology","20","40"

In sufficient concentration, SO{sub 3} also can increase corrosion and fouling of equipment and components downstream of the furnace while decreasing their efficiency and penalizing overall plant heat rate. This article, the first in a three part series, details the negative impacts of SO{sub 3} on operations and maintenance of back-end plant equipment. These include: reduction of unit heat rate and increased corrosion of downstream equipment due to the raising of dew point by SO{sub 3}; fouling of air heaters and SCR catalysts due to the reaction of SO{sub 3} with ammonia and competition of SO{sub 3} with mercury for adsorption sites on carbon particles, reducing the effectiveness of mercury emissions control. Part II will explain and quantify the potential benefits of limiting the concentration of SO{sub 3} in flue gas to 3ppm at the entrance to the air heater.

Coal represents 95% of US energy reserves as oppose to natural gas representing only 5%. Gasified coal allows particulates, SO{sub 2}, NOx, mercury and even CO{sub 2} to be captured prior to combustion, eliminating more complex post combustion capture. The technology to refuel combined cycle combustion turbines is well established and modifications to the power block are far from onerous. The most significant change to the turbine is replacing combustors and baskets. Full plant integration requires changes in the design of the bottoming cycle. The incremental capital cost of producing a coal plant by refuelling would certainly be less than building a greenfield IGCC or conventional pulverised coal plant. However, nearly all the combined cycle fleet was built by private developers and independent power producers at a time of low cost gas, and these owners are not the best candidates, hence the Catch 22. 1 photo.","","","","","","United States","2006-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 44,47,49-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 000100230","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20823941","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20823941","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","10","110"

Four different generation technologies are evaluated: combined-cycle natural gas, nuclear power, clean coal, and pulverized coal. We construct hydrogen-electricity price curves for each technology and evaluate the resulting air emissions of key pollutants. Substantial capital investments may be avoided by leveraging off generation assets that would otherwise be built to produce electricity. We also account for the interaction between the production of hydrogen and wholesale electricity prices and demand. Results show that off-peak electrolysis is a plausible but not dominant strategy for hydrogen production; however, there may be a substantial real option value in using the electric power system to transition to a hydrogen economy that may exceed the direct cost savings of producing hydrogen by less expensive methods.","","","","","","United States","2006-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proceedings of the IEEE; Journal Volume: 94; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1864-1879","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9219; IEEPAD; TRN: 000300204","10.1109/JPROC.2006.883717","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20847609","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20847609","","Proceedings of the IEEE","10","94"

This study indicates that some elements such as Hg, Bi, Cd, As, Pb, Ge, Tl, Sn, Zn, Sb, B show enrichments in FAs relative to the BAs in both group boiler units. In addition to these, Cs, Lu, Tm, and Ga in Units B1-4 and S in Units B5-6 also have enrichments in FAs. Elements showing enrichments in BAs in both group boiler units are Ta, Mn, Nb.

As a result, most correlations in the literature have been derived for cylinders of 25-50 mm diameter in vigorously fluidizing beds. In recent years, fluidized bed heat treating furnaces fired by natural gas have become increasingly popular, particularly in the steel wire manufacturing industry. These fluidized beds typically operate at relatively low fluidizing rates and with small diameter wires (1-6 mm). Nusselt number correlations developed based on boiler tube studies do not extrapolate down to these small size ranges and low fluidizing rates. In order to obtain reliable Nusselt number data for these size ranges, an experimental investigation has been undertaken using two heat treating fluidized beds; one a pilot-scale industrial unit and the other a lab-scale (300 mm diameter) unit. Heat transfer measurements were obtained using resistively heated cylindrical samples ranging from 1.3 to 9.5 mm in diameter at fluidizing rates ranging from approximately 0.5 x G{sub mf} (packed bed condition) to over 10 x G{sub mf} using aluminum oxide sand particles ranging from d{sub p}=145-330 {mu}m (50-90 grit). It has been found that for all cylinder sizes tested, the Nusselt number reaches a maximum near 2 x G{sub mf}, then remains relatively steady ({+-}5-10%) to the maximum fluidizing rate tested, typically 8-12xG{sub mf}. A correlation for maximum Nusselt number is developed.","","","","","","United States","2006-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Heat Transfer; Journal Volume: 128; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 984-989","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1481; JHTRAO; TRN: 080900196","10.1115/1.2345425","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073646","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073646","","Journal of Heat Transfer","10","128"

In other words, the studies on fluidized bed combustion systems, which is one of the clean coal technologies, will maintain its importance. The main objective of the present study is to introduce the development and the applications of the fluidized bed technology (FBT) and to review the fluidized bed combustion studies conducted in Turkey. The industrial applications of the fluidized bed technology in the country date back to the 1980s. Since then, the number of the fluidized bed boilers has increased. The majority of the installations are in the textile sector. In Turkey, there is also a circulating fluidized bed thermal power plant with a capacity of 2 x 160 MW under construction at Can in Canakkale.

Different boilers, coals, and PECDs are used in these power plants. Measurement in situ was performed by an electrical low-pressure impactor with a sampling system, which consisted of an isokinetic sampler probe, precut cyclone, and two- stage dilution system with a sample line to the instruments. The size distribution was measured over a range from 0.03 to 10 {mu}m. Before and after all of the PECDs, the particle number size distributions display a bimodal distribution. The PM2.5 fraction emitted to atmosphere includes a significant amount of the mass from the coarse particle mode. The controlled and uncontrolled emission factors of total PM, inhalable PM (PM10), and fine PM (PM2.5) were obtained. Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and baghouse total collection efficiencies are 96.38 99.89% and 99.94%, respectively. The minimum collection efficiency of the ESP and the baghouse both appear in the particle size range of 0.1 1 0 {mu}m. In this size range, ESP and baghouse collection efficiencies are 85.79 98.6% and 99.54%. Real- time measurement shows that the mass and number concentration of PM10 will be greatly affected by the operating conditions of the PECDs. The number of emitted particles increases with increasing boiler load level because of higher combustion temperature. During test run periods, the data reproducibility is satisfactory. 19 refs., 11 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1243-1251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001200139","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20813110","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20813110","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","9","56"

A common solution to this problem is to put orifices in the pipe systems to balance the flow. It is well known that if the orifices are sized to balance clean air flow to individual burners connected to a pulverizer, the coal/air flow would still be unbalanced and vice versa. However, the current power industry practice throughout the world is to size orifices for balancing the clean air flow and accept the resulting imbalance in coal/air flow. Field tests are mostly conducted to verify a balanced clean air flow. It is now proposed to size the orifices for balancing the coal/air flow and then calculate the unbalanced clean air flow distribution to be known as the 'tailored clean air flow'. Commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code CFX was used to simulate the complex flows in the piping systems in a power plant. The two-phase modelling technique was employed to estimate the pressure drop coefficients with both clean air and coal/air flows in order to size the orifices. The results indicate that the pressure drop is strongly dependent on the piping system geometry. With this proposed method, field tests can be conducted to correspond with the tailored clean air flow, and the coal/air flow balancing would be achieved.","","","","","","United States","2006-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Mathematical Modelling; Journal Volume: 30; Journal Issue: 9","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 854-866","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0307-904X; AMMODL; TRN: 001000264","10.1016/j.apm.2005.06.005","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20781604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20781604","","Applied Mathematical Modelling","9","30"

It is estimated that total Hg emissions from all anthropogenic sources increased at an average annual rate of 2.9% during the period 1995-2003, reaching 696 ({+-}307) t in 2003, with a speciation split of 395 t of Hg{sup 0}, 230 t of Hg{sup 2+}, and 70 t of particulate mercury, Hg{sup p}. Nonferrous metals smelting and coal combustion continue to be the two leading mercury sources in China, as nonferrous metals production and coal consumption keep increasing. Nonferrous metals smelting and coal combustion together contributed {approximately}80% of total Hg emissions during the past decade. Hg emissions from coal combustion increased from 202 t in 1995 to 257 t in 2003 at an average annual rate of 3.0%. Among all of the coal consumption sectors, the power sector is the leading one in Hg emissions growth, up by 5.9% annually. Hg emissions from nonferrous metals smelting increased from 230 t in 1995 to 321 t in 2003 at an average annual rate of 4.2%. Although Hg emissions related to gold smelting decreased since 1996, other nonferrous metals such as zinc, lead, and copper contributed significant Hg growth at annual rates of 8.5%, 13.0%, and 6.9%, respectively. At provincial level, the trends of Hg emissions show significant variation. The uncertainty level decreased from {+-}78% (95% confidence interval) in the estimate of total emissions in 1995, to {+-}44% in 2003. This is primarily attributed to the decreased emissions from those Hg sources with the largest uncertainty in both activity levels and emission factors, such as artisanal gold smelting, mercury mining, and battery/fluorescent lamp production. 36 refs., 2 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 17; Other Information: ywu@anl.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5312-5318","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001100256","10.1021/es060406x","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20790877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20790877","","Environmental Science and Technology","17","40"

These materials are commonly irregular in shape and size. It is therefore not easy to predict their aerodynamic properties, especially in comparison to pulverized fuels. Because particles fall with their maximum projection area perpendicular to the direction of the fall, a size measure representing this maximum projection area is most likely to relate to behavioral properties. In view of this, the ability to describe precisely the largest projected area of a particle will immensely help in any modeling of particles' behavior in boilers and industrial furnaces. The particle image analysis method (PIAM) is an automatic image processing tool developed with MATLAB-coded commands that is capable of determining several properties of irregular-shaped particles including the largest projected area, equivalent diameter of a sphere of the same projected area and mass, major and minor axis lengths of each particle, eccentricity, and many more. PIAM processes digital images of particles to determine their properties in terms of picture elements (pixels). With the magnification factor, pixel distances can be converted into real distances. The particle information obtained from PIAM is used to characterize behavioral properties. 19 refs., 8 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: schnell@ivd.uni-stuttgart.de","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1685-1690","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 001000095","10.1021/ef0600457","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20781466","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20781466","","Energy and Fuels","4","20"

As an extension of existing fuzzy-robust programming and two stage stochastic programming methods, the TFSRP can explicitly address complexities and uncertainties of the study system without unrealistic simplifications. Uncertain parameters can be expressed as probability density and/or fuzzy membership functions, such that robustness of the optimization efforts can be enhanced. Moreover, economic penalties as corrective measures against any infeasibilities arising from the uncertainties are taken into account. This method can, thus, provide a linkage to predefined policies determined by authorities that have to be respected when a modeling effort is undertaken. In its solution algorithm, the fuzzy decision space can be delimited through specification of the uncertainties using dimensional enlargement of the original fuzzy constraints. The developed model is applied to a case study of regional air quality management at two coal-fired power plants considered as major sulfur dioxide emission sources. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been obtained. The solutions can be used for further generating pollution-mitigation alternatives with minimized system costs and for providing a more solid support for sound environmental decisions. 61 refs., 7 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: gordon.huang@uregina.ca","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1070-1082","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001100052","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20790714","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20790714","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","56"

The degree of such failure can be as minor as a pinhole leak or as major as a fully involved baghouse fire. In some cases, local air pollution regulations or federal hazardous waste laws may require estimation of the total quantity of particulate matter released to the environment as a result of such failures. In this paper, a technique is presented for computing the dust loading in the baghouse exhaust when one or more bags have failed. The algorithm developed is shown to be an improvement over a previously published result, which requires empirical knowledge of the variation in baghouse pressure differential with bag failures. An example calculation is presented for a baghouse equipped with 200 bags. The prediction shows that a small percentage of failed bags can cause a relatively large proportion of the gas flow to bypass the active bags, which, in turn, leads to high outlet dust loading and low overall collection efficiency from the baghouse. 10 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: rmartin@exponent.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1177-1183","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001100055","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20790717","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20790717","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","56"

The technology is based on a novel class of perovskite ceramic oxides which can selectively separate oxygen ions from a stream of air at high temperature and pressure. Those ions are transported across the ITM leaving non-permeate air which can be integrated with a fuel-fired gas system, enabling co-production of power and steam along with the concentrated, high-purity oxygen.

Major reductions in the largest emissions sources have made accurate inventories of previously minor sources much more important to the understanding and improvement of local air quality. Changes in manufacturing processes, industry types, vehicle technologies, and metropolitan infrastructure are occurring at an increasingly rapid pace, emphasizing the importance of inventories that reflect current conditions. New technologies for measuring source emissions and ambient pollutant concentrations, both at the point of emissions and from remote platforms, are providing novel approaches to collecting data for inventory developers. Advances in information technologies are allowing data to be shared more quickly, more easily, and processed and compared in novel ways that can speed the development of emission inventories. Approaches to improving quantitative measures of inventory uncertainty allow air quality management decisions to take into account the uncertainties associated with emissions estimates, providing more accurate projections of how well alternative strategies may work. This paper discusses applications of these technologies and techniques to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of emission inventories across North America and outlines a series of eight recommendations aimed at inventory developers and air quality management decision-makers to improve emission inventories and enable them to support effective air quality management decisions for the foreseeable future. 122 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: miller.andy@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1115-1120","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001100053","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464540","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20790715","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20790715","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","56"

This study investigated in situ Hg emissions at a blended bituminous-subbituminous ash land-fill in the Great Lakes area and a lignite-derived ash and FGD solids landfill in the Midwestern United States using a dynamic field chamber. Fly ash and saturated FGD materials emitted Hg to atmosphere at low rates (- 0.1 to 1.2 ng/m{sup 2}hr), whereas FGD material mixed with fly ash and pyrite exhibited higher emission rates ({approximately} 10 ng/m{sup 2}hr) but were still comparable with natural background soils (- 0.3 to 13 ng/m{sup 2}hr). Air temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity were important factors correlated with measured Hg fluxes. Field study results were not consistent with corresponding laboratory observations in that fluxes measured in the latter were higher and more variable. This is hypothesized to be partially an artifact of the flux measurement methods. 19 refs., 4 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: mgustin@cabnr.unr.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1167-1176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001100054","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464543","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","20790716","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20790716","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","56"
"Mercury speciation in coal-fired power plant plumes observed at three surface sites in the southeastern U.S.","Edgerton, Eric S; Hartsell, Benjamin E; Jansen, John J","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; MERCURY; COAL; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; CHEMICAL STATE; USA; PARTICULATES; AIR POLLUTION MONITORING; PLUMES; EMISSION; FLUE GAS; VALENCE; CONCENTRATION RATIO; TRAJECTORIES; TIME DEPENDENCE; SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION","Elemental Hg (Hg{sup 0}), reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) and fine particulate Hg (Hg{sub P}) were measured intermittently at three sites in the southeastern U.S. from June 2001 through November 2004. Simultaneous measurements of SO{sub 2} and NOy were used to identify plumes from coal fired power plants (CFPPs). Emission signatures and back trajectories were used to identity specific CFPPs, and to compare observed (i.e., at the site) versus expected (i.e., at the stack) Hg speciation. Results for 41 precipitation-free plume events show that observed RGM:SO{sub 2} is substantially lower (by a factor of 2-4) than expected RGM:SO{sub 2}. Hg{sub P} represented 2%, or less, of total-Hg in CFPP plumes, in general agreement with emission estimates. Results for 21 events, where both RGM and Hg{sup 0} could be estimated, show that total-Hg (i.e., RGM + Hg{sup 0}) was essentially conserved from the point of emission to the site, and that Hg{sup 0} was the dominant form (average 84%). Emission estimates, based on coal analyses and the EPRI-ICR Hg speciation model, indicate that Hg{sup 0} should represent about 42% of Hg in the observed plumes. Possible explanations for these differences include, but are not limited to, in-plume reduction of RGM to Hg{sub 0}, measurement error, errors in emission estimates, and depositional losses. Further work is needed to confirm these results and to determine if they apply to CFPPs in general, or the limited set of observed CFPPs. 27 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: ericedge@gte.net","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4563-4570","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001000174","10.1021/es0515607","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20781533","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20781533","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","40"

Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent concentrations (BaPeq) were calculated for risk assessment. Model results were provisionally validated for concentrations and profiles based on the observed data at two monitoring stations. The dominant emission sources in the area were domestic coal combustion, coke production, and biomass burning. Mainly because of the difference in the emission heights, the contributions of various sources to the average concentrations at receptors differ from proportions emitted. The shares of domestic coal increased from {approximately} 43% at the sources to 56% at the receptors, while the contributions of coking industry decreased from {approximately} 23% at the sources to 7% at the receptors. The spatial distributions of gaseous and particulate PAHs were similar, with higher concentrations occurring within urban districts because of domestic coal combustion. With relatively smaller contributions, the other minor sources had limited influences on the overall spatial distribution. The calculated average BaPeq value in air was 2.54 {+-} 2.87 ng/m{sup 3} on an annual basis. Although only 2.3% of the area in Tianjin exceeded the national standard of 10 ng/m{sup 3}, 41% of the entire population lives within this area. 37 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: taos@urban.pku.edu.cn","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4586-4591","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001000175","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20781534","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20781534","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","40"

If EU allowances (EUAs) trade at euro 20/t-CO{sub 2}, the EUA component in the power price is estimated to be slightly &lt; euro 10/MW.h. In the case of UK power for delivery 1 year ahead, this is {approximately} 10% of the market price of power. The introduction of a carbon components into the UK power prices took place along before the 'official' start of ETS in 2005. Analysis of historical data of the price of power, gas, coal and EUAs shows that the first trace of a CO{sub 2} component in UK power dates back to August 2003, shortly after EUAs first started to trade. In April 2004, CO{sub 2} was fully integrated into the UK power price. 4 refs., 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 15; Other Information: kris.voorspools@fortis.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4543-4546","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001000173","10.1021/es062747g","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","20781532","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20781532","","Environmental Science and Technology","15","40"

The major challenge is to find a cost- effective way to remove carbon dioxide from the flue gas of power plants. One industrially proven method is to dissolve CO{sub 2} in the solvent monoethanolamine (MEA) at a temperature of 38{sup o}C and then release it from the solvent in another unit when heated to 150{sup o}C. This produces CO{sub 2} ready for sequestration. Research is in progress with alternative solvents that require less energy. Another technique is to use enriched oxygen in place of air in the combustion process which produces CO{sub 2} ready for sequestration. A process that is more attractive from an energy management viewpoint is to gasify coal so that it is partially oxidized, producing a fuel while consuming significantly less oxygen. Several IGCC schemes are in operation which produce syngas for use as a feedstock, in addition to electricity and hydrogen. These schemes are costly as they require an air separation unit. Novel approaches to coal gasification based on 'membrane separation' or chemical looping could reduce the costs significantly while effectively capturing carbon dioxide. 1 ref., 2 figs., 1 photo.","","","","","","United States","2006-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physics World; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: fan.1@osu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-41","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0953-8585; PHWOEW; TRN: 071200001","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20961242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20961242","","Physics World","7","20"

The model was applied to ambient SO{sub 2} and particle measurements, the latter, made every 30-min for 10 elements (Al, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) during a 12.5-h period on April 1, when winds blew from between 290-330 degrees in which the four coal boilers are situated. Agreement between predicted and observed SO{sub 2} concentrations was excellent of 0.92; and their ratio, 1.09 {+-} 0.22 when 4 emission sources were used in the model. Average ratios of predicted and observed concentrations for As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn varied from 0.97 {+-} 10.20 for Cr to 1.07 {+-} 0.44 for As. Performance indices for these elements were all well within acceptable ranges. Emission rate ratios of various metal species to Se predicted are similar for the three of the coal boilers, but differed substantially for the fourth, as expected for a boiler with minimal particle control technology. All are within the range derived from previous PDRM results and in-stack measurements (except Al) at 7 Eastern U.S. coal-fired power plants.

This and other accompanying market-oriented reforms were intended to improve efficiency by encouraging regional dispatch by independent system operators. If the reforms made dispatch more efficient, then utilization rates of high-cost plants should have fallen relative to those of low-cost plants since 1996. A difference-in-difference model using plant-level panel data indicates that relative utilization rates of high-cost plants did indeed fall after 1996, but only in regions with independent system operators.

The incentives behind the developed concept were the derived advantages from beneficial technical economic and environmental impacts. Although the primary use of fly ash is concrete, other forms of CCPs could be considered for more non-traditional highway applications. For example, these might include soils stabilization, binders for in-place pavement recycling, use in flowable fills, aggregates, source materials for structural fills and embankments, components in manufactured soils, and for granular base courses beneath pavements. At this same time, unknown to ACCA, EPA Region 3 in Philadelphia was working with the Wetlands and Watershed Work Group, a non-profit organization involved in wetlands policy and management along with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on their own Green Highways initiative. These groups were planning a conference, the 'Green Highway Forum'. This was held in College Park, Maryland at the University of Maryland, Nov 8-10 2005. At the conference a draft 'roadmap' was presented as a guide to executive level participants bringing the diverse viewpoints of many agencies and interest groups together. Ten guiding principals were considered. The 'Green Highways' is a new effort to recognize the 'greenness' of many projects already completed and those to be initiated. 2 photos.","","Internet free of charge from www.acaa-usa.org/ASHatWork.htm","","","","United States","2006-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ash at Work","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24-25","","","","TRN: 070800014","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20905774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20905774","","Ash at Work","",""
"The current state of the science related to the re-release of mercury from coal combustion products","Pflughoeft-Hassett, Debra F; Hassett, David J; Heebink, Loreal V; Buckley, Tera D","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT; COAL; MERCURY; COMBUSTION PRODUCTS; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; STABILITY; FLY ASH; FLUE GAS; GYPSUM; DESULFURIZATION; LEACHING; VAPORS; CONCENTRATION RATIO","The stability of mercury associated with CCPs is an issue that has only recently been under investigation but has become a prominent question as the industry strives to determine if current management options for CCPs will need to be modified. Mercury and other air toxic elements can be present in fly ash, FGD material and bottom ash and boiler slag. Mercury concentrations ranging from {lt} 0.01 to 2.41 ppm in fly ash and from 0.001 to 0.342 ppm in bottom ash have been reported. Stability of mercury must be evaluated by tests that include 1) direct leachability; 2) vapor-phase release at ambient and elevated temperatures; and 3) microbiologically induced leachability and vapor-phase release. The amount of mercury leached from currently produced CCPs is extremely low and does not appear to represent an environmental or re-release hazard. Concentrations of mercury in leachates from fly ashes and FGD material using either the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) or the synthetic groundwater leaching procedure (SGLP) are generally below detection limits. The release of mercury vapor from CCPs resulting from the use of mercury control technologies has been evaluated on a limited basis. Research indicates that mercury bound to the ash or activated carbon is fairly stable. The EERC found that organomercury species were detected at very low levels both in the vapor and leachate generated from the microbiologically mediated release experiments. The current state of the science indicates that mercury associated with CCPs is stable and highly unlikely to be released under most management conditions, including utilisation and disposal. The exception to this is exposure to high temperatures such as those that may be achieved in cement and wallboard production. Therefore, existing CCPs management options are expected to be environmentally sound options for CCPs from systems with mercury control technologies installed. 2 refs., 2 photos.","","Internet free of charge from www.acaa-usa.org/ASHatWork.htm","","","","United States","2006-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ash at Work; Other Information: dphassett@undeerc.org","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 26-27","","","","TRN: 070800015","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20905775","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20905775","","Ash at Work","",""

Work has centered on FGD gypsum or calcium sulfite and to a much lesser extent on fly ash. Researchers have found three agronomically valuable functions of these materials. First, and most obvious, is the fertilizer value of these materials. Gypsum applications to the soil surface provide the rainfall with an alternative source of electrolyte which prevents soil crushing, thus keeping the soil open and permeable to rainwater and air. Gypsum is more effective than liming materials atremediation of sub-soil acidity by detoxifying the excess exchangeable aluminium, which causes low pH. One proven way to sequester carbon is to fix it as organic matter in soil. 90% of the carbon in roots is converted to soil organic matter, whereas 90% of surface residue is oxide and the carbon returned to the atmosphere. Therefore, more carbon is sequestered by increasing root growth. Improved soil water management also reduces nitrous oxide emissions from soils. The utility's world is improved since the highest quality and lowest cost material is generated by an emission control scrubber as FGD-gypsum. There are more than 175 million crop acres in the US alone. Each acre would require 0.5 ton per year to prevent surface sealing. This means that the potential for FGD-gypsum use is more than 80 million tons per year. 4 photos.","","Internet free of charge from www.acaa-usa.org/ASHatWork.htm","","","","United States","2006-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ash at Work; Other Information: cliffert@accnorwalk.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 10-11,14-15","","","","TRN: 070800299","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20905936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20905936","","Ash at Work","",""

"Modeling mercury in power plant plumes","Lohman, Kristen; Seigneur, Christian; Edgerton, Eric; Jansen, John","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; MERCURY; PLUMES; FLUE GAS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; DEPOSITION; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; CHEMICAL REACTIONS; CHEMICAL STATE; CLOUDS; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; VELOCITY; SULFUR DIOXIDE; ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT; SENSITIVITY; EMISSION","Measurements of speciated mercury (Hg) downwind of coal-fired power plants suggest that the Hg{sup II}/(Hg{sup 0} + Hg{sup II}) ratio decreases significantly between the point of emission and the downwind ground-level measurement site, but that the SO{sub 2}/(Hg{sup 0} + Hg{sup II}) ratio is conserved. The authors simulated nine power plant plume events with the Reactive & Optics Model of Emissions (ROME), a reactive plume model that includes a comprehensive treatment of plume dispersion, transformation, and deposition. The model simulations fail to reproduce such a depletion in Hg{sup II}. A sensitivity study of the impact of the Hg{sup II} dry deposition velocity shows that a difference in dry deposition alone cannot explain the disparity. Similarly, a sensitivity study of the impact of cloud chemistry on results shows that the effect of clouds on Hg chemistry has only minimal impact. Possible explanations include Hg{sup II} reduction to Hg{sup 0} in the plume, rapid reduction of Hg{sup II} to Hg{sup 0} on ground surfaces, and/or an overestimation of the Hg{sup II} fraction in the power plant emissions. The authors propose that a chemical reaction not included in current models of atmospheric mercury reduces Hg{sup II} to Hg{sup 0} in coal-fired power plant plumes. The incorporation of two possible reduction pathways for Hg{sup II} shows better agreement between the model simulations and the ambient measurements. These potential Hg{sup II} to Hg{sup 0} reactions need to be studied in the laboratory to investigate this hypothesis. Because the speciation of Hg has a significant effect on Hg deposition, models of the fate and transport of atmospheric Hg may need to be modified to account for the reduction of Hg{sup II} in coal-fired power plant plumes if such a reaction is confirmed in further experimental investigations. 31 refs., 2 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: seigneur@aer.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3848-3854","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000800305","10.1021/es051556v","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20762238","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20762238","","Environmental Science and Technology","12","40"

This is due to the fact that the oxide films formed on the steam side can lead to major failures and consequently to reduced plant availability. The wall loss of the pressure boundary caused by oxidation can increase the hoop stresses and cause premature creep failures; second, the increased insulation of the tubes due to the low thermal conductivity of the oxide film can lead to increased metal temperature, thereby exacerbating the fireside corrosion as well as creep problems. The third concern is that thicker oxides may spall more easily when the plant is cooled down. On restart, the spalled material may lodge somewhere in the system with the potential for causing tube blockages, or it may be swept out with the working fluid and enter the steam turbine causing erosion damage to the turbine nozzles and blades. Failures of tubing and turbine components by these mechanisms have been widely reported in the United States. In view of the importance of the steamside oxidation, a major study of the phenomenon is being carried out as part of a major national program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ohio Coal Development Office. As a prelude to the experimental work, a literature survey was performed to document the state of the art.

The former is applied using two different horizontal resolutions: coarse (84 km) and fine (16.7 km). More than 96% of the power plant Hg emissions are calculated with the plume model to be transported beyond 50 km from the plants. The grid-based model predicts a lower fraction to be transported beyond 50 km: {gt} 91% with a coarse resolution and {gt} 95% with a fine resolution. The contribution of the power plant emissions to total Hg deposition within a radius of 50 km from the plants is calculated to be {lt} 8% with the plume model, {lt} 14% with the Eulerian model with a coarse resolution, and {lt} 10% with the Eulerian model with a fine resolution. The Eulerian grid-based model predicts greater local impacts than the plume model because of artificially enhanced vertical dispersion; the former predicts about twice as much Hg deposition as the latter when the area considered is commensurate with the resolution of the grid-based model. If one compares the local impacts for an area that is significantly less than the grid-based model resolution, then the grid-based model may predict lower local deposition than the plume model, because two compensating errors affect the results obtained with the grid-based model: initial dilution of the power plant emissions within one or more grid cells and enhanced vertical mixing to the ground. 25 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: seigneur@aer.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 743-751","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900391","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464496","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20772647","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20772647","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","56"

There has been some speculation that the adsorption takes place on the particulate-covered plate electrodes. This convective mass transfer analysis of laminar and turbulent channel flows provides the maximum potential for Hg adsorption by the plate electrodes within an ESP under those conditions. Mass transfer calculations, neglecting electro hydrodynamic (EHD) effects, reveal 65% removal of elemental Hg for a laminar flow within a 15-m-long channel of 0.2-m spacing and 42% removal for turbulent flow within a similar configuration. Both configurations represent specific collection areas (SCAs) that are significantly larger than conventional ESPs in use. Results reflecting more representative SCA values generally returned removal efficiencies of {lt}20%. EHD effects, although potentially substantial at low Reynolds numbers, diminish rapidly with increasing Reynolds number and become negligible at typical ESP operating conditions. The present results indicate maximum Hg removal efficiencies for ESPs that are much less than those observed in practice for comparable ESP operating conditions. Considering Hg adsorption kinetics and finite sorbent capacity in addition to the present mass transfer analyses would yield even lower adsorption efficiencies than the present results. In a subsequent paper, the author addresses the mass transfer potential presented by the charged, suspended particulates during their collection within an ESP and the role they potentially play in Hg capture within ESPs. 28 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: herek.clack@iit.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 759-766","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900392","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464489","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","20772648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20772648","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","56"

These data are being used in time series epidemiologic studies in which associations of acute respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes and daily ambient air pollutant levels are assessed. Modified semivariograms are used to quantify the effects of instrument precision and spatial variability on the assessment of daily metrics of ambient gaseous pollutants (SO{sub 2}, CO, NOx, and O{sub 3}) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (PM2.5 mass, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC)). Variation because of instrument imprecision represented 7-40% of the temporal variation in the daily pollutant measures and was largest for the PM2.5 EC and OC. Spatial variability was greatest for primary pollutants (SO{sub 2}, CO, NOx, and EC). Population-weighted variation in daily ambient air pollutant levels because of both instrument imprecision and spatial variability ranged from 20% of the temporal variation for O{sub 3} to 70% of the temporal variation for SO{sub 2} and EC. Wind rose plots, corrected for diurnal and seasonal pattern effects, are used to demonstrate the impacts of local sources on monitoring station data. The results presented are being used to quantify the impacts of instrument precision and spatial variability on the assessment of health effects of ambient air pollution in Atlanta and are relevant to the interpretation of results from time series health studies that use data from fixed monitors. 38 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: james.mulholland@ce.gatech.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 876-888","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900396","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464499","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","20772652","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20772652","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","56"

Nevertheless, the fate of gas-phase mercury within an ESP remains poorly understood. The present analysis focuses on the gas-particle mass transfer that occurs within a charged aerosol in an ESP. As a necessary step in gas-phase mercury adsorption or transformation, gas-particle mass transfer - particularly in configurations other than fixed beds - has received far less attention than studies of adsorption kinetics. Our previous analysis showed that only a small fraction of gas-phase mercury entering an ESP is likely to be adsorbed by collected particulate matter on the plate electrodes. The present simplified analysis provides insight into gas-particle mass transfer within an ESP under two limiting conditions: laminar and turbulent fluid flows. The analysis reveals that during the process of particulate collection, gas-particle mass transfer can be quite high, easily exceeding the mass transfer to ESP plate electrodes in most cases. Decreasing particle size, increasing particle mass loading, and increasing temperature all result in increased gas-particle mass transfer. The analysis predicts significantly greater gas-particle mass transfer in the laminar limit than in the turbulent limit; however, the differences become negligible under conditions where other factors, such as total mass of suspended particulates, are the controlling mass transfer parameters. Results are compared to selected pilot- and full-scale sorbent injection data. 41 refs., 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","2006-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: herek.clack@iit.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3617-3622","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000800059","10.1021/es050246+","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20762043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20762043","","Environmental Science and Technology","11","40"

The research approach was to modify the carbide structure of commercial AISI 440C steel for better fracture resistance while maintaining the already high abrasion resistance. The new alloys contained 12Cr, 2.5–4.5Ti, and 1–1.5C (wt.%) and were melted in a vacuum induction furnace. Their microstructure was composed primarily of a martensitic matrix with a dispersion of TiC precipitates. Modification of TiC morphology was accomplished through changing the cooling rate during solidification.

Three different Illinois Basin bituminous coals (from high to low sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl)) and one Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coal with very low S and very low Cl were tested in a pilot-scale combustor equipped with an SCR reactor for controlling nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) emissions. The SCR catalyst induced high oxidation of elemental Hg (Hg{sup 0}), decreasing the percentage of Hg{sup 0} at the outlet of the SCR to values &lt;12% for the three Illinois coal tests. The PRB coal test indicated a low oxidation of Hg{sup 0} by the SCR catalyst, with the percentage of Hg{sup 0} decreasing from {approximately} 96% at the inlet of the reactor to {approximately} 80% at the outlet. The low Cl content of the PRB coal and corresponding low level of available flue gas Cl species were believed to be responsible for low SCR Hg oxidation for this coal type. The test results indicated a strong effect of coal type on the extent of Hg oxidation. 16 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Other Information: lee.chun-wai@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 643-649","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000700369","10.1080/10473289.2006.10464475","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","20752300","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752300","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","",""

During the first determination, the monitor had an RA of 25% compared with ASTM Method D6784-02 (Ontario Hydro Method). However, the Ontario Hydro Method performed poorly, because the mercury concentrations were near the detection limit of the reference method. The mercury in this exhaust stream was primarily elemental. The second test was performed at a U.S. Army boiler against EPA Reference Method 29. Mercury and arsenic were spiked because of expected low mercury concentrations. The monitor had an RA of 16% for arsenic and 17% for mercury, meeting RA requirements of EPA Performance Specification 12a. The results suggest that the sampling stream contained significant percentages of both elemental and oxidized mercury. The monitor was successful at measuring total mercury in particulate and vapor forms. 25 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 657-665","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900379","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20772636","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20772636","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","5","56"

The Chem-Mod system is able to capture Hg{sup 0} by using a liquid sorbent to oxidize it to Hg{sup 2+} or trap it on its surface. A second, powder sorbent captures SO{sub 2} and heavy metals. The two sorbents combine to trap the emissions in a ceramic-like matrix that is locked into the fly ash. The technology removed up to 98%, 90%, and 86% of the mercury in week-long tests with different bituminous and subbituminous grades of coals. In addition, the system cut SO{sub 2} emissions by 40-75% and those of arsenic, chloride, and heavy metals by 75-90%.

A number of sorbent candidates such as amine-silica gel, urea-silica gel, thiol-silica gel, amide-silica gel, sulfur-alumina, sulfur-molecular sieve, sulfur-montmorillonite, sodium sulfide-montmorillonite, and sodium polysulfide-montmorillonite, were synthesized and tested in a lab-scale fixed-bed system under an argon flow for screening purposes at 70{sup o}C and/or 140{sup o}C.

In many regions of the United States, existing methods to measure stationary source pollutant emissions may be acceptable for the foreseeable future. However, other regions will require more comprehensive source measurement methods that expand the measured pollutants to include the full range of the atmospheric burden. Decisions about which path(s) to follow will depend on existing ambient air quality levels an the need to better quantify atmospheric emissions of primary PM from stationary sources, control stationary source primary PM to achieve the ambient air quality standard, and better understand the components of stationary source primary PM emissions.

The tests were performed using two pilot CO{sub 2} capture plants of the International Test Centre for CO{sub 2} Capture (ITC), which provided two different sources and compositions of flue gas. The University of Regina CO{sub 2} plant (UR unit) processes flue gas from the combustion of natural gas while the Boundary Dam CO{sub 2} plant (BD unit) processes flue gas from a coal-fired electric power station. The results show that a huge heat-duty reduction can be achieved by using a mixed MEA/MDEA solution instead of a single MEA solution in an industrial environment of a CO{sub 2} capture plant. However, this benefit is dependent on whether the chemical stability of the solvent can be maintained.","","","","","","United States","2006-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2414-2420","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: 000700162","10.1021/ie050569e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20752213","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752213","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","8","45"

This technology is energy-intensive and has been applied to CO{sub 2} removal from natural gas, ammonia, and hydrogen gas streams. Energy requirements can be reduced by the use of a more-reactive solvent, operating the cross exchanger at a lower temperature, optimizing the stripper operation, and using innovative stripper configurations (vacuum and multipressure). This work calculates stripper performance with an algorithm in Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM) that incorporates thermodynamic studies, reaction rate measurements, physical properties, and contactor-specific information for three stripper configuration-a simple stripper operating at 160 kPa, a multipressure stripper operating at three pressures (330/230/160 kPa), and a vacuum stripper (30 kPa) for two solvents: 7m (30 wt %) monoethanolamine (MEA) and 5m K{sup +}/2.5m piperazine. The temperature approach is varied from 5 to 10{sup o}C. With some approximations, we predict the influence of using solvents with varying heats of desorption {Delta}H{sub des}) on the reboiler duty and the equivalent work for stripping (reboiler duty as equivalent Carnot work plus compression work). With a rich solution giving PCO{sub 2}{asterisk} = 2.5 kPa at 40{sup o}C, the vacuum stripper is favored for solvents with Delta H{sub des} {&lt;=} 21 kcal/(gmol of CO{sub 2}) while the multipressure configuration is attractive for solvents with {Delta}(H{sub des} {&gt;=} 21 kcal/(gmol of CO{sub 2}).","","","","","","United States","2006-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2457-2464","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: 000700163","10.1021/ie050548k","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20752214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752214","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","8","45"

The energy consumption in stripping can be 15-30% of the power-plant output. A rigorous rate-based model for CO{sub 2}-MEA-H{sub 2}O qas used to simulate several flowsheet alternatives that reduce the energy requirement using Aspen Plus with RateFrac. Results were calculated for vapor recompression, multipressure, and simple strippers at 5 and 10{sup o}C approach temperatures and 70, 90, and 95% CO{sub 2} removal. The 'equivalent work of steam/mole of CO{sub 2} removed' and the reboiler duty were used to compare the proposed schemes and to show the shift of energy use from work to heat. The total equivalent work for multipressure was less than that for the simple stripper by 0.03-0.12 GJ/(ton of CO{sub 2}), and the reboiler duty was less by 0.15-0.41 GJ/(ton of CO{sub 2}). The multipressure with vapor recompression is an attractive option because it utilizes the overhead water vapor latent heat to reduce reboiler duty load, recovers the work of compression to strip more CO{sub 2}, and shows more reversible behavior.","","","","","","United States","2006-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2465-2472","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: 000700164","10.1021/ie050547s","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20752215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752215","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","8","45"
"Identifying cost-effective CO{sub 2} control levels for amine-based CO{sub 2} capture systems","Rao, A B; Rubin, E S","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CAPTURE; CARBON DIOXIDE; FLUE GAS; AMINES; ADSORBENTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; EFFICIENCY; COST; CAPITALIZED COST","Studies of CO{sub 2} capture and storage (CCS) from coal-fired power plants typically assume a capture efficiency near 90%, although the basis for a particular choice usually is not discussed. Nor do studies systematically explore a range of CO{sub 2} capture efficiencies to identify the most cost-effective levels of CO, control and the key factors that affect such levels. An exploration of these issues is the focus of this paper. As part of the United States Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program, we have developed an integrated modeling framework (called IECM-cs) to evaluate the performance and cost of alternative CCS technologies and power systems in the context of plant-level multipollutant control requirements. This paper uses IECM-cs to identify the most cost-effective level of CO, control using currently available amine-based CO{sub 2} capture technology for PC plants. Two general cases are of interest. First, we examine the effects of systematically increasing the CO{sub 2} capture efficiency of an amine-based system for PC applications over a broad range. We report two measures of cost: (i) capital cost and (ii) cost-effectiveness (cost per tonne of CO{sub 2} avoided) relative to similar plants without CCS. Second, we examine the cost-effectiveness of plant designs that partially bypass the amine capture unit so as to achieve low to moderate reductions of CO{sub 2}, but at lower overall cost. Results from these cases are compared to the conventional case of a capture unit treating the entire flue gas stream. In each case, we identify the most cost-effective strategies and the key factors that affect those results.","","","","","","United States","2006-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2421-2429","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: 000700165","10.1021/ie050603p","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20752216","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752216","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","8","45"

The catalyst activities for the SCR of NO by NH{sub 3} have been determined to derive structure-activity relationships in combination with the Raman data. Isolated monovanadates and polyvanadates are formed at various proportions (depending on the loading) on the catalyst surface under dehydrated conditions. The band positions and characteristics are discussed in terms of possible configurations for the dispersed VO{sub x} species. The bands observed, the surface composition, and the bond conservation rule allow to propose a small size for the chains of polyvanadates (i.e., 2, 3). The reducing action of NH{sub 3} is favored in the presence of adjacent V sites; at low loadings, the presence of NH{sub 3} has no effect on the structural properties of surface VO{sub x}. The reducibility in H{sub 2} follows an opposite trend and is favored at low n{sub s}, as indicated by both in situ Raman and H{sub 2}-TPR. The SO{sub 2} presence affects only the molecular structure of catalysts with low n{sub s}, for which a significant part of surface TiO{sub 2} sites are vacant; the effect (judged from the in situ Raman data) is merely one of driving the dispersed vanadia species in a state of 'virtually' high surface density by crowding them together, thereby providing more adjacent V sites for activation of NH{sub 3} in SCR reaction conditions.","","","","","","United States","2006-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 239; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: 000100206","10.1016/j.jcat.2006.01.019","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20823920","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20823920","","Journal of Catalysis","1","239"

Considerable air pollution is caused by the manufacturing industries themselves and by the power plants, trucks, and ships that support them. It is estimated that 10-40% of emissions of primary SO{sub 2}, NOx, RSP, and VOC in the region are caused by export-related activities. Using the STEM-2K1 atmospheric transport model, it is estimated that these emissions contribute 5-30% of the ambient concentrations of SO{sub 2}, NOx, NOz, and VOC in the region. (NO{sub Z}=PAN, HONO, HNO{sub 3}, N{sub 2}O{sub 5} and organic nitrates). One reason that the exported goods are cheap and therefore attractive to consumers in developed countries is that emission controls are lacking or of low performance. It is estimated that state-of-the-art controls could be installed at an annualized cost of $0.3-3 billion, representing 0.3-3% of the value of the goods produced. Mitigation measures could be adopted without seriously affecting the prices of exported goods and would achieve considerable human health and other benefits in the form of reduced air pollutant concentrations in densely populated urban areas. 22 refs., 5 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: dstreets@anl.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2099-2107","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000700037","10.1021/es051275n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20752113","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20752113","","Environmental Science and Technology","7","40"

The flow is redistributed during partial cleaning of the filter, with flows higher across the newly cleaned filter section. The calculated average Hg removal efficiency from the baghouse is lower because of the high mass flux of Hg exiting the filter in the newly cleaned section.

The article examines the state of technologies for gasifying coal: it gives analysis of the technical considerations and economic consequences of adapting an existing combined-cycle plant to burn coal rather than natural gas. 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: andy.donaldson@worleyparsons.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34,36-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 000600143","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20741057","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20741057","","Power (New York)","1","150"

The experiments were carried out under various MHD generator load and shock tube operation conditions. Important characteristics of syngas plasma such as temperature, electric field, conductivity, and total output power were directly measured and evaluated. Special attention was paid to the influence of syngas composition (CO : H{sub 2} : O{sub 2} ratio). The results show that syngas combustion can provide high plasma ionization and attainable plasma electrical conductivity has an order of 60-80 S/m at gas temperature 3100-3300 K.","","","","","","United States","2006-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 242-249","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; ITCNE4; TRN: 000500371","10.1109/TEC.2005.847994","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20727795","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20727795","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","21"

They include an air separation unit (ASU), a gasification system, and a gas turbine combined cycle power block, and feature competitive efficiency and lower emissions compared to conventional power generation technology. IGCC systems are not yet in widespread commercial use and opportunities remain to improve system feasibility via improved process integration. A process simulation model was developed for IGCC systems with alternative types of ASU and gas turbine integration. The model is applied to evaluate integration schemes involving nitrogen injection, air extraction, and combinations of both, as well as different ASU pressure levels. The optimal nitrogen injection only case in combination with an elevated pressure ASU had the highest efficiency and power output and approximately the lowest emissions per unit output of all cases considered, and thus is a recommended design option. The optimal combination of air extraction coupled with nitrogen injection had slightly worse efficiency, power output, and emissions than the optimal nitrogen injection only case. Air extraction alone typically produced lower efficiency, lower power output, and higher emissions than all other cases. The recommended nitrogen injection only case is estimated to provide annualized cost savings compared to a nonintegrated design. Process simulation modeling is shown to be a useful tool for evaluation and screening of technology options. 27 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: frey@eos.ncsu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1693-1699","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000500302","10.1021/es0515598","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20727733","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20727733","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","40"

The feedstock for this actual plant is culm, the waste left from anthracite coal mining. Before combustion in circulating fluidized bed boilers, the usable carbon within the culm is separated from the indigenous rock. The rock and ash waste from the combustion process fill adjacent land previously scared by strip mining. Trees and grass are planted in these areas as part of a land reclamation program. Analyses based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics using actual operating data are first presented to acquaint the reader with the plant's components and operation. Using emission and other relevant environmental data from the plant, all externalities study is outlined that estimates the plant's effect on the local population. The results show that the plant's cycle performs with a coefficient of utilization of 29% and all approximate exergetic efficiency of 34.5%. In order to increase these values, recommended improvements to the plant are noted. In addition, the externality costs associated with the estimated SO{sub 2} and NOx discharge from the culm fed plant are lower (85-95%) than those associated with a similarly sized coal fed plant. The plant's cycle efficiencies are lower than those associated with more modern technologies; such as all integrated gas turbine combined cycle. However, given the abundant, inexpensive supply of feedstock located adjacent to the plant and the environmental benefit of removing culm banks, the plant's existing operation is unique from an economical and environmental viewpoint.","","","","","","United States","2006-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 128; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 98-103","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: 000500266","10.1115/1.2148973","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20727698","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20727698","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","128"

The system consisted of photocatalytic or ozone oxidation of NOx, followed by scrubbing and biological denitrification. Maximum photocatalytic oxidation of NOx was achieved while using powdered TiO{sub 2} at a catalytic loading rate of 10 g/h, relative humidity of 50%, and a space time of 10 s. The used catalyst was regenerated and reused. A total of 72% of oxidized NO was recovered as HNO{sub 3}/HNO{sub 2} in the regeneration process. Stoichiometrically, 10% excess ozone was able to affect 100% oxidation of NO to NO{sub 2}. Presence of SO{sub 2} adversely influenced the oxidation of NO by ozone. The scrubbing of NO was effective with distilled water. Heterotrophic denitrifiers were able to denitrify the leachate with an efficiency of 90%, using sewage (COD 450 mg/L) as electron donor.

Results show that, for all product groups but waste treatment, the fossil CED correlates well with most impact categories, such as global warming, resource depletion, acidification, eutrophication, tropospheric ozone formation, ozone depletion, and human toxicity (explained variance between 46% and 100%). It is concluded that the use of fossil fuels is an important driver of several environmental impacts and thereby indicative for many environmental problems. It may therefore serve as a screening indicator for environmental performance. However, the usefulness of fossil CED as a stand-alone indicator for environmental impact is limited by the large uncertainty in the product-specific fossil CED-based impact scores (larger than a factor of 10 for the majority of the impact categories; 95% confidence interval). A major reason for this high uncertainty is nonfossil energy related emissions and land use, such as landfill leachates, radionuclide emissions, and land use in agriculture and forestry. 38 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2006-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: m.huijbregts@science.ru.nl","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 641-648","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000400192","10.1021/es051689g","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712312","","Environmental Science and Technology","3","40"

Several types of configurations have been hypothesized and tested for these kinds of applications at the conceptual level, but hybrid power plants are one of the most efficient. These are designs that combine the fuel cell cycle with other thermodynamic cycles to provide higher efficiency. The power plant in focus is the high-pressure (HP)-low-pressure (LP) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)/steam turbine (ST)/gas turbine (GT) configuration which is a part of the Vision-21 program in the USA. In this design, coal is gasified in an entrained bed gasifier and the syngas produced is cleaned in a transport bed desulfurizer and passed over to cascaded SOFC modules (at two pressure levels). This module is integrated with a reheat GT cycle. The heat of the exhaust from the GT cycle is used to convert water to steam, which is eventually used in a steam bottoming cycle. Since this hybrid technology is new and futuristic, the system level models used for predicting the fuel cells' performance and for other modules such as the desulfurizer have significant uncertainties in them. Also, the performance curves of the SOFC would differ depending on the materials used for the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. The accurate characterization and quantification of these uncertainties is crucial to the credibility of the model predictions. We have utilized the uncertainty analysis of the (HP-LP)SOFC/ST/GT conceptual design to illustrate the concept of 'value of research', which deals with the examination of tradeoffs inherent in allocating scarce resources to reduce uncertainty.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 681-695","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; TRN: 000400272","10.1021/ie0492247","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712388","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712388","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","2","45"

"Steady-state bumpless transfer under controller uncertainty using the state/output feedback topology","Zheng, K; Lee, A H; Bentsman, J; Taft, C W","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; BOILERS; TURBINES; ON-LINE CONTROL SYSTEMS","Linear quadratic (LQ) bumpless transfer design introduced recently by Turner and Walker gives a very convenient and straightforward computational procedure for the steady-state bumpless transfer operator synthesis. It is, however, found to be incapable of providing convergence of the output of the offline controller to that of the online controller in several industrial applications, producing bumps in the plant output in the wake of controller transfer. An examination of this phenomenon reveals that the applications in question are characterized by a significant mismatch, further referred to as controller uncertainty, between the dynamics of the implemented controllers and their models used in the transfer operator computation. To address this problem, while retaining the convenience of the Turner and Walker design, a novel state/output feedback bumpless transfer topology is introduced that employs the nominal state of the offline controller and, through the use of an additional controller/model mismatch compensator, also the offline controller output. A corresponding steady-state bumpless transfer design procedure along with the supporting theory is developed for a large class of systems. Due to these features, it is demonstrated to solve a long-standing problem of high-quality steady-state bumpless transfer from the industry standard low-order nonlinear multiloop PID-based controllers to the modern multiinput-multioutput (MIMO) robust controllers in the megawatt/throttle pressure control of a typical coal-fired boiler/turbine unit.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-17","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-6536; IETTE2; TRN: 000400146","10.1109/TCST.2005.859632","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712271","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712271","","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","1","14"

One of the most promising mercury removal approaches is the injection of a sorbent, such as powdered activated carbon (PAC), to make it much more controllable. ADA-ES recently simulated field tests of sorbent injection at New England Power Company's Brayton Point Power Plant in Somerset, Mass., where activated carbon sorbent was injected using a set of eight lances upstream of the second of two electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). Consultants from Fluent created a computational model of the ductwork and injection lances. The simulation results showed that the flue gas flow was poorly distributed at the sorbent injection plane, and that a small region of reverse flow occurred, a result of the flow pattern at the exit of the first ESP. The results also illustrated that the flow was predominantly in the lower half of the duct, and affected by some upstream turning vanes. The simulations demonstrated the value of CFD as a diagnostic tool. They were performed in a fraction of the time and cost required for the physical tests yet provided far more diagnostic information, such as the distribution of mercury and sorbent at each point in the computational domain. 1 fig.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 110; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 13,15","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; POENAI; TRN: 000400204","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712324","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","1","110"

The model incorporated the effects of diffusion within the porous SCR catalyst and the competition between ammonia and Hg for active sites on the catalyst. Laboratory data on Hg oxidation in simulated flue gas and slipstream data on Hg oxidation in flue gas from power plants were modeled. The model provided good fits to the data for eight different catalysts, both plate and monolith, across a temperature range of 280-420{sup o}C, with space velocities varying from 1900 to 5000 hr{sup -1}. Space velocity, temperature, hydrochloric acid content of the flue gas, ratio of ammonia to nitric oxide, and catalyst design all affected Hg oxidation across the SCR catalyst.

"A predictive mechanism for mercury oxidation on selective catalytic reduction catalysts under coal-derived flue gas","Niksa, Stephen; Fujiwara, Naoki","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION; COAL; FLUE GAS; MERCURY; OXIDATION; NITROGEN OXIDES; AMMONIA; NITRIC OXIDE; CATALYSTS; HYDROCHLORIC ACID; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; CATALYTIC EFFECTS","This paper introduces a predictive mechanism for elemental mercury (Hg{sup 0}) oxidation on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts in coal-fired utility gas cleaning systems, given the ammonia (NH{sub 3})/nitric oxide (NO) ratio and concentrations of Hg{sup 0} and HCl at the monolith inlet, the monolith pitch and channel shape, and the SCR temperature and space velocity. A simple premise connects the established mechanism for catalytic NO reduction to the Hg{sup 0} oxidation behavior on SCRs: that hydrochloric acid (HCl) competes for surface sites with NH{sub 3} and that Hg{sup 0} contacts these chlorinated sites either from the gas phase or as a weakly adsorbed species. This mechanism explicitly accounts for the inhibition of Hg{sup 0} oxidation by NH{sub 3}, so that the monolith sustains two chemically distinct regions. In the inlet region, strong NH{sub 3} adsorption minimizes the coverage of chlorinated surface sites, so NO reduction inhibits Hg{sup 0} oxidation. But once NH{sub 3} has been consumed, the Hg{sup 0} oxidation rate rapidly accelerates, even while the HCl concentration in the gas phase is uniform. Factors that shorten the length of the NO reduction region factors that enhance surface chlorination, promote Hg{sup 0} oxidation. This mechanism accurately interprets the reported tendencies for greater extents of Hg{sup 0} oxidation on honeycomb monoliths with smaller channel pitches and hotter temperatures and the tendency for lower extents of Hg{sup 0} oxidation for hotter temperatures on plate monoliths. The mechanism reproduces the reported extents of Hg{sup 0} oxidation on a single catalyst for four coals that generated HCl concentrations from 8 to 241 ppm, which covers the entire range encountered in the U.S. utility industry. Similar performance is also demonstrated for full-scale SCRs with diverse coal types and operating conditions. 28 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1866-1875","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000400171","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464779","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","20712291","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712291","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","12","55"

A three-layer Lagrangian model called ATMOS was used to simulate the spatial distribution of incremental sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) and coarse particulate matter (PM10) concentrations under different emission control scenarios. In 2005, the emissions from planned power plants mainly affected the air quality of Shanxi, Shaanxi, the common boundary of Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, and the area around the boundary between Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. In these areas, the annually averaged incremental SO{sub 2} and PM10 concentrations exceed 2 and 2.5 {mu}g/m{sup 3}, respectively. The maximum increases of the annually averaged SO{sub 2} and PM10 concentrations are 8.3 and 7.2 {mu}g/m{sup 3}, respectively, which occur around Hancheng city. After integrated control measures are considered, the maximum increases of annually averaged SO{sub 2} and PM10 concentrations fall to 4.9 and 4 {mu} g/m{sup 3}, respectively. In 2010, the areas affected by planned power plants are mainly North Shaanxi, North Ningxia, and Northwest Shanxi. The maximum increases of the annually averaged SO{sub 2} and PM10 concentrations are, respectively, 6.3 and 5.6 {mu}g/m{sup 3}, occurring in Northwest Shanxi, which decline to 4.4 and 4.1 {mu}g/m{sup 3} after the control measures are implemented. The results showed that the proposed power plants mainly affect the air quality of the region where the power plants are built. The impacts will be decreased greatly by implementing integrated control measures. 11 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1816-1826","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000400172","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712292","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712292","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","12","55"

Nitrogen dioxide (NO{sub 2}) is one of the six criteria pollutants regulated by the 1970 Clean Air Act where National Ambient Air Quality Standards were established to protect public health and welfare. Patent data are used to show that in the cases of Japan, Germany, and the United States, innovations in NOx control technologies did not occur until stringent government regulations were in place, thus 'forcing' innovation. It is demonstrated that reductions in the capital and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs of new generations of high-efficiency NOx control technologies, selective catalytic reduction (SCR), are consistently associated with the increasing adoption of the control technology: the so-called learning-by-doing phenomena. The results show that as cumulative world coal-fired SCR capacity doubles, capital costs decline to {approximately} 86% and O&amp;M costs to 58% of their original values. The observed changes in SCR technology reflect the impact of technological advance as well as other factors, such as market competition and economies of scale. 38 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1827-1838","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000400173","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712293","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712293","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","12","55"

A fiber optic pressure sensor utilizing single-crystal cubic zirconia as the sensing element is reported. The pressure response of this sensor has been measured at temperatures up to 1000{sup o}C. Additional experimental results show that cubic zirconia could be used for pressure sensing at temperatures over 1000{sup o}C.

"Improved accounting of emissions from utility energy storage system operation","Denholm, Paul; Holloway, Tracey","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; ENERGY STORAGE; EMISSION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; SULFUR DIOXIDE; NITROGEN OXIDES; USA; COAL; POWER GENERATION; ACCURACY; PEAK LOAD; OFF-PEAK ENERGY STORAGE; CALCULATION METHODS; ACCOUNTING; CARBON DIOXIDE; HEAT RATE","Several proposed utility-scale energy storage systems in the U.S. will use the spare output capacity of existing electric power systems to create the equivalent of new load-following plants that can rapidly respond to fluctuations in electricity demand and increase the flexibility of baseload generators. New energy storage systems using additional generation from existing plants can directly compete with new traditional sources of load-following and peaking electricity, yet this application of energy storage is not required to meet many of the Clean Air Act standards required of new electricity generators (e.g., coal- or gas-fired power plants). This study evaluates the total emissions that will likely result from the operation of a new energy storage facility when coupled with an average existing U.S. coal-fired power plant and estimates that the emission rates of SO{sub 2} and NOx will be considerably higher than the rate of a new plant meeting Clean Air Act standards, even accounting for the efficiency benefits of energy storage. This study suggests that improved emissions 'accounting' might be necessary to provide accurate environmental comparisons between energy storage and more traditional sources of electricity generation. 35 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 23; Other Information: paul_denholm@nrel.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 9016-9022","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000300001","10.1021/es0505898","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20700810","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20700810","","Environmental Science and Technology","23","39"
"Environmental effects of interstate power trading on electricity consumption mixes","Marriott, Joe; Matthews, H Scott","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS; ELECTRIC POWER; POWER GENERATION; ENERGY CONSUMPTION; SECTORAL ANALYSIS; INDUSTRY; IMPORTS; DOMESTIC SUPPLIES; TRADE; DIVERSIFICATION; ENERGY SOURCES; MIXTURES; FOSSIL FUELS; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES","Although many studies of electricity generation use national or state average generation mix assumptions, in reality a great deal of electricity is transferred between states with very different mixes of fossil and renewable fuels, and using the average numbers could result in incorrect conclusions in these studies. The authors create electricity consumption profiles for each state and for key industry sectors in the U.S. based on existing state generation profiles, net state power imports, industry presence by state, and an optimization model to estimate interstate electricity trading. Using these 'consumption mixes' can provide a more accurate assessment of electricity use in life-cycle analyses. It is concluded that the published generation mixes for states that import power are misleading, since the power consumed in-state has a different makeup than the power that was generated. And, while most industry sectors have consumption mixes similar to the U.S. average, some of the most critical sectors of the economy - such as resource extraction and material processing sectors - are very different. This result does validate the average mix assumption made in many environmental assessments, but it is important to accurately quantify the generation methods for electricity used when doing life-cycle analyses. 16 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: marriott@cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8584-8590","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000100184","10.1021/es0506859","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20681352","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20681352","","Environmental Science and Technology","22","39"

The authors examine the costs of renewable power, accounting for the federal production tax credit, the market value of a renewable credit, and the value of producing electricity without emissions of SO{sub 2}, NOx, mercury, and CO{sub 2}. The focus is on Texas, which has a large RPS and is the largest U.S. electricity producer and one of the largest emitters of pollutants and CO{sub 2}. The private and social costs of wind generation in an RPS is compared with the current cost of fossil generation, accounting for the pollution and CO{sub 2} emissions. It was found that society paid about 5.7 cents/kWh more for wind power, counting the additional generation, transmission, intermittency, and other costs. The higher cost includes credits amounting to 1.1 cents/kWh in reduced SO{sub 2}, NOx, and Hg emissions. These pollution reductions and lower CO{sub 2} emissions could be attained at about the same cost using pulverized coal (PC) or natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS); the reductions could be obtained more cheaply with an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant with CCS. 35 refs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 22; Other Information: apt@cmu.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8578-8583","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000100183","10.1021/es048024j","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20681351","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20681351","","Environmental Science and Technology","22","39"
"Nanostructured sorbents for capture of cadmium species in combustion environments","Lee, Myong-Hwa; Cho, Kuk; Shah, Apoorva P; Biswas, Pratim","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; NANOSTRUCTURES; CAPTURE; CADMIUM; AEROSOLS; COMBUSTION PRODUCTS; CADMIUM OXIDES; ADSORBENTS; LEACHING; NUCLEATION; CHEMISORPTION; SILICA; PARTICLE SIZE; DEMETALLIZATION; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; FLUE GAS","The pathways of cadmium species to form a sub-micrometer-sized aerosol in a combustion system exhaust were established. Cadmium oxide was the predominant species formed in the experiments and resulted in particles of a mean size of 26-63 nm with number concentrations in the range of 2-8 x 10{sup 6} cm{sup -3}. Two different nanostructured sorbents, a solid montmorillonite (MMT) and an in situ generated agglomerated silica, were used for capture of the cadmium species. The MMT sorbent was not stable at 1000{sup o}C, and structural changes resulted. MMT did not suppress nucleation of cadmium species and partially captured it by weak physisorption as established by the leachability tests. In contrast, the in situ generated silica nanostructured agglomerates had a high surface area, suppressed nucleation of cadmium species vapors, and chemisorbed them effectively resulting in a firm binding, as compared to the MMT sorbent. There is an optimal temperature-time relationship at which the capture process is expected to be most effective. The leaching efficiency under these conditions was less than 3.2%. The nanostructured silica agglomerate size can be tuned for effective capture in existing particle control devices. 46 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 21; Other Information: pratim.biwas@wustl.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 8481-8489","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000100094","10.1021/es0506713","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20681281","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20681281","","Environmental Science and Technology","21","39"
"A new coordinated control strategy for boiler-turbine system of coal-fired power plant","Li, S Y; Liu, H B; Cai, W J; Soh, Y C; Xie, L H","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; BOILERS; STEAM TURBINES; CONTROL SYSTEMS","This paper presents the new development of the boiler-turbine coordinated control strategy using fuzzy reasoning and autotuning techniques. The boiler-turbine system is a very complex process that is a multivariable, nonlinear, slowly time-varying plant with large settling time and a lot of uncertainties. As there exist strong couplings between the main steam pressure control loop and the power output control loop in the boiler-turbine unit with large time-delay and uncertainties, automatic coordinated control of the two loops is a very challenging problem. This paper presents a new coordinated control strategy (CCS) which is organized into two levels: a basic control level and a high supervision level. Proportional-integral derivative (PID) type controllers are used in the basic level to perform basic control functions while the decoupling between two control loops can be realized in the high level. A special subclass of fuzzy inference systems, called the Gaussian partition with evenly (GPE) spaced midpoints systems, is used to self-tune the main steam pressure PID controller's parameters online based on the error signal and its first difference, aimed at overcoming the uncertainties due to changing fuel calorific value, machine wear, contamination of the boiler heating surfaces and plant modeling errors. For the large variation of operating condition, a supervisory control level has been developed by autotuning technique. The developed CCS has been implemented in a power plant in China, and satisfactory industrial operation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy has enhanced the adaptability and robustness of the process. Indeed, better control performance and economic benefit have been achieved.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 943-954","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-6536; IETTE2; TRN: 000100113","10.1109/TCST.2005.854319","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20681293","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20681293","","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","6","13"

During BRAVO, daily speciated fine (diameter &lt;2.5 {mu}m) particulate concentrations were measured at 37 sites throughout Texas. At the primary receptor site, K-Bar Ranch, there were many additional measurements including a 'high-sensitivity' version of the 24-hr fine particulate elemental data. The spatial, temporal, and interspecies patterns in these data are examined here to qualitatively investigate source regions and source types influencing the fine particulate concentrations in Texas with an emphasis on sources of sulfates, the largest contributor to fine mass and light extinction. Peak values of particulate sulfur (S) varied spatially and seasonally. Maximum S was in Northeast Texas during the summer, whereas peak S at BBNP was in the fall. Sulfate acidity at BBNP also varied by month. Sources of Se were evident in Northeast Texas and from the Carbon I and II coal-fired plants. High S episodes at BBNP during BRAVO had several different trace element characteristics. Carbon concentrations at BBNP during BRAVO were probably mostly urban-related, with arrival from the Houston area likely. The Houston artificial tracer released during the second half of BRAVO was highly correlated with some carbon fractions. There was evidence of the influence of African dust at sites throughout Texas during the summer. Patterns in several trace elements were also examined. Vanadium was associated with air masses from Mexico. Lead concentrations in southern Texas have dropped dramatically over the past several years. 23 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1636-1648","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000200039","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464757","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","20688426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20688426","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","",""

However, no applicable theoretical models have been developed to calculate the dissolution rate of rising CO{sub 2} droplets with or without hydrate shells. Such models are important for the evaluation of the fate of CO{sub 2} injected into oceans. Here, the author adapts a convective dissolution model to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of a single rising CO{sub 2} droplet (or noninteracting CO{sub 2} droplets) in seawater. The model has no free parameters; all of the required parameters are independently available from literature. The input parameters include: the initial depth, the initial size of the droplet, the temperature as a function of depth, density of CO{sub 2} liquid, the solubility of CO{sub 2} liquid or hydrate, the diffusivity of CO{sub 2}, and viscosity of seawater. The effect of convection in enhancing mass transfer is treated using relations among dimensionless numbers. The calculated dissolution rate for CO{sub 2} droplets with a hydrate shell agrees with data in the literature. The theory can be used to explore the fate of CO{sub 2} injected into oceans under various temperature and pressure conditions. 28 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: youxue@umich.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7719-7724","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001200088","10.1021/es050140e","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20674521","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20674521","","Environmental Science and Technology","19","39"

The proportion of bioaccessible to total metal ranged from zero (V) to 80% (Zn) for coal-derived ash in SLF and from 2 (Th) to 100% (Cu) for tire-derived fly ash in SGF. The tire-derived ash contained much more Zn. However, Zn ranked only 5th of the various toxic metals in SGF compared with international regulations for ingestion. On the basis of total concentrations, the metals closest to exceeding limits based on international regulations for inhalation were Cr, Pb, and Al. On dissolution in SLF, the most limiting metals were Pb, Cu, and Zn. For metals exposed to SGF there was no relative change in the top metal, Al, before and after dissolution but the second-ranked metal shifted from Pb to Ni. In most cases only a proportion of the total metal concentrations in either fly ash was soluble, and hence bioaccessible, in either biofluid. When considering the regulatory limits for inhalation of particulates, none of the metal concentrations measured were as hazardous as the fly ash particulates themselves. However, on the basis of the international ingestion regulations for Al, the maximum mass of fly ash that could be ingested is only 1 mg per day (10 mg based on bioaccessibility). It is possible that such a small mass could be consumed by exposed individuals or groups. 39 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 19; Other Information: jrt@ansto.gov.au","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 7749-7756","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 001200089","10.1021/es0502369","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20674522","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20674522","","Environmental Science and Technology","19","39"

That should not be a surprise; a typical steam generator has miles of tubes that operate at high temperatures and pressures. Are your experiences comparable to those of your peers? Could you learn something from tube-leak benchmarking data that could improve the operation of your plant? The Electric Utility Cost Group (EUCG) recently completed a boiler-tube failure study that is available only to its members.

The traditional way to clean heat-transfer surfaces is by sootblowing using air, steam, or water at regular intervals. But with the advent of fuel-switching strategies, such as switching to PRB coal to reduce a plant's emissions, the control of heating surface cleanliness has become more problematic for many owners of steam generators. Boiler modeling can help solve that problem. The article describes Babcock & Wilcox's Powerclean modeling system which consists of heating surface models that produce real-time cleanliness indexes. The Heat Transfer Manager (HTM) program is the core of the system, which can be used on any make or model of boiler. A case study is described to show how the system was successfully used at the 1,350 MW Unit 2 of the American Electric Power's Rockport Power Plant in Indiana. The unit fires a blend of eastern bituminous and Powder River Basin coal. 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34-37","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 001200256","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20674672","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20674672","","Power (New York)","8","149"

In a concept proposed by Clean Energy Systems, Inc., nitrogen is removed from the combustion air and replaced with steam diluent. In this way, formation of nitrogen oxides is prevented, and the exhaust stream can be separated into concentrated CO2 and water streams. The concentrated CO2 stream could then serve as input to a CO2 sequestration process. In this study, experimental data are reported from a full-scale combustion test using steam as the diluent in oxy-fuel combustion. This combustor represents the “reheat” combustion system in a steam cycle that uses a high and low-pressure steam expansion. The reheat combustor serves to raise the temperature of the low-pressure steam turbine inlet, similar to the reheat stage of a conventional steam power cycle. Unlike a conventional steam cycle, the reheat enthalpy is actually generated by oxy-fuel combustion in the steam flow. This paper reports on the unique design aspects of this combustor, as well as initial emissions and operating performance.","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), New York, NY","Publisher","National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, Morgantown, WV, and Albany, OR; NASA, Sandusky, OH; Clean Energy Systems, Inc., Rancho Cordova, CA","USDOE - Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2005-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 127; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: ASME 2003 Turbo Expo: Power for Land, Sea, and Air, Atlanta, GA, June 16-19, 2003","","Medium: X; Size: 740-747","","DOE/NETL-IR-2006-012; NETL-TPR-0635","None cited","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: US200820%%83","10.1115/1.1924633","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","938559","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/938559","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","127"

It discusses the established commercial primary and secondary control technologies and examines what is being done to use them more effectively. Furthermore, the paper discusses recent developments in NOx controls. The popular primary control technologies in use in the United States are low-NOx burners and overfire air. Data reflect that average NOx reductions for specific primary controls have ranged from 35% to 63% from 1995 emissions levels. The secondary NOx control technologies applied on U.S. coal-fired utility boilers include reburning, selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Thirty-six U.S. coal-fired utility boilers have installed SNCR, and reported NOx reductions achieved at these applications ranged from 15% to 66%. Recently, SCR has been installed at 150 U.S. coal-fired utility boilers. Data on the performance of 20 SCR systems operating in the United States with low-NOx emissions reflect that in 2003, these units achieved NOx emission rates between 0.04 and 0.07 lb/106 Btu. 106 refs., 6 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Other Information: srivastava.ravi@epa.gov","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1367-1388","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001200313","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464736","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","20674729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20674729","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","",""

This is only possible if all the CO{sub 2} produced is captured and if one avoids the admixture of nitrogen from the air with fuel gases. Because zero emission coal plants have no smoke stack, they emit no pollutants to the air. Zero emission plants circulate a gas stream to which fresh fuel is added and from which spent fuel and impurities are removed as solids or liquids. Coal is gasified via hydrogenation (hydrogasification), steam reforming or CO{sub 2} gasification (Boudouard reaction). In one class of zero emission coal plants, the gas (not necessarily hydrogen) is oxidized in a fuel cell and the resultant water and CO{sub 2} are partially removed before returning the remaining gas to the gasifier. The high conversion efficiency of zero emission power plants, which exceeds 70% even in realistic designs, stems from combining fuel cells with careful heat management. The paper generalizes the concepts and outlines the thermodynamic basis of zero emission power plants.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Minerals and Metallurgical Processing; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 161-167","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0747-9182; MMPRE8; TRN: 001100129","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20674295","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20674295","","Minerals and Metallurgical Processing","3","22"

Potential builders are looking for greater certainty on a number of energy, environmental and regulatory issues before they invest. The work of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) in advocating solutions to create this certainty is reported in this article. It is asking Congress to put transmission assets on a par with other major assets and reduce their depreciable lives from 20 to 15 years, and calling for repeal legislation that limits investment in the regulated energy industry. EEI is advocating federal environmental legislation similar to the Clean Skies Act that would lower emissions faster, with greater certainty, and with greater cost savings.

The estimated OC blank concentrations ranged from 1 to 2.4 {mu}g/m{sup 3} showing higher values in urban areas for the 13 monitoring sites in the northeastern United States. In the STN data, several different samplers and analyzers are used, and various instruments show different method detection limit (MDL) values, as well as errors. A comprehensive set of error structures that would be used for numerous source apportionment studies of STN data was estimated by comparing a limited set of measured concentrations and their associated uncertainties. To examine the estimated error structures and investigate the appropriate MDL values, PM2.5 samples collected at a STN site in Burlington, VT, were analyzed through the application of the positive matrix factorization. A total of 323 samples that were collected between December 2000 and December 2003 and 49 species based on several variable selection criteria were used, and eight sources were successfully identified in this study with the estimated error structures and min values among different MDL values from the five instruments: secondary sulfate aerosol (41%) identified as the result of emissions from coal-fired power plants, secondary nitrate aerosol (20%), airborne soil (15%), gasoline vehicle emissions (7%), diesel emissions (7%), aged sea salt (4%), copper smelting (3%), and ferrous smelting (2%). Time series plots of contributions from airborne soil indicate that the highly elevated impacts from this source were likely caused primarily by dust storms.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: hopkepk@clarkson.edu","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1190-1199","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 001000273","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20647745","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20647745","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","8","55"

Laboratory reactor tests, in which a commercially available activated carbon was used, showed a significant catalytic effect. It is shown that the kinetic equation for the catalytic oxidation of S(IV), in seawater slurries of activated carbon, is first-order with respect to S(IV) and zero-order with respect to oxygen. The dependence of the kinetic constant with respect to pH, temperature, and catalyst size particles were also obtained. The study showed that using an appropriated size and concentration of catalyst, it is possible to reach, at pH = 4, S(IV), oxidation rates similar to those obtained at pH = 6 without catalyst. Operating at pH = 4 requires less seawater flow rate in the oxidation basin than at pH = 6. Thus, the volume of the water treatment plant can be reduced too. The space requirements and both the capital and the operating cost are lower, a critical issue concerning the retrofitting of existing power stations. 12 refs., 9 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 13; Other Information: vidal@esi.us.es","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 5031-5036","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: 000900048","10.1021/es048929x","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20638440","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638440","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","39"

"Preliminary estimates of performance and cost of mercury emission control technology applications on electric utility boilers: An update","Srivastava, R K; Staudt, J E; Jozewicz, W","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COAL; MERCURY; COST ESTIMATION; ACTIVATED CARBON; INJECTION; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; SCRUBBERS; ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATORS; PERFORMANCE; DENITRIFICATION; DESULFURIZATION; FLUE GAS; USA","The Environmental Protection Agency has recently proposed a reduction in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. There are two broad approaches under development to controlling mercury emissions from coal-fired electric utility boilers. (1) powdered activated carbon (PAC) injection; and (2) multipollutant control, in which Hg capture is enhanced in existing and new sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) control devices. To help inform the recent EPA rulemaking proposal, estimates of performance levels and related costs associated with the above mercury control approaches were developed. This work presents these estimates. Estimates of cost for PAC injection range from 0.003 to 3.096 mills/kWb. In general, the higher costs are associated with the plants using spray dryers and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) or plants using hot-side ESPs, which represent a minority of power plants. Excluding these plants, cost estimates range between 0.003 and 1.903 mills/kWh. At the low end of the cost ranges, 0.003 mills/kWb, it is assumed that no additional control technologies are needed, but mercury monitoring will be necessary. In these cases, high mercury removal may be the result of the type of NOx and SO{sub 2} control measures currently used, such as combinations of selective catalytic reduction and wet flue gas desulfurization or spray drier absorbers with fabric filters on bituminous coal-fired boilers. Because mercury control approaches are under development at present, cost and performance estimates are preliminary and are expected to be refined as mercury control technologies are matured to commercial status. Factors that may affect the performance of these technologies include speciation of mercury in flue gas, the characteristics of the sorbent, and the type(s) of PM, NOx, and SO, controls used.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 198-213","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0278-4491; ENVPDI; TRN: 000900257","10.1002/ep.10057","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20638611","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638611","","Environmental Progress","2","24"

This article evaluates predicted extents of Hg oxidation from a detailed chemical reaction mechanism, emphasizing the data from 1 and 29 MW pilotscale furnaces for diverse coal types. The proposed mercury (Hg) oxidation mechanism consists of a 168-step gas phase mechanism that accounts for interaction among all important flue gas species and a heterogeneous oxidation mechanism on unburned carbon (UBC) particles, similar to established chemistry for dioxin production under comparable conditions. The mechanism was incorporated into a gas cleaning system simulator to predict the proportions of elemental and oxidized Hg species in the flue gases, given relevant coal properties (C/H/O/N/S/Cl/Hg), flue gas composition (O{sub 2}, H{sub 2}O, HCl), emissions (NOx, SOx, CO), the recovery of fly ash, fly ash loss-on-ignition (LOI), and a thermal history. Predictions are validated without parameter adjustments against datasets from lab-scale and from pilot-scale coal furnaces at 1 and 29 MWt. Collectively, the evaluations cover 16 coals representing ranks from sub-bituminous through high-volatile bituminous, including cases with Cl{sub 2} and CaCl{sub 2} injection. The predictions are, therefore, validated over virtually the entire domain of Cl-species concentrations and UBC levels of commercial interest. Additional predictions identify the most important operating conditions in the furnace and gas cleaning system, including stoichiometric ratio, NOX, LOI, and residence time, as well as the most important coal properties, including coal-Cl. 33 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: neasteve@pacbell.net","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 930-939","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900287","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464688","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20638630","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638630","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","55"

During the study period, the seasonal mean visibilities in spring, summer, fall, and winter were only 5.4, 9.1, 8.2, and 3.4 km, respectively. To ascertain how urban aerosols influence the visibility, we conducted concurrent visibility monitoring and aerosol sampling in 1999 to identify the principal causes of visibility impairments in the region. In this study, ambient aerosols were sampled and analyzed for 11 constituents, including water-soluble ions and carbon materials, to investigate the chemical composition of Kaohsiung aerosols. Stepwise regression method was used to correlate the impact of aerosol species on visibility impairments. Both seasonal and diurnal variation patterns were found from the monitoring of visibility. Results showed that light scattering was attributed primarily to aerosols with sizes that range from 0.26 to 0.90 {mu}m, corresponding with the wavelength region of visible light, which accounted for {approximately} 72% of the light scattering coefficient. Sulfate was a dominant component that affected both the light scattering coefficient and the visibility in the region. On average, (NH{sub 4}){sup 2}SO{sub 4}, NH{sub 4}NO{sub 3}, total carbon, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)-remainder contributed 53%, 17%, 16%, and 14% to total light scattering, respectively. An empirical regression model of visibility based on sulfate, elemental carbon, and humidity was developed, and the comparison indicated that visibility in an urban area could be properly simulated by the equation derived herein. 35 refs., 10 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1031-1041","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900290","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20638633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638633","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","55"

It applies multiple quantitative and qualitative measures of innovation to a case subject to several 'technology - push' and 'demand-pull', instruments: sulfur dioxide control technology for power plants. The study employs analyses of public R&amp;D funding, patents, expert interviews, learning curves, conference proceedings, and experience curves. Results indicate that: regulation and the anticipation of regulation stimulate invention; technology-push instruments appear to be less effective at prompting invention than demand-pull instruments; and regulatory stringency focuses inventive activity along certain technology pathways. Increased diffusion of the technology results in significant and predictable operating cost reductions in existing systems, as well as notable efficiency improvements and capital cost reductions in new systems. Government plays an important role in fostering knowledge transfer via technical conferences, as well as affecting the pattern of collaborative relationships within the technical research community via regulatory changes that affect the market for the technology. Finally, the case provides little evidence for the claim that cap-and-trade instruments induce innovation more effectively than other instruments.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Technological Forecasting and Social Change; Journal Volume: 72; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 697-718","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0040-1625; TFSCB3; TRN: 001000097","10.1016/j.techfore.2004.11.001","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20647584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20647584","","Technological Forecasting and Social Change","6","72"

The droplet pH, diameter, S(IV) concentration, sulfur dioxide concentration, and liquid-to-gas ratio are found to influence the absorption of sulfur dioxide by the fine water spray. The results demonstrate that the absorption of sulfur dioxide by the fine water spray increases as the droplet diameter falls. The concentration gradient between the interface of the gaseous and liquid phases causes the absorption of sulfur dioxide by the droplets to increase as the initial S(IV) concentration decreases or the sulfur dioxide concentration increases. The results indicate that the performance of the fine water spray in removing sulfur dioxide is generally improved by reducing the droplet diameter or the initial S(IV) concentration, or by increasing the sulfur dioxide concentration, the droplet pH or the liquid-to-gas ratio. The proposed model reveals the parameters that should be controlled in using a fine water spray device and a method for improving its performance in removing sulfur dioxide.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A: Toxic Hazardous Substances and Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 40; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2027-2039","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1093-4529; TRN: 000400036","10.1080/10934520500230971","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20712166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20712166","","Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part A: Toxic Hazardous Substances and Environmental Engineering","1","40"

One of the more significant issues is to improve poor gas distribution that causes bag failures in baghouse operation. Bag failures during operation are almost impossible to prevent, but proper flow design can help in their prevention. This study investigated vertical velocity profiles below the bags in a baghouse (the hopper region) to determine whether flow could be improved with the installation of flow distributors in the hopper region. Three types of flow distributors were used to improve flow distribution and were compared with the original baghouse without flow distributors. Velocity profiles were measured by a hot-wire anemometer at an inlet velocity of 18 m/sec. Uniformity of flow distribution was calculated by the uniformity value U for the velocity profile of each flow distributor. Experimental results showed that the velocity profile of the empty configuration (without flow distributors) was poor because the uniformity value was 2.048. The uniformity values of type 1 (flow distributor with three vertical vanes), type 2 (flow distributor with one vertical and one inclined vane), and type 3 (flow distributor with two inclined vanes) configurations were reduced to 1.051, 0.617, and 0.526, respectively. These results indicate that the flow distributors designed in this study made significant improvements in the velocity profile of a baghouse, with the type 3 configuration having the best performance. 11 refs., 10 figs.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: chencj@ccsum.tajen.edu.tw","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 886-892","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900286","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464678","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","20638629","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638629","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","55"
"The impact of wet flue gas desulfurization scrubbing on mercury emissions from coal-fired power stations","Niksa, Stephen; Fujiwara, Naoki","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FLUE GAS; DESULFURIZATION; MERCURY; EMISSION; COAL; RETENTION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; SCRUBBERS; CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; OXIDATION; EFFICIENCY; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; PREDICTION EQUATIONS; LIMESTONE; LIME-LIMESTONE WET SCRUBBING PROCESSES; PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS; MERCURY CHLORIDES; HYDROCHLORIC ACID","The article introduces a predictive capability for mercury (Hg) retention in any Ca-based wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber, given Hg speciation at the FGD inlet, the flue gas composition, and the sulphur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) capture efficiency. A preliminary statistical analysis of data from 17 full-scale wet FGDs connects flue gas compositions, the extents of Hg oxidation at FGD inlets, and Hg retention efficiencies. These connections show that solution chemistry within the FGD determines Hg retention. A more thorough analysis based on thermochemical equilibrium yields highly accurate predictions for total Hg retention with no parameter adjustments. For the most reliable data, the predictions were within measurement uncertainties for both limestone and Mg/lime systems operating in both forced and natural oxidation mode. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Information Collection Request (ICR) database, the quantitative performance was almost as good for the most modern FGDs, which probably conform to the very high SO{sub 2} absorption efficiencies assumed in the calculations. The large discrepancies for older FGDs are tentatively attributed to the unspecified SO{sub 2} capture efficiencies and operating temperatures and to the possible elimination of HCl in prescrubbers. The equilibrium calculations suggest that Hg retention is most sensitive to inlet HCl and O{sub 2} levels and the FGD temperature; weakly dependent on SO{sub 2} capture efficiency; and insensitive to HgCl{sub 2}, NO, CA:S ratio, slurry dilution level in limestone FGDs, and MgSO{sub 3} levels in Mg/lime systems. Consequently, systems with prescrubbers to eliminate HCl probably retain less Hg than fully integrated FGDs. The analysis also predicts re-emission of Hg{sub 0} but only for inlet O{sub 2} levels that are much lower than those in full-scale FGDs. 12 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: neasteve@pacbell.net","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 970-977","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900288","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464689","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","20638631","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638631","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","55"

Dust (fly ash) emissions are positively correlated to free calcium oxide content, whereas sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) emissions are negatively correlated. As a result, at present, the Agios Dimitrios Power Plant operates very strictly within the legislative limits on atmospheric particulate emission. In the study reported, the factors to be considered in assessing the impact of lignite combustion on the environment are presented and evaluated statistically. The ash appears to have a remarkable SO{sub 2} natural dry scrubbing capability when the free calcium oxide content ranges between 4 and 7%. Precipitator operating problems attributable to high ash resistivity can be overcome by injecting sulfur trioxide to reduce the ash resistivity, with, of course, a probable increase in operating costs. 27 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1042-1049","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900291","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464694","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","20638634","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638634","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","7","55"

Taking the time to carefully develop a co-benefits mercury strategy may reduce overall costs of compliance and exposure to performance and financial risk. The article discusses the effectiveness of various air pollution control devices (APCDs) in removing mercury. Experience indicates that at plants burning bituminous coals, a fabric filter (FF), an FF combined with a spray dryer, or a flue gas desulfurization system can reduce mercury by 60-90%. Cold-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) remove only 40% of the mercury in flue gas and hot-side ESPs remove virtually none. The rank of coal and its chlorine content influence the removal of mercury. Reaction Engineering International has demonstrated the usefulness of a CFD model to quantify the impacts of variations of burner air and fuel flows on NOx, unburned carbon in fly ash, and mercury speciation in flue gases. 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: senior@reaction-eng.com","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 40,42-43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; POWEAD; TRN: 000900055","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20638447","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638447","","Power (New York)","5","149"

The results of the fixed-bed testing under simulated lignite combustion flue gas composition for activated carbons showed some initial breakthrough followed by increased mercury (Hg) capture for up to {approximately}4.8 hr. After breakthrough, the Hg in the effluent stream was primarily in an oxidized form ({gt}90%). Aliquots of selected activated carbons were exposed to simulated flue gas containing Hg{sup 0} vapor for varying time intervals to explore surface chemistry changes as the initial breakthrough, Hg capture, and oxidation occurred. The samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine changes in the abundance and forms of sulfur, chlorine, oxygen, and nitrogen moieties as a result of interactions of flue gas components on the activated carbon surface during the sorption process. The data are best explained by a competition between the bound hydrogen chloride (HCl) and increasing sulfur (S(VI)) for a basic carbon binding site. Because loss of HCl is also coincident with Hg breakthrough or loss of the divalent Hg ion (Hg{sup 2+}), the competition of Hg{sup 2+} with S(VI) on the basic carbon site is also implied. Thus, the role of the acid gases in Hg capture and release can be explained. 25 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 747-754","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900064","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464672","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20638456","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638456","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","55"

Wet (or waterbased) ESPs are well suited for collection of acid aerosols and fine particulates because of greater corona power and virtually no re-entrainment. However, field disruptions because of spraying (misting) of water, formation of dry spots (channeling), and collector surface corrosion limit the applicability of current wet ESPs in the control of secondary PM2.5. Researchers at Ohio University have patented novel membrane collection surfaces to address these problems. Water-based cleaning in membrane collectors made of corrosion-resistant fibers is facilitated by capillary action between the fibers, maintaining an even distribution of water. This paper presents collection efficiency results of lab-scale and pilot-scale testing at First Energy's Bruce Mansfield Plant for the membrane-based wet ESP. The data indicate that a membrane wet ESP was more effective at collecting fine particulates, acid aerosols, and oxidized mercury than the metal-plate wet ESP, even with {approximately}15% less collecting area. 15 refs., 7 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 784-791","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 000900065","10.1080/10473289.2005.10464658","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","20638457","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20638457","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","6","55"

They would also help in developing a technology for the control of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, it is difficult to establish the accurate rate constants primarily due to the fact that mercury easily adsorbs on solid surface and its reactions can be catalyzed by the surface. We have demonstrated a procedure that allows the determination of gas phase, surface-induced, and photo-induced contributions in the kinetic study of the oxidation of mercury by chlorine gas. The kinetics was studied using reactors with various surface to volume ratios. The effect of the surface and the photo irradiation on the reaction was taken into consideration. The pressure dependent study revealed that the gas phase oxidation was a three-body collision process. The third order rate constant was determined to be 7.5({+-}0.2) x 10{sup -39} mL{sup 2} molecules{sup -2}s{sup -1} with N{sub 2} as the third body at 297 {+-} 1 K. The surface induced reaction on quartz window was second order and the rate constant was 2.7 x 10{sup -17} mL{sup 2} molecules{sup -1} cm{sup -2} sec. Meanwhile, the 253.7 nm photon employed for mercury detection was found to accelerate the reaction. The utilization efficiency of 253.7 nm photon for Hg{sup 0} oxidation was 6.7 x 10{sup -4} molecules photon{sup -1} under the conditions employed in this study.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Coal is projected to remain a major source of energy, with most of the demand growth in developing countries. Currently available power-generating technologies, deploying coal with natural gas or biomass, are examined. Examples of successful, partial substitution of coal by other fuels in power stations are highlighted, including the GHG emissions reductions achieved as well as the costs where available. Among various options, hybrid gasification and parallel cofiring of coal with biomass and natural gas appear to have the greatest potential to reduce GHG emissions. Much may also be achieved by cofiring, reburning, and repowering with gas turbines. The best method differs between different power systems. Co-utilization of biomass with coal is a least-cost option to reduce GHG emissions where the fuel prices are comparable, usually due to subsidies or taxes. The role of biomass is likely to increase due to greater use of subsidies, carbon taxes, and emissions trading within the context of the Kyoto Protocol. This should provide opportunities for clean coal technology transfer and diffusion, including biomass co-utilization. 32 refs., 1 fig., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Power and Energy Systems; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: International conference on co-utilization of domestic fuels, Gainesville, FL (United States), 5-6 Feb 2003; Other Information: irene@iea-coal.org.uk","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 153-158","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1078-3466; TRN: 000800456","10.2316/Journal.203.2004.3.203-3410","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20490069","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20490069","","International Journal of Power and Energy Systems","3","24"

China's total energy consumption in 2000 was 1075.3 Mtce, of which coal accounted for 6.8%. Coal is thus the dominant energy source in China, which fact has led to a serious air pollution problem. It is estimated that the total biomass energy resources in China are some 437 Mtce, of which 240 Mtec of biomass energy resources came from agriculture crop residues in 2000. Biomass is a kind of clean energy, and there is great potential for China to convert biomass resources into energy to mitigate the use of coal, which will help to partially solve China's energy and environmental problems. This article describes in detail China's energy structure; the status of coal in that structure, and the resources of agriculture, forestry, and other biomass. It then introduces a project for co-firing of biomass and coal, which is a specially designed internal circulating fluidized bed (ICFB) boiler with steam capacity of 35 t/h (6 MWE), based on the operation performance of ICFB.

As there exist strong couplings between the main steam pressure control loop and the power output control loop in the boiler-turbine unit with large time-delay and uncertainties, automatic coordinated control of the two loops is a very challenging problem. This paper presents a new coordinated control strategy (CCS) which is organized into two levels: a basic control level and a high supervision level. PID-type controllers are used in the basic level to perform basic control functions while the decoupling between two control loops can be realized in the high level. Moreover, PID-type controllers can be auto-tuned to achieve a better control performance in the whole operating range and to reject the unmeasurable disturbances. A special subclass of fuzzy inference systems, namely the Gaussian partition system with evenly spaced midpoints, is also proposed to auto-tune the PID controller in the main steam pressure loop based on the error signal and its first difference to overcome uncertainties caused by changing fuel calorific value, machine wear, contamination of the boiler heating surfaces and plant modeling errors, etc. The developed CCS has been implemented in a power plant in China, and satisfactory industrial operation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy has enhanced the adaptability and robustness of the process.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 247-261","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1079-8587; TRN: 001100173","10.1080/10798587.2004.10642881","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","20539666","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20539666","","Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing","3","10"

Whitings occur when the cyanobacteria fix atmospheric CO2 through the formation of CaCO3 on their cell surfaces, which leads to precipitation to the ocean floor and subsequent entombment in mud. Whitings represent one potential mechanism for CO2 sequestration. Research was performed to determine the ability of various strains of Synechocystis and Synechococcus to calcify when grown in microcosms amended with 2.5 mM HCO3- and 3.4 mM Ca2+. Results indicated that although all strains tested have the ability to calcify, only two Synechococcus species, strains PCC 8806 and PCC 8807, were able to calcify to the extent that a CaCO3 precipitate was formed. Enumeration of the cyanobacterial cultures during testing indicated that cell density did not appear to have a direct effect on calcification. Factors that had the greatest effect on calcification were CO2 removal and subsequent generation of alkaline pH. Whereas cell density was similar for all strains tested, differences in maximum pH were demonstrated. As CO2 was removed, growth medium pH increased and soluble Ca2+ was removed from solution. The largest increases in growth medium pH occurred when CO2 levels dropped below 400 ppmv. Research presented demonstrates that, under the conditions tested, many species of cyanobacteria in the genera Synechocystis and Synechococcus are able to calcify but only two species of Synechococcus were able to calcify to an extent that led to the precipitation of calcium carbonate.","","","Idaho National Lab.

One of the previously surveyed facilities was also evaluated for heat stress, and 1 additional coal-fueled power plant was surveyed for a total of 20 personal heat stress samples. Of the nearly 400 air samples collected, only 1 exceeded the allowable occupational exposure value. For the noise samples, 55 were equal to or greater than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 8-hour hearing conservation program level of 85 dBA, and 12 were equal to or greater than the OSHA 8-hour permissible exposure level of 90 dBA. The data concluded that some work sites were above the heat stress ceiling values recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Four of the 20 employees personally monitored exceeded the recommended limits for heart rate or body core temperature.","","","","","","United States","2004-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 403-413","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1545-9624; TRN: 000800146","10.1080/15459620490453346","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20489858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20489858","","Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","6","1"

Since ready access to the ocean is likely an essential requirement for AWL, it is shown that significant limestone resources are relatively close to a majority of CO{sub 2}-emitting power plants along the coastal US. Furthermore, waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (&gt;10{sup 9} tonnes/yr), could be used in many instances as an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate. With limestone transportation to coastal sites then as the dominant cost variable, CO{sub 2} sequestration (plus capture) costs of $3-$4/tonne are achievable in certain locations. While there is vastly more limestone and water on earth than that required for AWL to capture and sequester all fossil fuel CO{sub 2} production, the transportation cost of bringing limestone, seawater, and waste CO{sub 2} into contact likely limits the method's applicability to perhaps 10-20% of US point-source emissions. Using a bench-scale laboratory reactor, it is shown that CO{sub 2} sequestration rates of 10{sup -6} to 10{sup -5} moles/sec per m{sup 2} of limestone surface area are readily achievable using seawater. This translates into reaction densities as high as 2 x 10{sup -2} tonnes CO{sub 2} m{sup -3}day{sup -1}, highly dependent on limestone particle size, solution turbulence and flow, and CO{sub 2} concentration. Modeling of AWL end-solution disposal in the ocean shows significantly reduced effects on ocean pH and carbonate chemistry relative to those caused by direct CO{sub 2} disposal into the atmosphere or ocean. In fact the increase in ocean Ca{sup 2+} and bicarbonate offered by AWL should significantly enhance the growth of corals and other marine calcifiers whose health is currently being threatened by anthropogenic CO{sub 2} invasion and pH reduction in the ocean.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

At 800 C, current densities of 50-125 mA/cm{sup 2} were measured at a representative cell voltage of 0.8 V. Power densities for cells with two carbon-anode materials were found to be nearly the same on scales of 2.8- and 60 cm{sup 2} active area. Constant current operation of a small cell was accompanied by constant voltage during multiple tests of 10-30 hour duration. Cell voltage fell off after the carbon inventory was consumed. Three different cathode structures are compared, indicating that an LLNL fabricated porous nickel electrode with &lt;10 {micro}m pores provides improved rates compared with nickel foam with 100-300 {micro}m pores. Petroleum coke containing substantial sulfur and ash discharges at a slightly lower rate than purified petroleum coke. The sulfur leads to degradation of the anode current collector over time. A conceptual model for electrochemical reactivity of carbon is presented which indicates the importance of (1) bulk lattice disorder, which continually provides surface reactive sites during anodic dissolution and (2) electrical conductivity, which lowers the ohmic component of anode polarization.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Results of tests of sorbents in systems of water conditioning of thermal power plants, cleaning of return condensates, mazut- and oil-contaminated process wastewaters, makeup water in heat networks, and biosorption cleaning of sewerage are presented. The sorption methods of cleaning are shown to have many advantages, to save expensive ion-exchange resins and reagents, to decrease the cost of desalinated water, and to prolong the service of power equipment. Comparative data are presented for basic commercial kinds of activated carbon and HCCC (sorbents activated crushed brown-coal coke (ABD)). The technical characteristics of sorbents of hot-contact coal carbonization are shown to be at the level of commercial sorbents or be higher at a much lower cost (by a factor of 2.5 - 3). It is shown that the creation of several HCCC installations with an output of 25 - 30 thousand tons of sorbents a year at coal-fired power plants will solve many water-cleaning problems of the 'EES Rossii' Co.

The proportion of thermal power plants (TPP) in the structure of the generating capacity of Russia amounts to about 70% (147 mln kW). The proportion of gas in the structure of fuel consumed by TPP amounts to 64%. It is predicted that the fraction of high-quality kinds of fuel (gas and fuel oil) will decrease in the considered period due to maximum involvement of coal in the fuel balance and wider use of combined-cycle and gas-turbine technologies that provide a lower specific consumption of fuel. It is planned to resort to advanced technologies both for reconstructing existing plants and erecting new ones. This paper deals with problems of fuel supply of fossil-fuel-fired thermal power plants in the light of the evolution of the energy economy of Russia. The demand of TPP for different kinds of fossil fuel, i.e., gas, coal, and fuel oil, is estimated for the whole of the country and for its regions according to two variants of development of the generating capacity with planned commissioning of combined-cycle plants with a total output of 32 mln kW and gas-turbine plants with a total output of 61 mln kW in the period of up to 2020.

Many materials that experience hot corrosion are exposed to high heat fluxes and temperature gradients. The hot corrosion of metals can be described by the dissolution of a protective metal oxide into the fused salt and the subsequent precipitation of the metal oxide in a non-protective form. Rapp and Goto have established a criterion for the sustained hot corrosion of a pure metal that the solubility gradient of the protective oxide in the salt film must be negative at the oxide/salt interface. The influence of a temperature gradient on the metal oxide solubility gradient (and the predicted hot corrosion susceptibility) is discussed. Solubility data for NiO in Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} are used to illustrate the effects of a temperature gradient. The effects of a temperature gradient were determined by examining various combinations of dissolution reactions, oxidants, and transport kinetics.

However, the fine sand-silt particle size of fly ash may make it more susceptible than natural soils to detachment and transport by erosive processes. Furthermore, the high content of silt-size particles in fly ash may make it more susceptible to surface crust formation, resulting in reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff and erosion. In the summer of 1989, fly ash-wood waste mixtures, used as a topsoil substitute, were surface applied on two separate mine sites in Preston County, WV, one with 10% slope and the other 20% slope. Erosion rates were measured directly using the Linear Erosion/Elevation Measuring Instrument (LEMI). Erosion measurements were taken during the first two growing seasons on both sites. Erosion values were up to five times greater on the fly ash-treated minesoil than on the untreated minesoil. Mulching with wood chips reduced fly ash erosion to about one-half the loss of the unmulched plots. Erosion was related to both the amount and type of ground cover.

BaO/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and MgO/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} possess a higher NO{sub x} storage capability than Tb{sub 4}O{sub 7}/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and La{sub 2}O{sub 3}/{gamma}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. NO/O{sub 2} coadsorbed on Tb{sub 4}O{sub 7}, La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and BaO in the form of bridging bidentate, chelating bidentate, and monodentate nitrates, and on MgO in the form of bridging bidentate and monodentate nitrates via the reaction of adsorbed NO with adsorbed oxygen at 298 K. NO/O{sub 2} coadsorbed as a chelating bidentate nitrate on Tb{sub 4}O{sub 7} and La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and as a distinctive bridging bidentate nitrate on BaO and MgO via the reaction of adsorbed NO with surface lattice oxygen at 523 K. These various forms of adsorbed nitrate differ in structure and reactivity from Tb(NO{sub 3}){sub 3}, La(NO{sub 3}){sub 3}, Ba(NO{sub 3}){sub 2}, and Mg(NO{sub 3}){sub 2}, the precursor used to prepare metal oxides for NO/O{sub 2} coadsorption. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of chelating bidentate nitrate on Tb{sub 4}O{sub 7}, La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and BaO produced primarily NO and O{sub 2}, with maxima at 640 and 670 K, respectively. TPD of bridging bidentate nitrate and monodentate nitrate on Tb{sub 4}O{sub 7}, La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and BaO produced NO and O{sub 2} as major products and N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O as minor products, at 320--500 K.

The suspensions included a coal-washing effluent and a model system of TiO{sub 2} particles. A parametric study of TiO{sub 2} suspensions was performed to validate and analysis of the electrophoretic motion of the clarification front formed between a clear zone and the suspension. To measure the electric field strength needed in the prediction of the location of the front, a moveable probe and salt bridge were connected to a reference electrode. Using the measured electric field strengths, it was found that the numerical solution to the unit cell electrophoresis model agrees with the measured clarification rates. For suspensions with moderately thick electric double layers and high particle volume fractions the deviations from classical Smoluchowski theory are substantial, and the numerical analysis is in somewhat better agreement with the data than a prior solution of the problem. The numerical model reduces to the predictions of previous theories as the thickness of the electric double layer decreases, and it is in good agreement with the clarification rate measured for a coal-washing effluent suspension with thin electric double layers.","","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: 1 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1806-1812","","","FG22-95PC95209","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200032%%288","10.1021/es990969r","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080523","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","34"

The principal reason appears to be the decline in rail rates for low-sulfur western coal delivered to higher-sulfur coal-fired plants in the Midwest. Consequently, there is less sulfur to be removed to meet the Title IV cap on aggregate SO{sub 2} emissions, and the cost of compliance and price of allowances can be expected to be less than would otherwise have been the case.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-45","","","","Journal ID: JEEMDI; ISSN 0095-0696; TRN: IM9829%%23","10.1006/jeem.1998.1033","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","658991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/658991","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","1","36"

The authors document an increased incidence of axial malformations in bullfrog larvae (Rana catesbeiana) inhabiting two sites contaminated with coal combustion wastes. In the polluted sites, 18 and 37% of larvae exhibited lateral curvatures of the spine, whereas zero and 4% of larvae from two reference sites had similar malformations. Larvae from the most heavily polluted site had significantly higher tissue concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements, including As, Cd, Se, Cu, Cr, and V, compared with conspecifics from the reference sites. In addition, malformed larvae from the cost contaminated site had decreased swimming speeds compared with those of normal larvae from the same site. The authors hypothesize that the complex mixture of contaminants produced by coal combustion is responsible for the high incidence of malformations and associated effects on swimming performance.","","","Savannah River Ecology Lab., Aiken, SC (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 862-868","","","FC09-96SR18546","Journal ID: ISSN 0730-7268; ETOCDK; TRN: US0004019","10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0862:IAIOAM>2.3.CO;2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080474","","Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","4","19"

This paper is concerned with the design and execution of the experimental portion of the study, which represents the first reported investigation to obtain nearly full surface information on heat transfer coefficients within an environment that develops an appropriate pressure distribution about an airfoil blade tip and shroud model. A stationary blade cascade experiment has been run consisting of three airfoils, the center airfoil having a variable tip gap clearance. The airfoil models the aerodynamic tip section of a high-pressure turbine blade with inlet Mach number of 0.30, exit Mach number of 0.75, pressure ratio of 1.45, exit Reynolds number based on axial chord of 2.57 x 10{sup 6}, and total turning of about 110 degrees. A hue detection based liquid crystal method is used to obtain the detailed heat transfer coefficient distribution on the blade tip surface for flat, smooth tip surfaces with both sharp and rounded edges. The cascade inlet turbulence intensity level took on values of either 5 or 9%. The cascade also models the casing recess in the shroud surface ahead of the blade. Experimental results are shown for the pressure distribution measurements on the airfoil near the tip gap, on the blade tip surface, and on the opposite shroud surface. Tip surface heat transfer coefficient distributions are shown for sharp edge and rounded edge tip geometries at each of the inlet turbulence intensity levels.","","","General Electric Corp., Schenectady, NY (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-271","","","FC21-95MC31176","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%69","10.1115/1.555443","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086925","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086925","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

In this article, the flue gas desulfurization processes are briefly reviewed, and processes with highest use and with high potential for future use are compared from technical and economical points of view. In the selection of a desulfurization process, it is very important to consider the capacity of the plant, fuel type and fuel-to-sulfur ratio, availability and price of the reagent to be used, type, price, and market of side products, disposal problems of wastes, and environmental factors.","","","Istanbul Technical Univ., Maslak-Istanbul (TR)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 197-206","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200019%%341","10.1080/00908310050013983","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020916","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020916","","Energy Sources","3","22"

When such materials are land-applied to supply nutrients for agronomic crops, trace element contaminant solubility must be evaluated. In this study, major and trace element soil solution concentrations arising from application of fly ash, organic wastes, and mixtures of the two were compared in a laboratory incubation. Two fly ashes, broiler poultry litter (PL), municipal sewage sludge (SS), and mixtures of FA with either PL or SS were mixed with a Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludult) at rates of 32.3, 8.1, and 16.1 g kg{sup {minus}1} soil for FA, PL, and SS, respectively.

Initial soil solution concentrations of As, Mo, Se, and Cu were significantly greater in FA/OL treatments than the respective FA-only treatments. For Cu, increased solution concentrations were attributable to increased loading rates in FA/PL mixtures. Solution Cu concentrations were strongly correlated with dissolved C (R{sup 2} &gt; 0.96) in all PL treatments. Significant interactive effects for solution Mo and Se concentrations were observed for the FA/PL and may have resulted from the increased pH and competing anion concentrations of these treatments. Solution As concentrations showed a significant interactive effect for one FA/PL mixture. For the individual treatments, As was more soluble in the Pl treatment than either FA treatment.

Direct shear tests using Mikasa's apparatus, conventional permeability tests, and consolidation tests were conducted on two silt-size fly ashes, with low free lime contents, obtained from two different power plants. The results show that the immediate settling of both fly ashes takes place in a short period of time during consolidation and does not change with time. The rate of increase in shear strength with time is different depending on the pozzolanic reactions taking place for the two ashes. The permeability tests under constant stresses of 49 and 98 kPa for 12 days show that the coefficient of permeability for the tested ashes is between 10{sup {minus}6} and 10{sup {minus}7} m/s. During this period the coefficient of permeability either remains constant (for the case of the ash with a lower free lime content) or is slightly reduced (for the ash with a higher free lime content).

Coupons of three stainless steels (Types 304 [UNS S30400], 309 [UNS S30900], 347 [UNS S34700]) were exposed to the hot flue gases in the freeboard ({approximately} 10- cm below the location of the convection pass tubes). Deposits formed on the alloys contained high sulfur concentrations in their outer parts, as well as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Sulfur appeared to be associated with calcium and magnesium, suggesting that the fly ash may have reacted further after being deposited on the surface of the coupon. Areas of high sulfur concentration also correlated well with areas of high chromium content of the inner layers of the scales. cross sections of samples indicated that sulfur had penetrated into the alloy and reacted to form sulfide corrosion products. There was no direct evidence to show that alkali chlorides were involved in the corrosion process. No chloride was identified in the alloy samples. There was slight oxide spallation observed on all three alloys, with the degree of spallation in the following order: Type 304 &gt; Type 347 &gt; Type 309.","","","Western Kentucky Univ., Bowling Green, KY (US)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 298-306","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: IM200023%%129","10.5006/1.3287658","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20034201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20034201","","Corrosion (Houston)","3","56"

The puff model uses a second-order closure scheme, allowing for an accurate treatment of dispersion and the influence of turbulent concentration fluctuations on chemical rates. The model was tested using helicopter plume measurements from the 1995 Southern Oxidants Study (SOS) Nashville/Middle Tennessee Ozone Study. The model was applied for 6 days in June and July of 1995, and the model's ability to estimate physical and chemical plume characteristics, such as plume width and reactive species concentrations, was evaluated using the helicopter measurements. The best model results are for July 7, 1995, a case corresponding to a high NO{sub x} isolated power plant plume traveling over rural regions--model estimates of NO{sub x}, NO{sub y}, and O{sub 3} are highly correlated with measured values, and most of the measured plume centerline concentrations are reproduced to within 30%. For scenarios involving the interaction of the tracked plume with urban plumes or with other power plant plumes, model estimates of ozone concentrations are poorly correlated with observations, emphasizing the difficulty of characterizing such plumes from both measurement and modeling perspectives.","","","Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., San Ramon, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 870-880","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200020%%150","10.1021/es990611v","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20023215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20023215","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","34"

The authors further analyze the causes for the variations of emission coefficient for power consumption by deriving the relative influences of fuel mix, fuel intensity, and generation mix on emission coefficient and hence carbon intensity. The study explicitly accounts for fuel quality variations, generation, and transmission and distribution (T and D) losses and auxiliary consumption variations. Results show major increases in both emission intensity and emission coefficient during the 1980s. The authors find electricity intensity to be the major contributing factor behind the 40% emission intensity rise during this period. The emission coefficient increased by 13% during this period, the major contributing factor being generation mix effects, which increased by 27.6%, offsetting the effect of fuel quality, whose index declined by 10%.","","","Indira Gandhi Inst. of Development Research, Mumbai (IN)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb-Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 157-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200012%%508","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014580","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014580","","Energy Sources","2","22"

The degradation is mainly caused by both microstructural changes and thermal stress as a result of reaction layer formation at the interface between the TBC and bond coating. Therefore, it is critical to detect the formation and quantitatively evaluate the growth rate of the reaction layers. In this study, a novel in situ NDT method is developed for characterization of the reaction layer formation and its growth kinetics. Formation kinetics and physical properties of the reaction layer are evaluated by impedance spectroscopy (IS) technique. Specimens were aged over a long period of time, which provides large impedance. The impedance behavior of TBC and bond coating change significantly with the formation and the growth of the reaction layer. This allows us to nondestructively test the detrimental effects of the presence of the reaction layer for TBC integrity at high temperature.","","","Tohoku Univ., Sendai (JP)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Evaluation; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 476-481","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0025-5327; MAEVAD; TRN: IM200016%%131","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015648","","Materials Evaluation","3","58"

It was found that No molecules were absorbed on the fresh Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC catalyst and then oxidized by O{sub 2} to adsorbed NO{sub 2} and nitrate species. These NO{sub x} adspecies could be reduced by NH{sub 3} at high temperatures. NH{sub 3} molecules could also be adsorbed on the Broensted acid and Lewis acid sites on the Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC catalyst to generate, respectively, NH{sup +}{sub 4} ions and coordinated NH{sub 3} species. These NH{sub 3} adspecies were active in reacting with NO, NO + O{sub 2} and NO{sub 2}, but the reaction rates of NH{sub 3} + NO + O{sub 2} and NH{sub 3} + NO{sub 2} were much higher than that of NNO + NH{sub 3}. However, under reaction conditions, the surface of Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC was mainly covered by NH{sup +}{sub 4} ions and coordinated NH{sub 3}, and no NO{sub x} adspecies were detected. This is in agreement with the zero-order for the SCR reaction with respect to NH{sub 3}. A possible reaction scheme for the SCR reaction on Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC was proposed. NO reduction initially involved the reaction between NO{sub 2} and pairs of NH{sub 3} adspecies to form an active intermediate, which finally reacted with gaseous or weakly adsorbed NO to produce N{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O.","","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (US)","Electric Power Research Institute","","United States","2000-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200017%%173","10.1006/jcat.1999.2737","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017451","","Journal of Catalysis","1","190"

The damaging effects of erosion substantially shorten the lives of the pipelines and heat exchangers in the coal liquefaction-gasification utilities. In this study, the effects of turbulence intensity, temperature, particle sizes, and impinging velocity on erosion by particle impact are demonstrated numerically. Underlying turbulent flow on an Eulerian frame is described by the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a Renormalization Group Theory (RNG) {kappa}-{epsilon} turbulence model. The particle trajectories and particle-wall interactions are evaluated by a Lagrangian approach. An erosion model considering material weight removal from surfaces is used to predict erosive wear. Computational validation against measured data is performed on a one-phase and two-phase impinging jet.

Adsorbents prepared by thoroughly mixing sulfur and activated carbon in the furnace at the initial sulfur-to-carbon ratio (SCR) ranging from 4:1 to 1:2 showed similar adsorptive behavior in a fixed-bed system. Maintaining a stagnant inert atmosphere during the impregnation process improves sulfur deposition resulting in the enhanced dynamic capacity of the adsorbent when compared to other sulfur impregnated carbons. The fate of spent adsorbents was assessed using a toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP). Although mercury concentration in all leachates was below the TCLP limit, virgin activated carbon lost a significant fraction of the adsorbed elemental mercury during storage, while no loss was observed for sulfur-impregnated carbons. This finding suggests that virgin activated carbon may not be appropriate adsorbent for permanent sequestration of anthropogenic elemental mercury emissions.","","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 483-488","","","FG22-96PC96212","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200021%%70","10.1021/es9813008","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20026690","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20026690","","Environmental Science and Technology","3","34"

When cracks are found in these components, weld repair is often employed to ensure continued operation. The efficacy of the weld repairs in terms of extending the life of the aged components has, however, not been documented quantitatively. The Electric Power Research institute (EPRI) has recently undertaken a comprehensive study to evaluate weld repairs performed to aged piping. In connection with this study, results from other worldwide activities have been reviewed, leading to significant conclusions regarding weld repair. this review of results from several worldwide studies has confirmed that aged high-temperature piping can be successfully weld repaired to gain additional lives in excess of several decades. The key aspects of successful weld repair include excavation and removal of all prior creep cavitation damage, elimination of external bending stresses, and implementation of good welding practice. From merely a creep rupture point of view, postweld heat treatment (PWHT) has been concluded to be superfluous by several authors. Temperbead repairs appear to offer a promising alternative to PWHT repairs from a creep, tensile, and toughness standpoint. Choice of the repair process ultimately is dictated by many considerations such as toughness, notch sensitivity, residual stresses and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Several reports suggest that gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) repairs may outperform shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) repairs with or without PWHT.","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference, Boston, MA (US), 08/01/1999--08/05/1999; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 76-85","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-9930; JPVTAS; TRN: IM200022%%7","10.1115/1.556154","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030381","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","1","122"

Two mild extraction methods (42-d equilibration with ion-exchange resins; 2-d equilibration with pH 4.8 buffered nutrient solution) and analysis of nutrient data by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) were tested with 29 fly ash samples, four biosolids samples, and their mixtures. The resin method was useful for major nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) extraction from fly ashes and organic materials, particularly where mineralizable fractions of N and P under aerobic conditions are required. However, resins were inefficient in extracting P from high-Fe sewage sludges because organic waste samples caused premature failure of semipermeable membranes and fouling of resins. Extraction of fly ash with dilute buffered nutrient solution was more successful because micronutrient recovery was improved, major nutrients were correlated to the resin method, both addition and removal of nutrients were recorded. DRIS analysis was possible, and equilibration was rapid (2 d). The overall nutrient supply from these extremely variable fly ashes was: Cu = Fe {approx} B {approx} Mo &gt; Ca &gt; S &gt; Zn &gt;&gt; Mn &gt; N &gt; Mg &gt; P &gt; K (high micronutrient, low major nutrient supply).

Part 1 reports on discrete-passage diffusers, while Part 2 describes a test of a straight-channel diffuser designed for equivalent duty. Two builds of discrete-passage diffuser were tested, with 30 and 38 separate passages. Both the 30 and 38 passage diffusers investigated showed comparable range of unstalled operation and similar level of overall diffuser pressure recovery. The paper concentrates on the influence of inlet flow conditions on the pressure recovery and operating range of radial diffusers for centrifugal compressor stages. The flow conditions examined include diffuser inlet Mach number, flow angle, blockage, and axial flow nonuniformity. The investigation was carried out in a specially built test facility, designed to provide a controlled inlet flow field to the test diffusers. The facility can provide a wide range of diffuser inlet velocity profile distortion and skew with Mach numbers up to unity and flow angles of 63 to 75 deg from the radical direction. The consequences of different averaging methods for the inlet total pressure distributions, which are needed in the definition of diffuser pressure recovery coefficient for nonuniform diffuser inlet conditions, were also assessed. The overall diffuser pressure recovery coefficient, based on suitably averaged inlet total pressure, was found to correlate well with the momentum-averaged flow angle into the diffuser. It is shown that the generally accepted sensitivity of diffuser pressure recovery performance to inlet flow distortion and boundary layer blockage can be largely attributed to inappropriate quantification of the average dynamic pressure at diffuser inlet. Use of an inlet dynamic pressure based on availability or mass-averaging in combination with definition of inlet flow angle based on mass average of the radial and tangential velocity at diffuser inlet removes this sensitivity.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 43rd International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-9","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200019%%47","10.1115/1.555418","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020622","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020622","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"

The paper describes tests of a straight-channel type diffuser, sometimes called a wedge-vane diffuser, and compares the results with those from the discrete-passage diffusers described in Part 1. Effects of diffuser inlet Mach number, flow angle, blockage, and axial flow nonuniformity on diffuser pressure recovery and operating range are addressed. The straight-channel diffuser investigated has 30 vanes and was designed for the same aerodynamic duty as the discrete-passage diffuser described in Part 1. The ranges of the overall pressure recovery coefficients were 0.50--0.78 for the straight-channel diffuser and 0.50--0.70 for the discrete-passage diffuser, except when the diffuser was choked. In other words, the maximum pressure recovery of the straight-channel diffuser was found to be roughly 10% higher than that of the discrete-passage diffuser investigated. The two types of diffuser showed similar behavior regarding the dependence of pressure recovery on diffuser inlet flow angle and the insensitivity of the performance to inlet flow field axial distortion and Mach number. The operating range of the straight-channel diffuser, as for the discrete-passage diffusers, was limited by the onset of rotating stall at a fixed momentum-averaged flow angle into the diffuser, which was for the straight-channel diffuser, {alpha}{sub crit} = 70 {+-} 0.5 deg.

To study complex systems involving IRSOFC a mathematical model has been developed that simulates the fuel cell steady-state operation. The model, tested with a data available in literature, has been used for a complete IRSOFC parametric analysis taking into account the influence of cell operative pressure, cell and stream temperatures, fuel oxidant flow rates and composition, etc. The analysis of IRSOFC-GT combined cycles has been carried out by using the Thermo Economic Modular Program TEMP.The code has been modified to allow IRSOFC, external reformer and flue gas condenser performance to be taken into account.

This enables the blades to be maintained at nearly uniform temperature without detailed knowledge of the heat flux to the blades, and makes operation feasible at higher combustion temperatures using a wider range of materials than is possible in conventional gas turbines with air cooling. The new enabling technology for such cooling is the return-flow cascade, which extends to the rotating blades the heat flux capability and self-regulation usually associated with heat-pipe technology. In this paper the potential characteristics of gas turbines that use vaporization cooling are outlined briefly, but the principal emphasis is on the concept of the return-flow cascade. The concept is described and its characteristics are outlined. Experimental results are presented that confirm its conceptual validity and demonstrate its capability for blade cooling at heat fluxes representative of those required for high pressure ratio high temperature gas turbines.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%261","10.1115/1.483188","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015442","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015442","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Aluminide and platinum modified coating were deposited on GTD 111 material using an outward diffusion process. CoCrAlY coating was applied on GTD-111 by Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD). The oxidation behavior of these coatings is characterized by weight change measurements and by the variation of {beta} phase present in the coating. The platinum modified aluminide coating exhibited the highest resistance to oxide scale spallation (weight loss) during cyclic oxidation testing. Metallographic techniques were used to determine the amount of {beta} phase and the aluminum content in a coating as a function of cycles. Cyclic oxidation life of these coatings is discussed in terms of the residual {beta} and aluminum content present in the coating after exposure.

It is thought that the HVOF sprayed MCrAlY (M is Fe, Ni and/or Co) coatings can be applied to provide resistance against oxidation and corrosion to the hot parts of gas turbines. Also, it is well known that the thicker coating can be sprayed in comparison with any other thermal spraying systems due to improved residual stresses. However, thermal and mechanical properties of HVOF coatings have not been clarified. Especially, the characteristics of residual stress, that are the most important property from the view point of production technique, have not been made clear. In this paper, the mechanical properties of HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coatings were measured in both the case of as-sprayed and heat-treated coatings in comparison with a vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings. It was confirmed that the mechanical properties of HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coatings could be improved by a diffusion heat treatment to equate the vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings. Also, the residual stress characteristics were analyzed using a deflection measurement technique and a X-ray technique. The residual stress of HVOF coating was reduced by the shot-peening effect comparable to that of a plasma spray system in open air. This phenomena could be explained by the reason that the HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coating was built up by poorly melted particles.","","","Toshiba Corp., Kawasaki, Kanagawa (JP)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 43-49","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%270","10.1115/1.483173","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015451","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Development in combustion technology has, however, during recent years focused on decreasing emissions of particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides. In addition, combustion also includes a potential risk for emission of trace metals. Due to the fact that many trace elements have been identified as having a negative effect on human health and the natural environment, they have received special attention from a regulatory point of view. This paper describes a simple method for predicting the fate of eight trace elements (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) in combustion processes. Using the fuel composition and power plant operating conditions, the trace element concentrations in various ashes and the flue gas are determined. The method, which is based on a global equilibrium approach, describes the overall behavior of the eight trace elements successfully. Distribution/partitioning of the trace elements between the bottom ash, fly ash, and the flue gases is described and compared to measured data from a full-scale coal-fired power plant burning bituminous coal. The outcome from the prediction is actual concentrations of trace elements in main power plant streams.","","","Abo Akademi Univ., Turku (FI)","","","United States","1999-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4508-4513","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200008%%190","10.1021/es990243v","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006583","","Environmental Science and Technology","24","33"

In this paper, the authors present a new damage function model that synthesizes previous efforts and refines components that have been associated with variations in impact estimates. Their model focuses on end-use emissions and quantified the direct human health impacts of criteria air pollutants. To compare their model to previous efforts and to evaluate potential policy applications, the authors assess the impacts of an oil and natural gas-fueled cogeneration power plant in Boston, MA. Impacts under baseline assumptions are estimated to be $0.007/kWh of electricity, $0.23/klb of steam, and $0.004/ton-h of chilled water (representing 2--9% of the market value of outputs). Impacts are largely related to ozone (48%) and particulate matter (42%). Addition of upstream emissions and nonpublic health impacts increases externalities by as much as 50%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the importance of plant siting, meteorological conditions, epidemiological assumptions, and the monetary value placed on premature mortality as well as the potential influence of global warming. Comparative analyses demonstrate that their model provides reasonable impact estimates and would therefore be applicable in a broad range of policy settings.","","","Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA (US)","","","United States","1999-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4364-4372","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: US0000713","10.1021/es990634+","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006567","","Environmental Science and Technology","24","33"

The environmental impact and the elimination of pollution agents has become a prime necessity in waste digestion. Furthermore, plants in which the production of electrical power by means of burnt gases produced in the digestion process have been designed and built. In this field an MHD integration plant could be very attractive. This feasibility study has been developed by simulating an ideal plant with a plastic incinerator, an MHD device and conventional steam turbines.

To ensure operational reliability, it is essential to know whether or not water has permeated the insulation, and if so, to determine accurately the degree of deterioration. The authors have developed a capacitance measuring robot which enables measurement near the stator core end without removing the rotor, and confirmed good results in the field. The robot travelling along the retaining ring can be accurately positioned, and measured capacitances are stable and reproducible. The robot minimizes the extent of disassembly and reassembly, thus greatly reducing the out-of-operation period. Further, because the insulation condition can be accurately determined through its periodical use, the authors believe that it will contribute to both preventing accidents and assuring generators with high reliability.","","","Toshiba Corp., Yokohama (JP)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1366-1371","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9383; ITCNE4; TRN: IM200032%%139","10.1109/60.815074","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080374","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","4","14"

Major features that influence the utilization of each fly ash for zeolite synthesis are evidenced, and several fly ash types were selected as potential high-quality starting material for zeolite synthesis and ceramic applications. The main parameters influencing this selection were relatively small grain size; high Al and Si contents; high glass content; low CaO, S, and Fe contents; and relatively low heavy metal concentration. The Compostilla and Cou He fly ashes have high potential applications because of the low content of major impurities (such as Ca, Fe, and S) and the low content of soluble hazardous elements. The Espiel, Escucha, Los Barrios, As Pontes, Soto de Ribera, Meirama, Narcea, and Teruel fly ashes have important application potential, but this potential is slightly limited by the intermediate content of nonreactive impurities, such as Fe and Ca. The La Robla fly ash is of moderate interest, since the relatively high Ca and Fe oxide contents may reduce its potential applications. Finally, the Puertollano fly ash also has limited application because of the very high concentration of some heavy metals such as As, Cd, Ge, Hg, Pb, and Zn.

While the mass and optical properties of emissions are needed for these studies, the available measurements do not characterize the low-technology burning that is thought to contribute a large fraction of light-absorbing material to the global budget. The authors have measured characteristics of particulate matter (PM) emitted from a small, low-technology lignite-burning plant. The PM emission factor is comparable to those used to calculate emission inventories of light-absorbing particles. However, the fine fraction, the absorbing fraction, and the absorption efficiency of the emissions are substantially below assumptions that have been made in inventories of black carbon emissions and calculations of climate forcing. The measurements suggest that nonblack, light-absorbing particles are emitted from low-technology coal burning. As the burning rate increases, the emitted absorption cross-section decreases, and the wavelength dependence of absorption becomes closer to that of black particles.","","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (US)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 21; Other Information: PBD: 1 Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 3887-3891","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: US0000114","10.1021/es9810538","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000717","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000717","","Environmental Science and Technology","21","33"
"CO{sub 2} emission abatement in IGCC power plants by semiclosed cycles: Part A -- With oxygen-blown combustion","Chiesa, P; Lozza, G","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CARBON DIOXIDE; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITIES; COAL GASIFICATION; COMBINED-CYCLE POWER PLANTS; SYNGAS PROCESS","This paper analyzes the fundamentals of IGCC power plants where carbon dioxide produced by syngas combustion can be removed, liquefied and eventually disposed, to limit the environmental problems due to the greenhouse effect. To achieve this goal, a semiclosed-loop gas turbine cycle using an highly-enriched CO{sub 2} mixture as working fluid was adopted. As the oxidizer, the syngas combustion utilizes oxygen produced by an air separation unit. Combustion gases mainly consist of CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O: after expansion, heat recovery and water condensation, a part of the exhausts, highly concentrated in CO{sub 2}, can be easily extracted, compressed and liquefied for storage or disposal. A detailed discussion about the configuration and the thermodynamic performance of these plants is the aim of the paper. Proper attention was paid to: (i) the modelization of the gasification section and of its integration with the power cycle, (ii) the optimization of pressure ratio due the change of the cycle working fluid, (iii) the calculation of the power consumption of the auxiliary equipment, including the compression train of the separated CO{sub 2} and the air separation unit. The resulting overall efficiency is in the 38--39% range, with status-of-the-art gas turbine technology, but resorting to a substantially higher pressure ratio. The extent of modifications to the gas turbine engine, with respect to commercial units, was therefore discussed. Relevant modifications are needed, but not involving changes in the technology. A second plant scheme will be considered in the second part of the paper, using air for syngas combustion and a physical absorption process to separate CO{sub 2} from nitrogen-rich exhausts. A comparison between the two options will be addressed there.","","","Politecnico di Milano, Milan (IT)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 635-641","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%158","10.1115/1.2818519","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","20006102","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006102","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

The idea behind this proposal is to overcome the major drawbacks of the previous solution (large oxygen consumption and re-design of the gas turbine unit), by means of a semiclosed cycle using air as the oxidizer. Consequently, combustion gases are largely diluted by nitrogen and cannot be simply compressed to produce liquefied CO{sub 2} for storage or disposal. However, CO{sub 2} concentration remains high enough to make separation possible by a physical absorption process. It requires a re-pressurization of the flow subtracted from the cycle, with relevant consequences on the plant energy balance. The configuration and the thermodynamic performance of this plant concept are extensively addressed in the paper. As in the first part, the influence of the pressure ratio is discussed, but values similar to the ones adopted in commercial heavy-duty machines provide here acceptable performance. Proper attention was paid to the impact of the absorption process on the energy consumption. The resulting net overall efficiency is again in the 38--39% range, with assumptions fully comparable to the ones of Part A. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the present scheme enables the use of unmodified machines, but large additional equipment is required for exhausts treatment and CO{sub 2} separation. A final comparison between the two semiclosed cycle concepts is therefore addressed.","","","Politecnico di Milano, Milan (IT)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 642-648","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%159","10.1115/1.2818520","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","20006103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006103","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

Strain accommodation of the TBC is not attained by plastic deformation, but by means of crack initiation, crack opening, crack propagation or sliding of adjacent crack faces. In technical applications a distinction is made between tolerated or desired cracks perpendicular to the surface, and detrimental cracks parallel to the substrate-coating interface. Thus, TBC can respond to creep deformation by segmentation or spallation, the latter being referred to as failure. The parameters influencing the probability of either segmentation or spallation are temperature, creep rate, magnitude of creep deformation, layer thickness, and microstructure of the TBC. It can be stated that spallation failure probability increases with increasing creep rate, creep deformation, and layer thickness. The presence of pores between single spraying layers also strongly augments the likelihood of spallation. No significant influence of temperature on spallation failure probability can be found in the range from 850 C to 1,050 C. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy investigation show that the microstructure of the ceramic TBC changes during creep, and that the density of cracks detected on micrographs with low magnification (x50) increases with increasing creep deformation. On the other hand, the density of microcracks visible with high magnification (x500) is constant, or even decreases with increasing creep deformation. These findings are explained by sintering processes enabled by stress relaxation due to formation of macroscopic cracks perpendicular to the surface as a response to creep deformation. A relationship between microstructural changes and the emission of signals recorded during creep is presented.","","","Univ. of Karlsruhe (DE)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 678-682","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%163","10.1115/1.2818525","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","20006107","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006107","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

Prolonged periods of use at high temperatures may cause creep deformation and the assessment of damage can give large financial savings. A number of techniques can be applied for life assessment, e.g., calculations based on operational data, nondestructive testing for material interrogation, but because of the uncertainties involved the techniques are often used in combination. This paper describes a material interrogation (metallographic) technique for creep strain assessment in SX alloys. Creep tests have been performed at 950 C on the SX alloy CMSX-4 and quantitative microstructural studies performed on specimens interrupted at various levels of strain. It was found that the strengthening {gamma}{prime}-particles, initially cuboidal in shape, coalesced to form large plates or rafts normal to the applied stress. The rafts reached their maximum length before 2% strain, but continued to thicken with increasing strain. Although of different dimensions, the aspect ratios (length/thickness ratio) of the gamma-prime rafts and gamma plates were similar at similar levels of strain, increasing from {approximately} 1 at zero strain to a maximum of {approximately} 3 at about 1--2% strain. Analysis of microstructural measurements from rafting studies on SX alloys presented in the literature showed that the aspect ratios of the {gamma} and {gamma}{prime}-phases were similar and that at a temperature of 950--1,000 C a maximum length/thickness ratio of about 2.5--3.5 is reached at 1 to 2% creep strain. Measurement of gamma-prime raft or (or gamma plate) dimensions on longitudinal sections of blades is thus a suitable method for high temperature creep damage assessment of SX alloys.","","","Vattenfall Energisystem AB, Stockholm (SE)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 683-686","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%164","10.1115/1.2818526","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","20006108","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006108","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

For effective rehabilitation of ash ponds, densification of the slurry deposit is essential to increase the bearing capacity and to improve its resistance to liquefaction. Extensive field trials were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of deep blasting for densification of deposited fly ash. Ninety explosions comprising 15 single blasts, with varying depths and quantities of charges, and 3 group blasts, each having 25 charges placed at various spacings, were carried out. The compaction achieved in terms of an increase in relative density was evaluated from surface settlement measurements. Extensive field monitoring was undertaken through pore-water pressure measurements, vibration measurements, penetration tests, and block vibration tests. For the average charge of 2--4 g of explosive per cubic meter of untreated deposit, the average relative density was found to improve from 50% to 56--58%. Analysis of the test results indicates that deep blasting may be an effective technique for modest compaction of loose fly ash deposits. The field testing program presented in this paper provides valuable information that can be used for planning blast densification of fly ash deposits.","","","","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 889-899","","","","Journal ID: JGGEFK; ISSN 1090-0241; TRN: IM9946%%516","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1999)125:10(889)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","697130","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/697130","","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","10","125"

This article is concerned with the transient behavior and thermal performance of a porous matrix combustor-heater in which combustion and heat transfer among the different phases (i.e., the solid matrix, the gas flowing in the packed bed, and the coolant flowing through the tubes) are considered. The governing equations for describing combustion and heat transfer processes are nonlinear and coupled. Under the assumption that axial flow of the gas is predominant, these equations are numerically solved for a typical cell in order to obtain the transient three-dimensional distributions of temperatures and of the fuel mass fraction. The numerical algorithm developed provides the tools for analyzing the effects of operating and geometrical parameters on the performance of a porous matrix combustor-heater and for optimizing design and operation of the unit.

A study of the design, fabrication and operational characteristics of a Hoop Energy Storage System (HESS) has been done. For the magnetic levitation of Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet, the magnetic force calculation and dynamic analysis of the rotational stability were included in the design and operation of HESS. 2564 Nd-Fe-B magnets which has the dimension of 2in. x 2in. x lin. were assembled for the levitation of a 3.7 ton-carbon fiber composite hoop. A computer simulation of rotation under magnetic force and torque due to both the vertical stabilization magnetic set and the radial stabilization magnet set showed that the rotation of the hoop's spin axis induced by the torque of the levitated rotor magnets reduces the additional active control. The fabrication of a 6m-diameter carbon fiber composite hoop was completed and the ANSYS code was used to study its stress analysis. The study showed that the strength of the hoop material is high enough for the 600MJ-energy storage. A performance test of the HESS at a low speed rotation is reported.","","","Seoul National Univ.

Entry of nonutilities into the industry and the emergence of stranded costs are two major changes that are shown to have an impact on the market for allowances and the industry`s incentives to switch to cleaner fuels. The degree of impact depends on the extent to which consumers bypass traditional utilities and buy from entrants, and on public utility commission policies regarding the recovery of stranded costs. In turn, the amount of stranded costs depends on fuel switching. The results follow from simulations of a two-utility model that illustrate the qualitative effects of changing policies.","","","","","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 195-214","","","","Journal ID: JEEMDI; ISSN 0095-0696; TRN: 99:010350","10.1006/jeem.1999.1087","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687375","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","2","38"

AAC is unique among construction materials in combining excellent thermal resistance and thermal inertia. Generally, low-density construction materials do not provide good thermal inertia, while heavier ones commonly have poor thermal resistance. Five different 10.2 cm (4 in.) AAC samples made from US electric utility fly ash as the silica source, along with three 10.2 cm (4 in.) conventional building material specimens, were tested for thermal inertia properties. Three primary issues addressed by these experiments were: (1) to develop and compare AAC thermal inertia to conventional building materials; (2) to document differences in thermal inertia characteristics of the AAC blocks produced by the various utilities; and (3) to determine if a periodic heat flow model using the thermal inertia approach adequately predicts the observed thermal inertia parameters of a material. A theoretical periodic heat flow model in the literature for thermal inertia did an adequate job of predicting the observed thermal inertia parameters for the AAC and conventional construction samples.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 59-75","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9941%%155","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1999)125:2(59)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","680114","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/680114","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","125"

The methodology is applied to the two largest sources of energy-related carbon dioxide: electricity generation and motor vehicles. Carbon-free road transportation is hypothesized to substitute for petroleum-fueled vehicles and carbon-free electric power generation for fossil-fueled electricity based on empirical analogs for substitution dynamics parameters, beginning in the year 2000. The examples imply that near-term significant reductions to 1990 carbon emissions levels via technology substitution are unlikely.

Results from these investigations indicated a high combustor exit Mach number, similar to that used in a gas turbine engine, was required to correctly simulate the combustor dynamics and evaluate acoustic characteristics of lean premixed fuel injectors. Comparisons made between aerodynamically stabilized and bluff-body stabilized nozzles and the use of premixed and diffusion pilots showed that small levels of diffusion piloting behind a bluff-body yielded the best acoustic/emission performance. Their success is due to increased flame stabilization (superior anchoring ability), which reduced flame motion and thermal/acoustic coupling. For cases where diffusion piloting was not present, both designs exhibited similar dynamical behavior. Increases in the combustor exit Mach number and reductions in the inlet air temperature were shown to degrade acoustic performance of both nozzle designs. The bluff-body configuration with small levels of diffusion piloting, however, was found to be less sensitive to these changes when compared to its aerodynamic counterpart.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) turbo expo `98 - land, sea, air, Stockholm (Sweden), 2-5 Jun 1998; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 429-436","","CONF-980615-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9939%%99","10.1115/1.2818491","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","678043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/678043","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","121"

Elemental mercury, dimethyl mercury, and mercuric chloride were loaded onto a gold trap (one Hg species per test) at temperatures of 25--375 C. The Hg was then evolved (in argon) at 900 C. In other tests, Hg was loaded onto the trap at 25 C and then heated (in argon) at 50--1,000 C to release Hg. The argon streams were analyzed using cold vapor atomic fluorescence to obtain information on Hg collection and evolution as a function of temperature. The Hg was released from the gold entirely as elemental mercury, regardless of the Hg species collected. Temperatures of about 250 C were required to release the Hg, and there were no differences among Hg species with respect to the temperatures necessary to evolve the Hg. Results of the tests on Hg collection efficiency versus the temperature of the gold trap indicated that proper selection of the collection temperature could potentially be used to provide Hg speciation information. However, refinements in the technique are necessary before it can be put into practical use.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 13; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2278-2283","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: IM9939%%124","10.1021/es981030t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","678068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/678068","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","33"

The ceramic liner is made up of the layer of outer metal wall, ceramic fiber, and inner ceramic tiles. Fuel flow rates for the catalysts and the premixing nozzles are controlled independently. Catalytic combustion temperature is controlled under 1000 C, premixed gas is injected from the premixing nozzles to the catalytic combustion gas and lean premixed combustion over 1300 C is carried out in the ceramic liner. This system was designed to avoid catalytic deactivation at high temperature and thermal and mechanical shock fracture of the honeycomb monolith of catalyst. A combustor for a 10 MW class, multican type gas turbine was tested under high pressure conditions using LNG fuel. Measurements of emission, temperature, etc. were made to evaluate combustor performance under various combustion temperatures and pressures.

Fabric acceleration and pulse pressure were used as an index of bag-cleaning intensity. The jet pump curves, which relate the flow rate through the venturi to the average developed pressure by the venturi, were determined by the similar system. The intersection of the jet pump curve and the bag operating line, which relates the pressure drop to flow rate across the bag during pulse-jet cleaning, is the system operating point that was used to predict the average pulse pressure can be achieved without the venturi at the top of the bag for bag materials with low resistance coefficient. For bags with higher resistance coefficients, higher pulse pressure is obtained with a venturi installed at the top of the bag. The predicted pressure values are in good agreement with experimental data. Dimensional analysis for jet pump performance was developed to reduce the experimental data. The results show that the jet pump curves obtained under different operating conditions can be reduced to the same nondimensional curve, which can be used to facilitate the design and operation of a pulse-jet cleaning system.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 583-588","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: IM9930%%53","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1999)125:6(583)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354312","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","6","125"

In this study, the separate addition of lime, Portland cement and cement kiln dust to a Class F and a Class C fly ash has been investigated as a possible remediation treatment to remove undesirable elements from the leachates. Leach tests without additives at several water/solid ratios revealed levels of B, Cr, Mo and SO{sub 4} above drinking water standards. A marked reduction in all these elements occurred at 3:1, 6:1 and 20:1 water/solid ratios with a 20 mass% addition of lime or cement. Reductions were more pronounced for the Class F than for the Class C fly ash. The mineralogical and chemical composition of fly ash influences its behavior with respect to the additive treatment. In this study, an anionic clay (hydrocalumite) is formed in considerable quantity in the Class F fly ash treated with lime; and can accommodate anions like borate, chromate and molybdate into its interlayer region. With Class C fly ash, the lime-treatment generates hydrogarnet, which has less sites for anion substitution; and ettringite, which has less preference for chromate and molybdate than hydrocalumite. The overall order of improvement in fly ash leachate water quality with additive treatment was lime > OPC > CKD.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 221-231","","","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9921%%8","10.1016/S0956-053X(99)00052-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","343545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343545","","Waste Management","3","19"

The used oil-fuel ash (OFA) had a high percentage of magnesium compounds because of magnesium oxide addition for removing slag and ashes from boilers and pipes. Several studies had been carried out on stabilization of toxic metals also occurring in oil-fuel ashes (particularly vanadium and nickel), by mixing with coal fly ashes and cement. In this case, the presence of magnesium compounds in the composition of the studied oil-fuel ashes could alter the mechanical and chemical properties of the cement matrix in fresh and hardened mortar and concrete. The authors present here the chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization of oil-fuel ashes and the behavior of Portland cement mortars incorporating high amounts of these oil-fuel ashes. The study includes workability, water demand, setting time, expansion and compressive strength developments. Preliminary results demonstrate a high absorption of water by oil-fuel ash particles, which promotes an increase in the water/cement ratio for a given workability. Acceleration of Portland cement/oil-fuel ash particles, which promotes an increase in the water/cement ratio for a given workability. Acceleration of Portland cement/oil-fuel ash pastes setting times was observed, due to the presence of carbonates. On the other hand, no significant expansion in specimens due to the presence of magnesium compounds was detected and, consequently, mechanical properties of hardened mortars containing oil-fuel ashes did not decrease with curing time. Compressive strengths for mortars containing OFA were much lower, however, than control mortar samples.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-7","","","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9921%%16","10.1016/S0956-053X(98)00079-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","343553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343553","","Waste Management","1","19"

Density functional theory and ab initio calculations were carried out to investigate the pyrolysis mechanisms of pyrrole. All equilibrium and transition state structures of the proposed reaction channels were fully optimized by the density functional B3LYP method using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Relative energies were evaluated at the QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. In addition to the mechanism proposed in experimental studies, alternative unimolecular pathways for the formation of cis-crotonitrile and allyl cyanide, major nitrogen-containing isomerization products, were proposed and investigated. The results suggest that a mechanism proposed in the present study is more likely responsible for the formation of allyl cyanide. For the formation of cis-crotonitrile, a mechanism proposed in the present study should also be competitive, especially under low-pressure conditions. Although extensive calculations were carried out, the authors failed to identify a unimolecular decomposition pathway generating HCN, another major nitrogen-containing pyrolysis product, with an activation barrier close to the experimental value.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: 20 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3917-3922","","","","Journal ID: JPCAFH; ISSN 1089-5639; TRN: IM9927%%114","10.1021/jp9841790","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","351589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351589","","Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory","20","103"

The kinetics of pyrolysis of pyrrole have been investigated theoretically by ab initio quantum chemical techniques and by detailed chemical kinetic modeling of previously reported experimental results. The overall kinetics can be successfully modeled by a 117 step kinetic model that gives good agreement with temperature profiles of major products and also provides an acceptable fit for minor products. The thermochemistry and rate parameters of a number of key reactions have been obtained by ab initio calculations carried out at CASSCF, CASPT2, and G2(MP2) levels of theory. Several reaction pathways were investigated. The major product, HCN, arises principally from a hydrogen migration in pyrrole to form a cyclic carbene with the NH bond intact. Ring scission of this carbene leads to an allenic imine precursor of HCN and propyne. This is the decomposition pathway of lowest energy. Pyrolysis is preceded by the facile tautomerization of pyrrole to 2H-pyrrolenine. The latter can undergo CN fission to form an open chain biradical species, which is the precursor of the butenenitrile isomeric products, cis- and trans-crotononitrile and allyl cyanide. The biradical can also undergo facile H-fission to form cyanoallyl radical, which is an important precursor of acetylene, acetonitrile, and acrylonitrile, H{sub 2} also arises principally from H-fission of the biradical.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: 20 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3923-3934","","","","Journal ID: JPCAFH; ISSN 1089-5639; TRN: IM9927%%115","10.1021/jp984358h","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","351590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351590","","Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory","20","103"

The effects of biomass and lignite coal usage on the environment were reported comparatively. Considering total cereal products and fatty seed plants, approximately 50--65 million tons per year of biomass and 11,051 million tons of solid matter animal waste are produced, and 60% of biomass is seen as possible to use for energy. The primary energy of applicable biomass was evaluated as 467--623 Peta Joule (PJ) and the energy of animal residues as 50,172 PJ.

The partially zeolitized fly ashes were dried overnight in air at room temperature and then characterized using X-ray diffraction and SEM. On occasion, a few samples were dried to constant weight for an additional 8--10 min in a microwave oven to remove bound water as well. The dried samples were evaluated for their ability to adsorb sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) from a simulated stack gas containing {approximately}1000 ppm SO{sub 2}. Determinations were made in real time using a UV/vis spectrophotometer followed by a total sulfur analysis of the loaded samples once testing was complete. Breakthrough curves indicate that the zeolites in the samples are able to remove all of the SO{sub 2} in the simulated flue gas (zero SO{sub 2} emission) for varying periods of time, and that the actual amount of SO{sub 2} removed by the zeolite depended on the type and degree of dryness of the zeolite or zeolite-like material present. For example, a 7 day 150 C cured sample containing analcime and dodalite was able to adsorb 6--7 mg of SO{sub 2} per gram of sample regardless of the source of the fly ash, whereas a 90 C cured sample containing X, Y, and Na-P1 was significantly less efficient.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: 1 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1464-1469","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: IM9930%%91","10.1021/es9802091","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354350","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","33"

The efficient functioning of an ESP normally means minimizing power consumption and maximizing dust collection. Several control strategies can be adopted to meet this broad requirement. In this paper, a distributed control technique of an ESP, which uses the actual dust emission and boiler load as feedback inputs has been explained. The Electrostatic Precipitator Management System, which is a system designed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., Hyderabad, India, to meet the above control strategies using the distributed architecture to achieve efficient ESP operation is also described.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1995 IEEE/IAS international conference on industrial automation and control, January 5--7, Hyderabad (IN); PBD: May-Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 561-568","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9930%%20","10.1109/28.767002","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354279","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","3","35"

Based on the test results, the absorption and binding mechanism of fly ash on Ca{sup 2+}, Na{sup +}, OH{sup {minus}}, Cl{sup {minus}}, and Cr{sup 3+} ions were studied. The study showed that particle distribution of fly ash depends on the type of coal and its combustion conditions. The fly ashes investigated in the present investigation are formed of amorphous or glassy structures. Fly ashes also have large specific surface and special texture, and have fairly good absorption and binding capability on Ca{sup 2+}, Na{sup +}, OH{sup {minus}}, Cl{sup {minus}}, and Cr{sup 3+} ions.

EC is believed to be a coupled phenomenon including chemical corrosion and mechanical erosion, which is dominated by piping layout, fitting geometry, and local flow structure. A new approach was proposed for investigation of EC phenomenon using local flow models, including the multidimensional, two-fluid model to simulate flow characteristics within piping and EC models to predict two-dimensional distributions of EC locations. Impacts of gravitational and centrifugal forces on two-phase flow behaviors were captured reasonably well by the current three-dimensional, two-fluid models. EC locations predicted by the proposed models showed satisfactory agreement with distributions of wear sites measured in practice. Results showed the models explained the EC phenomenon reasonably well.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 332-342","","","","Journal ID: CORRAK; ISSN 0010-9312; TRN: IM9925%%36","10.5006/1.3283995","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","349885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/349885","","Corrosion","4","55"

Small macro- and mesopore volumes were the structural properties of the sorbent related to the conversion values, with a maximum in conversion and porosity for the sorbent at a slurring time of 15 h despite the continuous increase in the specific surface area (microporosity). These results confirm that the pore size distribution and volume are the main variables which can be related to the maximum utilization of the sorbent at low temperatures. The increase in the specific surface area of the sulfated sorbents at high relative humidity (80%), due to the microporosity increase, may be explained by taking into account that the partial condensation of water can happen in the pore structure and a gas-liquid-solid reaction, with a fast nucleation step, would produce the observed microporosity increase.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1384-1390","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9922%%277","10.1021/ie980016m","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","345344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345344","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","38"

The concept pursued in this paper is the generation of syngas low in carbon, where most of the heating value of the coal fuel is carried by hydrogen. Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO in the syngas into CO{sub 2}, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage. Energy balances, performance, and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall ICGG power output between 350 and 400 MW. In one plant, the raw syngas exiting the gasifier is cooled in a high-temperature, radiative cooler; in the other it is quenched by the injection of liquid water. With respect to conventional Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO{sub 2} emissions by 90% reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 40%. These penalties can be reduced by accepting lower reductions of CO{sub 2} emissions. Compared to the semi-closed cycle considered by other authors, where CO{sub 2} is the main component of the gas turbine working fluid, the plants analyzed here exhibit higher efficiency over the whole range of specific CO{sub 2} emissions.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) turbo expo `98 - land, sea, air, Stockholm (Sweden), 2-5 Jun 1998; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 295-305","","CONF-980615-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9927%%158","10.1115/1.2817120","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","351633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351633","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","121"

Until now such detection has been difficult and uncertain. The technique combines collection of particles, measurement of magnetization and coercive field, and microscopy. The analysis depends on the fact that ash from iron sulfide in fossil fuels is in the form of spherical magnetite. These particles have a relatively high coercive field H{sub c}, near 135 Oe, compared with airborne particulates from soil erosion which have an H{sub c} of {approximately}35 Oe. The coercive field of any sample therefore gives an indication for the percentage of fly ash relative to the total amount of magnetic material that is airborne. The concentration of ash from a large, isolated coal burning power station is found to fall off with the distance from the source, approximately as D{sup {minus}1}.

These by-products could be beneficial to acidic soils because of their alkalinity and the ability of gypsum (CaSO{sub 4}{center{underscore}dot}2H{sub 2}O) to reduce Al toxicity in acidic subsoils. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted to determine the liming efficacy of a fluidized bed combustion boiler by-product (FBC) that contained 129 g Mg kg{sup {minus}1} as CaMg(CO{sub 3}){sub 2} and MgO and its effects on surface and subsurface soil chemistry. The FBC was mixed in the surface 10 cm of two acidic soils (Wooster silt loam, an Oxyaquic Fragiudalf, and Coshocton silt loam, an Aquultic Hapludalf) at rates of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 times each soil's lime requirement (LR). Soils were sampled in 10-cm increments to depths ranging from 20 to 110 cm, and corn (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were grown. Application of Mg-FBC increased alfalfa yields in all six site-years, whereas it had no effect on corn grain yield in five site-years and decreased grain yield in one site-year. Plant tissue concentrations of Mg, S, and Mo were increased by Mg-FBC, while most trace elements were either unaffected or decreased. Application of Mg-FBC at one or two times LR increased surface soil pH to near 7 within 1 wk. Although surface soil pH remained near 7 for 2 yr, there was minimal effect on subjacent soil pH. Application of Mg-FBC increased surface soil concentrations of Ca, Mg, and S, which promoted downward movement of Mg and SO{sub 4}. This had different effects on subsoil chemistry in the two soils: in the high-Ca-status Wooster subsoil, exchangeable Ca was decreased and exchangeable Al was increased, whereas in the high-Al-status Coshocton subsoil, exchangeable Al was decreased and exchangeable Mg was increased. The Mg-FBC was an effective liming material and, because of the presence of both Mg and SO{sub 4}, may be more effective than gypsum in ameliorating subsoil Al phytotoxicity.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (US)","Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; USGS; USDOE","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Agronomy Journal; Journal Volume: 91; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24-32","","","FC21-91MC28060","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-1962; AGJOAT; TRN: IM200008%%301","10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100010005x","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","20006694","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006694","","Agronomy Journal","1","91"

This process is automatic, producing profile designs significantly faster and with significantly lower loss than has previously been possible. The optimizer developed uses a genetic algorithm to optimize a two-dimensional profile, defined using 17 parameters, for minimum loss with a given flow condition. The optimizer works with a population of two-dimensional profiles with varied parameters. A CFD mesh is generated for each profile, and the result is analyzed using a two-dimensional blade-to-blade solver, written for steady viscous compressible flow, to determine profile loss. The loss is used as the measure of a profile`s fitness. The optimizer uses this information to select the members of the next population, applying crossovers, mutations, and elitism in the process. Using this method, the optimizer tends toward the best values for the parameters defining the profile with minimum loss.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-17","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9915%%1","10.1115/1.2841220","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","330485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330485","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","121"

One approach for mercury removal, which may be relatively simple to retrofit is the injection of sorbents, such as activated carbon, upstream of existing particulate control devices. A study, sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Energy (DOE), is being conducted at the University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) to develop a sorbent-screening test protocol, screen potential mercury sorbents in a bench-scale fixed-bed system, and provide data to support efforts to model mercury capture mechanisms. A proper protocol is required to establish repeatability of the results and ensure reproducibility of results between different labs. To date, elemental mercury tests have been completed with several sorbents and under various flue gas conditions. The carbon-based sorbent used in this study was a lignite-based activated carbon (LAC). This paper presents results from the more recent tests with the LAC sorbent and elemental mercury. The LAC sorbent has also been used by others as a baseline sorbent.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Fal 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 203-208","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: IM9904%%72","10.1002/ep.670170321","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","302284","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302284","","Environmental Progress","3","17"

A study of the influence of co-firing of dry municipal sewage sludge on the behavior of the metals Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, zn during pulverized coal combustion is presented. Sewage sludge contains higher concentrations of the metals listed above than the reference coal, but a lower concentration of Cl, that enhances the volatility of many metals. Experiments were performed in a semi-industrial scale pulverized fuel combustion chamber. Ash was collected at four locations: bottom hopper, air preheater, cyclone, and bag filter. From the bottom hopper to the filter, the particle size decreased and ash particles were progressively enriched in volatile elements. Mass balances of the metals were performed and the enrichment trends on the ash collected at the different locations were calculated. Increasing the sewage sludge share in the blend caused a significant increase in the recovery rate in the solid phase. In spite of that, the calculated concentrations in the flue gas of Hg and zn increased. Sewage sludge co-firing influences the combustion process and the post-combustion environment in many ways. This study focuses on the effect of the different flue gas composition on the condensation temperature of metal species. The system was modeled by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. The results indicated that the increasing recovery of Zn might be caused by enhanced condensation and the increasing recovery of Hg by adsorption on ash particles. The increasing recovery of the other metals seemed referable to failure in vaporization and it cannot be studied with an equilibrium approach.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 6-8; Conference: International conference on incineration and thermal treatment technologies, Salt Lake City, UT (United States), 11-15 May 1998; Other Information: PBD: 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 433-444","","CONF-980513-","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9923%%169","10.1016/S0956-053X(98)00127-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","347632","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/347632","","Waste Management","6-8","18"

Monolayer etch pits, multilayer (deep) etch pits, and nascent etch pits were observed for the graphite-NO reaction in different reaction temperature regimes. The formation of deep pits and nascent pits became prevalent at higher temperatures, e.g., 850 C with 1% NO. No temperature break point in the Arrhenius plot of the turnover frequency (TOF) rates was observed. The activation energy for the graphite-NO reaction was 132 kJ/mol, which was relatively low compared to literature data. Careful analysis of basal plane STM features revealed that the often-reported (by others) temperature break point in the Arrhenius plot was caused by the contribution of NO basal plane c-attack in the higher temperature range, which forms nascent etch pits and deep pits. The formation of nascent and deep pits with higher activation energies (than that for monolayer etching) contributed to the higher apparent activation energy in the high temperature range. In global rate measurements for the NO-carbon reaction, it is not possible to distinguish between the monolayer etching process and basal plane c-attack. The TOF measured by the STM method were true intrinsic rates for edge site monolayer recession. For the NO-graphite reaction, the reaction is first order with respect to NO. The NO-graphite reaction is at least 15 times faster than the O{sub 2}-graphite reaction. The NO-graphite and N{sub 2}O-graphite reactions might have the same rate-limiting step in the low temperature range, but have different rate-limiting steps in the high temperature range.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 180; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 245-257","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9908%%394","10.1006/jcat.1998.2268","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316313","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316313","","Journal of Catalysis","2","180"

While the focus is particularly on coal generation technologies funded through the five phases of the Clean Coal Technology Program sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE), the article also sheds some light on the industry debate regarding the role that coal will play in a deregulated future. Environmentalists have argued that deregulation will lead to greater utilization of older (read cheaper) coal plants, particularly in Midwestern states. Meanwhile, many believe that natural gas-fired combustion turbines will displace coal facilities. Lurking in the background to further complicate matters are emission standards pertaining to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, together with the possibility of new regulations addressing global climate change concerns.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 51-58","","","","Journal ID: ELEJE4; ISSN 1040-6190; TRN: IM9910%%48","10.1016/S1040-6190(98)00106-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","320858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/320858","","Electricity Journal","10","11"

They have widespread applications which include industrial and chemical plants, fossil and nuclear power systems, heating and cooling systems, and vehicle exhaust systems. A bellows is a component in piping systems which absorbs mechanical deformation with flexibility. Its geometry is an axially symmetric shell which consists of two toroidal shells and one annular plate or conical shell. In order to analyze the bellows, this study presents the finite element analysis using a conical frustum shell element. A finite element analysis program is developed to analyze various bellows. The formula for calculating the natural frequency of bellows is made by the simple beam theory. The formula for fatigue life is also derived by experiments. A shape optimal design problem is formulated using multiple objective optimization. The multiple objective functions are transformed to a scalar function with weighting factors. The stiffness, strength, and specified stiffness are considered as the multiple objective function. The formulation has inequality constraints imposed on the natural frequencies, the fatigue limit, and the manufacturing conditions. Geometric parameters of bellows are the design variables. The recursive quadratic programming algorithm is utilized to solve the problem.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 325-333","","","","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: 99:002608","10.1115/1.2842339","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","302330","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302330","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","4","120"

All the experiments have been carried out in a perfectly stirred reactor, operated isothermally in the temperature range 1,050--1,250 K, with stoichiometric ratios ranging between 1.0 and 1.3. It has been found that, close to the higher temperature values investigated, the NO conversion as a function of the stoichiometric ratio shows a maximum around 1.15--1.20, both in the case of pure methane and methane-ethane mixtures in the feed. Moreover, the addition of NO significantly enhances the system reactivity at the lower temperatures investigated. The ethane content in the feed plays a different role depending upon the temperature value considered. At the lowest temperatures investigated the larger the amount of ethane, the higher the NO abatement, while at the higher temperatures the methane-ethane mixtures always show a larger NO conversion than that of pure methane. However, when increasing the ethane content in the feed, the NO conversion decreases. Finally, various detailed kinetic models (with particular reference to that developed by Miller and Bowman) have been discussed and used to interpret the experimental results.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4241-4252","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9901%%97","10.1021/ie970474f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289422","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","37"

However, many systems can consume more electrical energy than a conventional cooling plant without ice storage. This excess energy problem is illustrated in this paper by a simplified cooling plant model employed in a simulation environment that allows the assessment of the control performance of various conventional and optimal strategies. The optimal control strategy of minimizing operating cost only is introduced and subsequently is modified to allow the simultaneous consideration of operating cost and energy consumption. This proposed optimal control strategy could be valuable if ice storage systems are to stand on their own merits in a deregulated utility environment. Due to the lack of demand charges under real-time pricing, even small energy penalties and their associated excess energy cost may jeopardize the feasibility of the ice storage system.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 275-281","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9908%%206","10.1115/1.2888131","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","316126","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316126","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","120"

The physicochemical properties of the deactivated catalysts by SO{sub 2} were extensively characterized by TGA, TPSR, XPS, Raman, XANES, the measurements of surface area and elemental analysis. Not only the surface area and sulfur content of the deactivated catalysts, but their TGA and TPSR patterns strongly suggest the formation of a sulfur species as a deactivating agent on the catalyst surface. It is also observed that the sulfur species exists in the form of sulfate (SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}}) by XPS and Raman. It mainly causes the loss of NO removal activity of the catalysts. The sulfate species formed on the deactivated catalysts by SO{sub 2} did not significantly alter the chemical environment of the copper ions contained in the zeolite catalysts such as CuHM and CuNZA.

"Numerical prediction of the dynamic behavior of turbulent diffusion flames","Bohn, D; Deutsch, G; Krueger, U","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBULENT FLOW; FLAMES; COMBUSTION KINETICS; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; GAS BURNERS","Environmental compatibility requires low-emission burners for gas turbine power plants as well as for jet engines. In the past, significant progress has been made developing low NO{sub x} and CO burners. Unfortunately, these burners often have a more pronounced tendency than conventional burner designs to produce combustion driven oscillations. The oscillations may be excited to such an extent that pronounced pulsation may possibly occur; this is associated with a risk of engine failure. The stability of a burner system can be investigated by means of a stability analysis under the assumption of acoustical behavior. The problem with all these algorithms is the transfer function of the flame. A new method is presented here to predict the dynamic flame behavior by means of a full Navier-Stokes simulation of the complex combustion process. The first step is to get a steady-state solution of a flame configuration. After that a transient simulation follows with a sudden change in the mass flow rate at the flame inlet. The time-dependent answer of the flame to this disturbance is then transformed into the frequency space by a Laplace Transformation. This leads, in turn, to the frequency response representing the dynamic behavior of the flame. In principle, this method can be adapted for both diffusion as well as premixed flame systems.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 41. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, June 10--13, 1996, Birmingham (GB); PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 713-720","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9908%%222","10.1115/1.2818458","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","316142","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316142","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","120"

One of the main features of this plant is that it exhibits nonlinear process behavior due to large throughput swings. In this application, the operating window of the plant has been divided into a number of smaller windows in which the nonlinear process behavior has been approximated by linear behavior. For each operating window, linear step weight models were developed from a detailed nonlinear first principles model, and the model prediction is calculated based on interpolation between these linear models. The model output at each operating point can then be calculated from four basic linear models, and the required control action can subsequently be calculated with the standard model predictive control approach using quadratic programming.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 689-693","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9908%%220","10.1115/1.2818455","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","316140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316140","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","120"

In order to calculate this potential realistically, a knowledge of the loss mechanisms is required. The experiment reported here was designed as a statistical experiment to identify the losses due to finite passage opening time, friction, and leakage, using a three-port, flow divider, wave rotor cycle. Incidence loss was also found to be important. Rotors of 12 in. diameter were used, with two different lengths, 9 in. and 18 in., and two different passage widths, 0.25 in. and 0.54 in., in order to vary friction and opening time. To vary leakage, moveable end walls were provided so that the rotor to end wall gap could be adjusted.

An advantage of the copper oxide processes is the simultaneous removal of SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x}. The sorbent absorbs SO{sub 2} and acts as catalyst in reduction reactions for high NO{sub x} removal. Therefore, CuO processes have the potential to offer a more efficient and economical way to reduce both SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x} emissions as compared to other flue gas cleanup processes, which use two separate processes to curtail SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x}. The moving-bed process is capable of simultaneously removing 99% SO{sub 2} and 95% NO{sub x} from coal-fired combustor flue gas. This article describes a countercurrent moving-bed regenerator model using natural gas as the reducing agent. The model incorporates several aspects important for predicting the regenerator performance, such as gas expansion effects, deviation from first-order kinetics with respect to copper sulfate, and mass transfer limitations. The sorbent residence time predicted by this model is in good agreement with data obtained from the life-cycle test system at the Federal Energy Technology Center. The tests conducted include effects of reactor temperature, the methane to copper sulfate feed ratio, and sorbent residence time, on sorbent regeneration. The regenerator modeling also details the impact of gas velocity on the reactor performance.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Sum 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 61-69","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: IM9823%%170","10.1002/ep.670170210","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","642275","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/642275","","Environmental Progress","2","17"

In particular, the electromechanical behavior of the overall turbine-alternator system, with respect to the electrical interconnected grid, may be theoretically studied, by using dynamic simulation models perfected with suitable details. The control systems performances can also be easily checked and fine-tuned, in presence of small and large perturbations, both in normal and in emergency operating conditions. The simulator STAR, which has been successfully used also for the specialists training, can be effectively considered as a real turbine-alternator system. In fact its inputs may be directly connected to the interfaces of the excitation system and turbine governor; moreover, the simulator provides in output the process variables with the suitable format requested by the different control apparatuses. The paper describes the main design topics of the STAR simulator, as mainly regards its hardware and software architecture and the model framework of the turbine (steam, hydro or gas), alternator (with static and rotating exciter) and grid interconnection. The structure of the excitation control system and turbine speed governor, as well as the parameters configuration, run-time simulation, and data visualization procedures are shortly described. Finally, the STAR performances are shown through significant transient responses.","","","","","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 282-291","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9829%%139","10.1109/60.707609","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659106","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659106","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","13"

The benefits of producing gas-turbine blades from single crystal superalloys has resulted from at least two factors. Firstly, the elimination of grain boundaries from the component has increased the creep ductility by removing sites where cavities develop and has allowed the chemistry of superalloys, designed specifically for use in the single crystal form, to be free of grain boundary strengthening elements thus increasing the melting temperature and potential operating temperature. Secondly, by controlling the orientation of the single crystal casting, normally having the low modulus <001> direction parallel to the centrifugally stressed blade axis, thermal stresses are minimized and the thermal fatigue resistance is greatly enhanced. However, these advantages have been obtained at the expense of dealing with a highly anisotropic material. In order to exploit the full potential of single crystal superalloys, an effective anisotropic design strategy is required.","","","","","","United States","1998-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 4-5; Conference: Annual meeting of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS), San Antonio, TX (United States), 15-19 Feb 1998; Other Information: PBD: 4 Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 465-472","","CONF-980202-","","Journal ID: SCMAF7; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9826%%96","10.1016/S1359-6462(98)00223-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651140","","Scripta Materialia","4-5","39"

It uses an ultrashort laser pulse that propagates through the absorbing medium, for which the relevant absorption information resides in the free-induction decay that is trailing behind the transmitted pulse. Time gating out most of the transmitted pulse, but not the free-induction decay, enhances the relative fraction of light that contains absorption information when the spectrum is measured. This procedure reduces the background associated with the input light, thus enhancing detection sensitivity. {copyright} {ital 1998} {ital Optical Society of America}","","","","","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Optics Letters; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1289-1291","","","","Journal ID: OPLEDP; ISSN 0146-9592; TRN: 98:007559","10.1364/OL.23.001289","","2011-03-10T00:00:00Z","641520","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/641520","","Optics Letters","16","23"

Such effluents may pose potential human health and ecological risks. To evaluate these risks, a model was developed and applied to a time-variable release of these constituents into a river. The release pattern and dose are typical of power plants. In situ formation of chloroform is also simulated. The model is applicable to situations where chloroform is the dominant trihalomethane. Therefore, the model is limited to water with low background bromide ion concentrations. For the scenario evaluated, predicted total residual chlorine levels, expressed in terms of a hazard quotient for the protection of aquatic organisms, are above EPA criteria at locations to within approximately 5 km downstream of the discharge; excess lifetime risk to an individual exposed to predicted levels of chloroform in the river range from 5 {times} 10{sup {minus}7} to above 10{sup {minus}6}, a degree of risk that is close to levels of concern to regulatory agencies.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2162-2171","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: 98:010521","10.1021/es970209l","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","655426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/655426","","Environmental Science and Technology","14","32"

All of the three options--recycling, landfilling and combustion--have some disadvantages. Even landfilling, which produces no emissions, fails to take advantage of the energy value inherent in plastic. Waste combustion, on the other hand, recovers the energy in plastic materials and reduces the volume of disposed solid waste by up to 90% of its initial preburn volumes. However, this management option generates emissions and produces an ash residue that must be managed. As demonstrated by recent test burns, improvements in combustion and air-pollution-control technology have dramatically reduced the health risks from emissions and ash. Recent studies have shown that plastics--in quantities even higher than those normally found in municipal solid waste--do not adversely affect levels of emissions or the quality of ash from waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, waste-to-energy facilities may be a relatively economical source of fuel, and may be a more economic solution to waste management than the other available options. A waste-to-energy plant generally produces electricity that is sold to the electric utilities for approximately six cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate that is competitive with those offered by nuclear power plants and power plants that generate energy by burning fossil fuels.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Scientist; Journal Volume: 86; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 364-373","","","","Journal ID: AMSCAC; ISSN 0003-0996; TRN: IM9834%%254","10.1511/1998.31.819","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","290014","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/290014","","American Scientist","4","86"

Principle factors affecting the susceptibility of rotors to SCC have been identified as disk yield strength, applied stress level, and surface film/crevice chemistry. Microstructure and cleanliness of the steel have been found to have relatively little effect. Advances in steel making and forging over the last 20 years have provided manufacturers with additional design and material options to mitigate the problem. Increases in forging size capabilities of steel companies and the welded construction of rotors now permit designing with integral and partial integral rotors that use materials with lower yield strength (more SCC resistant) as well as eliminating the SCC problem in bores and keyways. However, a recent survey of US utilities has shown that SCC in the blade attachment legion of LP rotors is an increasing concern. This problem has led to development of repair and refurbishment methods for rim attachments, especially weld buildup of rims with corrosion-resistant alloys.

The fish life cycle model simulates different life stages of fish by using appropriate expressions representing growth and mortality rates. The heart of the developed modeling approach is the prediction of plant-caused reduction in total fish population by estimating recruitment to adult population with and without entrainment of ichthyoplankton and impingement of small fish. The model was applied to a local fish species, gilthead (Aparus aurata), for the case of a proposed power plant in the Aegean region of Turkey. The simulations indicate that entrainment and impingement may lead to a population reduction of about 2% to 8% in the long run. In many cases, an impact of this size can be considered rather unimportant. In the case of sensitive and ecologically values species facing extinction, however, necessary precautions should be taken to minimize or totally avoid such an impact.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 612-618","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: 98:007767","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1998)124:7(612)","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","642350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/642350","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","7","124"

Research data on fuel-NO{sub x} formation are insufficient, and there still remains a wide explored domain. The present research aims at obtaining fundamental knowledge of fuel-NO{sub x} formation characteristics by applying reaction kinetics to gas turbine conditions. An instantaneous mixing condition was assumed in the cross section of a gas turbine combustor and both gradual mixing condition and instantaneous mixing condition were assumed at secondary air inlet section. The results may be summarized as follows: (1) in the primary combustion zone under fuel rich condition, HCN and other intermediate products are formed as ammonia contained in the fuel decomposes; (2) formation characteristics of fuel-NO{sub x} are affected by the condition of secondary air mixing; and (3) the conversion ratio from ammonia to NO{sub x} declines as the pressure inside the combustor rises under the condition of gradual mixing at the secondary air inlet. These results obtained agreed approximately with the experimentation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 4.

High reliability and durability must be intrinsically designed into these turbine engines to meet operating economic targets and ETOPS certification requirements. This level of performance has been brought about by a combination of advances in air cooling for turbine blades and vanes, design technology for stresses and airflow, single crystal and directionally solidified casting process improvements, and the development and use of rhenium (Re) containing high {gamma}{prime} volume fraction nickel-base superalloys with advanced coatings, including full-airfoil ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Re additions to cast airfoil superalloys not only improves creep and thermo-mechanical fatigue strength, but also environmental properties including coating performance. Re dramatically slows down diffusion in these alloys at high operating temperatures. A team approach has been used to develop a family of two nickel-base single crystal alloys (CMSX-4 containing 3% Re and CMSX-10 containing 6% Re) and a directionally solidified, columnar grain nickel-base alloy (CM 186 LC containing 3% Re) for a variety of turbine engine applications. A range of critical properties of these alloys is reviewed in relation to turbine component engineering performance through engine certification testing and service experience. Industrial turbines are now commencing to use this aero developed turbine technology in both small and large frame units in addition to aero-derivative industrial engines. These applications are demanding, with high reliability required for turbine airfoils out to 25,000 hours, with perhaps greater than 50% of the time spent at maximum power. Combined cycle efficiencies of large frame industrial engines are scheduled to reach 60% in the US ATS program. Application experience to a total 1.3 million engine hours and 28,000 hours individual blade set service for CMSX-4 first stage turbine blades is reviewed for a small frame industrial engine.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 595-600","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%228","10.1115/1.2818188","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","665380","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665380","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

Due to the lack of empirical data available, a modeling approach is used to simulate the effect of varying moisture content in the gasifier feed biomass. For a specified as-received biomass moisture content, drying prior to gasification increases overall efficiency, but the gains in efficiency decrease with increasing levels of drying. For a specified post-dryer gasifier feed moisture content, cycle efficiency and power output increase with decreasing as-received biomass moisture down to 30%, below which the change in cycle performance is negligible.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 455-459","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%218","10.1115/1.2818166","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","665370","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665370","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

Although the primary objective of this effort was to develop an RQL combustor with lower conversion of fuel bound nitrogen to NO{sub x} than a conventional gas turbine combustor, the RQL2 design can be readily adapted to natural gas and liquid fuel combustion. RQL2 is the culmination of a 5 year research and development effort that began with natural gas tests of a 2 in. diameter converging rich stage liner, an impingement cooled 7 in. diameter radially-stratified-quench stage, and a backward facing step at the entrance to a 10 in. diameter film cooled lean stage. The rich stage combustor liner has a novel double-walled structure with narrow circumferential cooling channels to maintain metal wall temperatures within design limits. Provisions were made to allow independent control of the air supplied to the rich and quench/lean stages. RQL2 has been fired for almost 100 hours with LHV fuel supplied by a pilot scale coal gasification and high temperature desulfurization system. At the optimum rich stage equivalence ratio NO{sub x} emissions were about 50 ppmv NH{sub 3} in the LHV fuel, this corresponds to a conversion of NH{sub 3} to NO{sub x} of about 5%. As conditions were shifted away from the optimum, RQL2 NO{sub x} emissions gradually increased until they were comparable to a standard combustor. A chemical kinetic model of RQL2, constructed from a series of ideal chemical reactors, matched the measured NO{sub x} emissions fairly well. The CO emissions were between 5 and 30 ppmv (on a dry, 15% O{sub 2} basis) under all conditions.","","","","USDOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center, WV (United States)","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 502-508","","CONF-970604-","AC21-87MC23170","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%222","10.1115/1.2818173","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","665374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665374","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

For optimization of energy systems, the environmental aspects are quantified and introduced into the objective function. In this particular work, the environomic approach is followed of the analysis and optimal design of a combined-cycle plant. In addition to the basic configuration, two alternatives for NO{sub x} abatement are studied: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and steam injection.

But even when a clean fuel such as LNG (liquefied natural gas) is used, thermal NO{sub x} is generated in the high temperature gas turbine combustion process. The NO{sub x} emission from gas turbines is controlled through selective catalytic reduction processes (SCR) in the Japanese electric industry. If catalytic combustion could be applied to the combustor of the gas turbine, it is expected to lower NO{sub x} emission more economically. Under such high temperature and high pressure conditions, as in the gas turbine, however, the durability of the catalyst is still insufficient. So it prevents the realization of a high temperature catalytic combustor. To overcome this difficulty, a catalytic combustor combined with premixed combustion for a 1,300 C class gas turbine was developed. In this method, catalyst temperature is kept below 1,000 C, and a lean premixed gas is injected into the catalytic combustion gas. As a result, the load on the catalyst is reduced and it is possible to prevent the catalyst deactivation. After a preliminary atmospheric test, the design of the combustion was modified and a high pressure combustion test was conducted. As a result, it was confirmed that NO{sub x} emission was below 10 ppm (at 16 percent O{sub 2}) at a combustor outlet gas temperature of 1,300 C and that the combustion efficiency was almost 100%. This paper presents the design features and test results of the combustor.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 41. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, June 10--13, 1996, Birmingham (GB); PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 509-513","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%167","10.1115/1.2818174","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","665320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665320","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

The designed combustor had the following three characteristics: (1) in order to assure the stable combustion burning low-Btu gas (LBG), an auxiliary combustion chamber was installed at the entrance of the combustor; (2) to reduce fuel NO{sub x} emission that was produced from the ammonia (NH{approximately}) in the fuel, the rich-lean combustion method was introduced; and (3) to compensate for the declined cooling-air associated with the higher temperature of the gas turbine, the tested combustor was equipped with a dual-structure transition piece so that the cooling air in the transition piece can be recycled to cool down the combustor liner wall. As a result of combustor tests, it is confirmed that CO emission is less than 20 ppm, the conversion rate of NH3 which contains about 1,000 ppm in the coal gasified fuel to NO{sub x} shows 40% or below, and the liner wall temperature remained below almost 850 C under high pressure (1.4 MPa), rated load condition.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 481-487","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%219","10.1115/1.2818170","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","665371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665371","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

These components are generally coated with either a diffusion coating (aluminide or platinum aluminide) or with an overlay coating (MCrAlY) to provide additional hot corrosion and/or oxidation protection. These coatings degrade due to inward and outward diffusion of elements during service. Outward diffusion of aluminum results in formation of a protective oxide layer on the surface. When the protective oxide spalls, aluminum in the coating diffuses out to reform the oxide layer. Accelerated oxidation and failure of coating occur when the Al content in the coating is insufficient to reform a continuous alumina film. This paper describes development of a coating life prediction model that accounts for both oxidation and oxide spallation under thermal mechanical loading as well as diffusion of elements that dictate the end of useful life. Cyclic oxidation data for aluminide and platinum aluminide coatings were generated to determine model constants. Applications of this model for predicting cyclic oxidation life of coated materials are demonstrated. Work is underway to develop additional material data and to qualify the model for determining actual blade and vane coating refurbishment intervals.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 609-704","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%229","10.1115/1.2818189","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","665381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665381","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

Here the authors explore model sensitivity to some of the more important biological, physical and engineering design parameters, with particular reference to CO{sub 2} injection as a buoyant droplet plume. Uncertainty in the dose-response relationship, e.g. caused by the use of data for surface organisms, will affect predicted values of total mortality by less than a factor of two for a single point discharge from 10 standard (500 MWe) coal-fired values of total mortality by less than a factor of two for a single point discharge from 10 standard 500 MWe coal-fired electric power plants and a factor of five for a single point discharge from one standard plant. The most important design variable is the number of physically separated discharge points (diffuser ports or groups of ports) used to disperse the CO{sub 2}. Predicted mortality drops to zero as the number of discharge points per standard plants exceeds two. Finally the most important physical parameters are ambient current speed and turbulent diffusivity. As with the dose-response data, most physical oceanographic measurements have been conducted near the ocean surface. Model sensitivity suggests that a factor of 2.5 reduction in current speed or a factor of 3 reduction in ambient diffusivity, relative to the base case, would require that the number of discharge points per standard plant increase from 2 to 12 in order to avoid mortality. Thus, impacts can be strongly site-specific, and additional oceanographic measurements are needed at depths appropriate for CO{sub 2} sequestration. Nonetheless, it should be easy to design an environmentally conservative multi-point discharge system that can disperse CO{sub 2} as a droplet plume without significant mortality, even under adverse environmental conditions.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 5-6; Conference: International symposium on ocean disposal of carbon dioxide, Tokyo (Japan), 31 Oct - 1 Nov 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 375-380","","CONF-9610136-","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: 98:006356","10.1016/S0956-053X(97)10038-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624047","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624047","","Waste Management","5-6","17"

All of these factors can influence the potential for a fly ash to be marketed for utilization. In this study, three coal-fired combustors, two tangentially fired and one wall-fired, all burning high-sulfur Illinois coal at the same power plant, were studied before and after conversion to low-NO{sub x} combustion. In all cases, the post-conversion fly ash was higher in carbon than the pre-conversion ash from the same unit. The fly ashes in at least two of the units would appear to have post-conversion ashes which still fall within the regional guidelines for the limit of carbon (or loss on ignition).","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 219-229","","","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9819%%22","10.1016/S0956-053X(97)10008-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","619434","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619434","","Waste Management","4","17"

Cogeneration can achieve extremely high levels of thermal efficiency, much higher than the most advanced and sophisticated combined cycle power plants generating only electric power. Thermal efficiency is one of the key factors in determining the power plant economics and feasibility. High efficiency means a lesser amount of fuel is used to generate the same amount of energy. In turn, burning a lesser amount of fuel means that fewer pollutants will be emitted. The paper first describes cogeneration plants, then discusses the importance of thermal load availability, cogeneration and distributed generation and other issues affecting cogeneration.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cogeneration and Competitive Power Journal; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Spr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 47-60","","","","Journal ID: CCPJE8; ISSN 1066-8683; TRN: IM9819%%148","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","619560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619560","","Cogeneration and Competitive Power Journal","2","13"

The results were analyzed on the basis of a 1D model. The estimates of the intrinsic activity parameters and of the effective factors were found to differ significantly among the catalysts under study. Aspects related to scale-up were also addressed on a preliminary basis. Concerning the SO{sub 2} oxidation reaction, the lab-scale analysis of the catalysts can be directly exploited for reactor design. On the contrary, the evaluation of the DeNO{sub x} performance of the industrial plate-type monolith requires the study of the interphase mass transfer in the real scale; the NO conversion data collected in the slab-reactor were estimated as not conservative in relation to design applications.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2623-2633","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9828%%191","10.1021/ie970791m","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","655521","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/655521","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","7","37"

Its predictions are practically equivalent to those of a previous 2D model, but its numerical solution is faster by 1 order of magnitude, making it suitable for predictive control applications. The model is successfully fitted to transient NO reduction data at different temperatures, space velocities, and NH{sub 3}/NO feed ratios over two commercial SCR monolith catalysts. The data indicate characteristic times up to several minutes. The model analysis shows that: (1) SCR dynamics are determined by buildup/depletion of the catalyst NH{sub 3} coverage, which result primarily from a competition between adsorption of ammonia and its reaction with NO, the rate of NH{sub 3} desorption being markedly slower; (2) the dynamic response of NO conversion is slow compared to changes in the NH{sub 3} feed content, which is unfavorable for a feedback control system; and (3) positive/negative peaks of NO emissions vs progressive changes of the NH{sub 3} slip are predicted upon sudden load variations.","","","","","","United States","1998-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2341-2349","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9826%%147","10.1021/ie970729p","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651191","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651191","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","37"

Accurate prediction of the jet trajectory and temperature dilution are necessary if discharge structures are to be designed to meet the appropriate standards. A modified version of the integral Fan-Brooks model has been used to calculate the horizontal penetration of inclined thermal buoyant water jets. The classical densimetric Froude number F{sub 0} is substituted by a Froude number F{sub a} based on the thermal expansion coefficient of water.

This benefit is widely recognized, but turbine developers routinely encounter problems with combustion oscillations during the testing of new premix combustors. Because of the associated pressure fluctuations, combustion oscillations must be eliminated in a final combustor design. Eliminating these oscillations is often time-consuming and costly because there is no single approach to solve an oscillation problem. Previous investigations of combustion stability have focused on rocket applications, industrial furnaces, and some aeroengine gas turbines. Comparatively little published data is available for premixed combustion at conditions typical of an industrial gas turbine. In this paper, the authors report experimental observations of oscillations produced by a fuel nozzle typical of industrial gas turbines. Tests are conducted in a specially designed combustor capable of providing the acoustic feedback needed to study oscillations. Tests results are presented for pressures up to 10 atmospheres, theoretical considerations, it is expected that oscillations can be characterized by a nozzle reference velocity, with operating pressure playing a smaller role. This expectation is compared to observed data that shows both the benefits and limitations of characterizing the combustor oscillating behavior in terms of a reference velocity rather than other engine operating parameters. This approach to characterizing oscillations is then used to evaluate how geometric changes to the fuel nozzle will affect the boundary between stable and oscillating combustion.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 294-302","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9834%%214","10.1115/1.2818120","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","290059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/290059","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","120"

Large fluctuations in calorific value are not tolerated by most gas customers, but power plants can adapt their facilities to work with variable gas quality as long as the power they produce remains constant. Gas-storage wells feeding a power plant must be modeled with a gas-rate adjustment based on calorific-value variations.

A large part of CO{sub 2} emitted to the atmosphere originates from the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal and petroleum. To reduce the CO{sub 2} exhaust from flue gases, several methods of CO{sub 2} separation have been proposed. Lithium zirconate powder reacts immediately with ambient CO{sub 2} in the range of 450 to 550 C. Moreover, the products react and return reversibly to lithium zirconate at temperatures above 650 C. Utilizing this reaction, the possibility of a CO{sub 2} separation system which operates at around 550 C is suggested. A CO{sub 2} separation process operable at temperatures beyond 500 C may have a special benefit, because the separation can be achieved directly during the fuel reforming process, where high CO{sub 2} concentration is expected.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1344-1350","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9820%%276","10.1149/1.1838462","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","624306","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624306","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","4","145"

The alloys were united directly from the molten state by centrifugal casting. In the optimum process, temperatures were controlled to prevent meltback of the SS310 outer layer by the higher melting T-11 stream. Hollow extrusion billets were prepared from the heavy-walled cast bimetallic tubes and successfully hot extruded to 84-mm OD x 64-mm ID tubes, and to 51-mm OD x 38-mm ID tubes. For the most part, thicknesses of the cladding and of the tube wall are rather uniform around the circumference and from end to end of the tubes. Hardness and tensile properties of annealed 51-mm tubes are uniform from end to end of a tube, and between tubes, and readily conform to ASTM A 213; tubes satisfy the flattening and flaring requirements of ASTM A 450. The cladding is metallurgically bonded to be base metal, as revealed by metallography, and by two tests developed for this study: a bond shear strength test and a twist test. In the latter test, rings 3.1 mm in thickness are slotted and severely twisted with a special tool. In tubes made by the optimum process, minute fissures that form adjacent to some of the pressure points during twist testing occupy just 3% of the bond-line length. Cost estimates for commercial production of 51-mm tubes via the centrifugal casting route suggest that such tubes should be considerably less expensive than conventionally clad tubes (extruded from composite billets assembled from heavy-walled wrought tubes). Such tubes should be attractive for the following applications in utility boilers: high-corrosion areas of existing coal-fired boilers, in both steam-generating tubes and superheaters; water walls, screen tubes, and superheater tubes of municipal waste-incineration boilers; future ultra super-critical boilers operating a higher temperatures and pressures; and steam-generating tubes of Syngas coolers of integrated coal gasification power plants.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the ASM international conference Heat-Resistant Materials II, September 11--14, 1995, Gatlinburg, TN (US); PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 227-238","","","","Journal ID: JMEPEG; ISSN 1059-9495; TRN: IM9818%%98","10.1361/105994998770347963","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","616474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616474","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","2","7"

The tubes are exposed to the action of high stresses and high temperatures, producing the so-called creep damage. In this work, two kinds of results are reported: lab and field studies using a 2.25Cr-1Mo steel. The laboratory work was in turn divided into two parts. In the first, the steel was exposed to the action of natural ash deposits in oxidant atmospheres at 600 C for 24 h.

In the field work, components of a power station were coated with different types of nickel- and iron-base coatings containing chromium, Fe-Cr, and Fe-Si using the powder flame spraying technique. After testing, the coated tubes were analyzed using electron microscopy. The results showed that all the coating systems had good corrosion resistance, especially those containing silicon or chromium.","","","","","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 108-113","","","","Journal ID: JMEPEG; ISSN 1059-9495; TRN: IM9817%%14","10.1361/105994998770348124","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","616133","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616133","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","1","7"

The thermal storage is usable at a temperature of {minus}27 C and higher. The proposed system is designed to shift electric demand from high to low-demand periods. The system utilizes a heat-operated absorption refrigeration system; however, the generator heat is supplied by a self-contained vapor compression heat pump. The heat pump is operated during the off-peak period to recover the low-temperature thermal storage by reprocessing the stored ammonia-water solution to a lower ammonia-water concentration. The ammonia vapor liberated from solution in the dephlegmator is used in the compressor to produce the generator heat. Three different configurations are considered, including a solar-assisted system. The results are compared to a eutectic salt storage system.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 25-31","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9817%%201","10.1115/1.2888042","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","616318","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616318","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","120"

The Sarlux integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant must simultaneously satisfy electrical power and refinery hydrogen and steam demands (trigeneration gasification). The plant`s gasifier, heat recovery, sulfur removal, hydrogen recovery and steam power generation units are highly integrated and require coordinated control. In this study, dynamic simulation provides insights into the behavior of the process and combined cycle units during normal and upset conditions. The dynamic simulation is used to design a control system that drives the gasifiers to satisfy power, steam and hydrogen demands before a load change or upset is detected by the syngas pressure controller. At the study conclusion, the model will demonstrate how the IGCC plant will respond to the contractual maximum load change rate and process upsets. The study tests the basic process and control system design during the project engineering phase to minimize startup troubleshooting and expensive field changes.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrocarbon Processing; Journal Volume: 77; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 107-116","","","","Journal ID: HYPRAX; ISSN 0018-8190; TRN: IM9804%%229","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","564221","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/564221","","Hydrocarbon Processing","1","77"
"An experimental/computational study of airflow in the combustor-diffuser system of a gas turbine for power generation","Agrawal, A K; Kapat, J S; Yang, T T","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; AIR FLOW; COMPUTER CALCULATIONS; GAS TURBINES; COMBUSTORS; DIFFUSERS","This paper presents an experimental/computational study of cold flow in the combustion-diffuser system of industrial gas turbines employing can-annular combustors and impingement-cooled transition pieces. The primary objectives were to determine flow interactions between the prediffuser and dump chamber, to evaluate circumferential flow nonuniformities around transition pieces and combustors, and to identify the pressure loss mechanisms. Flow experiments were conducted in an approximately one-third geometric scale, 360-deg annular test model simulating practical details of the prototype including the support struts, transition pieces, impingement sleeves, and can-annular combustors. Wall static pressures and velocity profiles were measured at selected locations in the test model. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analysis employing a multidomain procedure was performed to supplement the flow measurements. The complex geometric features of the test model were included in the analysis. The measured data correlated well with the computations. The results revealed strong interactions between the prediffuser and dump chamber flows. The prediffuser exit flow was distorted, indicating that the uniform exit conditions typically assumed in the diffuser design were violated. The pressure varied circumferentially around the combustor casing and impingement sleeve. The circumferential flow nonuniformities increased toward the inlet of the turbine expander. A venturi effect causing flow to accelerate and decelerate in the dump chamber was also identified. This venturi effect could adversely affect impingement cooling of the transition piece in the prototype. The dump chamber contained several recirculation regions contributing to the losses. Approximately 1.2 dynamic head at the prediffuser inlet was lost in the combustor-diffuser.","","","","USDOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center, WV (United States)","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 41.

"Efficient recovery of carbon dioxide from flue gases of coal-fired power plants by cyclic fixed-bed operations over K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-carbon","Hayashi, Hiromu; Taniuchi, Jun; Furuyashiki, Nobuyoshi; Sugiyama, Shigeru; Hirano, Shinichi; Shigemoto, Naoya; Nonaka, Takazumi","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; CARBON DIOXIDE; CHEMISORPTION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; FLUE GAS; POTASSIUM CARBONATES; COAL; MOISTURE; MATERIALS RECOVERY; ACTIVATED CARBON; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL","An efficient chemical absorption method capable of cyclic fixed-bed operations under moist conditions for the recovery of carbon dioxide from flue gases has been proposed employing K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-carbon. Carbon dioxide was chemically absorbed by the reaction K{sub 2}CO{sub 3} + CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2}O {r_equilibrium} 2KHCO{sub 3} to form potassium hydrogen carbonate. Moisture, usually contained as high as 8--17% in flue gases, badly affects the capacity of conventional adsorbents such as zeolites, but the present technology has no concern with moisture; water is rather necessary in principle as shown in the equation above. Deliquescent potassium carbonate should be supported on an appropriate porous material to adapt for fixed-bed operations. After breakthrough of carbon dioxide, the entrapped carbon dioxide was released by the decomposition of hydrogen carbonate to shift the reaction in reverse on flushing with steam, which could be condensed by cooling to afford carbon dioxide in high purity. Among various preparations of alkaline-earth carbonates (X{sub 2}CO{sub 3}, X = Li, Na, K) on porous materials, K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-activated carbon revealed excellent properties for the present purpose. Preparation and characterization of K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-carbon and illustrative fixed-bed operations under flue gas conditions in laboratory columns and a bench-scale plant are described.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 185-191","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9814%%90","10.1021/ie9704455","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","599782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/599782","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","37"

Solidification/Stabilization (S/S) processes were tested by analyzing the influence of the variables: binder type, water needs, and land disposal scenario that affect the final solid leaching characteristics. A factorial design of experiments was used to study the influence of these variables in the final S/S solid. After characterization of the leachates according to European regulations, the chemical stability of the S/S solids was analyzed using a standard dynamic leaching test (DLT). A dynamic leaching model of the contaminants (sulfates) contained in the S/S matrix was formulated from the research on the long-term behavior of the solid matrix, establishing the parameters that have an effect on the mobility of the sulfate. One parameter, the effective diffusion coefficient [D{sub e} (cm{sup 2}/s)] and its logarithmic expression, the leaching index (LX), were evaluated for each S/S process. Values of 1.51 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) {le} D{sub e} {le} 2.14 {times} 10{sup {minus}9} (cm{sup 2}/s) for 100% humidity-cured S/S wastes and 1.98 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) {le} D{sub e} {le} 4.36 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) for water bath-cured S/S wastes were obtained for D{sub e}, leading to LX values of 8.67 {le} LX {le} 10.82 and 10.36 {le} LX {le} 10.80, respectively. These values suggest that a high immobility was reached in some of the developed S/S processes. The validity of the leaching parameters obtained after a short-term landfill period was confirmed after 1 year.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-50","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: IM9809%%52","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1998)124:1(43)","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","577367","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/577367","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","1","124"
