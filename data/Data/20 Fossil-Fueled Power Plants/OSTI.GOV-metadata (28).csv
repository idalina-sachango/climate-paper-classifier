"Use of sorbents of hot-contact coal carbonization in the power industry","Blokhin, A I; Keneman, F E; Sklyarov, A V; Fedoseev, B S","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; ADSORBENTS; CARBONIZATION; ACTIVATED CARBON; SORPTIVE PROPERTIES; COAL; WATER TREATMENT; RUSSIAN FEDERATION; SEWAGE; WASTE WATER; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; OILS; PETROLEUM; DECONTAMINATION; WASTE PRODUCT UTILIZATION; BIODEGRADATION","The many years of experience in the use of sorbents of hot-contact coal carbonization (HCCC) in the power industry is used for substantiation of their prospects for solving problems of power and materials saving and improving the reliability and safety of operation of power equipment. Results of tests of sorbents in systems of water conditioning of thermal power plants, cleaning of return condensates, mazut- and oil-contaminated process wastewaters, makeup water in heat networks, and biosorption cleaning of sewerage are presented. The sorption methods of cleaning are shown to have many advantages, to save expensive ion-exchange resins and reagents, to decrease the cost of desalinated water, and to prolong the service of power equipment. Comparative data are presented for basic commercial kinds of activated carbon and HCCC (sorbents activated crushed brown-coal coke (ABD)). The technical characteristics of sorbents of hot-contact coal carbonization are shown to be at the level of commercial sorbents or be higher at a much lower cost (by a factor of 2.5 - 3). It is shown that the creation of several HCCC installations with an output of 25 - 30 thousand tons of sorbents a year at coal-fired power plants will solve many water-cleaning problems of the 'EES Rossii' Co. ('The United Power Systems of Russia') and make it a monopolistic producer of activated carbon in the Russian market.","","","","","","United States","2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Technology and Engineering; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 359-365","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1570-145X; TRN: 000300118","10.1023/B:HYCO.0000021301.18704.0b","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20567892","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20567892","","Power Technology and Engineering","6","37"

The proportion of thermal power plants (TPP) in the structure of the generating capacity of Russia amounts to about 70% (147 mln kW). The proportion of gas in the structure of fuel consumed by TPP amounts to 64%. It is predicted that the fraction of high-quality kinds of fuel (gas and fuel oil) will decrease in the considered period due to maximum involvement of coal in the fuel balance and wider use of combined-cycle and gas-turbine technologies that provide a lower specific consumption of fuel. It is planned to resort to advanced technologies both for reconstructing existing plants and erecting new ones. This paper deals with problems of fuel supply of fossil-fuel-fired thermal power plants in the light of the evolution of the energy economy of Russia. The demand of TPP for different kinds of fossil fuel, i.e., gas, coal, and fuel oil, is estimated for the whole of the country and for its regions according to two variants of development of the generating capacity with planned commissioning of combined-cycle plants with a total output of 32 mln kW and gas-turbine plants with a total output of 61 mln kW in the period of up to 2020. The tasks of the fuel policy to be solved in the considered period are presented.","","","","","","United States","2002-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Technology and Engineering; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 123-131","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1570-145X; TRN: 000300123","10.1023/A:1020960308519","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20567897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20567897","","Power Technology and Engineering","3","36"

These decreases were unprecedented in magnitude and spatial extent. In contrast, nitrate (NO{sub 3}{sup {minus}}) concentrations generally did not change over this period. The largest decreases in both H{sup +} and SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} concentrations, which nearly mimicked one another, occurred in and downwind of the Ohio River Valley, the same area where Title 4 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) set limitations on sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) emissions from a large number of utility-owned coal-fired sources. Phase 1 of the CAAA required that these limitations be met by January 1, 1995. On the basis of their analysis of precipitation chemistry and emissions data, the authors conclude that significant declines in acid rain occurred in many parts of the Eastern US from 1995 through 1997 because of large reductions in SO{sub 2} emissions in this region and a corresponding reduction in SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}} concentrations in precipitation.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (US)","","","United States","2000-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: 15 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 940-949","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200019%%97","10.1021/es9901258","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020672","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020672","","Environmental Science and Technology","6","34"

Many materials that experience hot corrosion are exposed to high heat fluxes and temperature gradients. The hot corrosion of metals can be described by the dissolution of a protective metal oxide into the fused salt and the subsequent precipitation of the metal oxide in a non-protective form. Rapp and Goto have established a criterion for the sustained hot corrosion of a pure metal that the solubility gradient of the protective oxide in the salt film must be negative at the oxide/salt interface. The influence of a temperature gradient on the metal oxide solubility gradient (and the predicted hot corrosion susceptibility) is discussed. Solubility data for NiO in Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} are used to illustrate the effects of a temperature gradient. The effects of a temperature gradient were determined by examining various combinations of dissolution reactions, oxidants, and transport kinetics. Based on these results, and the thinness of the molten salt films, temperature gradients are not expected to be of importance to hot corrosion fluxing mechanisms.","Wiley/VCH Pubs Inc., New York","Publisher","Albany Research Center (ARC), Albany, OR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2000-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials and Corrosion; Journal Volume: 51; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: X","","DOE/ARC-2000-013","","Journal ID: ISSN 0947-5117; TRN: US200520%%143","10.1002/1521-4176(200008)51:8<564::AID-MACO564>3.0.CO;2-4","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","810018","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/810018","","Materials and Corrosion","8","51"

However, the fine sand-silt particle size of fly ash may make it more susceptible than natural soils to detachment and transport by erosive processes. Furthermore, the high content of silt-size particles in fly ash may make it more susceptible to surface crust formation, resulting in reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff and erosion. In the summer of 1989, fly ash-wood waste mixtures, used as a topsoil substitute, were surface applied on two separate mine sites in Preston County, WV, one with 10% slope and the other 20% slope. Erosion rates were measured directly using the Linear Erosion/Elevation Measuring Instrument (LEMI). Erosion measurements were taken during the first two growing seasons on both sites. Erosion values were up to five times greater on the fly ash-treated minesoil than on the untreated minesoil. Mulching with wood chips reduced fly ash erosion to about one-half the loss of the unmulched plots. Erosion was related to both the amount and type of ground cover. Increased vegetative ground cover resulted in reduced erosion. Mosses and fungi appeared to provide better erosion protection than grass-legume cover.","","","West Virginia Univ., Morgantown, WV (US)","","","United States","2000-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Quality; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May-Jun 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 805-811","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0047-2425; JEVQAA; TRN: IM200032%%190","10.2134/jeq2000.00472425002900030016x","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","20080425","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080425","","Journal of Environmental Quality","3","29"

The suspensions included a coal-washing effluent and a model system of TiO{sub 2} particles. A parametric study of TiO{sub 2} suspensions was performed to validate and analysis of the electrophoretic motion of the clarification front formed between a clear zone and the suspension. To measure the electric field strength needed in the prediction of the location of the front, a moveable probe and salt bridge were connected to a reference electrode. Using the measured electric field strengths, it was found that the numerical solution to the unit cell electrophoresis model agrees with the measured clarification rates. For suspensions with moderately thick electric double layers and high particle volume fractions the deviations from classical Smoluchowski theory are substantial, and the numerical analysis is in somewhat better agreement with the data than a prior solution of the problem. The numerical model reduces to the predictions of previous theories as the thickness of the electric double layer decreases, and it is in good agreement with the clarification rate measured for a coal-washing effluent suspension with thin electric double layers.","","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: 1 May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1806-1812","","","FG22-95PC95209","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200032%%288","10.1021/es990969r","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080523","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","34"

The authors document an increased incidence of axial malformations in bullfrog larvae (Rana catesbeiana) inhabiting two sites contaminated with coal combustion wastes. In the polluted sites, 18 and 37% of larvae exhibited lateral curvatures of the spine, whereas zero and 4% of larvae from two reference sites had similar malformations. Larvae from the most heavily polluted site had significantly higher tissue concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements, including As, Cd, Se, Cu, Cr, and V, compared with conspecifics from the reference sites. In addition, malformed larvae from the cost contaminated site had decreased swimming speeds compared with those of normal larvae from the same site. The authors hypothesize that the complex mixture of contaminants produced by coal combustion is responsible for the high incidence of malformations and associated effects on swimming performance.","","","Savannah River Ecology Lab., Aiken, SC (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 862-868","","","FC09-96SR18546","Journal ID: ISSN 0730-7268; ETOCDK; TRN: US0004019","10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<0862:IAIOAM>2.3.CO;2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080474","","Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","4","19"

This paper is concerned with the design and execution of the experimental portion of the study, which represents the first reported investigation to obtain nearly full surface information on heat transfer coefficients within an environment that develops an appropriate pressure distribution about an airfoil blade tip and shroud model. A stationary blade cascade experiment has been run consisting of three airfoils, the center airfoil having a variable tip gap clearance. The airfoil models the aerodynamic tip section of a high-pressure turbine blade with inlet Mach number of 0.30, exit Mach number of 0.75, pressure ratio of 1.45, exit Reynolds number based on axial chord of 2.57 x 10{sup 6}, and total turning of about 110 degrees. A hue detection based liquid crystal method is used to obtain the detailed heat transfer coefficient distribution on the blade tip surface for flat, smooth tip surfaces with both sharp and rounded edges. The cascade inlet turbulence intensity level took on values of either 5 or 9%. The cascade also models the casing recess in the shroud surface ahead of the blade. Experimental results are shown for the pressure distribution measurements on the airfoil near the tip gap, on the blade tip surface, and on the opposite shroud surface. Tip surface heat transfer coefficient distributions are shown for sharp edge and rounded edge tip geometries at each of the inlet turbulence intensity levels.","","","General Electric Corp., Schenectady, NY (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 44th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Indianapolis, IN (US), 06/07/1999--06/10/1999; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-271","","","FC21-95MC31176","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200035%%69","10.1115/1.555443","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086925","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086925","","Journal of Turbomachinery","2","122"

Besides desulfurization before combustion, flue gas desulfurization is considered the most promising method that could also be applicable to all other fossil fuels. In this article, the flue gas desulfurization processes are briefly reviewed, and processes with highest use and with high potential for future use are compared from technical and economical points of view. In the selection of a desulfurization process, it is very important to consider the capacity of the plant, fuel type and fuel-to-sulfur ratio, availability and price of the reagent to be used, type, price, and market of side products, disposal problems of wastes, and environmental factors.","","","Istanbul Technical Univ., Maslak-Istanbul (TR)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 197-206","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200019%%341","10.1080/00908310050013983","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020916","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020916","","Energy Sources","3","22"

When such materials are land-applied to supply nutrients for agronomic crops, trace element contaminant solubility must be evaluated. In this study, major and trace element soil solution concentrations arising from application of fly ash, organic wastes, and mixtures of the two were compared in a laboratory incubation. Two fly ashes, broiler poultry litter (PL), municipal sewage sludge (SS), and mixtures of FA with either PL or SS were mixed with a Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludult) at rates of 32.3, 8.1, and 16.1 g kg{sup {minus}1} soil for FA, PL, and SS, respectively. Treatments were incubated at 22 C at 17% moisture content and soil solution was periodically extracted by centrifugation over 33 d. Initial soil solution concentrations of As, Mo, Se, and Cu were significantly greater in FA/OL treatments than the respective FA-only treatments. For Cu, increased solution concentrations were attributable to increased loading rates in FA/PL mixtures. Solution Cu concentrations were strongly correlated with dissolved C (R{sup 2} &gt; 0.96) in all PL treatments. Significant interactive effects for solution Mo and Se concentrations were observed for the FA/PL and may have resulted from the increased pH and competing anion concentrations of these treatments. Solution As concentrations showed a significant interactive effect for one FA/PL mixture. For the individual treatments, As was more soluble in the Pl treatment than either FA treatment.

Direct shear tests using Mikasa's apparatus, conventional permeability tests, and consolidation tests were conducted on two silt-size fly ashes, with low free lime contents, obtained from two different power plants. The results show that the immediate settling of both fly ashes takes place in a short period of time during consolidation and does not change with time. The rate of increase in shear strength with time is different depending on the pozzolanic reactions taking place for the two ashes. The permeability tests under constant stresses of 49 and 98 kPa for 12 days show that the coefficient of permeability for the tested ashes is between 10{sup {minus}6} and 10{sup {minus}7} m/s. During this period the coefficient of permeability either remains constant (for the case of the ash with a lower free lime content) or is slightly reduced (for the ash with a higher free lime content).

The principal reason appears to be the decline in rail rates for low-sulfur western coal delivered to higher-sulfur coal-fired plants in the Midwest. Consequently, there is less sulfur to be removed to meet the Title IV cap on aggregate SO{sub 2} emissions, and the cost of compliance and price of allowances can be expected to be less than would otherwise have been the case.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-45","","","","Journal ID: JEEMDI; ISSN 0095-0696; TRN: IM9829%%23","10.1006/jeem.1998.1033","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","658991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/658991","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","1","36"

Sulfur and chloride products may play important roles especially in fireside corrosion in atmospheric pressure, fluidized bed combustion (AFBC) systems, caused by the capture of sulfur and chlorine by limestone used as bed material in the combustor, and the resulting deposition of sulfur- or chlorine-rich compounds onto metallic surfaces. Results were reported from tests in a 0.1-MW{sub th} AFBC system where 1,000-h test burns were conducted using two coals with widely differing chlorine levels, and limestone was used as the sulfur sorbent. Coupons of three stainless steels (Types 304 [UNS S30400], 309 [UNS S30900], 347 [UNS S34700]) were exposed to the hot flue gases in the freeboard ({approximately} 10- cm below the location of the convection pass tubes). Deposits formed on the alloys contained high sulfur concentrations in their outer parts, as well as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Sulfur appeared to be associated with calcium and magnesium, suggesting that the fly ash may have reacted further after being deposited on the surface of the coupon. Areas of high sulfur concentration also correlated well with areas of high chromium content of the inner layers of the scales. cross sections of samples indicated that sulfur had penetrated into the alloy and reacted to form sulfide corrosion products. There was no direct evidence to show that alkali chlorides were involved in the corrosion process. No chloride was identified in the alloy samples. There was slight oxide spallation observed on all three alloys, with the degree of spallation in the following order: Type 304 &gt; Type 347 &gt; Type 309.","","","Western Kentucky Univ., Bowling Green, KY (US)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 298-306","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: IM200023%%129","10.5006/1.3287658","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20034201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20034201","","Corrosion (Houston)","3","56"

The model was tested using helicopter plume measurements from the 1995 Southern Oxidants Study (SOS) Nashville/Middle Tennessee Ozone Study. The model was applied for 6 days in June and July of 1995, and the model's ability to estimate physical and chemical plume characteristics, such as plume width and reactive species concentrations, was evaluated using the helicopter measurements. The best model results are for July 7, 1995, a case corresponding to a high NO{sub x} isolated power plant plume traveling over rural regions--model estimates of NO{sub x}, NO{sub y}, and O{sub 3} are highly correlated with measured values, and most of the measured plume centerline concentrations are reproduced to within 30%. For scenarios involving the interaction of the tracked plume with urban plumes or with other power plant plumes, model estimates of ozone concentrations are poorly correlated with observations, emphasizing the difficulty of characterizing such plumes from both measurement and modeling perspectives.","","","Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., San Ramon, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 870-880","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200020%%150","10.1021/es990611v","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20023215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20023215","","Environmental Science and Technology","5","34"

The study explicitly accounts for fuel quality variations, generation, and transmission and distribution (T and D) losses and auxiliary consumption variations. Results show major increases in both emission intensity and emission coefficient during the 1980s. The authors find electricity intensity to be the major contributing factor behind the 40% emission intensity rise during this period. The emission coefficient increased by 13% during this period, the major contributing factor being generation mix effects, which increased by 27.6%, offsetting the effect of fuel quality, whose index declined by 10%.","","","Indira Gandhi Inst. of Development Research, Mumbai (IN)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb-Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 157-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200012%%508","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014580","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014580","","Energy Sources","2","22"

In this study, a novel in situ NDT method is developed for characterization of the reaction layer formation and its growth kinetics. Formation kinetics and physical properties of the reaction layer are evaluated by impedance spectroscopy (IS) technique. Specimens were aged over a long period of time, which provides large impedance. The impedance behavior of TBC and bond coating change significantly with the formation and the growth of the reaction layer. This allows us to nondestructively test the detrimental effects of the presence of the reaction layer for TBC integrity at high temperature.","","","Tohoku Univ., Sendai (JP)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Evaluation; Journal Volume: 58; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 476-481","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0025-5327; MAEVAD; TRN: IM200016%%131","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015648","","Materials Evaluation","3","58"

It was found that No molecules were absorbed on the fresh Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC catalyst and then oxidized by O{sub 2} to adsorbed NO{sub 2} and nitrate species. These NO{sub x} adspecies could be reduced by NH{sub 3} at high temperatures. NH{sub 3} molecules could also be adsorbed on the Broensted acid and Lewis acid sites on the Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC catalyst to generate, respectively, NH{sup +}{sub 4} ions and coordinated NH{sub 3} species. These NH{sub 3} adspecies were active in reacting with NO, NO + O{sub 2} and NO{sub 2}, but the reaction rates of NH{sub 3} + NO + O{sub 2} and NH{sub 3} + NO{sub 2} were much higher than that of NNO + NH{sub 3}. However, under reaction conditions, the surface of Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC was mainly covered by NH{sup +}{sub 4} ions and coordinated NH{sub 3}, and no NO{sub x} adspecies were detected. This is in agreement with the zero-order for the SCR reaction with respect to NH{sub 3}. A possible reaction scheme for the SCR reaction on Fe-TiO{sub 2}-PILC was proposed. NO reduction initially involved the reaction between NO{sub 2} and pairs of NH{sub 3} adspecies to form an active intermediate, which finally reacted with gaseous or weakly adsorbed NO to produce N{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O.","","","Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI (US)","Electric Power Research Institute","","United States","2000-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 190; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; JCTLA5; TRN: IM200017%%173","10.1006/jcat.1999.2737","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20017451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20017451","","Journal of Catalysis","1","190"

The damaging effects of erosion substantially shorten the lives of the pipelines and heat exchangers in the coal liquefaction-gasification utilities. In this study, the effects of turbulence intensity, temperature, particle sizes, and impinging velocity on erosion by particle impact are demonstrated numerically. Underlying turbulent flow on an Eulerian frame is described by the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with a Renormalization Group Theory (RNG) {kappa}-{epsilon} turbulence model. The particle trajectories and particle-wall interactions are evaluated by a Lagrangian approach. An erosion model considering material weight removal from surfaces is used to predict erosive wear. Computational validation against measured data is performed on a one-phase and two-phase impinging jet. Numerical comparisons reveal that the current study provides better predictive capability for erosion than the previous works.","","","Chung-Hua Univ., Hsinchu (TW)","","","United States","2000-02-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

Adsorbents prepared by thoroughly mixing sulfur and activated carbon in the furnace at the initial sulfur-to-carbon ratio (SCR) ranging from 4:1 to 1:2 showed similar adsorptive behavior in a fixed-bed system. Maintaining a stagnant inert atmosphere during the impregnation process improves sulfur deposition resulting in the enhanced dynamic capacity of the adsorbent when compared to other sulfur impregnated carbons. The fate of spent adsorbents was assessed using a toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP). Although mercury concentration in all leachates was below the TCLP limit, virgin activated carbon lost a significant fraction of the adsorbed elemental mercury during storage, while no loss was observed for sulfur-impregnated carbons. This finding suggests that virgin activated carbon may not be appropriate adsorbent for permanent sequestration of anthropogenic elemental mercury emissions.","","","Univ. of Pittsburgh, PA (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1 Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 483-488","","","FG22-96PC96212","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200021%%70","10.1021/es9813008","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20026690","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20026690","","Environmental Science and Technology","3","34"

When cracks are found in these components, weld repair is often employed to ensure continued operation. The efficacy of the weld repairs in terms of extending the life of the aged components has, however, not been documented quantitatively. The Electric Power Research institute (EPRI) has recently undertaken a comprehensive study to evaluate weld repairs performed to aged piping. In connection with this study, results from other worldwide activities have been reviewed, leading to significant conclusions regarding weld repair. this review of results from several worldwide studies has confirmed that aged high-temperature piping can be successfully weld repaired to gain additional lives in excess of several decades. The key aspects of successful weld repair include excavation and removal of all prior creep cavitation damage, elimination of external bending stresses, and implementation of good welding practice. From merely a creep rupture point of view, postweld heat treatment (PWHT) has been concluded to be superfluous by several authors. Temperbead repairs appear to offer a promising alternative to PWHT repairs from a creep, tensile, and toughness standpoint. Choice of the repair process ultimately is dictated by many considerations such as toughness, notch sensitivity, residual stresses and hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. Several reports suggest that gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) repairs may outperform shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) repairs with or without PWHT.","","","Electric Power Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference, Boston, MA (US), 08/01/1999--08/05/1999; Other Information: PBD: Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 76-85","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-9930; JPVTAS; TRN: IM200022%%7","10.1115/1.556154","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030381","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","1","122"

Two mild extraction methods (42-d equilibration with ion-exchange resins; 2-d equilibration with pH 4.8 buffered nutrient solution) and analysis of nutrient data by the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) were tested with 29 fly ash samples, four biosolids samples, and their mixtures. The resin method was useful for major nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) extraction from fly ashes and organic materials, particularly where mineralizable fractions of N and P under aerobic conditions are required. However, resins were inefficient in extracting P from high-Fe sewage sludges because organic waste samples caused premature failure of semipermeable membranes and fouling of resins. Extraction of fly ash with dilute buffered nutrient solution was more successful because micronutrient recovery was improved, major nutrients were correlated to the resin method, both addition and removal of nutrients were recorded. DRIS analysis was possible, and equilibration was rapid (2 d). The overall nutrient supply from these extremely variable fly ashes was: Cu = Fe {approx} B {approx} Mo &gt; Ca &gt; S &gt; Zn &gt;&gt; Mn &gt; N &gt; Mg &gt; P &gt; K (high micronutrient, low major nutrient supply).

In mixtures of fly ash with 26% sewage sludge the order was: Ca &gt; S &gt; N &gt; Mg &gt; P &gt; K, while in mixtures of fly ash and 13% poultry manure, the nutrients ranked: Ca &gt; K {approx} N {approx} S &gt; Mg &gt; P.

Part 1 reports on discrete-passage diffusers, while Part 2 describes a test of a straight-channel diffuser designed for equivalent duty. Two builds of discrete-passage diffuser were tested, with 30 and 38 separate passages. Both the 30 and 38 passage diffusers investigated showed comparable range of unstalled operation and similar level of overall diffuser pressure recovery. The paper concentrates on the influence of inlet flow conditions on the pressure recovery and operating range of radial diffusers for centrifugal compressor stages. The flow conditions examined include diffuser inlet Mach number, flow angle, blockage, and axial flow nonuniformity. The investigation was carried out in a specially built test facility, designed to provide a controlled inlet flow field to the test diffusers. The facility can provide a wide range of diffuser inlet velocity profile distortion and skew with Mach numbers up to unity and flow angles of 63 to 75 deg from the radical direction. The consequences of different averaging methods for the inlet total pressure distributions, which are needed in the definition of diffuser pressure recovery coefficient for nonuniform diffuser inlet conditions, were also assessed. The overall diffuser pressure recovery coefficient, based on suitably averaged inlet total pressure, was found to correlate well with the momentum-averaged flow angle into the diffuser. It is shown that the generally accepted sensitivity of diffuser pressure recovery performance to inlet flow distortion and boundary layer blockage can be largely attributed to inappropriate quantification of the average dynamic pressure at diffuser inlet. Use of an inlet dynamic pressure based on availability or mass-averaging in combination with definition of inlet flow angle based on mass average of the radial and tangential velocity at diffuser inlet removes this sensitivity.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., Cambridge, MA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 43rd International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-9","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0889-504X; JOTUEI; TRN: IM200019%%47","10.1115/1.555418","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20020622","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20020622","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","122"

The paper describes tests of a straight-channel type diffuser, sometimes called a wedge-vane diffuser, and compares the results with those from the discrete-passage diffusers described in Part 1. Effects of diffuser inlet Mach number, flow angle, blockage, and axial flow nonuniformity on diffuser pressure recovery and operating range are addressed. The straight-channel diffuser investigated has 30 vanes and was designed for the same aerodynamic duty as the discrete-passage diffuser described in Part 1. The ranges of the overall pressure recovery coefficients were 0.50--0.78 for the straight-channel diffuser and 0.50--0.70 for the discrete-passage diffuser, except when the diffuser was choked. In other words, the maximum pressure recovery of the straight-channel diffuser was found to be roughly 10% higher than that of the discrete-passage diffuser investigated. The two types of diffuser showed similar behavior regarding the dependence of pressure recovery on diffuser inlet flow angle and the insensitivity of the performance to inlet flow field axial distortion and Mach number. The operating range of the straight-channel diffuser, as for the discrete-passage diffusers, was limited by the onset of rotating stall at a fixed momentum-averaged flow angle into the diffuser, which was for the straight-channel diffuser, {alpha}{sub crit} = 70 {+-} 0.5 deg.

This enables the blades to be maintained at nearly uniform temperature without detailed knowledge of the heat flux to the blades, and makes operation feasible at higher combustion temperatures using a wider range of materials than is possible in conventional gas turbines with air cooling. The new enabling technology for such cooling is the return-flow cascade, which extends to the rotating blades the heat flux capability and self-regulation usually associated with heat-pipe technology. In this paper the potential characteristics of gas turbines that use vaporization cooling are outlined briefly, but the principal emphasis is on the concept of the return-flow cascade.

It is thought that the HVOF sprayed MCrAlY (M is Fe, Ni and/or Co) coatings can be applied to provide resistance against oxidation and corrosion to the hot parts of gas turbines. Also, it is well known that the thicker coating can be sprayed in comparison with any other thermal spraying systems due to improved residual stresses. However, thermal and mechanical properties of HVOF coatings have not been clarified. Especially, the characteristics of residual stress, that are the most important property from the view point of production technique, have not been made clear. In this paper, the mechanical properties of HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coatings were measured in both the case of as-sprayed and heat-treated coatings in comparison with a vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings. It was confirmed that the mechanical properties of HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coatings could be improved by a diffusion heat treatment to equate the vacuum plasma sprayed MCrAlY coatings. Also, the residual stress characteristics were analyzed using a deflection measurement technique and a X-ray technique. The residual stress of HVOF coating was reduced by the shot-peening effect comparable to that of a plasma spray system in open air. This phenomena could be explained by the reason that the HVOF sprayed MCrAlY coating was built up by poorly melted particles.","","","Toshiba Corp., Kawasaki, Kanagawa (JP)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 43-49","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200015%%270","10.1115/1.483173","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015451","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","122"

Development in combustion technology has, however, during recent years focused on decreasing emissions of particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides. In addition, combustion also includes a potential risk for emission of trace metals. Due to the fact that many trace elements have been identified as having a negative effect on human health and the natural environment, they have received special attention from a regulatory point of view. This paper describes a simple method for predicting the fate of eight trace elements (As, Cd, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, V, and Zn) in combustion processes. Using the fuel composition and power plant operating conditions, the trace element concentrations in various ashes and the flue gas are determined. The method, which is based on a global equilibrium approach, describes the overall behavior of the eight trace elements successfully. Distribution/partitioning of the trace elements between the bottom ash, fly ash, and the flue gases is described and compared to measured data from a full-scale coal-fired power plant burning bituminous coal. The outcome from the prediction is actual concentrations of trace elements in main power plant streams.","","","Abo Akademi Univ., Turku (FI)","","","United States","1999-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4508-4513","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: IM200008%%190","10.1021/es990243v","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006583","","Environmental Science and Technology","24","33"

In this paper, the authors present a new damage function model that synthesizes previous efforts and refines components that have been associated with variations in impact estimates. Their model focuses on end-use emissions and quantified the direct human health impacts of criteria air pollutants. To compare their model to previous efforts and to evaluate potential policy applications, the authors assess the impacts of an oil and natural gas-fueled cogeneration power plant in Boston, MA. Impacts under baseline assumptions are estimated to be $0.007/kWh of electricity, $0.23/klb of steam, and $0.004/ton-h of chilled water (representing 2--9% of the market value of outputs). Impacts are largely related to ozone (48%) and particulate matter (42%). Addition of upstream emissions and nonpublic health impacts increases externalities by as much as 50%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the importance of plant siting, meteorological conditions, epidemiological assumptions, and the monetary value placed on premature mortality as well as the potential influence of global warming. Comparative analyses demonstrate that their model provides reasonable impact estimates and would therefore be applicable in a broad range of policy settings.","","","Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA (US)","","","United States","1999-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 15 Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 4364-4372","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: US0000713","10.1021/es990634+","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006567","","Environmental Science and Technology","24","33"

The environmental impact and the elimination of pollution agents has become a prime necessity in waste digestion. Furthermore, plants in which the production of electrical power by means of burnt gases produced in the digestion process have been designed and built. In this field an MHD integration plant could be very attractive. This feasibility study has been developed by simulating an ideal plant with a plastic incinerator, an MHD device and conventional steam turbines.

To ensure operational reliability, it is essential to know whether or not water has permeated the insulation, and if so, to determine accurately the degree of deterioration. The authors have developed a capacitance measuring robot which enables measurement near the stator core end without removing the rotor, and confirmed good results in the field. The robot travelling along the retaining ring can be accurately positioned, and measured capacitances are stable and reproducible. The robot minimizes the extent of disassembly and reassembly, thus greatly reducing the out-of-operation period. Further, because the insulation condition can be accurately determined through its periodical use, the authors believe that it will contribute to both preventing accidents and assuring generators with high reliability.","","","Toshiba Corp., Yokohama (JP)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1366-1371","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9383; ITCNE4; TRN: IM200032%%139","10.1109/60.815074","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20080374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20080374","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","4","14"

Major features that influence the utilization of each fly ash for zeolite synthesis are evidenced, and several fly ash types were selected as potential high-quality starting material for zeolite synthesis and ceramic applications. The main parameters influencing this selection were relatively small grain size; high Al and Si contents; high glass content; low CaO, S, and Fe contents; and relatively low heavy metal concentration. The Compostilla and Cou He fly ashes have high potential applications because of the low content of major impurities (such as Ca, Fe, and S) and the low content of soluble hazardous elements. The Espiel, Escucha, Los Barrios, As Pontes, Soto de Ribera, Meirama, Narcea, and Teruel fly ashes have important application potential, but this potential is slightly limited by the intermediate content of nonreactive impurities, such as Fe and Ca. The La Robla fly ash is of moderate interest, since the relatively high Ca and Fe oxide contents may reduce its potential applications. Finally, the Puertollano fly ash also has limited application because of the very high concentration of some heavy metals such as As, Cd, Ge, Hg, Pb, and Zn. From a mineralogical point of view, the Compostilla, Espiel, and Soto de Ribera fly ashes show the highest aluminum-silicate glass content and, consequently, the highest industrial application potential.","","","CSIC, Barcelona (ES)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 883-898","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; EGYSAO; TRN: IM200007%%300","10.1080/00908319950014263","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006244","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006244","","Energy Sources","10","21"

While the mass and optical properties of emissions are needed for these studies, the available measurements do not characterize the low-technology burning that is thought to contribute a large fraction of light-absorbing material to the global budget. The authors have measured characteristics of particulate matter (PM) emitted from a small, low-technology lignite-burning plant. The PM emission factor is comparable to those used to calculate emission inventories of light-absorbing particles. However, the fine fraction, the absorbing fraction, and the absorption efficiency of the emissions are substantially below assumptions that have been made in inventories of black carbon emissions and calculations of climate forcing. The measurements suggest that nonblack, light-absorbing particles are emitted from low-technology coal burning. As the burning rate increases, the emitted absorption cross-section decreases, and the wavelength dependence of absorption becomes closer to that of black particles.","","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (US)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 21; Other Information: PBD: 1 Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 3887-3891","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-936X; ESTHAG; TRN: US0000114","10.1021/es9810538","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20000717","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20000717","","Environmental Science and Technology","21","33"

To achieve this goal, a semiclosed-loop gas turbine cycle using an highly-enriched CO{sub 2} mixture as working fluid was adopted. As the oxidizer, the syngas combustion utilizes oxygen produced by an air separation unit. Combustion gases mainly consist of CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O: after expansion, heat recovery and water condensation, a part of the exhausts, highly concentrated in CO{sub 2}, can be easily extracted, compressed and liquefied for storage or disposal. A detailed discussion about the configuration and the thermodynamic performance of these plants is the aim of the paper. Proper attention was paid to: (i) the modelization of the gasification section and of its integration with the power cycle, (ii) the optimization of pressure ratio due the change of the cycle working fluid, (iii) the calculation of the power consumption of the auxiliary equipment, including the compression train of the separated CO{sub 2} and the air separation unit. The resulting overall efficiency is in the 38--39% range, with status-of-the-art gas turbine technology, but resorting to a substantially higher pressure ratio. The extent of modifications to the gas turbine engine, with respect to commercial units, was therefore discussed. Relevant modifications are needed, but not involving changes in the technology. A second plant scheme will be considered in the second part of the paper, using air for syngas combustion and a physical absorption process to separate CO{sub 2} from nitrogen-rich exhausts.

The idea behind this proposal is to overcome the major drawbacks of the previous solution (large oxygen consumption and re-design of the gas turbine unit), by means of a semiclosed cycle using air as the oxidizer. Consequently, combustion gases are largely diluted by nitrogen and cannot be simply compressed to produce liquefied CO{sub 2} for storage or disposal. However, CO{sub 2} concentration remains high enough to make separation possible by a physical absorption process. It requires a re-pressurization of the flow subtracted from the cycle, with relevant consequences on the plant energy balance. The configuration and the thermodynamic performance of this plant concept are extensively addressed in the paper. As in the first part, the influence of the pressure ratio is discussed, but values similar to the ones adopted in commercial heavy-duty machines provide here acceptable performance. Proper attention was paid to the impact of the absorption process on the energy consumption. The resulting net overall efficiency is again in the 38--39% range, with assumptions fully comparable to the ones of Part A. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the present scheme enables the use of unmodified machines, but large additional equipment is required for exhausts treatment and CO{sub 2} separation.

Strain accommodation of the TBC is not attained by plastic deformation, but by means of crack initiation, crack opening, crack propagation or sliding of adjacent crack faces. In technical applications a distinction is made between tolerated or desired cracks perpendicular to the surface, and detrimental cracks parallel to the substrate-coating interface. Thus, TBC can respond to creep deformation by segmentation or spallation, the latter being referred to as failure. The parameters influencing the probability of either segmentation or spallation are temperature, creep rate, magnitude of creep deformation, layer thickness, and microstructure of the TBC. It can be stated that spallation failure probability increases with increasing creep rate, creep deformation, and layer thickness. The presence of pores between single spraying layers also strongly augments the likelihood of spallation. No significant influence of temperature on spallation failure probability can be found in the range from 850 C to 1,050 C. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy investigation show that the microstructure of the ceramic TBC changes during creep, and that the density of cracks detected on micrographs with low magnification (x50) increases with increasing creep deformation. On the other hand, the density of microcracks visible with high magnification (x500) is constant, or even decreases with increasing creep deformation. These findings are explained by sintering processes enabled by stress relaxation due to formation of macroscopic cracks perpendicular to the surface as a response to creep deformation. A relationship between microstructural changes and the emission of signals recorded during creep is presented.","","","Univ. of Karlsruhe (DE)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 678-682","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%163","10.1115/1.2818525","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","20006107","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006107","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

Prolonged periods of use at high temperatures may cause creep deformation and the assessment of damage can give large financial savings.

This paper describes a material interrogation (metallographic) technique for creep strain assessment in SX alloys. Creep tests have been performed at 950 C on the SX alloy CMSX-4 and quantitative microstructural studies performed on specimens interrupted at various levels of strain. It was found that the strengthening {gamma}{prime}-particles, initially cuboidal in shape, coalesced to form large plates or rafts normal to the applied stress. The rafts reached their maximum length before 2% strain, but continued to thicken with increasing strain. Although of different dimensions, the aspect ratios (length/thickness ratio) of the gamma-prime rafts and gamma plates were similar at similar levels of strain, increasing from {approximately} 1 at zero strain to a maximum of {approximately} 3 at about 1--2% strain. Analysis of microstructural measurements from rafting studies on SX alloys presented in the literature showed that the aspect ratios of the {gamma} and {gamma}{prime}-phases were similar and that at a temperature of 950--1,000 C a maximum length/thickness ratio of about 2.5--3.5 is reached at 1 to 2% creep strain. Measurement of gamma-prime raft or (or gamma plate) dimensions on longitudinal sections of blades is thus a suitable method for high temperature creep damage assessment of SX alloys.","","","Vattenfall Energisystem AB, Stockholm (SE)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition, Stockholm (SE), 06/02/1998--06/05/1998; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 683-686","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%164","10.1115/1.2818526","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","20006108","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006108","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

The model is based on the Eulerian-Eulerian concept, in which Eulerian conservation equations are solved both for the gas and the particulate phases. A NO{sub x} formation and destruction submodel is used to calculate the local concentration of NO. The model is used to simulate a range of operating conditions in an actual, 350 MW, arch-fired boiler, with the aim of reducing, using primary measures, the emissions of NO{sub x}. The model results shed some light on the relevant NO{sub 2}-formation mechanisms under the several operating conditions. Furthermore, they correlate well quantitatively with the available field measurements at the plant, and reproduce satisfactorily the tendencies observed under the different operating modes.","","","Univ. of Zaragoza (ES)","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 735-740","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0742-4795; JETPEZ; TRN: IM200007%%170","10.1115/1.2818534","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","20006114","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006114","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","121"

The effects of total pressure, H{sub 2}S partial pressure (2--5 kPa), reaction temperature, CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2} partial pressures, particle size (16--200 {micro}m), and CaCO{sub 3} surface area on the extent of H{sub 2}S removal and solid conversion are determined. The gasifier pressure is found to have a negative effect on the sulfidation reaction. The sulfidation reaction is first order with respect to H{sub 2}S partial pressure. The conversion data of the sulfidation reaction are analyzed using the grain model, with the overall reaction rate being controlled by chemical reaction at the interface and by diffusion controlled with an apparent activation energy of about 48.7 kcal/mol.

For effective rehabilitation of ash ponds, densification of the slurry deposit is essential to increase the bearing capacity and to improve its resistance to liquefaction. Extensive field trials were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of deep blasting for densification of deposited fly ash. Ninety explosions comprising 15 single blasts, with varying depths and quantities of charges, and 3 group blasts, each having 25 charges placed at various spacings, were carried out. The compaction achieved in terms of an increase in relative density was evaluated from surface settlement measurements. Extensive field monitoring was undertaken through pore-water pressure measurements, vibration measurements, penetration tests, and block vibration tests. For the average charge of 2--4 g of explosive per cubic meter of untreated deposit, the average relative density was found to improve from 50% to 56--58%. Analysis of the test results indicates that deep blasting may be an effective technique for modest compaction of loose fly ash deposits. The field testing program presented in this paper provides valuable information that can be used for planning blast densification of fly ash deposits.","","","","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 889-899","","","","Journal ID: JGGEFK; ISSN 1090-0241; TRN: IM9946%%516","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1999)125:10(889)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","697130","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/697130","","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","10","125"

The desired strategies present a predetermined number of appropriate planning alternatives, which should be selected from a vast initial set in accordance with the given multiple criteria. These multiple criteria, caused by considering environmental criteria (such as SO{sub 2}, NO{sub x}, and particulate emissions minimization) together with economic and other criteria, make multicriteria analysis a cornerstone of the proposed approach. The proposed multicriteria analysis includes determining a criteria assessment vector for each initial alternative and multicriteria optimization of a set of such initial criteria assessment vectors. The basic issue of this article is to reflect development of calculation models for the environmental criteria (to create the criteria assessment vectors) together with appropriate environmental investigations. Suitable solution methodology and software, applied to the conditions prevailing in Israel, have been developed for the proposed approach.","","","","","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 687-704","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9946%%518","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","697132","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/697132","","Energy Sources","8","21"

The combustion was carried out in a laboratory scale plant at different combustion conditions: temperature, percentage of oxygen excess, and total air flow. PAH associated on the particulate matter have been analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy in the synchronous mode (FS) after PM extraction by sonication with dimethylformamide (DMF). It can be concluded that there is not a direct relationship between the OM content and the PAH supported in the PM emitted. In addition, neither PM or OM show dependence between themselves.","","","","","","United States","1999-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: 15 Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3177-3184","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: 99:010339","10.1021/es990241a","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687356","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687356","","Environmental Science and Technology","18","33"

Key factors affecting the magnitude and types of toxic releases for individual power plants also are discussed. A national projection suggests that the magnitude of electric utility industry releases will surpass those of the manufacturing industries which current report to the TRI.

Heat balances along the tubes are performed that account for convective heat transfer on both sides of the tubes, radiative transfer on the outer side, and fouling resistance.

Entry of nonutilities into the industry and the emergence of stranded costs are two major changes that are shown to have an impact on the market for allowances and the industry`s incentives to switch to cleaner fuels. The degree of impact depends on the extent to which consumers bypass traditional utilities and buy from entrants, and on public utility commission policies regarding the recovery of stranded costs. In turn, the amount of stranded costs depends on fuel switching. The results follow from simulations of a two-utility model that illustrate the qualitative effects of changing policies.","","","","","","United States","1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 195-214","","","","Journal ID: JEEMDI; ISSN 0095-0696; TRN: 99:010350","10.1006/jeem.1999.1087","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","687375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/687375","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","2","38"

AAC is unique among construction materials in combining excellent thermal resistance and thermal inertia. Generally, low-density construction materials do not provide good thermal inertia, while heavier ones commonly have poor thermal resistance. Five different 10.2 cm (4 in.) AAC samples made from US electric utility fly ash as the silica source, along with three 10.2 cm (4 in.) conventional building material specimens, were tested for thermal inertia properties. Three primary issues addressed by these experiments were: (1) to develop and compare AAC thermal inertia to conventional building materials; (2) to document differences in thermal inertia characteristics of the AAC blocks produced by the various utilities; and (3) to determine if a periodic heat flow model using the thermal inertia approach adequately predicts the observed thermal inertia parameters of a material. A theoretical periodic heat flow model in the literature for thermal inertia did an adequate job of predicting the observed thermal inertia parameters for the AAC and conventional construction samples.","","","","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 59-75","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9941%%155","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1999)125:2(59)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","680114","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/680114","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","125"

"Acoustic sensitivities of lean-premixed fuel injectors in a single nozzle rig","Kendrick, D W; Anderson, T J; Sowa, W A; Snyder, T S","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES; COMBUSTORS; NOISE POLLUTION CONTROL; COMBUSTION CONTROL; NOZZLES; MIXING; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS","An experimental and numerical investigation into the attenuation of combustion induced pressure oscillations in a single nozzle rig was undertaken at the United Technologies Research Center. Results from these investigations indicated a high combustor exit Mach number, similar to that used in a gas turbine engine, was required to correctly simulate the combustor dynamics and evaluate acoustic characteristics of lean premixed fuel injectors. Comparisons made between aerodynamically stabilized and bluff-body stabilized nozzles and the use of premixed and diffusion pilots showed that small levels of diffusion piloting behind a bluff-body yielded the best acoustic/emission performance. Their success is due to increased flame stabilization (superior anchoring ability), which reduced flame motion and thermal/acoustic coupling. For cases where diffusion piloting was not present, both designs exhibited similar dynamical behavior. Increases in the combustor exit Mach number and reductions in the inlet air temperature were shown to degrade acoustic performance of both nozzle designs. The bluff-body configuration with small levels of diffusion piloting, however, was found to be less sensitive to these changes when compared to its aerodynamic counterpart.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) turbo expo `98 - land, sea, air, Stockholm (Sweden), 2-5 Jun 1998; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 429-436","","CONF-980615-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9939%%99","10.1115/1.2818491","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","678043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/678043","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","121"
"Collection and thermal evolution behaviors of different mercury species captured with gold","Aeschliman, D B; Norton, G A","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; WASTE MANAGEMENT; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; MERCURY; METHYLMERCURY; GOLD; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; FLUE GAS; COAL","The effects of temperature on the collection and evolution of different mercury (Hg) species captured with gold were investigated to help determine if temperature control could be used to provide Hg speciation information in gaseous effluents. Elemental mercury, dimethyl mercury, and mercuric chloride were loaded onto a gold trap (one Hg species per test) at temperatures of 25--375 C. The Hg was then evolved (in argon) at 900 C. In other tests, Hg was loaded onto the trap at 25 C and then heated (in argon) at 50--1,000 C to release Hg. The argon streams were analyzed using cold vapor atomic fluorescence to obtain information on Hg collection and evolution as a function of temperature. The Hg was released from the gold entirely as elemental mercury, regardless of the Hg species collected. Temperatures of about 250 C were required to release the Hg, and there were no differences among Hg species with respect to the temperatures necessary to evolve the Hg. Results of the tests on Hg collection efficiency versus the temperature of the gold trap indicated that proper selection of the collection temperature could potentially be used to provide Hg speciation information. However, refinements in the technique are necessary before it can be put into practical use.","","","","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 13; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jul 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2278-2283","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: IM9939%%124","10.1021/es981030t","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","678068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/678068","","Environmental Science and Technology","13","33"

This combustor is composed of a burner system and a ceramic liner behind the burner system. The burner system consist of 6 catalytic combustor segments and 6 premixing nozzles, which are arranged in parallel and alternately. The ceramic liner is made up of the layer of outer metal wall, ceramic fiber, and inner ceramic tiles. Fuel flow rates for the catalysts and the premixing nozzles are controlled independently. Catalytic combustion temperature is controlled under 1000 C, premixed gas is injected from the premixing nozzles to the catalytic combustion gas and lean premixed combustion over 1300 C is carried out in the ceramic liner. This system was designed to avoid catalytic deactivation at high temperature and thermal and mechanical shock fracture of the honeycomb monolith of catalyst. A combustor for a 10 MW class, multican type gas turbine was tested under high pressure conditions using LNG fuel. Measurements of emission, temperature, etc. were made to evaluate combustor performance under various combustion temperatures and pressures.

"Influence of design and operation parameters on bag-cleaning performance of pulse-jet baghouse","Lu, H C; Tsai, C J","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FLY ASH; WASTE MANAGEMENT; BAGHOUSES; DESIGN; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; OPERATION; PERFORMANCE TESTING","In this study, a filter test system with clean new fabric bags was used to measure the pulse pressure and acceleration of the filter bag. Fabric acceleration and pulse pressure were used as an index of bag-cleaning intensity. The jet pump curves, which relate the flow rate through the venturi to the average developed pressure by the venturi, were determined by the similar system. The intersection of the jet pump curve and the bag operating line, which relates the pressure drop to flow rate across the bag during pulse-jet cleaning, is the system operating point that was used to predict the average pulse pressure can be achieved without the venturi at the top of the bag for bag materials with low resistance coefficient. For bags with higher resistance coefficients, higher pulse pressure is obtained with a venturi installed at the top of the bag. The predicted pressure values are in good agreement with experimental data. Dimensional analysis for jet pump performance was developed to reduce the experimental data. The results show that the jet pump curves obtained under different operating conditions can be reduced to the same nondimensional curve, which can be used to facilitate the design and operation of a pulse-jet cleaning system.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 583-588","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: IM9930%%53","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1999)125:6(583)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354312","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354312","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","6","125"

In this study, the separate addition of lime, Portland cement and cement kiln dust to a Class F and a Class C fly ash has been investigated as a possible remediation treatment to remove undesirable elements from the leachates. Leach tests without additives at several water/solid ratios revealed levels of B, Cr, Mo and SO{sub 4} above drinking water standards. A marked reduction in all these elements occurred at 3:1, 6:1 and 20:1 water/solid ratios with a 20 mass% addition of lime or cement. Reductions were more pronounced for the Class F than for the Class C fly ash. The mineralogical and chemical composition of fly ash influences its behavior with respect to the additive treatment. In this study, an anionic clay (hydrocalumite) is formed in considerable quantity in the Class F fly ash treated with lime; and can accommodate anions like borate, chromate and molybdate into its interlayer region. With Class C fly ash, the lime-treatment generates hydrogarnet, which has less sites for anion substitution; and ettringite, which has less preference for chromate and molybdate than hydrocalumite. The overall order of improvement in fly ash leachate water quality with additive treatment was lime > OPC > CKD.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 221-231","","","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9921%%8","10.1016/S0956-053X(99)00052-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","343545","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343545","","Waste Management","3","19"

The used oil-fuel ash (OFA) had a high percentage of magnesium compounds because of magnesium oxide addition for removing slag and ashes from boilers and pipes. Several studies had been carried out on stabilization of toxic metals also occurring in oil-fuel ashes (particularly vanadium and nickel), by mixing with coal fly ashes and cement. In this case, the presence of magnesium compounds in the composition of the studied oil-fuel ashes could alter the mechanical and chemical properties of the cement matrix in fresh and hardened mortar and concrete. The authors present here the chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization of oil-fuel ashes and the behavior of Portland cement mortars incorporating high amounts of these oil-fuel ashes. The study includes workability, water demand, setting time, expansion and compressive strength developments. Preliminary results demonstrate a high absorption of water by oil-fuel ash particles, which promotes an increase in the water/cement ratio for a given workability. Acceleration of Portland cement/oil-fuel ash particles, which promotes an increase in the water/cement ratio for a given workability. Acceleration of Portland cement/oil-fuel ash pastes setting times was observed, due to the presence of carbonates. On the other hand, no significant expansion in specimens due to the presence of magnesium compounds was detected and, consequently, mechanical properties of hardened mortars containing oil-fuel ashes did not decrease with curing time. Compressive strengths for mortars containing OFA were much lower, however, than control mortar samples.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-7","","","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9921%%16","10.1016/S0956-053X(98)00079-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","343553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/343553","","Waste Management","1","19"

The combustion of these fuels, used as an energy source in many power plants, results in the formation of many nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}). Density functional theory and ab initio calculations were carried out to investigate the pyrolysis mechanisms of pyrrole. All equilibrium and transition state structures of the proposed reaction channels were fully optimized by the density functional B3LYP method using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Relative energies were evaluated at the QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. In addition to the mechanism proposed in experimental studies, alternative unimolecular pathways for the formation of cis-crotonitrile and allyl cyanide, major nitrogen-containing isomerization products, were proposed and investigated. The results suggest that a mechanism proposed in the present study is more likely responsible for the formation of allyl cyanide. For the formation of cis-crotonitrile, a mechanism proposed in the present study should also be competitive, especially under low-pressure conditions.

The kinetics of pyrolysis of pyrrole have been investigated theoretically by ab initio quantum chemical techniques and by detailed chemical kinetic modeling of previously reported experimental results. The overall kinetics can be successfully modeled by a 117 step kinetic model that gives good agreement with temperature profiles of major products and also provides an acceptable fit for minor products. The thermochemistry and rate parameters of a number of key reactions have been obtained by ab initio calculations carried out at CASSCF, CASPT2, and G2(MP2) levels of theory. Several reaction pathways were investigated. The major product, HCN, arises principally from a hydrogen migration in pyrrole to form a cyclic carbene with the NH bond intact. Ring scission of this carbene leads to an allenic imine precursor of HCN and propyne. This is the decomposition pathway of lowest energy. Pyrolysis is preceded by the facile tautomerization of pyrrole to 2H-pyrrolenine. The latter can undergo CN fission to form an open chain biradical species, which is the precursor of the butenenitrile isomeric products, cis- and trans-crotononitrile and allyl cyanide. The biradical can also undergo facile H-fission to form cyanoallyl radical, which is an important precursor of acetylene, acetonitrile, and acrylonitrile, H{sub 2} also arises principally from H-fission of the biradical.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: 20 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3923-3934","","","","Journal ID: JPCAFH; ISSN 1089-5639; TRN: IM9927%%115","10.1021/jp984358h","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","351590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351590","","Journal of Physical Chemistry A: Molecules, Spectroscopy, Kinetics, Environment, amp General Theory","20","103"

The partially zeolitized fly ashes were dried overnight in air at room temperature and then characterized using X-ray diffraction and SEM. On occasion, a few samples were dried to constant weight for an additional 8--10 min in a microwave oven to remove bound water as well. The dried samples were evaluated for their ability to adsorb sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) from a simulated stack gas containing {approximately}1000 ppm SO{sub 2}. Determinations were made in real time using a UV/vis spectrophotometer followed by a total sulfur analysis of the loaded samples once testing was complete. Breakthrough curves indicate that the zeolites in the samples are able to remove all of the SO{sub 2} in the simulated flue gas (zero SO{sub 2} emission) for varying periods of time, and that the actual amount of SO{sub 2} removed by the zeolite depended on the type and degree of dryness of the zeolite or zeolite-like material present. For example, a 7 day 150 C cured sample containing analcime and dodalite was able to adsorb 6--7 mg of SO{sub 2} per gram of sample regardless of the source of the fly ash, whereas a 90 C cured sample containing X, Y, and Na-P1 was significantly less efficient.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: 1 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1464-1469","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: IM9930%%91","10.1021/es9802091","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354350","","Environmental Science and Technology","9","33"

The efficient functioning of an ESP normally means minimizing power consumption and maximizing dust collection. Several control strategies can be adopted to meet this broad requirement. In this paper, a distributed control technique of an ESP, which uses the actual dust emission and boiler load as feedback inputs has been explained. The Electrostatic Precipitator Management System, which is a system designed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., Hyderabad, India, to meet the above control strategies using the distributed architecture to achieve efficient ESP operation is also described.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1995 IEEE/IAS international conference on industrial automation and control, January 5--7, Hyderabad (IN); PBD: May-Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 561-568","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9930%%20","10.1109/28.767002","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354279","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","3","35"

Based on the test results, the absorption and binding mechanism of fly ash on Ca{sup 2+}, Na{sup +}, OH{sup {minus}}, Cl{sup {minus}}, and Cr{sup 3+} ions were studied. The study showed that particle distribution of fly ash depends on the type of coal and its combustion conditions. The fly ashes investigated in the present investigation are formed of amorphous or glassy structures. Fly ashes also have large specific surface and special texture, and have fairly good absorption and binding capability on Ca{sup 2+}, Na{sup +}, OH{sup {minus}}, Cl{sup {minus}}, and Cr{sup 3+} ions. This conclusion is important to wide application of fly ash in the future.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environment International; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 423-432","","","","Journal ID: ENVIDV; ISSN 0160-4120; TRN: 99:010059","10.1016/S0160-4120(99)00010-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","684519","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/684519","","Environment International","4","25"

EC is believed to be a coupled phenomenon including chemical corrosion and mechanical erosion, which is dominated by piping layout, fitting geometry, and local flow structure. A new approach was proposed for investigation of EC phenomenon using local flow models, including the multidimensional, two-fluid model to simulate flow characteristics within piping and EC models to predict two-dimensional distributions of EC locations. Impacts of gravitational and centrifugal forces on two-phase flow behaviors were captured reasonably well by the current three-dimensional, two-fluid models. EC locations predicted by the proposed models showed satisfactory agreement with distributions of wear sites measured in practice. Results showed the models explained the EC phenomenon reasonably well.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 332-342","","","","Journal ID: CORRAK; ISSN 0010-9312; TRN: IM9925%%36","10.5006/1.3283995","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","349885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/349885","","Corrosion","4","55"

Small macro- and mesopore volumes were the structural properties of the sorbent related to the conversion values, with a maximum in conversion and porosity for the sorbent at a slurring time of 15 h despite the continuous increase in the specific surface area (microporosity). These results confirm that the pore size distribution and volume are the main variables which can be related to the maximum utilization of the sorbent at low temperatures. The increase in the specific surface area of the sulfated sorbents at high relative humidity (80%), due to the microporosity increase, may be explained by taking into account that the partial condensation of water can happen in the pore structure and a gas-liquid-solid reaction, with a fast nucleation step, would produce the observed microporosity increase.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1384-1390","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9922%%277","10.1021/ie980016m","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","345344","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/345344","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","38"

The concept pursued in this paper is the generation of syngas low in carbon, where most of the heating value of the coal fuel is carried by hydrogen. Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO in the syngas into CO{sub 2}, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage. Energy balances, performance, and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall ICGG power output between 350 and 400 MW. In one plant, the raw syngas exiting the gasifier is cooled in a high-temperature, radiative cooler; in the other it is quenched by the injection of liquid water. With respect to conventional Texaco IGCCs, the reduction of specific CO{sub 2} emissions by 90% reduces LHV efficiency from 5 to 7 percentage points and increases the cost of electricity of about 40%. These penalties can be reduced by accepting lower reductions of CO{sub 2} emissions. Compared to the semi-closed cycle considered by other authors, where CO{sub 2} is the main component of the gas turbine working fluid, the plants analyzed here exhibit higher efficiency over the whole range of specific CO{sub 2} emissions.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) turbo expo `98 - land, sea, air, Stockholm (Sweden), 2-5 Jun 1998; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 295-305","","CONF-980615-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9927%%158","10.1115/1.2817120","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","351633","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/351633","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","121"

Because sodium is a major contributor to fouling in low-rank coal power stations, a sodium analysis system has been developed based on this phenomenon. The analyzer is being trialed at a commercial power station over an extended period, with the response of the analyzer being correlated to station parameters such as coal quality, load, and mill availability. A normalization procedure has been adopted to reduce the analyzer`s response to boiler temperature and load changes. Qualitative results to date indicate that the analyzer response can be related to the fouling properties of the coal.","","","","","","United States","1999-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1159-1162","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9919%%221","10.1021/ie980581p","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","338605","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/338605","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","3","38"

Until now such detection has been difficult and uncertain. The technique combines collection of particles, measurement of magnetization and coercive field, and microscopy. The analysis depends on the fact that ash from iron sulfide in fossil fuels is in the form of spherical magnetite. These particles have a relatively high coercive field H{sub c}, near 135 Oe, compared with airborne particulates from soil erosion which have an H{sub c} of {approximately}35 Oe. The coercive field of any sample therefore gives an indication for the percentage of fly ash relative to the total amount of magnetic material that is airborne. The concentration of ash from a large, isolated coal burning power station is found to fall off with the distance from the source, approximately as D{sup {minus}1}. As D increases there is a drop in H{sub c}, associated with the reduced amount of fly ash relative to the airborne particulates from soil erosion.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 15 Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 528-532","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: 99:004665","10.1021/es980942s","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","330526","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330526","","Environmental Science and Technology","4","33"

These by-products could be beneficial to acidic soils because of their alkalinity and the ability of gypsum (CaSO{sub 4}{center{underscore}dot}2H{sub 2}O) to reduce Al toxicity in acidic subsoils. A 3-yr field experiment was conducted to determine the liming efficacy of a fluidized bed combustion boiler by-product (FBC) that contained 129 g Mg kg{sup {minus}1} as CaMg(CO{sub 3}){sub 2} and MgO and its effects on surface and subsurface soil chemistry. The FBC was mixed in the surface 10 cm of two acidic soils (Wooster silt loam, an Oxyaquic Fragiudalf, and Coshocton silt loam, an Aquultic Hapludalf) at rates of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 times each soil's lime requirement (LR). Soils were sampled in 10-cm increments to depths ranging from 20 to 110 cm, and corn (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were grown. Application of Mg-FBC increased alfalfa yields in all six site-years, whereas it had no effect on corn grain yield in five site-years and decreased grain yield in one site-year. Plant tissue concentrations of Mg, S, and Mo were increased by Mg-FBC, while most trace elements were either unaffected or decreased. Application of Mg-FBC at one or two times LR increased surface soil pH to near 7 within 1 wk. Although surface soil pH remained near 7 for 2 yr, there was minimal effect on subjacent soil pH. Application of Mg-FBC increased surface soil concentrations of Ca, Mg, and S, which promoted downward movement of Mg and SO{sub 4}. This had different effects on subsoil chemistry in the two soils: in the high-Ca-status Wooster subsoil, exchangeable Ca was decreased and exchangeable Al was increased, whereas in the high-Al-status Coshocton subsoil, exchangeable Al was decreased and exchangeable Mg was increased. The Mg-FBC was an effective liming material and, because of the presence of both Mg and SO{sub 4}, may be more effective than gypsum in ameliorating subsoil Al phytotoxicity.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (US)","Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; USGS; USDOE","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Agronomy Journal; Journal Volume: 91; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24-32","","","FC21-91MC28060","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-1962; AGJOAT; TRN: IM200008%%301","10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100010005x","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","20006694","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006694","","Agronomy Journal","1","91"

The acceleration of hot corrosion attack of boilers is caused by the presence of fuel ash deposits containing V, Na, and S, in the form of Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} and V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, which form low melting point phases. In addition to this, the tubes are exposed to the action of both high stresses and high temperatures, producing a continuous plastic deformation of the tube walls called creep damage. Creep rupture tests were carried out in the temperature range 620 to 670 C in static air in the presence of corrosive environments using 321H and 347H type stainless steels used in superheater and reheater tubes under hot corrosion and creep environments.

A genetic optimizer has been developed that modifies the blade profile and calculates its profile loss. This process is automatic, producing profile designs significantly faster and with significantly lower loss than has previously been possible. The optimizer developed uses a genetic algorithm to optimize a two-dimensional profile, defined using 17 parameters, for minimum loss with a given flow condition. The optimizer works with a population of two-dimensional profiles with varied parameters. A CFD mesh is generated for each profile, and the result is analyzed using a two-dimensional blade-to-blade solver, written for steady viscous compressible flow, to determine profile loss. The loss is used as the measure of a profile`s fitness. The optimizer uses this information to select the members of the next population, applying crossovers, mutations, and elitism in the process. Using this method, the optimizer tends toward the best values for the parameters defining the profile with minimum loss.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-17","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9915%%1","10.1115/1.2841220","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","330485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330485","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","121"

One approach for mercury removal, which may be relatively simple to retrofit is the injection of sorbents, such as activated carbon, upstream of existing particulate control devices. A study, sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Energy (DOE), is being conducted at the University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) to develop a sorbent-screening test protocol, screen potential mercury sorbents in a bench-scale fixed-bed system, and provide data to support efforts to model mercury capture mechanisms. A proper protocol is required to establish repeatability of the results and ensure reproducibility of results between different labs. To date, elemental mercury tests have been completed with several sorbents and under various flue gas conditions. The carbon-based sorbent used in this study was a lignite-based activated carbon (LAC). This paper presents results from the more recent tests with the LAC sorbent and elemental mercury. The LAC sorbent has also been used by others as a baseline sorbent.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Fal 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 203-208","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: IM9904%%72","10.1002/ep.670170321","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","302284","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302284","","Environmental Progress","3","17"

A study of the influence of co-firing of dry municipal sewage sludge on the behavior of the metals Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, zn during pulverized coal combustion is presented. Sewage sludge contains higher concentrations of the metals listed above than the reference coal, but a lower concentration of Cl, that enhances the volatility of many metals. Experiments were performed in a semi-industrial scale pulverized fuel combustion chamber. Ash was collected at four locations: bottom hopper, air preheater, cyclone, and bag filter. From the bottom hopper to the filter, the particle size decreased and ash particles were progressively enriched in volatile elements. Mass balances of the metals were performed and the enrichment trends on the ash collected at the different locations were calculated. Increasing the sewage sludge share in the blend caused a significant increase in the recovery rate in the solid phase. In spite of that, the calculated concentrations in the flue gas of Hg and zn increased. Sewage sludge co-firing influences the combustion process and the post-combustion environment in many ways. This study focuses on the effect of the different flue gas composition on the condensation temperature of metal species. The system was modeled by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. The results indicated that the increasing recovery of Zn might be caused by enhanced condensation and the increasing recovery of Hg by adsorption on ash particles. The increasing recovery of the other metals seemed referable to failure in vaporization and it cannot be studied with an equilibrium approach.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 6-8; Conference: International conference on incineration and thermal treatment technologies, Salt Lake City, UT (United States), 11-15 May 1998; Other Information: PBD: 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 433-444","","CONF-980513-","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: IM9923%%169","10.1016/S0956-053X(98)00127-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","347632","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/347632","","Waste Management","6-8","18"

Monolayer etch pits, multilayer (deep) etch pits, and nascent etch pits were observed for the graphite-NO reaction in different reaction temperature regimes. The formation of deep pits and nascent pits became prevalent at higher temperatures, e.g., 850 C with 1% NO. No temperature break point in the Arrhenius plot of the turnover frequency (TOF) rates was observed. The activation energy for the graphite-NO reaction was 132 kJ/mol, which was relatively low compared to literature data. Careful analysis of basal plane STM features revealed that the often-reported (by others) temperature break point in the Arrhenius plot was caused by the contribution of NO basal plane c-attack in the higher temperature range, which forms nascent etch pits and deep pits. The formation of nascent and deep pits with higher activation energies (than that for monolayer etching) contributed to the higher apparent activation energy in the high temperature range. In global rate measurements for the NO-carbon reaction, it is not possible to distinguish between the monolayer etching process and basal plane c-attack. The TOF measured by the STM method were true intrinsic rates for edge site monolayer recession. For the NO-graphite reaction, the reaction is first order with respect to NO. The NO-graphite reaction is at least 15 times faster than the O{sub 2}-graphite reaction. The NO-graphite and N{sub 2}O-graphite reactions might have the same rate-limiting step in the low temperature range, but have different rate-limiting steps in the high temperature range.","","","","","","United States","1998-12-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 180; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 245-257","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9908%%394","10.1006/jcat.1998.2268","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","316313","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316313","","Journal of Catalysis","2","180"

While the focus is particularly on coal generation technologies funded through the five phases of the Clean Coal Technology Program sponsored by the Department of Energy (DOE), the article also sheds some light on the industry debate regarding the role that coal will play in a deregulated future. Environmentalists have argued that deregulation will lead to greater utilization of older (read cheaper) coal plants, particularly in Midwestern states. Meanwhile, many believe that natural gas-fired combustion turbines will displace coal facilities. Lurking in the background to further complicate matters are emission standards pertaining to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, together with the possibility of new regulations addressing global climate change concerns.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 51-58","","","","Journal ID: ELEJE4; ISSN 1040-6190; TRN: IM9910%%48","10.1016/S1040-6190(98)00106-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","320858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/320858","","Electricity Journal","10","11"

They have widespread applications which include industrial and chemical plants, fossil and nuclear power systems, heating and cooling systems, and vehicle exhaust systems. A bellows is a component in piping systems which absorbs mechanical deformation with flexibility. Its geometry is an axially symmetric shell which consists of two toroidal shells and one annular plate or conical shell. In order to analyze the bellows, this study presents the finite element analysis using a conical frustum shell element. A finite element analysis program is developed to analyze various bellows. The formula for calculating the natural frequency of bellows is made by the simple beam theory. The formula for fatigue life is also derived by experiments. A shape optimal design problem is formulated using multiple objective optimization. The multiple objective functions are transformed to a scalar function with weighting factors. The stiffness, strength, and specified stiffness are considered as the multiple objective function. The formulation has inequality constraints imposed on the natural frequencies, the fatigue limit, and the manufacturing conditions. Geometric parameters of bellows are the design variables. The recursive quadratic programming algorithm is utilized to solve the problem.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 325-333","","","","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: 99:002608","10.1115/1.2842339","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","302330","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302330","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","4","120"

All the experiments have been carried out in a perfectly stirred reactor, operated isothermally in the temperature range 1,050--1,250 K, with stoichiometric ratios ranging between 1.0 and 1.3. It has been found that, close to the higher temperature values investigated, the NO conversion as a function of the stoichiometric ratio shows a maximum around 1.15--1.20, both in the case of pure methane and methane-ethane mixtures in the feed. Moreover, the addition of NO significantly enhances the system reactivity at the lower temperatures investigated. The ethane content in the feed plays a different role depending upon the temperature value considered. At the lowest temperatures investigated the larger the amount of ethane, the higher the NO abatement, while at the higher temperatures the methane-ethane mixtures always show a larger NO conversion than that of pure methane. However, when increasing the ethane content in the feed, the NO conversion decreases. Finally, various detailed kinetic models (with particular reference to that developed by Miller and Bowman) have been discussed and used to interpret the experimental results.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4241-4252","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9901%%97","10.1021/ie970474f","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289422","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","37"

However, many systems can consume more electrical energy than a conventional cooling plant without ice storage. This excess energy problem is illustrated in this paper by a simplified cooling plant model employed in a simulation environment that allows the assessment of the control performance of various conventional and optimal strategies. The optimal control strategy of minimizing operating cost only is introduced and subsequently is modified to allow the simultaneous consideration of operating cost and energy consumption. This proposed optimal control strategy could be valuable if ice storage systems are to stand on their own merits in a deregulated utility environment. Due to the lack of demand charges under real-time pricing, even small energy penalties and their associated excess energy cost may jeopardize the feasibility of the ice storage system.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 275-281","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9908%%206","10.1115/1.2888131","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","316126","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316126","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","120"

The physicochemical properties of the deactivated catalysts by SO{sub 2} were extensively characterized by TGA, TPSR, XPS, Raman, XANES, the measurements of surface area and elemental analysis. Not only the surface area and sulfur content of the deactivated catalysts, but their TGA and TPSR patterns strongly suggest the formation of a sulfur species as a deactivating agent on the catalyst surface. It is also observed that the sulfur species exists in the form of sulfate (SO{sub 4}{sup 2{minus}}) by XPS and Raman. It mainly causes the loss of NO removal activity of the catalysts. The sulfate species formed on the deactivated catalysts by SO{sub 2} did not significantly alter the chemical environment of the copper ions contained in the zeolite catalysts such as CuHM and CuNZA.

In the past, significant progress has been made developing low NO{sub x} and CO burners. Unfortunately, these burners often have a more pronounced tendency than conventional burner designs to produce combustion driven oscillations. The oscillations may be excited to such an extent that pronounced pulsation may possibly occur; this is associated with a risk of engine failure. The stability of a burner system can be investigated by means of a stability analysis under the assumption of acoustical behavior. The problem with all these algorithms is the transfer function of the flame. A new method is presented here to predict the dynamic flame behavior by means of a full Navier-Stokes simulation of the complex combustion process. The first step is to get a steady-state solution of a flame configuration. After that a transient simulation follows with a sudden change in the mass flow rate at the flame inlet. The time-dependent answer of the flame to this disturbance is then transformed into the frequency space by a Laplace Transformation. This leads, in turn, to the frequency response representing the dynamic behavior of the flame. In principle, this method can be adapted for both diffusion as well as premixed flame systems.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 41. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, June 10--13, 1996, Birmingham (GB); PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 713-720","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9908%%222","10.1115/1.2818458","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","316142","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316142","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","120"

In this application, the operating window of the plant has been divided into a number of smaller windows in which the nonlinear process behavior has been approximated by linear behavior. For each operating window, linear step weight models were developed from a detailed nonlinear first principles model, and the model prediction is calculated based on interpolation between these linear models.

Incidence loss was also found to be important. Rotors of 12 in. diameter were used, with two different lengths, 9 in. and 18 in., and two different passage widths, 0.25 in. and 0.54 in., in order to vary friction and opening time.

"A sorbent regenerator simulation model in copper oxide flue gas cleanup processes","Chen, Z Y; Yeh, J T","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FLUE GAS; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; COPPER OXIDES; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; ADSORBENTS; NITROGEN OXIDES; SULFUR DIOXIDE; POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT","Sorbent regeneration is an important step in copper oxide flue gas cleanup processes because poor regeneration performance could require higher sorbent circulation rate and inventory, resulting in increased process costs. An advantage of the copper oxide processes is the simultaneous removal of SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x}. The sorbent absorbs SO{sub 2} and acts as catalyst in reduction reactions for high NO{sub x} removal. Therefore, CuO processes have the potential to offer a more efficient and economical way to reduce both SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x} emissions as compared to other flue gas cleanup processes, which use two separate processes to curtail SO{sub 2} and NO{sub x}. The moving-bed process is capable of simultaneously removing 99% SO{sub 2} and 95% NO{sub x} from coal-fired combustor flue gas. This article describes a countercurrent moving-bed regenerator model using natural gas as the reducing agent. The model incorporates several aspects important for predicting the regenerator performance, such as gas expansion effects, deviation from first-order kinetics with respect to copper sulfate, and mass transfer limitations. The sorbent residence time predicted by this model is in good agreement with data obtained from the life-cycle test system at the Federal Energy Technology Center. The tests conducted include effects of reactor temperature, the methane to copper sulfate feed ratio, and sorbent residence time, on sorbent regeneration. The regenerator modeling also details the impact of gas velocity on the reactor performance.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Sum 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 61-69","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: IM9823%%170","10.1002/ep.670170210","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","642275","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/642275","","Environmental Progress","2","17"

In particular, the electromechanical behavior of the overall turbine-alternator system, with respect to the electrical interconnected grid, may be theoretically studied, by using dynamic simulation models perfected with suitable details. The control systems performances can also be easily checked and fine-tuned, in presence of small and large perturbations, both in normal and in emergency operating conditions. The simulator STAR, which has been successfully used also for the specialists training, can be effectively considered as a real turbine-alternator system. In fact its inputs may be directly connected to the interfaces of the excitation system and turbine governor; moreover, the simulator provides in output the process variables with the suitable format requested by the different control apparatuses. The paper describes the main design topics of the STAR simulator, as mainly regards its hardware and software architecture and the model framework of the turbine (steam, hydro or gas), alternator (with static and rotating exciter) and grid interconnection. The structure of the excitation control system and turbine speed governor, as well as the parameters configuration, run-time simulation, and data visualization procedures are shortly described. Finally, the STAR performances are shown through significant transient responses.","","","","","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 282-291","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9829%%139","10.1109/60.707609","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659106","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659106","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","13"

The benefits of producing gas-turbine blades from single crystal superalloys has resulted from at least two factors. Firstly, the elimination of grain boundaries from the component has increased the creep ductility by removing sites where cavities develop and has allowed the chemistry of superalloys, designed specifically for use in the single crystal form, to be free of grain boundary strengthening elements thus increasing the melting temperature and potential operating temperature. Secondly, by controlling the orientation of the single crystal casting, normally having the low modulus <001> direction parallel to the centrifugally stressed blade axis, thermal stresses are minimized and the thermal fatigue resistance is greatly enhanced. However, these advantages have been obtained at the expense of dealing with a highly anisotropic material. In order to exploit the full potential of single crystal superalloys, an effective anisotropic design strategy is required.","","","","","","United States","1998-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 39; Journal Issue: 4-5; Conference: Annual meeting of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society (TMS), San Antonio, TX (United States), 15-19 Feb 1998; Other Information: PBD: 4 Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 465-472","","CONF-980202-","","Journal ID: SCMAF7; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9826%%96","10.1016/S1359-6462(98)00223-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651140","","Scripta Materialia","4-5","39"

It uses an ultrashort laser pulse that propagates through the absorbing medium, for which the relevant absorption information resides in the free-induction decay that is trailing behind the transmitted pulse. Time gating out most of the transmitted pulse, but not the free-induction decay, enhances the relative fraction of light that contains absorption information when the spectrum is measured. This procedure reduces the background associated with the input light, thus enhancing detection sensitivity. {copyright} {ital 1998} {ital Optical Society of America}","","","","","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Optics Letters; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1289-1291","","","","Journal ID: OPLEDP; ISSN 0146-9592; TRN: 98:007559","10.1364/OL.23.001289","","2011-03-10T00:00:00Z","641520","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/641520","","Optics Letters","16","23"

A thermodynamic model presented in earlier communications is developed further. The substance-specific data required were extracted from literature and used without any further adjustment. The experimental results show that the soluble bivalent mercury (HgCl{sub 2}) is completely reduced to elemental insoluble form through sulfur dioxide, even in the presence of 0.1 M HCl (i.e., also in strongly acidic solutions).

Such effluents may pose potential human health and ecological risks. To evaluate these risks, a model was developed and applied to a time-variable release of these constituents into a river. The release pattern and dose are typical of power plants. In situ formation of chloroform is also simulated. The model is applicable to situations where chloroform is the dominant trihalomethane. Therefore, the model is limited to water with low background bromide ion concentrations. For the scenario evaluated, predicted total residual chlorine levels, expressed in terms of a hazard quotient for the protection of aquatic organisms, are above EPA criteria at locations to within approximately 5 km downstream of the discharge; excess lifetime risk to an individual exposed to predicted levels of chloroform in the river range from 5 {times} 10{sup {minus}7} to above 10{sup {minus}6}, a degree of risk that is close to levels of concern to regulatory agencies.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: PBD: 15 Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2162-2171","","","","Journal ID: ESTHAG; ISSN 0013-936X; TRN: 98:010521","10.1021/es970209l","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","655426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/655426","","Environmental Science and Technology","14","32"

All of the three options--recycling, landfilling and combustion--have some disadvantages. Even landfilling, which produces no emissions, fails to take advantage of the energy value inherent in plastic. Waste combustion, on the other hand, recovers the energy in plastic materials and reduces the volume of disposed solid waste by up to 90% of its initial preburn volumes. However, this management option generates emissions and produces an ash residue that must be managed. As demonstrated by recent test burns, improvements in combustion and air-pollution-control technology have dramatically reduced the health risks from emissions and ash. Recent studies have shown that plastics--in quantities even higher than those normally found in municipal solid waste--do not adversely affect levels of emissions or the quality of ash from waste-to-energy facilities. In addition, waste-to-energy facilities may be a relatively economical source of fuel, and may be a more economic solution to waste management than the other available options. A waste-to-energy plant generally produces electricity that is sold to the electric utilities for approximately six cents per kilowatt-hour, a rate that is competitive with those offered by nuclear power plants and power plants that generate energy by burning fossil fuels.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Scientist; Journal Volume: 86; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 364-373","","","","Journal ID: AMSCAC; ISSN 0003-0996; TRN: IM9834%%254","10.1511/1998.31.819","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","290014","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/290014","","American Scientist","4","86"

Principle factors affecting the susceptibility of rotors to SCC have been identified as disk yield strength, applied stress level, and surface film/crevice chemistry. Microstructure and cleanliness of the steel have been found to have relatively little effect. Advances in steel making and forging over the last 20 years have provided manufacturers with additional design and material options to mitigate the problem. Increases in forging size capabilities of steel companies and the welded construction of rotors now permit designing with integral and partial integral rotors that use materials with lower yield strength (more SCC resistant) as well as eliminating the SCC problem in bores and keyways. However, a recent survey of US utilities has shown that SCC in the blade attachment legion of LP rotors is an increasing concern. This problem has led to development of repair and refurbishment methods for rim attachments, especially weld buildup of rims with corrosion-resistant alloys. Life prediction of rotors under SCC conditions currently involves estimating crack growth time from assumed defects to critical size. Factors that govern the location and time of crack initiation are not understood adequately. 50 refs., 23 figs., 1 tab.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 531-545","","","","Journal ID: CORRAK; ISSN 0010-9312; TRN: 98:006845","10.5006/1.3284881","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","634555","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/634555","","Corrosion","7","54"

The fish life cycle model simulates different life stages of fish by using appropriate expressions representing growth and mortality rates. The heart of the developed modeling approach is the prediction of plant-caused reduction in total fish population by estimating recruitment to adult population with and without entrainment of ichthyoplankton and impingement of small fish. The model was applied to a local fish species, gilthead (Aparus aurata), for the case of a proposed power plant in the Aegean region of Turkey. The simulations indicate that entrainment and impingement may lead to a population reduction of about 2% to 8% in the long run. In many cases, an impact of this size can be considered rather unimportant. In the case of sensitive and ecologically values species facing extinction, however, necessary precautions should be taken to minimize or totally avoid such an impact.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 612-618","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: 98:007767","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1998)124:7(612)","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","642350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/642350","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","7","124"

The present research aims at obtaining fundamental knowledge of fuel-NO{sub x} formation characteristics by applying reaction kinetics to gas turbine conditions. An instantaneous mixing condition was assumed in the cross section of a gas turbine combustor and both gradual mixing condition and instantaneous mixing condition were assumed at secondary air inlet section. The results may be summarized as follows: (1) in the primary combustion zone under fuel rich condition, HCN and other intermediate products are formed as ammonia contained in the fuel decomposes; (2) formation characteristics of fuel-NO{sub x} are affected by the condition of secondary air mixing; and (3) the conversion ratio from ammonia to NO{sub x} declines as the pressure inside the combustor rises under the condition of gradual mixing at the secondary air inlet.

High reliability and durability must be intrinsically designed into these turbine engines to meet operating economic targets and ETOPS certification requirements. This level of performance has been brought about by a combination of advances in air cooling for turbine blades and vanes, design technology for stresses and airflow, single crystal and directionally solidified casting process improvements, and the development and use of rhenium (Re) containing high {gamma}{prime} volume fraction nickel-base superalloys with advanced coatings, including full-airfoil ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Re additions to cast airfoil superalloys not only improves creep and thermo-mechanical fatigue strength, but also environmental properties including coating performance. Re dramatically slows down diffusion in these alloys at high operating temperatures. A team approach has been used to develop a family of two nickel-base single crystal alloys (CMSX-4 containing 3% Re and CMSX-10 containing 6% Re) and a directionally solidified, columnar grain nickel-base alloy (CM 186 LC containing 3% Re) for a variety of turbine engine applications. A range of critical properties of these alloys is reviewed in relation to turbine component engineering performance through engine certification testing and service experience. Industrial turbines are now commencing to use this aero developed turbine technology in both small and large frame units in addition to aero-derivative industrial engines. These applications are demanding, with high reliability required for turbine airfoils out to 25,000 hours, with perhaps greater than 50% of the time spent at maximum power.

This paper examines the efficiency and net power output of a fluidized bed gasifier-combined cycle with flue gas drying for a range of as-received raw biomass moisture contents and levels of pregasification drying. Due to the lack of empirical data available, a modeling approach is used to simulate the effect of varying moisture content in the gasifier feed biomass. For a specified as-received biomass moisture content, drying prior to gasification increases overall efficiency, but the gains in efficiency decrease with increasing levels of drying. For a specified post-dryer gasifier feed moisture content, cycle efficiency and power output increase with decreasing as-received biomass moisture down to 30%, below which the change in cycle performance is negligible.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 455-459","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%218","10.1115/1.2818166","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","665370","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665370","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

Although the primary objective of this effort was to develop an RQL combustor with lower conversion of fuel bound nitrogen to NO{sub x} than a conventional gas turbine combustor, the RQL2 design can be readily adapted to natural gas and liquid fuel combustion. RQL2 is the culmination of a 5 year research and development effort that began with natural gas tests of a 2 in. diameter converging rich stage liner, an impingement cooled 7 in. diameter radially-stratified-quench stage, and a backward facing step at the entrance to a 10 in. diameter film cooled lean stage. The rich stage combustor liner has a novel double-walled structure with narrow circumferential cooling channels to maintain metal wall temperatures within design limits. Provisions were made to allow independent control of the air supplied to the rich and quench/lean stages. RQL2 has been fired for almost 100 hours with LHV fuel supplied by a pilot scale coal gasification and high temperature desulfurization system. At the optimum rich stage equivalence ratio NO{sub x} emissions were about 50 ppmv NH{sub 3} in the LHV fuel, this corresponds to a conversion of NH{sub 3} to NO{sub x} of about 5%. As conditions were shifted away from the optimum, RQL2 NO{sub x} emissions gradually increased until they were comparable to a standard combustor. A chemical kinetic model of RQL2, constructed from a series of ideal chemical reactors, matched the measured NO{sub x} emissions fairly well. The CO emissions were between 5 and 30 ppmv (on a dry, 15% O{sub 2} basis) under all conditions.","","","","USDOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center, WV (United States)","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 502-508","","CONF-970604-","AC21-87MC23170","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%222","10.1115/1.2818173","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","665374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665374","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

For optimization of energy systems, the environmental aspects are quantified and introduced into the objective function. In this particular work, the environomic approach is followed of the analysis and optimal design of a combined-cycle plant. In addition to the basic configuration, two alternatives for NO{sub x} abatement are studied: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and steam injection.

But even when a clean fuel such as LNG (liquefied natural gas) is used, thermal NO{sub x} is generated in the high temperature gas turbine combustion process. The NO{sub x} emission from gas turbines is controlled through selective catalytic reduction processes (SCR) in the Japanese electric industry. If catalytic combustion could be applied to the combustor of the gas turbine, it is expected to lower NO{sub x} emission more economically. Under such high temperature and high pressure conditions, as in the gas turbine, however, the durability of the catalyst is still insufficient. So it prevents the realization of a high temperature catalytic combustor. To overcome this difficulty, a catalytic combustor combined with premixed combustion for a 1,300 C class gas turbine was developed. In this method, catalyst temperature is kept below 1,000 C, and a lean premixed gas is injected into the catalytic combustion gas. As a result, the load on the catalyst is reduced and it is possible to prevent the catalyst deactivation. After a preliminary atmospheric test, the design of the combustion was modified and a high pressure combustion test was conducted. As a result, it was confirmed that NO{sub x} emission was below 10 ppm (at 16 percent O{sub 2}) at a combustor outlet gas temperature of 1,300 C and that the combustion efficiency was almost 100%. This paper presents the design features and test results of the combustor.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 41. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, June 10--13, 1996, Birmingham (GB); PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 509-513","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%167","10.1115/1.2818174","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","665320","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665320","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

The designed combustor had the following three characteristics: (1) in order to assure the stable combustion burning low-Btu gas (LBG), an auxiliary combustion chamber was installed at the entrance of the combustor; (2) to reduce fuel NO{sub x} emission that was produced from the ammonia (NH{approximately}) in the fuel, the rich-lean combustion method was introduced; and (3) to compensate for the declined cooling-air associated with the higher temperature of the gas turbine, the tested combustor was equipped with a dual-structure transition piece so that the cooling air in the transition piece can be recycled to cool down the combustor liner wall. As a result of combustor tests, it is confirmed that CO emission is less than 20 ppm, the conversion rate of NH3 which contains about 1,000 ppm in the coal gasified fuel to NO{sub x} shows 40% or below, and the liner wall temperature remained below almost 850 C under high pressure (1.4 MPa), rated load condition.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 481-487","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%219","10.1115/1.2818170","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","665371","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665371","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

These components are generally coated with either a diffusion coating (aluminide or platinum aluminide) or with an overlay coating (MCrAlY) to provide additional hot corrosion and/or oxidation protection. These coatings degrade due to inward and outward diffusion of elements during service. Outward diffusion of aluminum results in formation of a protective oxide layer on the surface. When the protective oxide spalls, aluminum in the coating diffuses out to reform the oxide layer. Accelerated oxidation and failure of coating occur when the Al content in the coating is insufficient to reform a continuous alumina film. This paper describes development of a coating life prediction model that accounts for both oxidation and oxide spallation under thermal mechanical loading as well as diffusion of elements that dictate the end of useful life. Cyclic oxidation data for aluminide and platinum aluminide coatings were generated to determine model constants. Applications of this model for predicting cyclic oxidation life of coated materials are demonstrated. Work is underway to develop additional material data and to qualify the model for determining actual blade and vane coating refurbishment intervals.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 609-704","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9830%%229","10.1115/1.2818189","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","665381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/665381","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","120"

Here the authors explore model sensitivity to some of the more important biological, physical and engineering design parameters, with particular reference to CO{sub 2} injection as a buoyant droplet plume. Uncertainty in the dose-response relationship, e.g. caused by the use of data for surface organisms, will affect predicted values of total mortality by less than a factor of two for a single point discharge from 10 standard (500 MWe) coal-fired values of total mortality by less than a factor of two for a single point discharge from 10 standard 500 MWe coal-fired electric power plants and a factor of five for a single point discharge from one standard plant. The most important design variable is the number of physically separated discharge points (diffuser ports or groups of ports) used to disperse the CO{sub 2}. Predicted mortality drops to zero as the number of discharge points per standard plants exceeds two. Finally the most important physical parameters are ambient current speed and turbulent diffusivity. As with the dose-response data, most physical oceanographic measurements have been conducted near the ocean surface. Model sensitivity suggests that a factor of 2.5 reduction in current speed or a factor of 3 reduction in ambient diffusivity, relative to the base case, would require that the number of discharge points per standard plant increase from 2 to 12 in order to avoid mortality. Thus, impacts can be strongly site-specific, and additional oceanographic measurements are needed at depths appropriate for CO{sub 2} sequestration. Nonetheless, it should be easy to design an environmentally conservative multi-point discharge system that can disperse CO{sub 2} as a droplet plume without significant mortality, even under adverse environmental conditions.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Waste Management; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 5-6; Conference: International symposium on ocean disposal of carbon dioxide, Tokyo (Japan), 31 Oct - 1 Nov 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 375-380","","CONF-9610136-","","Journal ID: WAMAE2; ISSN 0956-053X; TRN: 98:006356","10.1016/S0956-053X(97)10038-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624047","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624047","","Waste Management","5-6","17"

The key ingredients in this mix--the gas and electric industries, the financial instruments and entities that back them, and the laws and regulations that control and guide them--are in a confluence moving at warp speed. Assets are being divested or monetized. Financial products--not only reserves--are the answer to managing supply risks. Spark spreads--the financial differential between the price of gas as a commodity and gas that has been transformed into electrons--are being traded. Electric restructuring is being patterned on the template of the gas experience. Electronic bulletin boards and trading systems are linking the industries in cyberspace. And the consolidation of these industries has led to the biggest mating game in the energy industries` history, all at a fast-forward pace. Federal and state legislators and regulators swim in the same tank as the voracious entities this article discusses. Faced with unimagined combinations of players, complicated market power questions swirl around the merger and acquisition marriages. And, as the markets push ahead with new ideas, the regulators attempt to shape the process with their own proposals to influence the market of the next millennium. This article discusses some of the major moves and certain key regulatory decisions regarding these landscape-altering initiatives.","","","","","","United States","1998-06-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 96; Journal Issue: 26; Other Information: PBD: 29 Jun 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 56-60","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9819%%249","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","619659","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619659","","Oil and Gas Journal","26","96"

Its predictions are practically equivalent to those of a previous 2D model, but its numerical solution is faster by 1 order of magnitude, making it suitable for predictive control applications. The model is successfully fitted to transient NO reduction data at different temperatures, space velocities, and NH{sub 3}/NO feed ratios over two commercial SCR monolith catalysts. The data indicate characteristic times up to several minutes. The model analysis shows that: (1) SCR dynamics are determined by buildup/depletion of the catalyst NH{sub 3} coverage, which result primarily from a competition between adsorption of ammonia and its reaction with NO, the rate of NH{sub 3} desorption being markedly slower; (2) the dynamic response of NO conversion is slow compared to changes in the NH{sub 3} feed content, which is unfavorable for a feedback control system; and (3) positive/negative peaks of NO emissions vs progressive changes of the NH{sub 3} slip are predicted upon sudden load variations.","","","","","","United States","1998-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2341-2349","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9826%%147","10.1021/ie970729p","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","651191","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/651191","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","37"

Accurate prediction of the jet trajectory and temperature dilution are necessary if discharge structures are to be designed to meet the appropriate standards. A modified version of the integral Fan-Brooks model has been used to calculate the horizontal penetration of inclined thermal buoyant water jets. The classical densimetric Froude number F{sub 0} is substituted by a Froude number F{sub a} based on the thermal expansion coefficient of water. Using the above model, a new equation is derived which can predict the horizontal penetration of the thermal jet at a given Froude number F{sub a} and discharge angle.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 561-569","","","","Journal ID: IHMTDL; ISSN 0735-1933; TRN: IM9820%%41","10.1016/S0735-1933(98)00043-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624074","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624074","","International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer","4","25"

This benefit is widely recognized, but turbine developers routinely encounter problems with combustion oscillations during the testing of new premix combustors. Because of the associated pressure fluctuations, combustion oscillations must be eliminated in a final combustor design. Eliminating these oscillations is often time-consuming and costly because there is no single approach to solve an oscillation problem. Previous investigations of combustion stability have focused on rocket applications, industrial furnaces, and some aeroengine gas turbines. Comparatively little published data is available for premixed combustion at conditions typical of an industrial gas turbine. In this paper, the authors report experimental observations of oscillations produced by a fuel nozzle typical of industrial gas turbines. Tests are conducted in a specially designed combustor capable of providing the acoustic feedback needed to study oscillations. Tests results are presented for pressures up to 10 atmospheres, theoretical considerations, it is expected that oscillations can be characterized by a nozzle reference velocity, with operating pressure playing a smaller role. This expectation is compared to observed data that shows both the benefits and limitations of characterizing the combustor oscillating behavior in terms of a reference velocity rather than other engine operating parameters. This approach to characterizing oscillations is then used to evaluate how geometric changes to the fuel nozzle will affect the boundary between stable and oscillating combustion.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 42. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exhibition, Orlando, FL (United States), 2-5 Jun 1997; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 294-302","","CONF-970604-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9834%%214","10.1115/1.2818120","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","290059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/290059","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","120"

Often the calorific value of the original gas in place differs significantly from that of the stored gas. Large fluctuations in calorific value are not tolerated by most gas customers, but power plants can adapt their facilities to work with variable gas quality as long as the power they produce remains constant. Gas-storage wells feeding a power plant must be modeled with a gas-rate adjustment based on calorific-value variations. The full-field modeling study presented in this paper examines the feasibility of coupling a power plant and gas-storage facility. The economic benefits of this full-field study include minimization of gas-injection rate and optimization of infill wells.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology; Journal Volume: 50; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 136-137","","","","Journal ID: JPTJAM; ISSN 0149-2136; TRN: IM9817%%185","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","616302","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616302","","JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology","4","50"

A large part of CO{sub 2} emitted to the atmosphere originates from the combustion of fossil fuels, especially coal and petroleum. To reduce the CO{sub 2} exhaust from flue gases, several methods of CO{sub 2} separation have been proposed. Lithium zirconate powder reacts immediately with ambient CO{sub 2} in the range of 450 to 550 C. Moreover, the products react and return reversibly to lithium zirconate at temperatures above 650 C. Utilizing this reaction, the possibility of a CO{sub 2} separation system which operates at around 550 C is suggested. A CO{sub 2} separation process operable at temperatures beyond 500 C may have a special benefit, because the separation can be achieved directly during the fuel reforming process, where high CO{sub 2} concentration is expected.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Electrochemical Society; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1344-1350","","","","Journal ID: JESOAN; ISSN 0013-4651; TRN: IM9820%%276","10.1149/1.1838462","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","624306","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624306","","Journal of the Electrochemical Society","4","145"

The alloys were united directly from the molten state by centrifugal casting. In the optimum process, temperatures were controlled to prevent meltback of the SS310 outer layer by the higher melting T-11 stream. Hollow extrusion billets were prepared from the heavy-walled cast bimetallic tubes and successfully hot extruded to 84-mm OD x 64-mm ID tubes, and to 51-mm OD x 38-mm ID tubes. For the most part, thicknesses of the cladding and of the tube wall are rather uniform around the circumference and from end to end of the tubes. Hardness and tensile properties of annealed 51-mm tubes are uniform from end to end of a tube, and between tubes, and readily conform to ASTM A 213; tubes satisfy the flattening and flaring requirements of ASTM A 450. The cladding is metallurgically bonded to be base metal, as revealed by metallography, and by two tests developed for this study: a bond shear strength test and a twist test. In the latter test, rings 3.1 mm in thickness are slotted and severely twisted with a special tool. In tubes made by the optimum process, minute fissures that form adjacent to some of the pressure points during twist testing occupy just 3% of the bond-line length. Cost estimates for commercial production of 51-mm tubes via the centrifugal casting route suggest that such tubes should be considerably less expensive than conventionally clad tubes (extruded from composite billets assembled from heavy-walled wrought tubes). Such tubes should be attractive for the following applications in utility boilers: high-corrosion areas of existing coal-fired boilers, in both steam-generating tubes and superheaters; water walls, screen tubes, and superheater tubes of municipal waste-incineration boilers; future ultra super-critical boilers operating a higher temperatures and pressures; and steam-generating tubes of Syngas coolers of integrated coal gasification power plants.","","","","","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 7; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the ASM international conference Heat-Resistant Materials II, September 11--14, 1995, Gatlinburg, TN (US); PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 227-238","","","","Journal ID: JMEPEG; ISSN 1059-9495; TRN: IM9818%%98","10.1361/105994998770347963","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","616474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616474","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","2","7"
"NO{sub x} reduction RACT compliance requires careful technology selection","Heckler, G B","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; NITROGEN OXIDES; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; VOLATILE MATTER; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS","After the Clean Air Act Amendments passed in 1990, Title I (Attainment and Maintenance of Ambient Air Quality Standards) and Title IV (Acid Deposition Control) of the Act required power plants to submit and implement compliance plans for NO{sub x} and volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions, among other pollutants. This legislation affected PECO Energy Co.`s Eddystone Generating Station, requiring the utility to comply with the Act under reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules established by the state of Pennsylvania. After carefully considering alternatives aligned with the RACT rules for Pennsylvania, PECO adopted a compliance strategy and submitted it to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PaDEP) for review and approval. Under the case-by-case RACT proposals, the proposed NO{sub x} reduction technology for Units 3 and 4 was to rehabilitate existing OFA ports which had been bricked over. Each of the four corners of these units was originally constructed with an OFA port located in the boiler side walls. Also under the case-by-case RACT proposals, the proposed NO{sub x} reduction technology for the A, B and C auxiliary boilers was to install low-NO{sub x} burners. Under presumptive RACT proposals, PECO proposed low-NO{sub x} burners with close-coupled OFA (CCOFA) and separated OFA (SOFA) as the proposed NO{sub x}-reduction technology for Units 1 and 2. For the combustion turbines PECO proposed to reduce NO{sub x} by limiting the annual capacity factor to 5 percent or less on a 12-month rolling basis. After considering technological and economic feasibility, the utility proposed no VOC reductions because none of the available VOC reduction technologies fell within RACT guidelines.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-27","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%86","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250774","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","5","100"

The increase of corrosion attack on boilers is caused by the presence of fuel ash deposits containing mainly vanadium, sodium, and sulfur which form low-melting-point compounds. The tubes are exposed to the action of high stresses and high temperatures, producing the so-called creep damage. In this work, two kinds of results are reported: lab and field studies using a 2.25Cr-1Mo steel. The laboratory work was in turn divided into two parts. In the first, the steel was exposed to the action of natural ash deposits in oxidant atmospheres at 600 C for 24 h. In the second part, tensile specimens were creep tested in Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4}, V{sub 2}O{sub 5}, and their mixture over a temperature range of 580 to 620 C. In the field work, components of a power station were coated with different types of nickel- and iron-base coatings containing chromium, Fe-Cr, and Fe-Si using the powder flame spraying technique.

The Sarlux integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant must simultaneously satisfy electrical power and refinery hydrogen and steam demands (trigeneration gasification). The plant`s gasifier, heat recovery, sulfur removal, hydrogen recovery and steam power generation units are highly integrated and require coordinated control. In this study, dynamic simulation provides insights into the behavior of the process and combined cycle units during normal and upset conditions. The dynamic simulation is used to design a control system that drives the gasifiers to satisfy power, steam and hydrogen demands before a load change or upset is detected by the syngas pressure controller. At the study conclusion, the model will demonstrate how the IGCC plant will respond to the contractual maximum load change rate and process upsets.

The primary objectives were to determine flow interactions between the prediffuser and dump chamber, to evaluate circumferential flow nonuniformities around transition pieces and combustors, and to identify the pressure loss mechanisms. Flow experiments were conducted in an approximately one-third geometric scale, 360-deg annular test model simulating practical details of the prototype including the support struts, transition pieces, impingement sleeves, and can-annular combustors. Wall static pressures and velocity profiles were measured at selected locations in the test model. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analysis employing a multidomain procedure was performed to supplement the flow measurements. The complex geometric features of the test model were included in the analysis. The measured data correlated well with the computations. The results revealed strong interactions between the prediffuser and dump chamber flows. The prediffuser exit flow was distorted, indicating that the uniform exit conditions typically assumed in the diffuser design were violated. The pressure varied circumferentially around the combustor casing and impingement sleeve. The circumferential flow nonuniformities increased toward the inlet of the turbine expander. A venturi effect causing flow to accelerate and decelerate in the dump chamber was also identified. This venturi effect could adversely affect impingement cooling of the transition piece in the prototype. The dump chamber contained several recirculation regions contributing to the losses. Approximately 1.2 dynamic head at the prediffuser inlet was lost in the combustor-diffuser.","","","","USDOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center, WV (United States)","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 41.

Carbon dioxide was chemically absorbed by the reaction K{sub 2}CO{sub 3} + CO{sub 2} + H{sub 2}O {r_equilibrium} 2KHCO{sub 3} to form potassium hydrogen carbonate. Moisture, usually contained as high as 8--17% in flue gases, badly affects the capacity of conventional adsorbents such as zeolites, but the present technology has no concern with moisture; water is rather necessary in principle as shown in the equation above. Deliquescent potassium carbonate should be supported on an appropriate porous material to adapt for fixed-bed operations. After breakthrough of carbon dioxide, the entrapped carbon dioxide was released by the decomposition of hydrogen carbonate to shift the reaction in reverse on flushing with steam, which could be condensed by cooling to afford carbon dioxide in high purity. Among various preparations of alkaline-earth carbonates (X{sub 2}CO{sub 3}, X = Li, Na, K) on porous materials, K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-activated carbon revealed excellent properties for the present purpose. Preparation and characterization of K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}-on-carbon and illustrative fixed-bed operations under flue gas conditions in laboratory columns and a bench-scale plant are described.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 185-191","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9814%%90","10.1021/ie9704455","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","599782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/599782","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","1","37"

Solidification/Stabilization (S/S) processes were tested by analyzing the influence of the variables: binder type, water needs, and land disposal scenario that affect the final solid leaching characteristics. A factorial design of experiments was used to study the influence of these variables in the final S/S solid. After characterization of the leachates according to European regulations, the chemical stability of the S/S solids was analyzed using a standard dynamic leaching test (DLT). A dynamic leaching model of the contaminants (sulfates) contained in the S/S matrix was formulated from the research on the long-term behavior of the solid matrix, establishing the parameters that have an effect on the mobility of the sulfate. One parameter, the effective diffusion coefficient [D{sub e} (cm{sup 2}/s)] and its logarithmic expression, the leaching index (LX), were evaluated for each S/S process. Values of 1.51 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) {le} D{sub e} {le} 2.14 {times} 10{sup {minus}9} (cm{sup 2}/s) for 100% humidity-cured S/S wastes and 1.98 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) {le} D{sub e} {le} 4.36 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} (cm{sup 2}/s) for water bath-cured S/S wastes were obtained for D{sub e}, leading to LX values of 8.67 {le} LX {le} 10.82 and 10.36 {le} LX {le} 10.80, respectively. These values suggest that a high immobility was reached in some of the developed S/S processes. The validity of the leaching parameters obtained after a short-term landfill period was confirmed after 1 year.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-50","","","","Journal ID: JOEEDU; ISSN 0733-9372; TRN: IM9809%%52","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1998)124:1(43)","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","577367","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/577367","","Journal of Environmental Engineering","1","124"

The first installation of its kind in the United States, the Robbins facility converts municipal solid waste (MSW) into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) that is fired in two circulating fluidized-bed boilers. Steam from the boilers powers a turbine generator that can produce enough electricity to service more than 50,000 homes. The Robbins facility processes a minimum of 1600 tons of MSW per day. Some 75 percent of the MSW is converted into RDF. In addition to compostable material, the balance yields reusable aluminum, ferrous materials, and glass. Even ash produced by the circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boilers can be used to manufacture cement. The Robbins facility is operated by Foster Wheeler Illinois, Inc., a member of the Foster Wheeler Power Systems Group. The plant was engineered by Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and built by Foster Wheeler Constructors, Inc.

Tests under different conditions of plate spacing, discharge electrodes, gas velocity, and energization wave form have been performed using two extreme coal types, with very high and low resistivity ashes, respectively. The study was made by means of a pilot installation operating with a flue gas slipstream drawn upstream of a power plant ESP. The experimental plant includes a specifically designed pilot ESP, able to admit an internal modification of plate spacing and electrode type. The ESP is equipped with a microprocessor controlled power supply which can generate both continuous and intermittent rectified current. The measured sensitivity of the precipitation process to the dust properties, filter configuration, electrode type, and energization method is presented, covering both the ESP efficiency evolution and the associated power consumption. The results of this work allow to extract practical conclusions about specification of ESP design and size for a given application, and assess the conditions in which use of wide plate spacing, new electrode geometries, or intermittent current are actually advantageous. 11 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Sum 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 98-105","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: 98:001308-0003","10.1002/ep.3300160215","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","617819","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/617819","","Environmental Progress","2","16"

The basic EPA strategy is revealed, however, in the preambles and discussions published with the revised standards. Additionally, the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) that accompanied the new NAAQS provided, as required, an expected cost of controls to compare to the benefits.

Correlation of the results of the microstructural investigation with the creep rupture properties allowed the stability of the microstructure during the high temperature exposure to be assessed. The consequences of microstructural changes for the extrapolation of creep rupture data to design lifetimes are considered.

The model accounts for interactions within and between approximately a dozen major process areas. The new model is applied to case studies to evaluate the sensitivity of process performance to the ranges of uncertainty in key model inputs such as heat losses, carbon conversion, and air leakage rates, and to illustrate how alternative designs, including steam injection and flue gas desulfurization (FGD), can affect plant thermal efficiency and net power output. The model results suggest that careful attention to the design of the FGD system is needed, especially with respect to reheat, and that steam injection may offer cost savings associated with reducing the size of the steam turbine with little or no penalty on plant output or plant efficiency. Uncertainties in the slagging combustor and the ceramic heat exchanger may lead to significant penalties on process performance.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 123; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 69-87","","","AC21-92MC29094","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9807%%25","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1997)123:3(69)","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","580785","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/580785","","Journal of Energy Engineering","3","123"

In addition to providing an alternative to fossil-fuel-based energy and creating new markets for agriculture, a renewable resource like biomass used in a sustainable fashion facilitates closure of the carbon cycle. To realize these benefits, particularly in the shadow of uncertainties cast by deregulation and recent changes in federal energy and agricultural policies, biomass power systems must be competitive with incumbent power-generation technologies in terms of generation efficiency and overall cost. Anticipated performance and cost of biomass-based integrated gasification, combined-cycle power systems are discussed. The electric power that can be generated worldwide using existing biomass resources (primarily crop residues and wastes) and the potential amount that could be generated from crops grown specifically for electricity generation are projected. Technical and economic obstacles that must be overcome before advanced biomass-power systems based on aeroderivative turbines or fuel cells can become fully commercial are identified. Research, development, and demonstration efforts under way or being planned to overcome those obstacles are described; developments in a major biomass gasification demonstration project taking place in Hawaii under the auspices of the US Department of Energy and the State of Hawaii are detailed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 123; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 88-99","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9807%%26","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1997)123:3(88)","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","580788","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/580788","","Journal of Energy Engineering","3","123"

Cavities are pre-existing in SX alloys as interdendritic casting porosity, from which cracks nucleate and grow during the later stages of creep. It is generally assumed that no new cavities nucleate during creep. In this respect, cavities in SX alloys have been considered uninteresting and there have been no quantitative studies of cavities during the creep of SX alloys.

Georgia Power`s Plant Jack McDonough recently installed low-NO{sub x} burners to meet Title IV Clean Air Act requirements. The tangential burners at this facility are configured in a symmetric corner arrangement with two adjacent sets of four. Each corner has five burner levels for a total of 40 burners. Therefore, the left and right furnace each contains four burners at five levels for a total of 20 burners. There is a wall between the right and left furnace and the flue-gas streams are either physically separated or virtually independent all the way downstream to the precipitator. The low-NO{sub x} burners behave quite differently with respect to load and excess air than conventional burners. To facilitate boiler tuning and to ensure safety, Georgia Power mounted CO and NO{sub x} monitors in the flue-gas stream associated with the left and right halves of the furnace.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 29-31","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%87","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250775","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250775","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","5","100"

This paper describes an efficient method for the calculation of the two most common reliability indicators: LOLE (Loss of Load Expectation) and EENS (Expected Value of Energy Not Served), in the case of electric systems including generation units with limits on energy generation (hydro plants with a variable amount of available water). The method is based on transforming the initial load curve into a thermal load curve, which enables one to separate completely the hydrothermal system and the thermal system, thereby facilitating both the reliability evaluations and the maintenance scheduling.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1561-1568","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9804%%7","10.1109/59.627859","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563874","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563874","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","12"
"An optimization-based algorithm for scheduling hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints","Guan, X; Ni, E; Li, R; Luh, P B","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; THERMAL POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; PLANNING; RELIABILITY; OPERATION","An optimization-based algorithm is presented for the short-term scheduling of hydrothermal power systems using the Lagrangian relaxation technique. This paper concentrates on the solution methodology for hydro subproblems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints. Continuous reservoir dynamics and constraints, discontinuous operating regions, discrete operating states, and hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs are considered in an integrated fashion. The key idea is to substitute out the reservoir dynamics and to relax the reservoir level constraints by using another set of multipliers, making a hydro subproblem unit-wise and stage-wise decomposable. The optimal generation level for each operating state at each hour can be obtained simply by minimizing a single variable function. Dynamic programming is then applied to optimize the operating states across the planning horizon with a small number of well-structured transitions. A modified subgradient algorithm is used to update multipliers. After the dual problem converges, the feasible solution to the hydro power subsystem is obtained by using a network flow algorithm, with operating states obtained in the dual solutions, and possibly adjusted by heuristics. Numerical testing based on practical system data sets show that this method is efficient and effective for dealing with hydrothermal systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1775-1780","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9804%%9","10.1109/59.627890","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","563876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563876","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","12"
"Gas suppliers and electric utilities facilitate increased use of natural gas in power generation","","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 03 NATURAL GAS; NATURAL GAS; POWER GENERATION; COMBUSTION; NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY; ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY; USES; TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT","During the past six years, gas use in electric generation increased significantly and will provide important market opportunities in the years ahead. At the same time, gas and electric industries learned that using gas in electric generation, particularly in areas of the country where it is not commonly used, presents challenges. In some cases, economic and reliability objectives conflicted. However, both industries repeatedly demonstrated that gas could be used successfully in electric generation and result in benefits for the participants. While progress has been made, impediments remain and sometimes the information needed to resolve these problems is not readily available. The research described in this report was undertaken to help identify ways that technological solutions might contribute in overcoming operational coordination and communication impediments to increased use of gas in electric generation. Concurrent with the increased use of gas in electric generation, both the gas and electric industries are undergoing massive changes in structure, roles, regulation and services that are offered. Services formerly provided by regulated monopolies are being unbundled. Many of the services are being offered on a competitive basis, often by organizations that are new entrants in the two industries. However, pipelines and generating companies may have additional incentives to work together to overcome challenges if Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rate regulation of pipelines provides clear incentives for increasing the throughput of gas. There will be opportunities for joint ventures, partnerships, and alliances that make it possible to share economic benefits resulting from increased reliance on natural gas.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15-17","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 98:000165-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563445","","Electric Light and Power","11","75"

In certain parts of the United States, their attention has shifted to the thousands of fine coal disposal impoundments that coal companies created during decades of operation. Coal companies commonly discard coal fines - nominally minus 28 mesh (0.60 mm) - because this material causes both high moisture (wet, sticky) and low moisture (dust) problems that severely hamper their marketability. Several sources place the amount of fine coal in impoundments at more than two billion tons. This total continues to rise by 30 to 50 million tons each year as most coal companies decide that the handling and marketing difficulties associated with fine coal far outweigh the value of the contained carbon. GPU Generation Inc. (GPU Genco), a subsidiary of GPU Inc., is pursing a unique approach to the utilization of these waste coal fines by formulating them into coal-water slurry (CWS) fuels for co-firing in coal-fired boilers. Earlier CWS development attempts focused on the production of highly loaded (65 to 70 percent solids) slurries for replacement of fuel oil in oil-fired boilers. However, GPU Genco focuses on slurries with lower loading levels (about 50 percent solids) that can be formulated at much lower costs without the use of additives.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 22","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 98:000165-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563446","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563446","","Electric Light and Power","11","75"

The rapidly stratified flame core (RSFC) burner achieved very large nitrogen oxide reductions of up to 90% with natural gas as fuel, and 70 to 80% when burning pulverized coal and heavy fuel oil, respectively. The RSFC design provides a fuel-rich (oxygen deficient), high-temperature environment early in the flame to allow the chemical conversion of the NO{sub x} precursors to harmless molecular nitrogen. A subsequent lower-temperature, fuel-lean environment, in which the remainder of the air is mixed with the remaining fuel, then ensures complete combustion. Another integral feature of the RSFC burner register is its uniquely shaped refractory throat quarl. The throat collimates the airflow as opposed to the divergent airflow from a traditional burner (bell mouth) nozzle shape. The cylindrical shape tends to enforce stratification.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 47-56","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9805%%267","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","566720","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/566720","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","12","101"

The calculations show that the initiation and propagation of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is not very sensitive to the oxygen content of the steam, but is sensitive to the conductivity of the condensed liquid layer and the stresses (residual and operational) that the disk experiences in service.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 393-400","","","FG02-91ER45461","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: 98:000422","10.1115/1.2842321","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","549414","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/549414","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","4","119"

The two repair weldments were accomplished on two 2-1/4Cr-1Mo pipe girth weldments which were removed from a utility hot reheat piping system in the fall of 1992 after 161,000 h of operation at 1,000 F (538 C). Each repair was performed around one-half of the diameter of a pipe girth weldment, while the remaining half of the girth weldment was left in the service-aged condition. Post-repair metallurgical and mechanical test results indicated that both weld repairs produced improved remaining lives when compared to the service-aged girth weldments. Since the two ex-service weldments that were utilized in weld repairs exhibited different stress rupture strengths to start with, the performance of temper bead and postweld heat-treated (PWHT) repair could not be compared directly. It was clear, however, that life extension periods exceeding 30 yr could be achieved by temperbead repairs, with improved toughness and with no loss of stress rupture ductility, tensile strength, or yield strength. The temperbead repair improved the toughness of the service-aged weldment, while the postweld heat-treated repair lowered the HAZ toughness.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 414-422","","","","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: IM9751%%100","10.1115/1.2842324","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","549417","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/549417","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","4","119"

Sensitivity is evaluated by introducing a parameter, defined as the ratio between the logarithmic differential of the power output or efficiency functions and the logarithmic differential of each variable considered. These analytical functions and their derivatives correspond to a gas turbine model developed by the authors. The above-mentioned sensitivity parameter can be also evaluated by means of a numerical procedure utilizing a common gas turbine power plant computational model. The values calculated with the two procedures turn out to be substantially the same.

"Distributed generation hits market","","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 03 NATURAL GAS; ON-SITE POWER GENERATION; DISPERSED STORAGE AND GENERATION; GAS TURBINES; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; ECONOMICS; FUEL CELLS","The pace at which vendors are developing and marketing gas turbines and reciprocating engines for small-scale applications may signal the widespread growth of distributed generation. Loosely defined to refer to applications in which power generation equipment is located close to end users who have near-term power capacity needs, distributed generation encompasses a broad range of technologies and load requirements. Disagreement is inevitable, but many industry observers associate distributed generation with applications anywhere from 25 kW to 25 MW. Ten years ago, distributed generation users only represented about 2% of the world market. Today, that figure has increased to about 4 or 5%, and probably could settle in the 20% range within a 3-to-5-year period, according to Michael Jones, San Diego, Calif.-based Solar Turbines Inc. power generation marketing manager. The US Energy Information Administration predicts about 175 GW of generation capacity will be added domestically by 2010. If 20% comes from smaller plants, distributed generation could account for about 35 GW. Even with more competition, it`s highly unlikely distributed generation will totally replace current market structures and central stations. Distributed generation may be best suited for making market inroads when and where central systems need upgrading, and should prove its worth when the system can`t handle peak demands. Typical applications include small reciprocating engine generators at remote customer sites or larger gas turbines to boost the grid. Additional market opportunities include standby capacity, peak shaving, power quality, cogeneration and capacity rental for immediate demand requirements. Integration of distributed generation systems--using gas-fueled engines, gas-fired combustion engines and fuel cells--can upgrade power quality for customers and reduce operating costs for electric utilities.","","","","","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 18-23","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: 98:002239","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563877","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","10","101"

Unlike conventional test stands, this test combustor uses a Helmholtz acoustic geometry to replicate the acoustic response that would otherwise be observed only during complete engine testing. The authors suggest that successful simulation of engine oscillations requires that the flame geometry and resonant frequency of the test device should match the complete engine environment. Instrumentation for measuring both pressure and heat release variation is described. Preliminary tests suggest the importance of characterizing the oscillating behavior in terms of a nozzle reference velocity and inlet air temperature. Initial tests demonstrate that the stabilizing effect of a pilot flame depends on the operating conditions.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 776-782","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9805%%1","10.1115/1.2817054","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","566192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/566192","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","119"

Normally, the gas treatment is carried out at or above room temperature by the conventional dry-type corona reactor. However, this treatment is still inadequate for the removal of certain stable gases present in the exhaust/flue gas mixture. The authors report here some interesting results of treatment of such stable gases like N{sub 2}O with pulsed plasma at subambient temperature. Also reported in this paper are improvements in DeNO/DeNO{sub x} efficiency using unconventional wet-type reactors, designed and fabricated by us, and operating at different subambient temperatures. DeNO/DeNO{sub x} by the pulsed-plasma process is mainly due to oxidation, but reduction takes place at the same time. When the wet-type reactor was used, the NO{sub 2} product was absorbed by water film and higher DeNO{sub x} efficiency could be achieved. Apart from laboratory tests on simulated gas mixtures, field tests were also carried out on the exhaust gas of an 8-kW diesel engine.

"Does environmental impact assessment really support technological change? Analyzing alternatives to coal-fired power stations in Denmark","Lund, H; Hvelplund, F","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; COAL; DENMARK; CLIMATIC CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; CARBON DIOXIDE","Danish energy policy calls for development of decentralized, cleaner technologies to replace conventional power stations and, since 1990, aims to reduce CO{sub 2} emissions in 2005 to 20% below their 1988 level. These political goals require a technological change, from conventional, central power stations to cleaner, decentralized technologies such as energy conservation, cogeneration, and renewable energy. In principle, environmental impact assessment (EIA) supports this change on a project-by-project basis. The EU directive on EIA was based on the preventive principle: to eliminate pollution source rather than attempting to counteract it subsequently. According to the Danish implementation of the directive, an EIA must review a project`s main alternatives and the environmental consequences of the alternatives. If this were done properly, EIAs could assist Denmark in meeting its CO{sub 2} reduction goals. However, because EIA is implemented on a restricted, regional basis, it does not support technological change. Responsibility for the preparation of the EIA is given to the regional authorities through a law which does not require alternatives to be assessed that extend geographically beyond the boundaries of a regional authority. Thus, there is no certainty of serious analysis of cleaner technology alternatives to large coal-fired power stations. This conclusion is based on examination of three case studies using a participatory research method.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 357-370","","","","Journal ID: EIARDK; ISSN 0195-9255; TRN: IM9749%%112","10.1016/S0195-9255(97)00026-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","544160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/544160","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","5","17"

To meet this need, a software tool is now under development that can run on a desktop or laptop personal computer to assist utility personnel and technical directors in outage planning. Total Outage Planning Software (TOPS), which runs on Windows, takes advantage of the mass data storage available with compact-disc technology by archiving the complete outage documentation on CD. Previous outage records can then be indexed, searched, and viewed on a computer with the click of a mouse.

The Cyclone from European Gas Turbines (EGT), ABB`s GTX100, and AlliedSignal`s ASE 120 all draw on previously proven designs that have been refined to make them more fuel-efficient, less polluting, easier to operate and maintain, and longer-lived. Three major factors are driving the development of new machines like these three which were unveiled at the 42nd annual Turbo Expo. First, the installation costs of new gas turbines are low. Second, the time needed to install gas turbines is also low, averaging under a year for simple-cycle operation (fuel burned to turn an electrical turbine) and under two years for combined-cycle operation (where exhaust heat is captured to produce additional power). Lastly, the sharp competition between turbine manufacturers has driven the dollar-per-kilowatt costs down to about $300 per kilowatt-hour, about the same as it was in the late 1970s.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 58-61","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9739%%124","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","522403","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/522403","","Mechanical Engineering","8","119"

Other heavy metals such as lead and nickel, which are small, hard to collect particulates, also may be included in the discharged flue gas. Industry and government researchers have had limited success in developing methods to control these trace-level emissions. Developing controls for mercury emissions is complicated by the different forms that mercury can take in the flue gas of a power plant. The most common forms of mercury are elemental mercury (Hg{degree}) and mercuric chloride (HgCl{sub 2}). Hg{degree} has a high vapor pressure as compared to HgCl{sub 2} and most of the other trace toxics, and it typically exists as a vapor in the flue gas exiting power plants. Hg{degree} is also relatively insoluble in water. As a vapor, Hg{degree} can pass through the normal emission control devices that are installed on the majority of modern power plants such as electrostatic precipitators (ESP), fabric filters (FF), or wet scrubbers.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-25","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9744%%80","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","532957","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/532957","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","8","101"

The report is based on the findings of a study which estimated HAP emissions from utilities and performed multipathway risk assessment analyses to determine the effect these emissions have on the public health. From this information, EPA will determine whether additional emission controls are necessary for utilities--in other words, whether there is the need for a maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standard for the utility industry. Although the EPA has not reached a final conclusion on the health effects from utility HAP emissions, the evidence so far is not extremely damaging. Only a small minority of facilities are found to pose a greater than one in1 million risk of death from cancer or chronic disorder due to HAP emissions. While this does not mean there will be no MACT standard necessary, it does greatly limit the possibility of one.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-29","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9744%%81","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","532958","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/532958","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","8","101"

The Slovenian ecological monitoring system was set up fifteen years ago with the task of assuring acquisition of data about air pollution in the vicinity of thermal power plants. In the meantime it has been constantly upgraded and improved. At the end of 1994 immission, emission and meteorological data started to be on-line transmitted to the National Dispatching Centre. Problems with space and restrictions encountered at the construction of new transmission lines made researchers look for solutions that would allow a greater loading of transmission lines without threatening the system reliability. A method was consequently theoretically implemented about the monitoring of the thermal loading of the most important 400 kV transmission lines supported with meteorological data obtained from the EIS measuring system. Transmission of data from EIS into the Dispatching Centre, supported with an adequate software, will facilitate efficient control of the system at consideration of ecological limitations (electricity production in thermal power plants) and at the same time a more efficient exploitation of transmission lines in view of meteorological conditions. The main idea of this paper is the use of the same meteorological system for controlling both, thermal power generation and loading of important 400 kV overhead lines.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1068-1075","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9746%%19","10.1109/59.630445","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538094","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538094","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","12"

The application of a new approach, design for performance, for high-temperature alloy development, design analysis, and remaining life assessment, based on short-time high-precision testing, is described in this paper. The material tested was a directionally solidified nickel-base alloy, GTD111. It was found that the creep strength at 850 C was indeed superior to that of a competitive alloy, IN738, but was not necessarily enhanced by the preferred alignment of grain boundaries and crystal orientation. In contrast, the fracture resistance at 800 C was improved in the longitudinal direction compared with transverse and diagonal orientations in terms of susceptibility to gas phase embrittlement (GPE) by oxygen. Specimens cut transversely and diagonally to the growth direction were more sensitive to GPE than specimens taken from conventionally cast IN738. The new conceptual framework allows account to be taken of GPE and other embrittling phenomena, which may develop in service, leading to rational life management decisions for gas turbine users. Additionally, straightforward design analysis procedures can be developed from the test data, which for the first time allow separate measurements of creep strength and fracture resistance to be used for performance evaluation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 521-533","","","","Journal ID: JMEPEG; ISSN 1059-9495; TRN: IM9747%%42","10.1007/s11665-997-0125-x","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","540936","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/540936","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","4","6"

Cost-cutting measures have in major downsizing efforts in virtually every utility in the country. After several cost-cutting rounds to reduce the low hanging fruit of inefficiency, utilities are still challenged to become leaner and meaner in order to compete in a deregulated environment. The problem for many power utilities, however, is they have not precisely determined their costs in every aspect of the plant`s operation. Naturally, obtaining an accurate understanding of expenditures is the starting point for utilities that wish to develop strategic plans to better manage assets, minimize costs and maximize return on investment better understand plant O&M costs and take measures to use this knowledge to their advantage. Cycling is a major reason for the increase in O&M costs of many fossil units. Cycling, in this context, refers to the operation of generating units at varying load levels in response to changes in system-load requirements.","","","","","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 98:001083-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","576196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/576196","","Electric Light and Power","7","75"

A ceramic combustor for a 1,500 C, 20 MW class industrial gas turbine was developed and tested. This combustor has a hybrid ceramic/metal structure. To improve the durability of the combustor, the ceramic parts were made of silicon carbide (SiC), which has excellent oxidation resistance under high-temperature conditions as compared to silicon nitride (Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}), although the fracture toughness of SiC is lower than that of Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}. Structural improvements to allow the use of materials with low fracture toughness were made to the fastening structure of the ceramic parts. Also, the combustion design of the combustor was improved. Combustor tests using low-Btu gaseous fuel of a composition that simulated coal gas were carried out under high pressure. The test results demonstrated that the structural improvements were effective because the ceramic parts exhibited no damage even in the fuel cutoff tests from rated load conditions. It also indicated that the combustion efficiency was almost 100% even under part-load conditions.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 41.

The paper reports on the development and testing of a premix research burner for MBtu fuels. The burner has a quartz glass annular mixing section and a quartz glass flame tue to allow visualization of the flame. A central lance is used to mount modules for fuel injection, swirl generation, and flame stabilization. This allows a large number of variants with different swirl strength, mixing section length, fuel injection geometry, and flameholder size and shape to be easily tested. Experiments have been performed at atmospheric pressure and under high-pressure conditions (14 bar pressure, 400 C air preheat temperature) for syngas with a H{sub 2}/CO ratio of up to 5. In a preliminary study, the mixing quality of the tested variants has been assessed with planar laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).

A large number of representative particles are tracked using Lagrangian equations of motion, in combination with a stochastic model for particle turbulent dispersion. All the important mechanisms associated with the particle motion through the mill (particle-surface collisions and rebounding phenomena, fuel moisture evaporation and erosion wear of internal surfaces) are modeled. A special model is constructed to simulate the fragmentation of impacting particles and to calculate the size distribution of the final mill product. The models are regulated on the basis of available data from grinding mills of the Greek lignite power stations. The numerical code is capable of predicting the locations of significant erosion and to estimate the amount of particle mass that circulates through the mill via the classifying chamber. Mean impact velocity and impingement angle distributions along all the internal surfaces are also provided. The results indicate remarkable differences in the extent of the erosion caused at different locations of the mill. Also, the significant role of the leading blades arrangement inside the classifier on its classification performance and efficiency is elucidated.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 723-733","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9744%%178","10.1115/1.2817049","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","533055","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/533055","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","119"

Fuel is the biggest single variable cost in power generation, typically 70 to 80 percent of variable production costs for coal-fired boilers. This significant cost element becomes a serious strategic consideration for generators which hope to compete in the expected commodities market for electricity -- that is, a market dominated by price alone. Key considerations in maintaining low fuel costs include not only the traditional ones of fuel purchase price and transportation costs, but also Clean Air Act (CAA) compliance requirements, the potential to switch fuels at a given plant, the impacts of various fuels on plant performance, and even the use of more imaginative devices such as futures contracts and fuel by wire. Fuel diversity is the practice of relying on a variety of fuels and fuel-related financial devices in order to make sure generation costs remain competitive during the uncertain future.

The studies are conducted for three processes of two coal-fired plants and one oil-fired that are all equipped with electrostatic precipitators. Flue-gas sampling and analysis include the concentrations of particles and total water soluble sulfates, particle size distribution, and flue-gas composition; while in-stack and out-of-stack opacities are determined by a transmissometer and certified smoke inspectors, respectively. Experimental results show that plume opacity outside the stack linearly correlates well with the in-stack opacity. The mixing of hot flue gas with cold ambient air would result in the condensation of hygroscopic sulfuric acid aerosols and an increase about 1.6% out of typical 15--25% measured opacity. An empirical equation similar to the Beer-Lambert-Bouger form is derived for predicting the plume opacity in terms of the stack diameter and the concentrations of particles and total water soluble sulfates.

That is, for the most part, GT suppliers are not focused on ever bigger, higher-capacity models, but instead on smaller turbines of 50 MW or less. Another clear market direction: Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), utility energy-service subsidiaries, independent developers, architect/engineering firms, and seemingly everybody else connected to the industry are concentrating less on new projects and more on the service of existing GTs. Although some believe the highly publicized performance problems with large T- and F-class GTs may have played a role in the shift in emphasis to smaller units, probably more important are low load growth--which hovers at 2% or less in most of the US--and industry restructuring that has rejuvenated interest in on-site power production. The latter is an age-old concept that has been polished up and given the shiny new label, distributed generation.","","","","","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 47-56","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9746%%73","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538147","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538147","","Power (New York)","4","141"
"General circulation model calculations of the direct radiative forcing by anthropogenic sulfate and fossil-fuel soot aerosol","Haywood, J M; Roberts, D L; Slingo, A","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; HUMIDITY; SOOT; SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION; GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS; CLIMATIC CHANGE; SULFATES; AEROSOLS; FOSSIL FUELS; COMBUSTION PRODUCTS; AIR POLLUTION","A new radiation code within a general circulation model is used to assess the direct solar and thermal radiative forcing by sulfate aerosol of anthropogenic origin and soot aerosol from fossil-fuel burning. The radiative effects of different aerosol profiles, relative humidity parameterizations, chemical compositions, and internal and external mixtures of the two aerosol types are investigated. The contribution to the radiative forcing from cloudy sky regions is found to be negligible for sulfate aerosol; this is in contrast to recent studies where the cloudy sky contribution was estimated using a method in which the spatial correlation between cloud amount and sulfate burden was ignored. However, the radiative forcing due to fossil-fuel soot aerosol is enhanced in cloudy regions if soot aerosol exists within or above the cloud. The global solar radiative forcing due to sulfate aerosol is estimated to be -0.38 W m{sup -2} and the global thermal radiative forcing is estimated to be +0.01 W m{sup -2}. The hemispheric mean radiative forcings vary by only about 10% for reasonable assumptions about the chemical form of the sulfate aerosol and the relative humidity dependence; the uncertainties in the aerosol loading are far more significant. If a soot/sulfate mass ratio of 0.075 is assumed, then the global solar radiative forcing weakens to -0.18 W m{sup -2} for an external mixture and weakens further for an internal mixture. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the radiative forcing shows strong negative/positive forcing contrasts that may influence the dynamical response of the atmosphere. Although these results are extremely sensitive to the adopted soot/sulfate ratio and the assumed vertical profile, they indicate that fossil-fuel soot aerosol may exert a nonnegligible radiative forcing and emphasize the need to consider each anthropogenic aerosol species. 58 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Climate; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1562-1577","","","","Journal ID: JLCLEL; ISSN 0894-8755; CNN: Contract PECD 7/12/37; TRN: 98:001980-0002","10.1175/1520-0442(1997)010<1562:GCMCOT>2.0.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","621421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/621421","","Journal of Climate","7","10"

Initially, the cities most likely to enter such contracts are those that wish to use the prospect of cheap energy to keep existing industry and lure new industry. One such deal has been set in South San Francisco, and industrial suburb of San Francisco with several fine chemicals and biotechnology firms. The city has signed a five-year contract with FirstPoint (Portland, OR) to provide energy and related services for residents, businesses, and industry.

Deciding whether to repair an existing plant, to completely rebuild it, retire or sell a generating facility depends upon carefully evaluating a complex interaction of technology and economics. While repowering has been touted as the most viable option for older fossil plants operating with low capacity factors, current repowering progress remains stalled until the US utility business environment becomes more transparent. Some capacity projections indicate repowering will account for half of all new capacity additions that will be brought online between now and 2005. The US Department of Energy estimates that by next year, more than 3,500 US utility generating plants will be at least 30 years old. While such statistics show promise, the economics that drive a repowering decision have changed, especially when the gold rush of ground-breaking repowerings planned and executed in the last decade is used as a comparison point.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 29-35","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9733%%220","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","504805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/504805","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","6","101"

Firing low-sulfur coal at a power plant designed for medium- or high-sulfur coal will impact the downstream particulate control device. Since the performance of an electro-static precipitator (ESP) is a strong function of the sulfur content in the coal, switching to a low-sulfur coal will severely impact collection efficiency. Particle resistivity is the dominant parameter affecting the performance of an ESP. When the resistivity is too high, the ESP must be increased in size by a factor of two to three, resulting in proportionally increased capital and operating costs. Fly ash from low-sulfur coal is known to have a typical resistivity one or two orders of magnitude above that for ideal collection efficiency in a well-designed ESP. Therefore, when a utility burning a medium- or high-sulfur coal switches to a low-sulfur coal, the increase in particle resistivity resulting from the reduced SO{sub 3} concentration will lead to severe problems in the ESP. There have been many instances where utilities have switched from a high- to a low-sulfur coal, and the problems caused by the increased resistivity have had such a devastating effect on the performance of the ESP that emissions have increased by a factor of 10.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-49","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9733%%221","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","504806","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/504806","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","6","101"

Finite-time thermodynamics is used to determine the maximum power output and the corresponding thermal efficiency for an irreversible closed-cycle Brayton heat engine. A realistic model is presented, which includes three types of irreversibilities: finite thermal conductance between the working fluid and the reservoirs, heat leaks between the reservoirs, and internal irreversibility inside the Brayton heat engine. The effects of heat leaks, hot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratios, and component efficiencies on the maximum power output and the corresponding thermal efficiency are studied. With component efficiencies less than 100%, the optimum ratio of the hot-end heat exchanger conductance to the total conductance of the two heat exchangers is found to be less than 0.5. Moreover, this ratio increases as the component efficiencies and the total conductance of the two heat exchangers are increased, and decreases as the hot-to-cold reservoir temperature ratio is increased.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 461-474","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9737%%173","10.1080/00908319708908865","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","514679","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/514679","","Energy Sources","5","19"

Up to now, the primary application of brush seals has been on aerospace engine gas turbines. However, installing brush seals in large utility gas turbine engines can decrease the turbine leakage by one-third or more and consequently improve plant efficiency by one-fourth of a point or more. This improvement is worth an order of magnitude more in fuel cost savings and power output increases over the life of the brush seals compared to the hardware costs. A program to develop brush seals for installation in utility gas turbines is in progress at the Florida facility of a leading manufacturer of utility gas turbines. The program objectives are to design and validate brush seal configurations for these large engines that significantly reduce leakage flows while meeting design, life, durability, and cost requirements. The program involves improving and adapting brush seal technology developed by a well-known brush seal designer and fabricator. Initial engine applications include a new advanced gas turbine engine and the next-generation Utility Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) engine. 5 figs.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Lubrication Engineering; Journal Volume: 53; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-14","","","","Journal ID: LUENAG; ISSN 0024-7154; TRN: 98:000558-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","569325","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/569325","","Lubrication Engineering","6","53"

To improve understanding of turbulent particle dispersion under the influence of electrostatic forces, a database on particle trajectories was first generated, based on the flow field from a direct numerical simulation of a plate-plate precipitator. The effect of various parameters, such as particle size, charge and particle migration velocity, on dispersion and collection efficiency was investigated. Results show that particle concentration profiles are not uniform due to finite values of turbulent diffusion coefficient. The simulations indicate that the early stages of particle collection are controlled by particle migration velocity, while final stages are controlled by turbulence diffusion mechanisms.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1403-1413","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9802%%136","10.1002/aic.690430604","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","556688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/556688","","AIChE Journal","6","43"

The constituent parts of the samples (yolk, albumen, and shell) were solubilized with acid in a teflon-tined pressurized bomb after an appropriate beating step. The Cd and Ph were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry using Pd/Mg nitric solution as chemical modifier. Fluoride was determined by direct ion-selective electrode potentiometry. Cadmium concentration in the samples from both regions ranged from <0.01 (albumen) to 0.10 (yolk) mg kg{sup -1}, whereas Ph and F concentrations ranged from 0.16 (shell) to 3.16 (yolk) and from 0.06 (yolk) to 1.75 (shell) mg kg{sup -1}, respectively.

In December 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), issued its Second Assessment Report. The IPCC`s conclusion that {open_quotes}[t]he balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate{close_quotes} fundamentally changed the tenor of the policy debate regarding potential threats associated with global climate change. At the Climate Change Convention`s Conference of the Parties (COP) in Geneva in July 1996, most countries, including the United States, advocated adopting the IPCC report as the basis for swift policy movement toward binding international emissions targets. The next COP, in December 1997, is scheduled to be the venue for the signing of a treaty protocol incorporating such targets. Binding targets would have major consequences for power plant operators in the US and around the world. Recent developments in the state of Oregon show the kinds of measures that may become commonplace at the state level in addressing climate change mitigation. First, Oregon recently completed the first administrative proceeding in the US aimed at offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions of a new power plant. Second, a legislatively mandated energy facility siting task force recently recommended that Oregon adopt a carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) standard for new power plant construction and drop use of the {open_quotes}need for power{close_quotes} standard. This article reviews these two policy milestones and their implications for climate change mitigation in the United States.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 53-63","","","","Journal ID: ELEJE4; ISSN 1040-6190; TRN: 97:014646","10.1016/S1040-6190(97)80559-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518451","","Electricity Journal","4","10"

Traditional chemical approaches to control the problem are under increasing legislative scrutiny, and regulatory actions that limit chemical discharge and require toxic use reduction may also further curtail the use of biocides. Nontoxic, silicon-based foul release coating systems appear to be an especially attractive solution to conventional treatment methods; however, criteria for coating selection and successful application are not well defined due to the relatively limited use of this technology in the industry. This article presents case histories from two utilities, reviews their testing and coating selection strategies, and discusses the application difficulties with coating-aged concrete surfaces in immersion service.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Performance; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-31","","","","Journal ID: MTPFBI; ISSN 0094-1492; TRN: 97:009341","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477173","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477173","","Materials Performance","5","36"

The higher-ranked components may then be inspected more often or by more rigorous nondestructive examination procedures than the lower-ranked components in the plants. The development of risk-based ranking of components has its origin in the nuclear power industry. More recently, it has been employed in fossil power and process plants. One major differences between nuclear power plant risk assessment and fossil-power/process plant risk assessment is that the former has only one dominant risk (undesired event), namely, core melt accident, whereas the latter may have more than one dominant risk, for example, explosion, catastrophic rupture, leakage of toxic chemicals, etc. This paper presents a ranking procedure that can be used in cases of possible multiple undesired events, and thus applicable to fossil power and process plants.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 175-177","","","","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: 97:009445","10.1115/1.2842280","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","477456","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477456","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","2","119"

A mechanism for rafting in Ni-base superalloys under high temperature creep conditions is discussed in terms of elastic strain energy. The elastic deformation is analyzed by the finite element method and approximate analytical expressions are also deduced for it. The difference between the elastic strain energies at {gamma} channels parallel and perpendicular to the stress axis is derived in closed form, which is used to evaluate the local equilibrium concentration of component elements. The rate of rafting estimated with a simple diffusion model and the concentration distribution data obtained in the present theory agree well with the magnitude of the measured growth rate.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Acta Materialia; Journal Volume: 45; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1801-1810","","","","Journal ID: ACMAFD; ISSN 1359-6454; TRN: IM9735%%1","10.1016/S1359-6454(96)00324-2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","509129","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/509129","","Acta Materialia","5","45"

In this study limestone was calcined at high temperature and lime was produced by water vapor steam treatment at low temperature. Experiments were performed at conditions that also cover those usually present in coal-fired power plants. The investigation of the reaction of lime with synthetic flue gas showed that the relative humidity of the gas has a major impact on the reactivity. Also the presence of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide does not show a significant influence on the sulfur dioxide removal reaction though some intermediate formation of calcium carbonate cannot be excluded. Mainly calcium sulfite hemihydrate was found to be the reaction product, but some calcium sulfate hemihydrate was also formed when oxygen was present. Four regions with different prevailing reaction mechanisms can be defined: In the beginning the formation of a monolayer is mainly determined by the SO{sub 2} concentration and to some smaller extent also by the relative humidity. This period is followed by the formation of the consecutive product layers which can initially be determined by a dissolving process of SO{sub 2}. Afterward this formation is only determined by the relative humidity and most likely by product layer diffusion. Above a conversion of around 9% reaction rate drops significantly which can be due to pore closure.","","","","Fonds zur Foerderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Wien (Austria)","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1410-1418","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9735%%215","10.1021/ie960628b","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","509342","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/509342","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","5","36"

Surviving in a competitive business world will require a dramatic alteration in the way most utility power plants are maintained and upgraded, and in their budget planning. Of particular concern to some utility managers is their inability to seek second opinions on original-equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations to repair and replace critical, costly plant components such as turbines, generators, or piping. Options were needed for conducting plant outages or taking a critical component out of operation in accordance with a plant`s own unique requirements. Over the past 20 years, some utilities have developed the ability to make these decisions independently. A utility`s ability to control these resources may become one of the keys to its survival.

Deregulation, a changing labor pool, competition and years of unbridled growth are some of the extraordinary factors impacting the industry. Perhaps the greatest challenge of all rests with the utility industry`s top management. To lead their organizations from government anointed monopolies to rightful market leaders demands major intellectual and physical adjustments. Given this most difficult position, executives must learn to embrace change as a constant business opportunity and develop skills to constructively channel and manage change.

Aeroderivative gas turbines and heavy-duty gas turbines both will require exhaust gas supplementary firing to achieve high throttle temperatures. This paper presents an analysis and examples of a split stream boiler arrangement for high-temperature and high-pressure topping steam turbine combined cycles. A portion of the gas turbine exhaust flow is run in parallel with a conventional heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). This side stream is supplementary fired opposed to the current practice of full exhaust flow firing. Chemical fuel gas recuperation can be incorporated in the side stream as an option. A significant combined cycle efficiency gain of 2 to 4 percentage points can be realized using this split stream approach. Calculations and graphs show how the DOE goal of 60 percent combined cycle efficiency burning natural gas fuel can be exceeded. The boiler concept is equally applicable to the integrated coal gas fuel combined cycle (IGCC).","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 40.

The control volume finite difference method was used for discretizing the governing equations in axisymmetric form on a boundary-fitted grid. The five independent variables addressed in this study are flue gas flow rate, flue gas temperature, radial injection location, injection orientation, and liquid entrainment in the flue gas. The flue gas temperature was found to have the most significant effect on tower performance (cold water temperature), because it strongly affects the buoyancy within the tower. The total air flow through a tower is driven by buoyancy forces, and the cooling performance is a strong function of the air flow rate.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 478-483","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9739%%119","10.1115/1.2815599","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","522398","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/522398","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","119"

Special emphasis was devoted to the formation of harmful byproducts such as N{sub 2}O, HCN, and NH{sub 3}. The effect of copper loading, reaction temperature, nitrogen oxides (NO, NO{sub 2}), hydrocarbons (ethene, propene), and water on activity and on the formation of byproducts has been investigated. Increasing the copper loading from 0.46 to 1.65 wt% CuO resulted in a shift of the maximum activity to lower temperatures and in slightly lower nitrogen yields. NO{sub 2} was reduced more efficiently than NO with both reductants, whereas no significant difference in activity was observed when either ethene or propene was used as a reductant. Water addition suppressed catalytic activity and leveled off the influence of copper loading. Substantial amounts of N{sub 2}O, HCN, and NH{sub 3} were observed for copper-containing catalysts, with ethene showing a markedly lower tendency to form HCN and N{sub 2}O. Addition of water to the feeds eliminated HCN formation and suppressed the production of N{sub 2}O but had only a marginal effect on NH{sub 3} formation.

From the H{sub 2}-D{sub 2} exchange an amount of three exchangeable surface hydrogen atoms retained by the catalyst per Mo atom was estimated after sulfiding the catalyst by 10% H{sub 2}S in H{sub 2} at 400{degree}C and sweeping it by helium at 80{degree}C H-D isotope exchange occurred between H{sub 2}(D{sub 2}) and D{sub 2}S(H{sub 2}S). As expected under the reaction conditions, H{sub 2}S(D{sub 2}S) did not produced H{sub 2}(D{sub 2}). The isotope exchange between H{sub 2} and D{sub 2} was about six times faster than the exchange between H{sub 2}(D{sub 2}) and D{sub 2}S(H{sub 2}S). However, it was shown that H{sub 2}S competed with H{sub 2} for adsorption: H{sub 2}S inhibited the exchange between H{sub 2} and D{sub 2}. It is proposed that H{sub 2}(D{sub 2}) and H{sub 2}S(D{sub 2}S) dissociate heterolytically on the same sites, involving both a sulfur vacancy and a sulfur atom. Furthermore, it is suggested that the isotope exchange could occur by dissociation of both reactants on one single center provided that this center possesses at least two coordinative unsaturations. 47 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-11","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 98:002221","10.1006/jcat.1997.1558","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563496","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563496","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The towering Chicago skyline was brought to you in part by the properties of high-strength concrete, of which recycled fly ash is a key component. Fly ash, a byproduct of coal-burning utilities, wasn`t used out of some altruistic desire to preserve and protect natural resources. It was used because it is a recycled product with characteristics superior to raw materials. Fly ash consists of lightweight particles which flow through utility airstreams and usually are captured with an electrostatic precipitator. Accumulations of ash are knocked free and fall into a hopper, allowing the material to be handled dry and substituted for cement.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Pollution Engineering; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 46-47","","","","Journal ID: PLENBW; ISSN 0032-3640; TRN: IM9724%%132","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477255","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477255","","Pollution Engineering","4","29"

A pronounced structure sensitivity is evident that results in a rate enhancement over the Pd(111) single crystal relative to the more open (100) and (110) faces, and for larger supported particles relative to smaller ones. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data indicate that the Pd(100) face is more active for NO dissociation and atomic N stabilization than the close-packed (111) plane. Similarly, TPD results show that smaller particles in the model supported catalysts are more active for atomic N formation and stabilization. The inverse correlation between reaction activity and N, formation and stabilization suggests that an inactive atomic N species plays a role in determining the reaction rate. 33 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 234-241","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0019","10.1006/jcat.1997.1571","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563514","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563514","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The authors recently demonstrated that destruction of a low photoefficiency contaminant, toluene, by addition of a high photoefficiency compound, trichloroethylene, could raise the toluene photoefficiency to provide 100% conversion in a single pass, fixed bed illuminated catalyst, using a residence time of about 5-6 ms. The present paper establishes the generality of this TCE enhancement of contaminant rate and photoefficiency by examining the photocatalytic oxidation of various common contaminants at 50 mg/m{sup 3} in air, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, and chloroalkanes using near-UV-illuminated titanium dioxide powder in a flow reactor, in the absence and presence of trichloroethylene (TCE). Compounds exhibiting TCE rate promotion were toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetaldehyde, butyraidehyde, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), methyl acrylate, 1,4-dioxane, and hexane. Rate inhibition by TCE was exhibited for acetone, methylene chloride, chloroform, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. TCE presence had almost no effect on the benzene and methanol rates. Butanol and vinyl acetate single component conversions were 100% under standard low flow rate conditions; increasing the flow rate quenched TCE conversion in the presence of butanol, and therefore no TCE enhancement effect could be noted. 19 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 118-126","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:003365-0009","10.1006/jcat.1997.1552","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","563504","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563504","","Journal of Catalysis","1","167"

The effect of partial pressure of N{sub 2}O, O{sub 2}, CO, and NO, the space time, and temperature have been investigated. The decomposition is first order in N{sub 2}O over Fe- and Co-ZSM-5 and has a slightly lower order over the Cu sample. Inhibition of oxygen observed for Cu-ZSM-5 is absent for Co and for Fe at the lower temperatures. N{sub 2}O destruction is enhanced by CO for all catalysts and by NO for Fe-ZSM-5 only. In the presence of NO, NO{sub 2} is produced over Fe- and Co-ZSM-5. Over Cu-ZSM-5 the enhancement by CO passes through a maximum as a function of CO pressure due to the strong adsorption at reduced sites. A detailed kinetic model that accounts quantitatively for the observed dependencies and which deviates from the classical model for oxidic systems is advanced.

The aluminide is therefore considered as one of the promising candidates for high-temperature structural materials in a corrosive atmosphere. Research effort has been focused mainly on process, development, and enhancement of room-temperature ductility together with the characterization of physical properties such as mechanical properties, oxidation, corrosion, and abrasive wear behavior. However, there have been only a few works reported to date in regard to the erosion characteristics of the alloy, one of the most important material property of this ordered intermetallic alloy for the use in a fossil-fuel plant. In this study, the solid-particle erosion behavior of the Fe-Al intermetallic alloys containing the various aluminum contents ranging from 25 to 30 at.% has been investigated to clarify the effect of aluminum content and different ordered structures, viz. DO{sub 3} and B2, on the erosion behavior. An attempt has been made to correlate the erosion behavior of these intermetallics to their mechanical properties by carrying out tensile tests together with SEM observation of the eroded surfaces.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 829-834","","","","Journal ID: SCMAF7; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9718%%15","10.1016/S1359-6462(96)00456-3","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","460434","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/460434","","Scripta Materialia","7","36"

Entergy`s market positioning is analyzed within the context of pending deregulation of the electricity market, and compared to that of other U.S. utilities. Entergy`s overall strategy to increase shareholder value includes aggressively managing the core electricity business, broadening the global power development business, expanding domestically into energy-related retail services, and managing an orderly transition to competition. The central initiative of the company`s transition plan, which has been filed in all of its state regulatory jurisdictions, is to write down almost all of its nuclear investment over a period of seven years while rates remain essentially constant. In contrast to other jurisdictional plans, Entergy is requesting a much longer transition period but is not asking for a competition transition charge to fund stranded costs. In addition, Entergy`s heavily funded and aggressive expansion of operations is the direct opposite of the response of many utilities that are paring operations.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: NUKEM Market Report; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4-17","","","","Journal ID: NMREEO; TRN: 97:003353-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","530586","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/530586","","NUKEM Market Report","",""

First-generation BIG/GTCC systems are likely to be commercially offered by vendors beginning around 2000 and will be based on either pressurized or atmospheric-pressure gasification. Both plant configurations are considered here, with estimates of capital and operating costs drawn from published and other sources. Prospective costs of a farm-grown energy crop (switchgrass) delivered to a power plant are developed with the aid of a geographic information system (GIS) for agricultural regions in the North Central and Southeast US in the year 2000 and 2020. A simplified approach is applied to estimate the cost of delivering chipped eucalyptus from an existing plantation in Northeast Brazil. The optimum capacity (MW{sub opt}), defined as that which yields the minimum calculated cost of electricity (COE{sub m}), varies by geographic region due to differences in delivered biomass costs. With pressurized BIG/GTCC plants, MW{sup opt} is in the range of 230--320 MW{sub e} for the sites considered, assuming most of the land around the power plant is farmed for energy crop production. For atmospheric-pressure BIG/GTCC plants, MW{sub opt} ranges from 110 to 142 MW{sub e}. When a lower fraction of the land around a plant is used for energy farming, values for MW{sub opt} are smaller than these. In all cases, the cost of electricity is relatively insensitive to plant capacity over a wide range around MW{sub opt}.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 41.

Elevated CO{sub 2} led on increasingly larger monthly growth rates than the atmospheric CO{sub 2} treatments. The increase was 9.5% in spring 1995, 23% in summer 1995, and 53% in spring 1996 in the high-water treatments, whereas in low-water treatments the growth response to elevated CO{sub 2} was constrained until the second year spring, when there was a 47% increase. The terpene concentrations was slightly larger in the elevated CO{sub 2} treatments than in atmospheric CO{sub 2} treatments and reached a maximum 37% difference in spring 1996. There was no significant effect of water treatment, likely as a result of a mild low water treatment for a Mediterranean plant. Terpene concentrations increased throughout the period of study, indicating possible age effects. The most abundant terpenes were {alpha}-pinene, cineole, camphor, borneol, and verbenone, which represented about 75% of the total. No significant differences were found in the terpene composition of the plants in the different treatments or seasons. The emission of volatile terpenes was much larger in spring (about 75 {mu}g/dry wt/hr) than in autumn (about 10 {mu}g/dry wt/hr), partly because of higher temperature and partly because of seasonal effect, but no significant differences was found because of CO{sub 2} or water treatment. The main terpene emitted was {alpha}-pinene, which represented about 50% of the total. There was no clear correlation between content and emission, either quantitatively or qualitatively. More volatile terpenes were proportionally more important in the total emission than in total content and in autumn than in spring.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Chemical Ecology; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 979-993","","","","Journal ID: JCECD8; ISSN 0098-0331; CNN: Grant AMB94-0199;Grant SC94-011; TRN: 97:003868-0001","10.1023/B:JOEC.0000006383.29650.d7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","535590","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/535590","","Journal of Chemical Ecology","4","23"

After three years of operation, the system is meeting all design requirements and is saving the utility about $250,000/yr.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35-38","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9730%%34","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492156","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492156","","Power (New York)","2","141"

From a customer perspective, DR options can have significant value as a power management (PM) tool for load leveling, as well as for power quality (PQ) applications. SRP has identified several locations where the utility could partner with customers who have loads greater than 1 MW to achieve these mutual benefits.

The operational conditions are taken into consideration by the neural network with a learning mechanism to optimize the schedule. The system is applied to a simulation for a plant with a three pressure staged reheat type 235.7 MW rated capacity, and the following points are seen: (1) the system can harmonize machines operations making good use of the operational margins, i.e. machine thermal stress and NOx emission; (2) startup time and energy loss are reduced by 35.6% and 26.3%, respectively, compared with the conventional off-line startup scheduling method.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 7. biennial IEEE conference on electromagnetic field computation, Okayama (Japan), 18-21 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 51-59","","CONF-9603111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9720%%334","10.1109/60.577280","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","465119","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/465119","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","12"

Plant operations and maintenance personnel are constantly working to maintain design thermal efficiency or, in many cases, to reduce the rate of efficiency decrease. It is well known that keeping the airfoils of a turbine free-flowing helps to maintain pumping efficiency and subsequently helps to keep thermal efficiency and output capacity high. At major overhauls of both gas and steam turbines, it is common to grit blast airfoils. This is done as part of a nondestructive testing (NDT) inspection process and, in the case of steam turbines, to remove products of carryover. But grit blasting can create a rough surface finish, resulting in a loss of turbine efficiency. Plant operators can improve thermal efficiency at low cost by improving surface finish (roughness) during gas and steam turbine component inspection and refurbishment.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-38","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9725%%152","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","479391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/479391","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","3","101"

The samples for the investigation were extracted from bead-on-plate weldments made by depositing 2.25Cr-1Mo weld metal on 9Cr-1Mo base plate and vice versa. Subsequent application of PWHT resulted in the formation of a soft zone in the low Cr ferritic steel weld or base plate. A carbide-rich hard zone, adjoining the soft zone, was also detected in the high Cr side of the weldment. Unmixed zones in the weld metal provided additional soft and hard zones in the weld metals. The migration of carbon from low-Cr steel to high-Cr steel, driven by the carbon activity gradient, has been shown to be responsible for the formation of soft and hard zones. A carbon activity diagram for 2.25Cr-1Mo/9Cr-1Mo weldments has been proposed to aid in the selection of welding consumables for reducing or preventing the soft zone formation.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal; Journal Volume: 76; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 135.s-142.s","","","","Journal ID: WEJUA3; ISSN 0043-2296; TRN: 97:008711","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471142","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471142","","Welding Journal","3","76"

These reactions form cluster 2 and the arene alkane corresponding to the thiol: Cp`{sub 2}Mo{sub 2}Co{sub 2}S{sub 3}(CO){sub 4} (1) + RSH {yields} Cp`{sub 2}Mo{sub 2}Co{sub 2}S{sub 4}(CO){sub 2} (2) + RH + 2CO. These reactions are first order in thiol and first order in cluster 1 with appreciable negative entropies of activation. These data suggest that the rate determining step of the desulfurization reaction is the initial association of the thiol to the cluster. The more nucleophilic thiolate anions react with 1 at -40{degree}C to form an adduct in which the thiolate anion is bound {eta}{sup 1} to the Co atom. At -25{degree}C, the initial adduct rearranges to a fluxional {mu}{sub 2},{eta}{sup 1}-bound thiolate. The fluxional process is proposed to involve a concerted `walking` of the thiolate and a {mu}{sub 2}-bound sulfide ligand on the surface of the cluster. Near 35 {degree}C, the thiolate-cluster adduct undergoes C-S bond homolysis to give the paramagnetic anion of cluster 1 and the phenyl or alkyl radical. The radical nature of the C-S bond cleavage was confirmed by the desulfurization of the radical clock reagents, cyclopropylmethanethiol and -thiolate anion, that form the cyclopropylmethyl radical which rearranged to the butenyl radical. 42 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the American Chemical Society; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 5 Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1027-1036","","","","Journal ID: JACSAT; ISSN 0002-7863; CNN: Grant NSF CHE-9205018;Grant NSF CHE-9523056; TRN: 97:002634-029","10.1021/ja9621096","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","460045","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/460045","","Journal of the American Chemical Society","5","119"
"Cost-effectiveness of emission control at fossil-fuel units for different cumulative load patterns","Roy, S","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; POWER SYSTEMS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL; POWER GENERATION; OPERATION; ECONOMICS","This paper describes a method to recommend allocation of generating units, with a view to achieve cost-effective control of particulate and gaseous emissions over an energy scenario. Definition of relative cost and relative emission, with respect to corresponding base-case values, allows one to develop a model that describes cost and emission aspects of the chosen scenario. Optimization of this model, by any appropriate linear-programming software, yields the allocation levels to be recommended. The emphasis of this paper is on the way in which results of the said optimization model reflect the effect of demand patterns on the allocation levels. Depending on the demands, required generation levels from each individual unit may differ. This affects the overall generation cost, and simultaneously the emissions from the thermal units, both relative to respective base values. Since the optimization algorithm attempts to reduce both the relative quantities, its results always reflect the changing generation vs. emission tradeoff for utilities vis-a-vis different demand patterns.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 321-328","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%84","10.1109/59.574954","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484916","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484916","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

The turbine under consideration is a steam turbine with two sections and is of reheat type. The controller can b viewed as including the speed droop governor and the fast-valving; the latter is not standard, in that it generates a continuous control. Hence, the disadvantages of the (usual) bang-bang fast-valving are avoided. The control signal is generated by two controllers, with the first one for small disturbances and the second one for large disturbances. The authors` approach is innovative in that both controllers have the same structure and only differ in the tuning of their parameters. They generate a continuous control and are switched with a bumpless transition to ensure the continuity of the overall control. The most important non-linearity of the turbine is taken into account, and a feedback linearization is made--but in a somewhat unusual manner to obtain a robust controller. A linear quadratic control is also used to ensure that the steady-state objectives are met and that good transients are obtained. Simulations with the EUROSTAG software show improved efficiency with the proposed controller compared with the current one, especially in the case of a short-circuit, and islanding or a temporary loss of synchronism of the machine considered; the current controller has a standard structure, including a bang-bang fast-valving.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 129-135","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%63","10.1109/59.574932","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484895","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484895","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"

As electric utilities continue to implement programs to improve plants` environmental performance, questions remain about the best methods for meeting NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2} emissions limits. Altering the existing boiler feedwater heating system by adding diesel engines is an option planners often overlook. Most engineers working for US utilities view diesels as problematic units which are only used for stand-by electric production, black start or as emergency systems in nuclear power facilities. Much of the world views diesel engines as a major source of base load electric generation which is efficient, reliable and simple to maintain. Diesel engines can also contribute to operating fossil-fired power stations. Although diesel capacity may seem small when compared to gas turbines (individual, medium-speed diesel engines are available in sizes up to 35 MW), it is ideal for repowering plants up to 300 MW via boiler feedwater heating.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 37-40","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9716%%131","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","455283","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/455283","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","2","101"

As a result, utilities are being forced to rely on aging plants to meet the nation`s electricity demand which is growing at an average rate of 2 to 3 percent per year. This heavy reliance on existing plants continues to increase the importance of good plant maintenance.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electric Light and Power; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 13-15","","","","Journal ID: ELLPAJ; ISSN 0013-4120; TRN: 97:001057-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","437529","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/437529","","Electric Light and Power","2","75"

"Predicting success","Matusheski, R L","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; POWER PLANTS; OPERATING COST; MAINTENANCE; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; FORECASTING","Typically, the costs of the labor and materials necessary to keep a power plant`s equipment in good operating condition increase as the equipment ages. With time, these installations become less reliable with ever higher maintenance costs. At the same time, deregulation is causing reductions in both personnel and budgets. Therefore, a key challenge facing plants in the current economic environment is to control expenditures on equipment repairs while resources dwindle. Many utility managers facing these challenges have resorted to prioritization. Prioritization only addresses immediate problems or repairs that affect operation for the short term. Preventive activities are minimized and predictive activities are generally nonexistent. Managers finding their plants in this situation only focus on problems that affect operation today. This short term approach creates a ``fire-fighting`` environment that drives up maintenance costs. Under this prioritization, all resources are devoted to these emergency situations. Costs increase to meet overtime requirements for emergency parts procurement and for lost production time as these equipment problems are addressed. An alternative to this ``fire-fighting`` mode for maintenance is to focus on the long term by performing equipment surveillance using advanced technologies.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 101; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-28","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9716%%130","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","455282","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/455282","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","2","101"

Often overlooked, however, is that the same phenomenon affects the heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG). In fact, the greater physical size, elevated gas temperature, and higher steam conditions in today`s HRSGs have disproportionately increased thermal stresses and fatigue damage, particularly in the superheater section. In many cases, designers fail to account for these increased stresses. Imprudent operating procedures, some taken directly from suppliers` manuals, further aggravate the situation. Economic pressures have left heat-recovery steam generators serving newer combined-cycle facilities vulnerable to fatigue failures after only a few hundred start/stop cycles.

The study aimed to verify results of an approximate analysis: whether extracting air from the turbine wrapper would crate unacceptable nonuniformity in the flow field inside the compressor discharge casing. A combined experimental and computational approach was undertaken. Cold flow experiments were conducted in an approximately one-third scale model of a heavy-frame gas turbine; a closely approximated three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analysis was also performed. This study substantiated the earlier prediction that extracting air from the turbine wrapper would be undesirable, although this method of air extraction is simple to retrofit. Prediffuser inlet is suggested as an alternate location for extracting air. The results show that not only was the problem of flow nonuniformity alleviated with this alternate scheme, but the frictional power loss in the compressor discharge casing was also reduced by a factor of two.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (NL), June 13--16, 1994; PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 20-26","","","AC21-89MC26041","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9726%%139","10.1115/1.2815551","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","483746","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483746","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","119"

It is, therefore, essential to establish a fundamental basis for fuel injection modeling that involves various atomization processes. A two-dimensional fuel injection model has been formulated to simulate the airflow within and downstream of the atomizer and address the formation and breakup of the liquid sheet formed at the atomizer exit. The sheet breakup under the effects of airblast, fuel pressure, or the combined atomization mode of the air-assist type is considered in the calculation. The model accounts for secondary breakup of drops and the stochastic Lagrangian treatment of spray. The calculation of spray evaporation addresses both droplet heat-up and steady-state mechanisms, and fuel vapor concentration is based on the partial pressure concept. An enhanced evaporation model has been developed that accounts for multicomponent, finite mass diffusivity and conductivity effects, and addresses near-critical evaporation. The present investigation involved predictions of flow and spray characteristics of two distinctively different fuel atomizers under both nonreacting and reacting conditions. The predictions of the continuous phase velocity components and the spray mean drop sizes agree well with the detailed measurements obtained for the two atomizers, which indicates the model accounts for key aspects of atomization. The model also provides insight into ligament formation and breakup at the atomizer exit and the initial drop sizes formed in the atomizer near field region where measurements are difficult to obtain. The calculations of the reacting spray show the fuel-rich region occupied most of the spray volume with two-peak radial gas temperature profiles. The results also provided local concentrations of unburned hydrocarbon and CO in atomizer flowfield.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

This concept creates special combustion system requirements that are very different from requirements of conventional gas turbine systems. The topping combustor provides the means for achieving state-of-the-art turbine inlet temperatures and is the main contributor to enhanced plant performance. The objective of this program is to develop a topping combustor that provides low emissions, and is a durable, efficient device exhibiting stable combustion and manageable wall temperature. The combustor will be required to burn a low-Btu syngas under normal coal-fired conditions. However, for start-up and/or carbonizer outage, it may be necessary to fire a clean fuel, such as oil or natural gas. Prior testing has shown the Westinghouse Multi-Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) to have excellent potential for this application. Metal wall temperatures can be maintained at acceptable levels, even though most cooling is done by 1,600 F vitiated air. Good pattern factors and combustion efficiencies have been obtained. Additionally, low conversion rates of fuel bound nitrogen to NO{sub x} have been demonstrated. This paper presents an update of the status of an ongoing topping combustor development and test program for application to Second-Generation Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combined Cycles (PFBCC). The program is sponsored by the Department of Energy`s Morgantown Energy Technology Center (DOE/METC) and will first be applied commercially into the Clean Coal Technology Round V Four Rivers Energy Modernization Project. Phase 1 of the program involved a conceptual and economic study (Robertson et al., 1988); Phase 2 addresses design and subscale testing of components; and Phase 3 will cover pilot plant testing of components integrated into one system.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

Achieving this with a single combustor geometry may not be possible. Rather, the mixing processes and air flow splits must likely be modified as a function of load in order to (1) abate the emission of oxides of nitrogen, (2) maintain combustion efficiency, and (3) preclude lean blow-out over the entire duty cycle. The present study employs a model combustor to evaluate combustor performance as a function of load and explore the application of variable geometry to optimize performance at each condition. A parametric variation of flow splits is conducted at each load condition by independently adjusting the primary jet area and swirler choke area. The resultant impact on combustor performance is measured and quantified in terms of a cost function. The cost function is defined to increase with improving combustor performance (e.g., improving combustion efficiency and/or declining NO{sub x} emissions). Cycle operating conditions are found to alter the response mappings of efficiency and NO{sub x}. As a result, the optimal configuration of the combustor changes as the load is varied over the duty cycle.

This has previously been studied experimentally and this CFD investigation was undertaken to explain the higher than expected NO{sub x} emissions. The combustion conditions selected for the present study were 300 K inlet air, 0.4 overall equivalence ratio, and pressures of 1 and 10 bar. The numerical model used here involved the solution of time-averaged governing equations using an elliptic flowfield solver. The turbulence was modeled using algebraic stress modeling (ASM). The thermochemical model was based on the laminar flamelet formulation. The conserved scalar/assumed pdf approach was used to model the turbulence chemistry interaction. The study was for two pressure cases at 1 and 10 bar. The turbulence-chemistry interaction is closed by assumption of a clipped Gaussian function form for the fluctuations in the mixture fraction.The kinetic calculations were done separately from the flowfield solver using an opposed laminar diffusion flame code of SANDIA. The temperature and species profiles were made available to the computations through look-up tables. The pollutants studied in this work were soot and NO for which three more additional transport equations are required, namely: averaged soot mass fraction, averaged soot particle number density, and finally averaged NO mass fraction. Soot oxidation was modeled using molecular oxygen only and a strong influence of pressure was predicted. Pressure was shown to have a major effect on soot formation.","","","","United Kingdom Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (United Kingdom)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

This article discusses the critical differences in freeze-protection design features.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 83-84","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9725%%161","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","479399","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/479399","","Power (New York)","1","141"

The wires are positioned parallel to the endwall and ahead of the cascade, within and outside the endwall boundary layer. The traces of the smoke generated by the wires are visualized with a laser light sheet illuminating various cross sections around the cascade. During the experiment, a periodically fluctuating horseshoe vortex system of varying number of vortices is observed near the leading edge of the cascade. A series of photographs and video tapes was taken in the cascade to trace these vortices. The development and evolution of the horseshoe vortex and the passage vortex are clearly resolved in the photographs. The interaction between the suction side leg of the horseshoe vortex and the passage vortex is also observed in the experiment. A vortex induced by the passage vortex, starting about one-fourth of the curvilinear distance along the blade on the suction surface, is also found. This vortex stays close to the suction surface and above the passage vortex in the laminar flow region on the blade. From this flow visualization, a model describing the secondary flows in a cascade is proposed and compared with previous published models. Some naphthalene mass transfer results from a blade near an endwall are cited and compared with the current model. The flows inferred from the two techniques are in good agreement.","","","","Department of the Air Force, Washington, DC (United States); USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

A transient experimental technique is presented that permits the determination of local heat transfer coefficients for a rough planar surface using thermochromic liquid crystals. The technique involves the use of a composite test surface in the form of a thin foil of stainless steel with roughness elements laminated over a transparent substrate. Tests are conducted on a splitter plate to provide momentum boundary layer thicknesses to roughness heights appropriate for actual turbine stator vanes. Data are reported for two roughness geometries and two free-stream velocities. The range of Reynolds numbers along with the ratio of average roughness value to momentum thickness matches the conditions encountered on the pressure side of the first-stage stator vanes in current high performance turbofan engines. A numerical simulation is conducted to validate the test method. Results for the rough surfaces investigated are compared with an available empirical relationship.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

The heat transfer measurements are produced using fluxmeters and by the conduction solution method from surface temperature measurements. Numerical predictions are made by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in a full three-dimensional, time-dependent form using the finite-volume method. Convergence is accelerated using a multigrid algorithm and turbulence modeled using a simple mixing length formulation. Notwithstanding systematic differences between the measurements and the computations, the level of agreement can be regarded as promising in view of the acknowledged uncertainties in the experimental data, the limitations of the turbulence model and, perhaps more importantly, the modest grid densities used for the computations.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

A quasi-three-dimensional formulation is used to account for the stream-wise variation of streamtube height. The code uses Ni`s Lax-Wendroff algorithm in the outer region an implicit ADI method in the inner region, conservative coupling at the interface, and the Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model. The computational mesh consists of an O-grid around each blade plus an unstructured outer grid of quadrilateral or triangular cells. The unstructured computational grid was adapted to the flow to better resolve shocks and wakes. Motion of each airfoil was simulated at each time step by stretching and compressing the mesh within the O-grid. This imposed motion consists of harmonic solid body translation in two directions and rotation, combined with the correct interblade phase angles. The validity of the code is illustrated by comparing its predictions to a number of test cases, including an axially oscillating flat plate in laminar flow, the Aeroelasticity of Turbomachines Symposium Fourth Standard Configuration (a transonic turbine cascade), and the Seventh Standard Configuration (a transonic compressor cascade). The overall comparison between the predictions and the test data is reasonably good. A numerical study on a generic transonic compressor rotor was performed in which the impact of varying the amplitude of the airfoil oscillation on the normalized predicted magnitude and phase of the unsteady pressure around the airfoil was studied. It was observed that for this transonic compressor, the nondimensional aerodynamic damping was influenced by the amplitude of the oscillation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

The transfer functions with and without wire-prong heat conduction effects are discussed and a new method for the description of complicated transfer functions describing both the prongs and wire frequency response is proposed. The experimental part of the paper starts with an investigation of the transfer function of various probes differing by the wire diameter, the l/d ratio, and the wire-prong connection using two simple methods: (1) electrical heating of the wire by a sine current and (2) a temperature step test consisting in injecting the probe into a hot air stream. The first test provides information on the wire response, whereas the second serves to study wire prong heat conduction effect. The tests cover a wide range of velocities and densities. A frequency bandwidth of 2 kHz is obtained with a 2.5 {micro}m wire probe at an air velocity of 200 m/s at atmospheric pressure. A numerical compensation system allows the authors to extend the use of this probe to much higher frequencies. Finally, the probe is mounted onto a wheel in a high-speed rotating test rig allowing probe traverses through a stationary hot air jet at rotational speed sup to 5,000 rpm with the probe positioned at a radius of 0.380 m. The probe signal is transmitted via an opto-electronic data transmission system. It is demonstrated that using the numerical compensation method, it is possible to reconstruct the hot jet temperature profile at frequencies up to 6 kHz.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

This problem is extremely complicated, with a three-dimensional, probably circumferentially periodic ingress/egress flow through the rim seal due to mainstream pressure asymmetries resulting from the presence of blades, etc. The present study does not assume that the complete problem can be modeled as steady and two-dimensional axisymmetric. Rather, the objective of this study is to obtain a partial understanding of the complete problem from investigating the circumferentially smeared, steady, two-dimensional axisymmetric subproblem. It was found that, contrary to the case of the nominal rim seal axial clearance, for a clearance of one-fourth of the nominal value, the temperature of the hot spot on the rotor is sharply reduced with increasing purge-coolant flow because the rim seal gap recirculation zone does not form. Also, it was found that smaller rim seal axial clearances gives less rotational drag as well as less heat transport from the mainstream into the wheelspace.","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 157-159","","","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9711%%255","10.1115/1.2841005","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","438791","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438791","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","119"

While the physics of wake ingestion and shock interaction have been studied quite extensively, few ideas for reducing the aerodynamic interaction losses have been forthcoming. This paper aims to extend previously reported work performed by GE Aircraft Engines in this area. It reports on both average-passage (steady) and unsteady three-dimensional numerical simulations of a candidate design to shed light on the interaction loss mechanisms and evaluate the design. The results from these simulations are first shown against test data for a baseline configuration to engender confidence in the numerical approach. Simulations with the proposed newly designed rotor are then performed to show the trade-offs that are being made in such designs. The new rotor does improve the overall efficiency of the group and physical explanations are presented based on examining entropy production.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

Most current unsteady aerodynamic models assume the cascade to be isolated in an infinitely long duct. This assumption, however, neglects the potentially important influence of neighboring blade rows. They present an elegant and computationally efficient method to model these neighboring blade row effects. In the present method, they model the unsteady aerodynamic response due to so-called spinning modes (pressure and vorticity waves), with each mode corresponding to a different circumferential wave number and frequency. Then, for each mode, they compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for each blade row. These coefficients can be obtained from any of the currently available unsteady linearized aerodynamic models of isolated cascades. A set of linear equations is then constructed that couples together the various spinning modes, and the linear equations are solved via LU decomposition. Numerical results are presented for both the gust response and blade vibration problems. To validate the model, the authors compare their results to other analytical models, and to a multistage vortex lattice model. They show that the effect of neighboring blade rows on the aerodynamic damping of vibrating cascades is significant, but nevertheless can be modeled with a small number of modes.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 40.

"Passage flow structure and its influence on endwall heat transfer in a 90 deg turning duct: Mean flow and high resolution endwall heat transfer experiments","Wiedner, B G; Camci, C","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FORCED CONVECTION; DUCTS; TURBINE BLADES; DIAGRAMS; COMPUTER CALCULATIONS; GAS FLOW","Three-dimensional measurements of the mean velocity field have been made in a square-cross-sectional, strongly curved, 90 deg turbulent duct flow. The mean radius to duct width ratio was 2.3. The study was performed as part of an overall investigation of the physics of endwall convective heat transfer. All three components of the velocity vector and the static and total pressure fields were measured using a five-hole probe at four duct cross sections: inlet, 0, 45, and 90 deg. Preliminary turbulence measurements using a single sensor hot wire at the inlet cross section were also obtained to provide streamwise fluctuation levels through the boundary layer. The endwall heat transfer coefficient distribution was determined using a steady-state measurement technique and liquid crystal thermography. A high-resolution heat transfer map of the endwall surface from far upstream of the curve through the 90 deg cross section is presented. The three-dimensional velocity field measurements indicate that a highly symmetric, strong secondary flow develops in the duct with a significant transfer of streamwise momentum to the transverse directions. The cross-stream vorticity components within the measurement plane were estimated using the five-hole probe data and an inviscid form of the incompressible momentum equation. The development of the total and static pressure fields, the three-dimensional mean velocity field, and all three components of the vorticity field are discussed. The endwall heat transfer distribution is interpreted with respect to the measured mean flow quantities.","","","","National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the ASME winter annual meeting, New Orleans, LA (US), November 28--December 3, 1993; PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-50","","","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9711%%254","10.1115/1.2841009","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","438790","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438790","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","119"

"Ampacity of cables in single covered trays","Harshe, B L; Black, W Z","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC CABLES; CAPACITY; POWER PLANTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; CALCULATION METHODS","A mathematical thermal model is developed to predict the operating temperatures of cables in a single covered tray when there is load diversity in the cable bundle. The model accommodates two different loading scenarios--one in which the heat is distributed evenly across the cable tray cross section and the second one which concentrates the heavily loaded cables along the centerline, while surrounding them with more lightly loaded cables. The temperature predictions provided by the model are compared to data found in other IEEE papers, data collected in laboratory measurements, and new data from a four-year study of cable trays in an operating nuclear plant. Reasons for differences between the field data and the computer results are discussed. The model is used to evaluate the conservatism in the available Codes and Standards. A derating factor is introduced that is defined in terms of the ampacity of cables in open-top trays. The derating factor accounts for the added thermal resistance present when a cover is placed over the cables, trapping a layer of stagnant air on top of the cable mass. The computer model is then used to predict values for the derating factor as a function of cable depth. The derating factor is shown to be independent of the composition of cables in the tray. The presence of a cover is shown to reduce the ampacity based on an uncovered tray by up to 25 percent depending on the depth of the cables in the tray.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3-14","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%56","10.1109/61.568219","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477179","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477179","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

Ampacity tables for sizing cables in randomly-filled cable trays are provided in NEMA WC 51-1986 based on a model developed by J. Stolpe which ensures that the maximum cable temperature does not exceed the insulation rating (typically 90 C) under worst-case conditions. The Stolpe model intentionally disregards the reduced heating effect of deenergized or lightly-loaded cables to ensure that all possible hot spot conditions are enveloped. In recent years other methods have been proposed to credit loading diversity in order to justify increased ampacity. However, since they involve certain assumptions about the heat distribution within the cable mass, these methods may fail to identify individual overloaded conductors. This paper describes a simple method which considers the performance of individual conductors while providing a means of increasing ampacity as a result of loading diversity.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-45","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITPDE5; ISSN 0885-8977; TRN: IM9724%%60","10.1109/61.568223","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","477183","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/477183","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","1","12"

In virtually all operating systems, the geothermal fluid is used in a hot water heating system to meet 100% of both the peak and annual heating requirements of the structure. This strategy is a result of the relatively low costs associated with the development of most US geothermal direct-use resources and past tax credit programs which penalized systems using any conventional fuel sources. Increasingly, greenhouse operations will encounter limitations in available geothermal resource flow due either to production or disposal considerations. As a result, it will be necessary to operate additions at reduced water temperatures reflective of the effluent from the existing operations. Water temperature has a strong influence on heating system design. Greenhouse operators tend to have unequivocal preferences regarding heating system equipment. Many growers, particularly cut flower and bedding plant operators, prefer the {open_quotes}bare tube{close_quotes} type heating system. This system places small diameter plastic tubes under the benches or adjacent to the plants. Hot water is circulated through the tubes providing heat to the plants and the air in the greenhouse. Advantages include the ability to provide the heat directly to the plants, low cost, simple installation and the lack of a requirement for fans to circulate air. The major disadvantage of the system is poor performance at low (<140{degrees}F) water temperatures, particularly in cold climates. Under these conditions, the quantity of tubing required to meet the peak heating load is substantial. In fact, under some conditions, it is simply impractical to install sufficient tubing in the greenhouse to meet the peak heating load.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-4","","","","Journal ID: GCQBDW; ISSN 0276-1084; TRN: 97:002455-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543082","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543082","","Geo-Heat Center Quarterly Bulletin","1","18"

"Dabhol resumes","Burr, M T","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; POWER PLANTS; CONSTRUCTION; FINANCING; INDIA","Shockwaves were felt throughout the global business community when political forces in India stalled out the Dabhol power project. Lenders and investors felt even less secure about the risks involved with developing infrastructure projects in emerging economies, and Dabhol came to symbolize the sinkholes that lie in wait for even the best-devised projects with the strongest sponsors. The project resumed in early December, however, after the Bombay High Court dismissed the only remaining lawsuit filed against Dabhol Power Co. Now, the Dabhol project is set to become an example of how a project can succeed in a big way if it has developers with integrity, skill, flexibility, and--above all--a great deal of patience. Originally a 695 MW facility, Dabhol was renegotiated so the complex totals 2,450 MW, with one 740 MW phase and another 1,710 MW phase. {open_quotes}The additional capacity allowed us to recover the costs we incurred during cancellation,{close_quotes} says Rebecca Mark, CEO of Enron Development Corp. in Houston, Texas. {open_quotes}We reduced rates for the second phase, and we`ll handle it on a competitive basis when it comes to specifying equipment.{close_quotes} Enron is the lead developer of the project, with an 80 percent equity stake. GE Capital of Stamford, Conn., USA, and Bechtel Enterprises of San Francisco, Calif., each hold a 10 percent share in the project. {open_quotes}The changes in the project have had little effect on the financing arrangements. Additional project costs which resulted from the delays were funded by the equity group, and the debt levels and terms remain consistent with those of the original closing,{close_quotes} says Everett Smith III, executive vice president and director-international, for GE Capital Services Structured Finance Group.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 97:014641","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518405","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518405","","Independent Energy","1","27"
"Multi-tiered contracts","Lilien, W","29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FUEL SUPPLIES; CONTRACT MANAGEMENT; ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY","In recent years, power projects increasingly involve multi-tiered fuel and feedstock supply arrangements. These often involve suppliers, transporters and other service providers and companies that deal with project owners through intermediary contracting parties. This intermediary contract structure improves upon past structures in which developers often made arrangements with separate parties for each fuel supply component. In today`s customer service, one-stop shopping environment, intermediary companies are helping to remove some of the complexity of fuel contracting by providing developers with a simpler approach. It allows developers to contract with fewer entities in the supply chain. These entities in turn coordinate and enter into subcontractual arrangements for certain aspects of a project`s fuel supply. In the past, the natural gas arrangements for a gas-fired generating project might have included suppliers, transporters, gas remarketers, fuel managers and supply aggregators. Under the multi-tiered approach the owner can make direct arrangements for fuel supply via a single, direct contract with a prime supplier. In turn, the supplier enters into subcontracts with producers and transporters. Tiered arrangements are also common for coal-fired plants. In one example, the fuel supply arrangements for a recently financed Indonesian power project included excavation of coal, land and water transportation, and unloading at the project storage facilities. Each step in the supply chain could have been separately arranged by the owner. However, the owner contracted with a single supplier, which arranged for certain services with other entities. Several of these entities further subcontracted additional components in the fuel supply chain.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35-36","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 97:002896-0007","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518409","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518409","","Independent Energy","1","27"
"The single entity option","Friedlander, M C; Roberts, K M","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; ENERGY FACILITIES; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY; CONTRACTS","Traditionally, an owner hires an engineer to design a power facility or other project and then circulates the completed plans to several contractors for competitive bidding. Although there are many variations on this theme, there is an alternative method which is growing in popularity--the design-build concept. In this construction method, the same entity designs and constructs the facility. The design builder may be a single firm with both design and construction capacity in-house, or it may be a combination of two or more firms with complementary abilities. If there are multiple firms, they may be structured as a joint venture or with one of the firms prime and the others in a subcontracting role. The critical aspect is that the owner contracts with one entity which has the responsibility for both designing and constructing the facility. According to statistics compiled by the Design-Build Institute of America and F.W. Dodge DATALINE2, a national reporter of construction statistics and information, from April 1995 to April 1996 the number of design-build contracts increased 103 percent over the previous year. Of a total $212 billion construction market, about $37.2 billion--18 percent--was design build. The strongest growth was in the category of industrial--plants, refineries, factories and warehouses--in which the concept use was up more than 300 percent from the previous year.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 28-30","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 97:014642","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518406","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518406","","Independent Energy","1","27"

Predictions were obtained using two flow analysis codes. One was a finite difference analysis, and the other was a finite volume analysis. Differences among the grids in terms of heat transfer and overall performance were small. The most significant difference among the five grids occurred in the prediction of pitchwise variation in total pressure. There was consistency between results obtained with each of the flow analysis codes when the same grid was used. A grid-generating procedure in which the viscous grid is embedded within an inviscid type grid resulted in the best overall performance.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 39th international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (NL), June 13--16, 1994; PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-38","","","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9711%%253","10.1115/1.2841008","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","438789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438789","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","119"

Although SCR using NH{sub 3} is effective for NO reduction, the process suffers from many disadvantages. In addition, current SCR processes must be located at places within the flue gas treatment process where temperatures are near 400{degrees}C. Retrofitting SCR into these locations in the plant is costly because space and access in many power plants are extremely limited. Therefore, there is a need to develop NO{sub x} control technologies that can be located downstream of the particulate control device, near the stack, where temperatures are around 150{degrees}C. This study investigates the low-temperature selective reduction of NO with hydrocarbons under simulated flue gas conditions over carbon and carbon-supported catalysts. NO oxidation to NO{sub 2} was also investigated as a way of making NO more reactive with hydrocarbons or easier to be removed by absorption at these temperatures.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 308-312","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; CNN: Contract 93-1-3-1A-3P; TRN: 97:000008-0061","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","433140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/433140","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","1","41"

The effect of pressure on the behavior of sorbent during SO{sub 2} removal from flue gas or during production of sorbent carbon is the parameter least found in the literature. Pressure thermogravimetric analysis (pTGA) provides a simple means of studying this effect. In this study, a fully calcined and a partially calcined dolomite and limestone were tested for SO{sub 2} sorbent characteristics under pTGA at 840{degrees}C at 160 psig.

The virgin activated carbon showed little adsorptive capacity, especially at temperatures above 90 {degrees}C. The pronounced effect of temperature on the adsorptive capacity evidences a physical adsorption mechanism between the mercury and virgin GAC. Sulfur impregnated activated carbons exhibited enhanced mercury removal efficiency over the non-impregnated varieties due to formation of mercuric sulfide on the carbon surface. This chemisorption process is enhanced with increased temperature between 25 and 90 {degrees}C. However, at 140 {degrees}C a decrease in adsorptive capacity occurs, indicating reduced formation of mercuric sulfide. The method used for impregnating GAC with sulfur had a pronounced effect on mercury removal capacity. The chemical bonding of sulfur and carbon surface at 600 {degrees}C provides a more uniform distribution of sulfur throughout the GAC pore structure than achieved by conventional condensation techniques, yielding improved performance.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 437-441","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000008-0086","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","433165","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/433165","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","1","41"

Because NO{sub x} concentrations are generally at near trace levels and less than 0.3%, a number of other potentially more efficient control measures have and are being investigated. One such measure includes the use of adsorbents such as metal oxides ion-exchanged zeolites, activated carbon fibers with and without modifiers, and activated carbons. Activated carbons can be used effectively for SCR and for the oxidation of SO{sub 2} to SO{sub 3} with the subsequent formation of H{sub 2}SO{sub 4}. The uptake of SO{sub 2} by carbons in the absence of NO{sub x} has been studied extensively. Moisture, O{sub 2} content, and temperature influence greatly the amount of SO{sub 2} adsorbed onto activated carbons, although agreement is lacking on the synergistic or detrimental effects of co-adsorbed O{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O. It has been suggested that two different sites on the carbon are involved in SO{sub 2} adsorption and oxidation, and that two different SO{sub 2} species are present on the carbon during and after adsorption.

Traditionally, electric utility energy storage has been used to store low-priced purchased or generated electric energy for later sale or use when energy cost would otherwise be much higher. But deregulation and restructuring in the electric industry, coupled with an expanding portfolio of storage alternatives, may lead to many new opportunities for energy storage, especially within the energy distribution infrastructure, and for maintaining or providing power quality at large customer sites. Small, modular, robust energy storage technologies could be used to solve a range of energy supply and infrastructure-related needs.

The average market price of granular ammonium sulfate ($138/ton) exceeds the rough estimated cost of ammonium sulfate from the proposed process ($111/ton), by 25 percent, if granular size ammonium sulfate crystals of 1.2 to 3.3 millimeters in diameters can be produced by the proposed process. However, there was at least {+-}30% margin in the cost estimate calculations. The additional costs for compaction, if needed to create granules of the required size, would make the process uneconomical unless considerable efficiency gains are achieved to balance the additional costs. This study suggests the need both to refine the crystallization process and to find potential markets for the calcium carbonate produced by the process.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 580-586","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000004-0014","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430286","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430286","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","2","41"

The effect of oxygen on NO absorption in iron(II) thiochelate aqueous solutions, as well as in iron(II)(EDTA) solutions, has been studied. The results showed that the iron(II) thiochelate is more resistant to oxidation by oxygen than the conventional iron(II)(EDTA) additive.

Mercury has been found to be emitted from combustion in at least two different chemical forms: elemental Hg and oxidized Hg compounds. Precise identification of the oxidized compounds emitted has not been accomplished to date. However, most workers in this field assume that mercuric chloride should be the predominant oxidized species. Mercuric chloride should be readily removed in a wet scrubber system because of its relatively high solubility in water. However, it has been presumed, and we have shown, that elemental Hg will pass through a wet scrubber system with little or no removal being effected. Therefore, it is important, in order to obtain a high total Hg removal, to study methods that might result in a removal of gaseous, elemental Hg from a flue-gas stream. In this regard, we have been studying the effect of dilute halogen-containing solutions on elemental Hg in gas streams of various compositions. In particular, the results of passing Hg through bubblers containing solutions of iodine, chlorine, and chloric acid are described. Mercury found in the bubbler solutions is an indication of the extent of reaction (oxidation) of elemental Hg with the halogen species, since we have found very little Hg transferred to the liquid phase when only distilled water is used in the bubblers. Results using commercial iodine, sodium hypochlorite, and NOXSORB-solutions are presented and discussed.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Speciation of mercury into its several forms has been of interest because of the wide range of toxicity exhibited. Thus, the monitoring of environmental levels of mercury is critical, as millions of tons have already been discharged into air, soil and water systems. It is now accepted that the predominant form of Hg in air is elemental or Hg(0) (90-95%), organic Hg compounds (mainly dimethyl mercury and methyl mercury chloride) account for about a tenth of the total mercury, while particulates have been reported as 5% of the total gaseous Hg. Since concentrations of Hg in air are very low(1.5 ng/m{sup 32}, while up to a factor of 10-100 greater in certain urban and indoor environments), the Hg needs to be preconcentrated before analysis. Gold tubes and denuders are most commonly used for collection of Hg as the amalgam. However Au samplers do not reveal the breakup of the individual Hg compounds, as on thermal desorption all species are converted to Hg(O). The aim of this work was to develop a preconcentrator that would collect all forms of Hg in air, which would retain their integrity on thermal desorption. The species would then be separated before the detector. Carbon surfaces were tried, as carbon tubes have been used for the collection of organic compounds in air which retain their integrity on desorption.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: National Meeting - American Chemical Society, Division of Environmental Chemistry; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 58-61","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: NMACDY; ISSN 0270-3009; TRN: 97:000878-0025","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","437338","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/437338","","National Meeting - American Chemical Society, Division of Environmental Chemistry","2","36"

The purity of recovered G ranges from almost 100 to 92%, with impurities occurring mainly as Mg(OH){sub 2}. Gypsum contaminated with Mg(OH), is referred to as Mg(OH){sub 2}-enriched by-product gypsum (Mg-G). Because of its Mg(OH){sub 2} content, Mg-G can potentially be used as a source of both Ca and Mg for green plants growing on soils and spoils with low levels of available Ca and Mg. In addition, the presence of Mg(OH){sub 2} should allow Mg-G to be used as an alkaline amendment for the reclamation of hyper-acid spoils. The total abandoned surface coal mined land needing reclamation in eastern USA has been estimated to be more than 0.5 million ha. Gypsum can reduce Al toxicity by: (1) increased ratio of Ca to Al in the soil solution, and (2) physical removal of Al from the soil profile through Ca exchange. The Mg(OH){sub 2} in Mg-G may enhance the effectiveness of these mechanisms for amelioration of phytotoxic conditions below the zone of incorporation. The presence of Mg and sulfate increases the potential for salt loading, which may enhance downward movement of Ca and Al. The purpose of this greenhouse study was to investigate the effects of G and Mg-G, at three application rates, on spoil and leachate pH and electrical conductivity (EC), and movement of major and trace elements. Preliminary observations on plant growth are also reported.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 575-578","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000004-0013","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430285","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430285","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","2","41"

Work at PETC is directed at evaluating the technical feasibility of this option for long-term disposal. At the pressures and temperatures associated with the depths required for effective sequestration of CO{sub 2} (> 500 m), the crystalline CO{sub 2} clathrate hydrate (CO{sub 2} {circ} nH{sub 2}O, 6 < n < 8) can form. Clathrate hydrates are a special type of inclusion compound in which small molecules, such as CO{sub 2}, are held in cavities formed by hydrogen-bonded H{sub 2}O molecules by van der Waals forces. The formation of the CO{sub 2} clathrate hydrate can either facilitate or complicate the sequestration of CO{sub 2} in the ocean. Sequestration would be facilitated if the clathrate hydrates form as solid crystals dense enough to sink and thus increase the residence time of the CO{sub 2} in the ocean. The formation can complicate sequestration if a thin coating of the hydrate forms on the surface of injected bubbles or drops of CO{sub 2}. This complication would hinder dissolution of the CO{sub 2} and permit its rise to unacceptably shallower depths and thus its premature return to the atmosphere. Being able to predict the fate of CO{sub 2} hinges on our understanding of these phenomena and their likely occurrence in ocean disposal scenarios.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1452-1457","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0061","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430382","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430382","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

Utilization of fly ash represents a potential for utilities to both reduce costs and increase revenues. A major barrier to fly ash use is its variable nature, both chemical and physical, due to differences in source coals, boiler design and stack removal processes. Recovery of useful products from fly ash can improve the economics of fly ash utilization and offset costs associated with disposal.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 604-608","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000004-0018","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430290","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","2","41"

Current CO{sub 2} emissions due to combustion of fossil fuels are estimated to be 2 x 10{sup 10} tons/yr. These emissions are implicated as a major contributor to the 1-2 ppm annual increase in atmospheric CO{sub 2} concentration; the present level of atmospheric CO{sub 2} is 360 ppm. Efforts are now under way to develop possible methods to minimize CO{sub 2} emissions. One method proposed for minimizing the CO{sub 2} emissions from power plants is to grow microalgae in flue gas streams, converting CO{sub 2} to algal biomass which could then be converted to fuels, chemicals, and foods. Algae can utilize CO{sub 2} efficiently, yielding three to five times more biomass per land area than typical crops and terrestrial plants. Flue gas contains not only CO{sub 2} but also oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that may be toxic to algal growth either by lowering the pH of solutions or by direct inhibition. High levels of CO{sub 2} (10-15 %) found in flue gas could also be inhibitory to algal growth.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1391-1396","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0048","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430369","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

Many kind of methods and ideas have been proposed for the problem, however, it is very hard to find out methods to be effective and realized within an early stage. The mass transfer rate of CO{sub 2} from the atmosphere to the ocean is low. The ocean has an enough capacity to absorb CO{sub 2}. The ocean disposal is not an ultimate technology to avoid the global warming, but emergency measures for the rapid increase of CO{sub 2} concentration in the atmosphere. The ocean disposal is required to be low cost and energy saving as well as possible. The deeper releasing can isolate CO{sub 2} for longer period. Therefore, the deep-sea releasing might be most reliable from a viewpoint of long period isolation of CO{sub 2}. However, the liquefaction and transportation of it to the great depth consume a large amount of extra energy and cost. Thus, we must solve these two contradictory matters namely reliability and cost. We propose the GLAD (Gas-Lift Advanced Dissolution) system for CO{sub 2} release into deep-sea as the answer to above-mentioned problems. The GLAD system is significantly efficient comparing with previous ideas. In the present paper, the principle ofthe GLAD system is described and its characteristics is estimated based on recent numerical and experimental results.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1441-1446","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000003-0059","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430380","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430380","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","4","41"

Aqueous chloric acid readily reacts with NO and SO{sub 2} even in dilute solutions at ambient temperatures. Chlorine dioxide, ClO{sub 2}, is formed as a chemical intermediate in the solution phase oxidation reactions. The oxidation by-products of NO include NO{sub 2} and nitric acid. The ClO{sub 2} generated from the solution phase reactions also participates in gas phase oxidation reactions with NO and NO{sub 2}. The combined solution phase and fast gas phase reaction chemistries provide the means for creating a new type of high performance NOx/SOx removal process. Wet scrubber based pilot plant tests have demonstrated up to 99% removal of NO. Additional recent research work has shown that chloric acid is an effective reagent for the removal of air toxic metals, such as elemental mercury, which are present in the waste gas output streams from incinerators, hydrogen from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants, and flue gases of coal-fired power plants. Work in this area is being conducted by Argonne National Laboratories and Olin. This paper discusses the oxidation chemistry of chloric acid and its unique solution and gas phase reactions with NO, SO{sub 2}, and air toxics in wet scrubber type process equipment. 32 refs., 16 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Progress; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Win 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 245-254","","","","Journal ID: ENVPDI; ISSN 0278-4491; TRN: 97:001199-0004","10.1002/ep.670150414","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","530598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/530598","","Environmental Progress","4","15"
"Dynamic model of Italy`s Progetto Energia cogeneration plants aims to better predict plant performance, cut start-up costs","","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; ITALY; COGENERATION; NATURAL GAS","Over the next four years, the Progetto Energia project will be building several cogeneration plants to help satisfy the increasing demands of Italy`s industrial users and the country`s demand for electrical power. Located at six different sites within Italy, these combined-cycle cogeneration plants will supply a total of 500 MW of electricity and 100 tons/hr of process steam to Italian industries and residences. To ensure project success, a dynamic model of the 50-MW base unit was developed. The goal established for the model was to predict the dynamic behavior of the complex thermodynamic system in order to assess equipment performance and control system effectiveness for normal operation and, more importantly, abrupt load changes. In addition to fulfilling its goals, the dynamic study guided modifications to controller logic that significantly improved steam drum pressure control and bypassed steam desuperheating performance simulations of normal and abrupt transient events allowed engineers to define optimum controller gain coefficients. The dynamic study will undoubtedly reduce the associated plant start-up costs and contribute to a smooth commercial plant acceptance. As a result of the work, the control system has already been through its check-out and performance evaluation, usually performed during the plant start-up phase. Field engineers will directly benefit from this effort to identify and resolve control system {open_quotes}bugs{close_quotes} before the equipment reaches the field. High thermal efficiency, rapid dispatch and high plant availability were key reasons why the natural gas combined-cycle plant was chosen. Other favorable attributes of the combined-cycle plant contributing to the decision were: Minimal environmental impact; a simple and effective process and control philosophy to result in safe and easy plant operation; a choice of technologies and equipment proven in a large number of applications.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Engineering; Journal Volume: 60; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Win 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 18-24","","","","Journal ID: HEENAU; ISSN 0017-9329; TRN: 97:001306-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","530593","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/530593","","Heat Engineering","4","60"

Technology to capture CO{sub 2} from power plant flue gas, while energy intensive and expensive, is commercially available. Capture from advanced combustion systems offers a further opportunity to significantly reduce cost and energy requirements of CO{sub 2} capture compared to that from today`s pulverized coal power plants. No viable disposal options exist today for large quantities of captured CO{sub 2}. Ocean disposal of CO{sub 2} and geological storage, especially in depleted oil and gas wells, are leading candidates. Although some niche utilization may occur, utilization seems unlikely to become a major sequestration option. Since CO{sub 2} capture and sequestration is a relatively expensive mitigation option, it can be regarded as an insurance policy. However, since CO{sub 2} mitigation options are few in number, continued research to reduce the costs of CO{sub 2} capture and to develop feasible sequestration options is important. 45 refs.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Annual Review of Energy and the Environment; Journal Volume: 21; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 145-166","","","","Journal ID: ANEEER; ISSN 1056-3466; TRN: IM9704%%204","10.1146/annurev.energy.21.1.145","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","415573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/415573","","Annual Review of Energy and the Environment","","21"

An experimental study was performed to measure the hydraulic and chemical barrier properties of the material using both water and a synthetic municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate. The composite material was found to have a hydraulic conductivity of 4.3 {+-} 1.6 {times} 10{sup {minus}8} m/s with water. More importantly, the composite material had chemical barrier properties for metal ions in the leachate liquid. Results show that the principal retarding mechanism for the heavy metal ions was precipitation. In accelerated tests, for the metal ions studied, the retardation order was Pb > Zn > Fe. The migrating front of the heavy metals (Fe, Zn and Pb) under landfill conditions is estimated to be less than 0.10 m in 15 years assuming a constant pH of 6.

Recently, operating units of Foster Wheeler Energy International, Inc. (FWEI) were awarded a contract to supply six 350-MW steam generators and auxiliary equipment at the Yangcheng No. 1 power plant. The Yangcheng project is a highly innovative major independent power project to be constructed in China`s Shanxi Province. The other major step is start-up of Foster Wheeler Power Machinery Company Limited, the new joint-venture company in Xinhui City, Guangdong Province, to manufacture steam generators. According to Beijing-based David J. Parham, FWEI Regional Vice President--China, the Yangcheng award is the largest single boiler contract ever awarded in China. The award was made by the China Electric Power Technology Import/Export Corporation on behalf of Yangcheng International Power Generating Company, Limited. Mr. Parham noted that the amount of electric power capacity that Foster Wheeler has under contract in China has increased to more than 7,300 MW. These contracts range in size from 50-MW circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) units to 660-MW utility boilers. The steam generators to be located at Yangcheng will fire low-volatile anthracite coal from a nearby mine using Foster Wheeler`s double-arch-fired boiler technology. The power plant is the first major project to utilize China`s {open_quotes}coal-by-wire{close_quotes} concept for development of that country`s energy sector. {open_quotes}Coal-by-wire{close_quotes} is the name given to a program in which PRC power plants are sited adjacent to coal mines rather than near the consumers of the power being generated.

Conventional flue-gas cleanup technologies are moderately effective in controlling HgCl{sub 2} but are very poor at controlling elemental mercury. Experiments were conducted on the removal of elemental mercury vapor by means of a number of different types of sorbents, using a fixed-bed adsorption system. Of the four commercial activated carbons evaluated, the sulfur-treated carbon sample gives the best removal performance, with good mercury-sorption capacities. Promising removal results also have been obtained with low-cost minerals after chemical treatments. The inorganic sorbents could potentially be developed into a cost-effective alternative to activated carbons for mercury removal. 12 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Spr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 107-119","","","","Journal ID: HWHME2; ISSN 0882-5696; TRN: 96:005277-0006","10.1089/hwm.1996.13.107","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","433489","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/433489","","Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials","1","13"

A major worldwide supplier of steam surface condensers to the electric utility industry, Senior Engineering is finding an increased use of titanium tubes and tube sheets in condenser specifications. When compared to other alloys, titanium`s light weight is efficient in design, handling, transportation and installation activities. Additionally, it maintains a stable price structure. Senior Engineering implements an orbital welding process using fusion gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) for its titanium tube-to-tube sheet welding. Orbital welding involves the use of a welding apparatus placed inside a tube or pipe to automatically and precisely weld a 360-deg joint. When welding manually, a welder stops several times during the weld due to the large amount of time and fatigue involved in achieving 360-deg welds, which results in lack of fusion. An automated orbital welding system, however, can accomplish the task as one continuous weld. This reduces process time and decreases lack of fusion. The orbital welding systems, featuring a microprocessor-based controller, an inverter-based power supply, an expandable mandrel and a customized torch shroud, reduced welding labor by 35%. The improved labor efficiency justified the addition of two more of the systems in January 1996.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-41","","","","Journal ID: WEJUA3; ISSN 0043-2296; TRN: 97:002049","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419657","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419657","","Welding Journal","12","75"

The derivation of creep rupture-lifetime diagrams is usually performed with conventional engineering parametric methods, according to Sherby and Dorn or Larson and Miller. In contrast, an alternative method is presented that is based on a more microstructural approach. In order to describe creep, the effective stress model takes into account the hardening contribution {sigma}{sub p} caused by the presence of second-phase particles, as well as the classical Taylor back-stress {sigma}{sub p} caused by dislocations. The modeled strain rate-stress dependence can be transferred directly into creep-rupture stress-lifetime diagrams using a modified Monkman-Grant (MG) relationship, which adequately describes the interrelation between {dot {var_epsilon}} representing dislocation motion, and lifetime t{sub f} representing creep failure. The comparison with measured creep-rupture data proves the validity of the proposed micromechanical concept.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical and Materials Transactions.

"Analysis of torques in large steam turbine driven induction generator shafts following disturbances on the system supply","Hammons, T J; Lee, S K; Low, K Y","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; SHAFTS; POWER SYSTEMS; ELECTRICAL TRANSIENTS; TORSION; STEAM TURBINES; THERMAL POWER PLANTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","The paper first summarizes advantages of steam turbine driven induction generators over conventional generators such as low cost, less maintenance, rugged and brushless rotors (squirrel cage type, no need for synchronization, etc.), together with problems concerning excitation (var compensation at loads etc.). A mathematical model of the induction generator simulated in direct-phase quantities where saturation of the magnetizing reactances is simulated and saturation of stator and rotor leakage reactances is ignored is developed and employed for detailed simulation of the machine. Discrete-mass models of the machine shaft where both steam and electrical viscous damping is simulated are employed in comparing transient shaft torsional response evaluated by time domain simulation and frequency domain analysis following incidence and clearance of severe system faults. The paper then investigates torsional response following incidence and clearance of severe supply system disturbances, when the rotor is stationary and when running at close to synchronous speed unexcited, and following malsynchronization when excited by a controlled var source, together with torsional response following bolted stator-terminal short-circuits at full-load and no-load following switching in of the induction generator onto the system supply. It examines precision of predicting torque in turbine-generator shafts by frequency domain analysis not analyzed for induction-generators in the literature heretofore following incidence and clearance of worst-case disturbances on the supply. Effect of steam and electrical damping on maximum shaft torques predicted by frequency domain analysis is also illustrated. The results illustrate there is no tendency for shaft torques to become more onerous as the fault clearing time is increased as is the case for shaft torques in large synchronous machines. Three large two-pole machines of rating of up to a few hundred MWs are analyzed.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 1996 Summer meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, Denver, CO (United States), 28 Jul - 1 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 693-700","","CONF-960725-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9711%%262","10.1109/60.556364","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","438798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438798","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","11"

The company already has an established position in this area and expects to become more competitive as aeroderivative gas turbines like the marine WR21 and industrial Trent reach the market. A measure of Rolls-Royce`s broad capability in medium power generation can be seen in the company`s decision to build its own cogen power station to provide heat and power to its major aerospace manufacturing facilities at Derby in the U.K. Work has already started on preparing land adjoining the site and the 60 MW power station is scheduled to go on line in January 1998.

"Microalgal technology for remediation of CO{sub 2} from power plant flue gas: A technoeconomic perspective","Kadam, K L; Sheehan, J J","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; CARBON DIOXIDE; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; GREENHOUSE EFFECT; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; BIODEGRADATION; ECONOMICS","Power plants burning fossil fuels are a major source of CO{sub 2}, which is implicated in global warming. Microalgal systems, which photosynthetically assimilate CO{sub 2}, can be used to mitigate this major greenhouse gas. A technoeconomic model was developed for trapping CO{sub 2} from flue gases by microalgae in outdoor ponds. The model allows the authors to make some notable observations about the microalgal process. For example, although it was known that the delivered CO{sub 2} cost is an important parameter, this model demonstrates in quantitative terms that the targeted improvements for productivity and lipid content double the relative impact of CO{sub 2} resource cost on total annualized cost of the technology. The model also shows that both algal lipid content and growth rate are important for an economical process, but a trade-off exists between the two, i.e., a high lipid content and low growth rate combination can be as effective as a low lipid content and high growth rate combination. Model predictions were also used to compare the microalgal technology with alternative technologies in terms of CO{sub 2} mitigation costs. The mid-term process, which can be implemented in the near future, is competitive with other CO{sub 2} remediation technologies currently being proposed. Incorporating anticipated advances into the design basis, a CO{sub 2} mitigation cost of $30/t (CO{sub 2} avoided basis) is obtained for the long-term process, which is very promising. Deployment of this technology for CO{sub 2} mitigation looks attractive if research goals put forth by the model are achieved.","","","","USDOE Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, PA (United States)","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: World Resource Review; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 493-503","","","","Journal ID: WRRVE5; ISSN 1042-8011; TRN: IM9713%%105","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","445369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/445369","","World Resource Review","4","8"

Although engineers use some of the most sophisticated computer hardware and software ever developed to design power and industrial plants, many procedures they follow were established when such plants were engineered by a single organization located under one roof. Today, however, conceptual design may be done in Houston; detailed design in Seoul, South Korea; fabrication in Tokyo; and construction in Bangkok, Thailand. As a result, engineers need a new design environment that integrates computing and communications technologies to support global project design and management. As more companies adopt object-oriented engineering software and Internet technology, such an environment is gradually being put in place.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 52-54","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9706%%1","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419457","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419457","","Mechanical Engineering","12","118"
"Process control takes to the Net","Paula, G","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; INTERNET; DATA TRANSMISSION; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INDUSTRIAL PLANTS; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS; PROCESS CONTROL; POWER PLANTS; INFORMATION DISSEMINATION","Manufacturers are beginning to use the Internet as the communications medium for accessing instrumentation and control applications from anywhere in the world. As the Internet has grown exponentially over the past few years, it has become a communications medium for a much wider variety of applications than its founders ever predicted. For example, manufacturing facilities typically use some sort of local area network (LAN) because LAN technology works well over relatively short distances. But even a factory has applications in which data might need to be accessed from a remote location. For these, the Net can be an invaluable resource. In one such case, Foxboro Controls Inc. in Foxboro, Mass, has made its Dynamic Performance Monitor software package Internet-ready. This software provides senior executives with strategic information about a plant`s operation to help them make management decisions. Although the focus thus far has been on accessing data from a remote site, sending data back to the plant is not far off. In most cases, it wouldn`t be desirable for someone far away to be able to change the settings on any device in the plant. However, tow-way communication could be useful for applications such as virtual engineering network where a remote office supports the plant.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9706%%2","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","419458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/419458","","Mechanical Engineering","12","118"

The Internet is dramatically improving communications between all the parties bringing a new product to market. Now a new generation of communications software is becoming available that enables engineers to transmit information contained in a 3-D product model to anyone with access to the Internet.

Wet conditions drastically decrease the NO decomposition activity of unpromoted Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts at 500{degrees}C. Activity is partially recovered upon removal of water vapor. Copper ion species migration leading to CuO formation inside the zeolite channels has been identified by STEM/EDX, XRD, and XPS as the major pathway to deactivation. The cerium modified Cu-ZSM-5 displays higher wet-gas activity for NO decomposition and recovers a higher fraction of its initial dry-gas activity than the Cu-ZSM-5 catalyst after removal of water vapor. The presence of cerium suppresses CuO particle formation and dealumination, providing higher hydrothermal stability for the zeolite structure and higher copper dispersion, all of which contribute to better catalytic performance of the Ce, Cu-ZSM-5 materials. 35 refs., 16 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 164; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 131-145","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant 5093-260-2580; TRN: 97:000801-0012","10.1006/jcat.1996.0369","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486382","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486382","","Journal of Catalysis","1","164"

The Fe/Cr ratio was varied at a fixed total amount of oxide dopant of 10% (wt). The Fe-Cr/TiO{sub 2}-PILC with Fe/Cr=3 showed the highest activity. Compared with commercial V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} catalysts, the activity (on a per gram basis) of the doped pillared clay was approximately twice as high under H{sub 2}O- and SO{sub 2}-free conditions and was approximately 40% higher under conditions with H{sub 2}O and SO{sub 2}. In addition, its activity for SO{sub 2} oxidation was only 20%-25% of that of the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}-based catalysts. TPD of NH{sub 3} on the Fe-Cr/TiO{sub 2}-PILC catalyst showed that both M=O and M-OH (M=Fe or Cr) were necessary for the SCR reaction. In situ IR spectra of NH{sub 3} showed that there was a higher Bronsted acidity than the Lewis acidity on the surface under reaction conditions and that there existed a direct correlation between the SCR activity and the Bronsted acidity among pillared clays with different Fe/Cr ratios. These results, along with the transient response to O{sub 2}, indicated that a similar mechanism to that on the V{sub 2}O{sub 5} catalyst was operative. The TiO{sub 2}-pillared clay used as the support also contributed to the high activity of the Fe-Cr catalyst. The TiO{sub 2} pillars combined with the tetrahedral SiO{sub 2} surfaces of the clay apparently gave rise to a high dispersion of Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}. 52 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 164; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-81","","","FG22-93PC93217","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000801-0007","10.1006/jcat.1996.0364","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486377","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486377","","Journal of Catalysis","1","164"

Reaction rates for the products (CO{sub 2}, N{sub 2}O, and N{sub 2}) were previously measured at the same conditions in this apparatus. Surface coverages were observed both at P{sub NO}=8 Torr, where the reaction yields mostly N{sub 2}O and the selectivity is insensitive to either P{sub CO} (1 to 40 Torr) or T(<673 K), and at P{sub NO}=0.8 Torr, where the major product changes from N{sub 2}O below 635 K to N{sub 2} above 635 K. Changes in the surface coverages of NO and CO correlate well with the observed changes in N{sub 2}O selectivity. Below 635 K, where N{sub 2}O formation is favored, NO dominates the surface. Above 635 K, Where N{sub 2} formation is preferred, CO is the majority surface species.

At this temperature, NO readily adsorbs on the Cu{sup +} sites of CuH- and Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts and decomposition of NO is observed for all catalysts, although the rate of decomposition is vastly different on these materials. In comparison, this reaction is negligible over the H- and NaH-ZSM-5 samples. The time evolution of several nitrogen-containing molecules after controlled O{sub 2} exposure to the NO/ZSM-5 systems has allowed the spectral correlation of these species. These nitrogen-containing species can interact with either the protonic sites of bridging hydroxyls forming hydrogen bonding complexes or the metal cations producing primarily surface nitrates and nitrites. The hydrogen bonded N{sub x}O{sub y} complexes were characterized with their IR absorption features: (1) NO{sub 2}, 2133 cm{sup {minus}1}; (b) N{sub 2}O{sub 3}, 1875 and 1587 cm{sup {minus}1}; and (c) N{sub 2}O{sub 4}, 2185 and 1745 cm{sup {minus}1}. The stretching vibrational frequency of the acidic OH groups of ZSM-5 red-shifts due to the interaction with nitrogen-containing molecules and forms {open_quotes}ABC{close_quotes} band structures characteristic of medium and strong hydrogen bonding complexes. Although the adsorbed N{sub x}O{sub y} species (N{sub 2}O{sub 3}, N{sub 2}O{sub 4}) interacting with the Bronsted protons exhibit characteristics of a strong Lewis base, adsorption enthalpies are sufficiently weak that their existence is not observed even after brief evacuation. Nitric oxide, oxygen coadsorption produces metal cation (Na{sup +} and Cu{sup n+}) bonded surface species possessing IR absorption bands between 1400 and 1650 cm{sup {minus}1} characteristic of nitrite and nitrate species. 46 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 164; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 232-245","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000801-0021","10.1006/jcat.1996.0378","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486391","","Journal of Catalysis","1","164"

The reactivity of the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}-WO{sub 3}/TiO{sub 2} catalysts increases on increasing either the V{sup 2}O{sub 5} or the WO{sub 3} loading; the reactivity of V and/or W in the ternary catalysts is higher than that of the corresponding binary samples.

The overlay deposit was found to terminate solidification at {approx}1,216 C by a {gamma}/Laves eutectic-type reaction. The Laves phase was highly enriched in Nb, Mo, and Si. The solidification reaction and microsegregation potential of major alloying elements in the overlay deposit are compared to other Nb-bearing Ni base alloys and found to be very similar to those for Alloy 718. Solidification cracks observed in the overlay were attributed to the wide solidification temperature range ({approx}170 C) and formation of interdendritic ({gamma} + Laves) constituent.

(New York) called for bids to remove lead from the 125-foot-tall steam-dispersion stacks at its Astoria Power Generating Station, the company specified that no lead could be released into the environment during the project. Another restriction was that any abrasive blasting for surface preparation would have to be accompanied by full-scale containment--including use of airtight seals, ventilation systems, entrance and exit air locks, and impermeable containment material--to ensure minimal discharge to the generating plant below the stack. Prospective contractors also would be required to meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards for medical surveillance, hygiene facilities, eating areas and personal protective equipment if lead levels exceeded 30 micrograms per cubic meter. To reduce the cost of erecting and maintaining full containment without jeopardizing health and safety criteria, Con Ed incorporated a practical solution to remove its aging, lead-based paint. The technology, comprised of a Vac-Pac{reg_sign} self-drumming HEPA filtration system, supports up to 10 operators using proprietary scalers and needleguns.

And as competition heats up, so will the drive for proprietary technologies, thus limiting the number of potential collaborators. From the private side of investment, R and D spending is constrained by an unpredictable future for the electric power industry. And the news is even worse for generation than other sectors of the industry. R and D money, which in the past was more narrowly focused on power generation, transmission, and distribution technologies, will be more widely spread to include technologies outside of the core business. At the very least, only those entities that plan to generate electricity can be expected to fund R and D for that purpose. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI, Palo Alto, Calif.), the Gas Research Institute (GRI), and others are putting funds into distributed generation. GRI in particular is involved in collaborative advanced gas-turbine (CAGT) projects that studies ways to use intercooled aeroderivative-type machines. GRI sees a market for gas turbine with costs and efficiencies somewhere between today`s simple- and combined-cycle configurations.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-44","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: 97:004459","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","438749","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438749","","Power (New York)","9","140"

The paper extends an existing test system by developing the necessary distribution and subtransmission networks. The extended test system has all the main facilities, such as generation, switching stations, transmission, sub transmission and radial distribution networks found in a practical system. The test system, is however, sufficiently small that students can analyze it using hand calculations or by developing small computer programs to fully understand the reliability models and evaluation techniques. Overall power system reliability evaluation is concerned with providing acceptable customer service. This is an important concern in today`s electric utility environment. This should therefore be an essential element in teaching power system reliability evaluation at either the graduate or undergraduate level.

Both the gas- and liquid-fueled versions of the IM270 use a single-can, lean premix combustor, and both versions are intended to meet Japan`s emissions limits without water or steam injection. The engineers accomplished the conceptual design of the IM270 in 1993, with detailed design of the prototype continuing into the following year. Manufacture of the prototype was completed in 1994, with tests on kerosene fuel starting just before the end of that year, and continuing into 1996. It is now in commercial operation in a cogen plant at the IHI Kure factory. The gas-fueled version has been under development since March 1995 at the Tokyo Gas Factory. The first production engine is scheduled to begin operation in April 1997. Given the market, it should be the first of many. 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Turbomachinery International; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35-36","","","","Journal ID: TUINDP; ISSN 0149-4147; TRN: 97:001726-013","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","447222","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/447222","","Turbomachinery International","7","37"

The short-term needs of the facility must be satisfied as well as the long-term strategies of the organization. The Lafarge Corporation Alpena Plant was faced with such a decision regarding their Kiln 19 clinker cooler. A change in raw materials was expected to increase production rates by 10%. The existing oscillating grate cooler did not have the capacity to handle the additional capacity. Other factors involved in the decision to replace the clinker cooler were escalating maintenance costs, obsolete parts, and poor operational efficiencies. The new clinker cooler utilizes air beam technology and has proven to meet all the requirements of the plant. The anticipated production increase was exceeded without negatively impacting the performance of the air beam cooler. Audited cooler losses were excellent at 207 MJ/t{sub KK} (49 kcal/kg{sub KK}). Power consumption results wee 6.6 kWh/t{sub KK}. Clinker discharge temperatures after the breaker are lower than 56 C above ambient. The fuel consumption reduction resulting from the cooler installation was approximately 3%.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE 38. cement industry technical conference, April 15--19, Los Angeles, CA (US); PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1409-1412","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9712%%98","10.1109/28.556645","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","442673","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/442673","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","6","32"
"A coordinated approach for real-time short term hydro scheduling","Tufegdzic, N; Frowd, R J; Stadlin, W O","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; OPERATION; ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; TASMANIA","The paper describes a coordinated approach to short-term hydro scheduling and dispatch that has been developed as a part of the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission`s (HEC) new Energy Management System (EMS), which is being delivered by Landis and Gyr Energy Management. Tasmania`s hydro generation system consists of 40 reservoirs in six river catchments. The daily water release for each plant is scheduled using the HEC`s mid-term operation policy. The Hydro Scheduling and Commitment (HSC) function schedules the hydro units on a half hourly basis so that the allocated water release maximizes the energy production. This maximization of energy production is achieved by maximizing the head and this ensures that operation is always as close as possible to maximum efficiency. Mixed Integer Linear Programming is used with a detailed model of the interconnected hydro system to determine the half-hourly operation schedule. The Hydro Economic Dispatch (HED) function is used to implement the schedules produced by HSC in the real-time operation. The HED also uses a detailed model of the hydro system with a Linear Programming algorithm to ensure that each unit operates as close as possible to its head-dependent theoretical maximum efficiency point while meeting the desired storage levels specified by the HSC solution. HSC and HED have been tested against a number of operational scenarios and when it is fully integrated within the new EMS it is expected to yield annual stored energy savings up to 0.5% through more efficient hydro-electric system operation. It is expected to also provide additional savings by fostering improvements to the mid-term operating plan.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1698-1704","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%11","10.1109/59.544630","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","435353","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435353","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"

For this case study, it is found that tonnage caps provide a more cost-effective way to meet emission goals than lb/MBtu rate limiting policies. The inefficiency of rate limits is due to its encouragement of fuel use (Btu dilution), and to a reduction of cost-effective energy transactions. Emissions dispatch is confirmed as an economical technique for NO{sub x} compliance. However, the cost-effective range of emissions dispatch is significantly reduced under lb/MBtu regulation, especially when the system has large opportunities for trading power.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1711-1717","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%13","10.1109/59.544632","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","435355","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435355","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"

The CHP economic dispatch problem is decomposed into two subproblems: the heat dispatch and the power dispatch. The subproblems are connected through the heat-power feasible region constraints of co-generation units. The connection can be interpreted by the unit heat-power feasible region constraint multipliers in the Lagrangian function, and the interpretation naturally leads to the development of a two-layer algorithm. The outer layer uses the Lagrangian Relaxation technique to solve the power dispatch iteratively. In each iteration, the inner layer solves the heat dispatch with the unit heat capacities passed by the outer layer. The binding constraints of the heat dispatch are fed back to the outer layer to move the CHP economic dispatch towards a global optimal solution.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1778-1784","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%23","10.1109/59.544642","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","435365","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435365","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"

In addition to economic considerations, oscillatory stability of the system as affected by the operation of pumped-storage units is of major concern. To achieve a secure as well as economical dispatching schedule for the pumped-storage units, differential dynamic programming is first employed to reach a preliminary schedule in which total fuel cost of the thermal units over the study period is minimized. Oscillatory stability analysis of the system under the preliminary schedule is then performed by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for all electromechanical modes. Sensitivities of the eigenvalues for the poorly-damped inter-area mode with respect to individual generator outputs are evaluated. Then a systematic approach based on linear programming is presented to refine the preliminary schedule in order to improve the damping for the inter-area mode. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by short term operational planning of Taiwan power system.","","","","National Science Council, Taipei (Taiwan, Province of China)","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1705-1710","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%12","10.1109/59.544631","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","435354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435354","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"
"Shedding light on vibration","Jones, H","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBOMACHINERY; MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS; ON-LINE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS; ROTORS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES","A nonintrusive technique for monitoring rotor-blade vibration using light probes has been applied to turbine-engine rotors and plant rotating equipment. The conventional method of measuring vibrations in turbine-engine rotor blades during engine operation uses strain gauges attached directly to the surfaces of the blades. The strain-gauge signals are transmitted from the rotor to stationary signal conditioners through radio telemetry or slip rings. The gauges and wiring, located inside the engine, have a high failure rate and can degrade the engine`s performance. Repairing strain gauges and wiring often requires disassembling the engine, resulting in test delays and increased costs. A system for measuring blade-tip deflection without using strain gauges has been developed at the Arnold Engineering Development Center, located at Arnold Air Force Base near Tullahoma, Tenn. The noninterference stress-measurement system (NSMS) uses blade-tip sensors, mounted in the engine casing around the periphery of the rotor stage, to sense the arrival of passing blades.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 94-97","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9705%%393","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","418016","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/418016","","Mechanical Engineering","11","118"

Accurate analyses of scrubber reagents and reactants are important to determine FGDS efficiency, slurry scaling potential and other operational factors. For those who may not be familiar with the technique, thermogravimetry (TG) is an excellent method for obtaining fast but meaningful determinations of FGD solids. Prior to the use of thermogravimetry, lab personnel had to use time-consuming, wet chemistry techniques for FGDS solids analyses. Because a TG analysis (TGA) requires little sample preparation other than drying, results can be obtained fairly rapidly.

Many older technologies and systems cannot remove enough of the contaminants to meet the needs of today`s turbines and operating conditions. Newer filtration technologies, such as multiphase filtration systems incorporating pressure coalescence filters to remove water, can reduce contaminants to levels that will help prevent unscheduled or forced outages, allow faster startups after an ongoing outage, and reduce wear of bearings and other components.

For this reason, the development of materials exhibiting superior creep strength and corrosion resistance is required. Directionally solidification (DS) and single crystal (SC) superalloys have been developed for advanced commercial and military applications. Owing to the difficulties to produce DS and SC alloys and the high casting cost, it is necessary to develop conventional casting superalloys with excellent properties similar to those of DS and SC alloys. For this purpose, a program to design and develop cast nickel-base superalloys was initiated in this investigation. Some methods, so called PHACOMP-Nv or NEW-PHACOMP-Md, allow one to estimate the phase stability of alloys, and eventually to improve it by modification of the composition. In fact these methods do not have a strong physical basis but are rather based on empirical correlations. In this paper, six compositions were calculated according to the conventional PHACOMP parameter calculation and based on the inventions Ni-Cr-W-Al-Ti-Ta system. Among them an alloy with high strength and superior creep rupture properties was determined. The phase stability was discussed using NEW-PHACOMP-Md concept.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: 15 Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 953-957","","","","Journal ID: SCMAF7; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9646%%67","10.1016/1359-6462(96)00211-4","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","389782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/389782","","Scripta Materialia","8","35"

This reaction scheme involves adsorption of ammonia on Bronsted acid sites (V{sup 5+} -OH), followed by activation of ammonia via reaction with redox sites (V=O). This activated form of ammonia reacts with gaseous or weakly adsorbed NO, producing N{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O, and leading to partial reduction of the catalyst. The V{sup 4+}-OH species formed by the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) reaction combine to form water, and the catalytic cycle is completed by reaction of the reduced sites with O{sub 2}. Water adsorbs competitively with ammonia on acid sites.

"Time-accurate Euler simulation of interaction of nozzle wake and secondary flow with rotor blade in an axial turbine stage using nonreflecting boundary conditions","Fan, S; Lakshminarayana, B","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINES; UNSTEADY FLOW; TURBULENT FLOW; NOZZLES; CALCULATION METHODS; STANDING WAVES","The objective of this paper is to investigate the three-dimensional unsteady flow interactions in a turbomachine stage. A three-dimensional time-accurate Euler code has been developed using an explicit four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme. Three-dimensional unsteady nonreflecting boundary conditions are formulated at the inlet and the outlet of the computational domain to remove the spurious numerical reflections. The three-dimensional code is first validated for two-dimensional and three-dimensional cascades with harmonic vortical inlet distortions. The effectiveness of the nonreflecting boundary conditions is demonstrated. The unsteady Euler solver is then used to simulate the propagation of nozzle wake and secondary flow through the rotor and the resulting unsteady pressure field in an axial turbine stage. The three-dimensional and time-dependent propagation of nozzle wakes in the rotor blade row and the effects of nozzle secondary flow on the rotor unsteady surface pressure and passage flow field are studied. It was found that the unsteady flow field in the rotor is highly three dimensional and the nozzle secondary flow has significant contribution to the unsteady pressure on the blade surfaces. Even though the steady flow at the midspan is nearly two dimensional, the unsteady flow is three dimensional and the unsteady pressure distribution cannot be predicted by a two-dimensional analysis.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Boundary layer measurements were conducted for two constant-K cases, K1 = {minus}0.51 {times} 10{sup {minus}6} and K2 = {minus}1.05 {times} 10{sup {minus}6}. The fluctuation quantities, u{prime}, v{prime}, t{prime}, the Reynolds shear stress ({ovr uv}), and the Reynolds heat fluxes ({ovr vt} and {ovr ut}) were measured. In general, u{prime}/U{sub {infinity}}, v{prime}/U{sub {infinity}}, and {ovr vt} have higher values across the boundary layer for the adverse pressure-gradient cases than they do for the baseline case (K = 0). The development of v{prime} for the adverse pressure gradients was more actively involved than that of the baseline. In the early transition region, the Reynolds shear stress distribution for the K2 case showed a near-wall shear developed at Y{sup +} = 70. For the baseline case, however, the maximum turbulent shear in the transition region was generated at Y{sup +} = 70, and no near-wall high-shear region was seen. Stronger adverse pressure gradients appear to produce more uniform and higher t{prime} in the near-wall region (Y{sup +} < 20) in both transitional and turbulent boundary layers. The instantaneous velocity signals did not show any clear turbulent/nonturbulent demarcations in the transition region. Increasingly stronger adverse pressure gradients seemed to produce large nonturbulent unsteadiness (or instability waves) at a similar magnitude as the turbulent spots could not be identified visually or through conventional conditional-sampling schemes. In addition, the streamwise evolution of eddy viscosity, turbulent thermal diffusivity, and Pr{sub t} are also presented.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

"Film cooling with compound angle holes: Heat transfer","Sen, B; Schmidt, D L; Bogard, D G","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBINE BLADES; FILM COOLING; HEAT TRANSFER; GAS TURBINES; HEAT FLUX","Heat transfer coefficients have been measured for film cooling injection from a single row of holes laterally directed with a compound angle of 60 deg. Two hole configurations were tested, round holes and holes with a diffusing expansion at the exit. Streamwise-directed round holes were also tested as a basis for comparison. All the holes were inclined at 35 deg with respect to the surface. The density ratio was 1.0, momentum flux ratios ranged from I = 0.16 to 3.9, and mass flux ratios ranged from M = 0.4 to 2.0. Results are presented in terms of h{sub f}/h{sub 0}, the ratio of film cooling heat transfer coefficient to the heat transfer coefficient for the undisturbed turbulent boundary layer at the same location. Results indicate that for the streamwise directed holes, the heat transfer rates are close to the levels that exist without injection. Similarly, at low momentum flux ratio, holes with a large compound angle had little effect on heat transfer rates. However, at high momentum flux ratios, holes with a large compound angle had significantly increased heat transfer levels. The results were combined with adiabatic effectiveness results to evaluate the overall performance of the three geometries. It is shown that for evaluation of film cooling performance with compound angle injection, especially at high momentum flux ratios, it is critical to know the heat transfer coefficient, as the adiabatic effectiveness alone does not determine the performance. Compound angle injection at high momentum flux ratios gives higher effectiveness values than streamwise-directed holes, but the higher heat transfer levels result in poorer overall performance.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 800-806","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9653%%21","10.1115/1.2840937","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","404419","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404419","","Journal of Turbomachinery","4","118"

This technique is based on an established surface-flow visualization technique, and makes use of the reaction between ammonia gas and a diazo surface coating. A new method of calibration has been developed to relate the result of the reaction to surface concentration of coolant. Using the analogy that exists between heat and mass transfer, the distribution of film-cooling effectiveness can then be determined. The complete representation of the film-cooling effectiveness distribution provided by the technique reveals the interaction between the coolant ejected from the endwall and the secondary flow in the turbine blade passage. Over- and undercooled regions on the endwall are identified, illustrating the need to take these interactions into account in the design process. Modifications to the cooling configuration examined in this paper are proposed as a result of the application of the ammonia and diazo technique.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

(1990) has been used to simulate the multistage environment of the General Electric E{sup 3} low-pressure turbine. Four configurations have been analyzed and compared to test data. These include the nozzle only, the first stage, the first stage and a half, and the first two stages. A high casing slope on the first-stage nozzle causes the secondary flow vortex to separate off the casing and enter the downstream rotor. The detrimental effect on performance due to this vortex interaction has been predicted by the above approach, whereas isolated blade row calculations cannot simulate this interaction. The unsteady analysis developed by Chen et al. (1994) has also been run to understand the unsteady flow field in the first-stage rotor and compare with the average passage model and test data. Comparisons of both the steady and the unsteady analyses with data are generally good, although in the region near the casing of the shrouded rotors, the predicted loss is lower than that shown by the data.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

The aim is to make the single-stage rig more appropriate for developing design rules for multistage compressors. End-wall blockage was generated by teeth on the hub and casing upstream of the rotor. A grid fitted upstream produced free-stream turbulence at rotor inlet typical of multistage machines and raised stage efficiency by 1.8 percent at the design point. The potential field that would be generated by blade rows downstream of an embedded stage was replicated by introducing a pressure loss screen at stage exit. This reduced the stator hub corner separation and increased the rotor pressure rise at flow rates below design, changing the shape of the pressure-rise characteristic markedly. These results highlight the importance of features of the flow environment that are often omitted from single-stage experiments and offer improved understanding of stage aerodynamics.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

"Transition length prediction for flows with rapidly changing pressure gradients","Solomon, W J; Walker, G J; Gostelow, J P","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINES; PRESSURE GRADIENTS; TURBULENT FLOW; BOUNDARY LAYERS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","A new method for calculating intermittency in transitional boundary layers with changing pressure gradients is proposed and tested against standard turbomachinery flow cases. It is based on recent experimental studies, which show the local pressure gradient parameter to have a significant effect on turbulent spot spreading angles and propagation velocities (and hence transition length). This can be very important for some turbomachinery flows. On a turbine blade suction surface, for example, it is possible for transition to start in a region of favorable pressure gradient and finish in a region of adverse pressure gradient. Calculation methods that estimate the transition length from the local pressure gradient parameter at the start of transition will seriously overestimate the transition length under these conditions. Conventional methods based on correlations of zero pressure gradient transition date are similarly inaccurate. The new calculation method continuously adjusts the spot growth parameters in response to changes in the local pressure gradient through transition using correlations based on data given in the companion paper by Gostelow et al. (1996). Recent experiment correlations of Gostelow et al. (1994a) are used to estimate the turbulent spot generation rate at the start of transition. The method has been incorporated in a linear combination integral computation and tested with good results on cases that report both the intermittency and surface pressure distribution data. It has resulted in a much reduced sensitivity to errors in predicting the start of the transition zone, and can be recommended for engineering use in calculating boundary layer development on axial turbomachine blades.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

An experimental investigation of the process of turbulence development in a separation bubble shows that transition occurs within the separated shear layer. A comparison of simultaneous velocity traces from probes separated in the lateral direction suggests that Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, which originate in the laminar shear layer, do not break down to turbulence simultaneously across their span when they proceed to agglomerate. The streamwise development of intermittency in this region can be characterized by turbulent spot theory with a high dimensionless spot production rate. Moreover, the progression of intermittency along the centerline of the shear layer is similar to that in attached boundary layer transition. The transverse development of intermittency is also remarkably similar to that in attached boundary layers. The parameters obtained from these measurements agree with correlations previously deduced from turbulence intensity measurements.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Tests were carried out in a cold flow rig and as part of a gas generator facility. The performance of the turbine was assessed, through measurements of reaction, rotor exit conditions and efficiency, with and without airfoil cooling. The measured cooled efficiency in the cold rig was 79.9 percent, which, after correcting for temperature and measuring plane location, matched reasonably well the efficiency of 81.5 percent in the gas generator test. The effect of cooling, as measured in the cold rig, was to reduce the turbine efficiency by 2.1 percent. A part-load turbine map was obtained at 100, 110, and 118 percent design speed and at 3.9, 5.0, and 6.0 pressure ratio. The influence of speed and the limit load pattern for transonic turbines are discussed. The effect of the downstream measuring distance on the calculated efficiency was determined using three different locations.

Levels of free-stream turbulence (Tu) up to 17.4 percent were generated using a method that simulates conditions at a gas turbine combustor exit. Film cooling was injected from a single row of five 35 deg slant-hole injectors (length/diameter = 3.5, pitch/diameter = 3.0) at blowing ratios from 0.55 to 1.85 and at a nearly constant density ratio (coolant density/free-stream density) of 0.95. Film cooling effectiveness data are presented for Tu levels ranging from 0.9 to 17 percent at a constant free-stream Reynolds number based on injection hole diameter of 19,000. Results show that elevated levels of free-stream turbulence reduce film cooling effectiveness by up to 70 percent in the region directly downstream of the injection hole due to enhanced mixing. At the same time, high free-stream turbulence also produces a 50--100 percent increase in film cooling effectiveness in the region between injection holes. This is due to accelerated spanwise diffusion of the cooling fluid, which also produces an earlier merger of the coolant jets from adjacent holes.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 814-825","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9653%%23","10.1115/1.2840939","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","404421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404421","","Journal of Turbomachinery","4","118"

"The transport of vortices through a turbine cascade","Wall, A.G. van de; Kadambi, J R; Boyle, R J; Adamczyk, J J","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; VORTEX FLOW; FLOW VISUALIZATION; GAS TURBINES; TURBOMACHINERY; TEST FACILITIES","An experiment was conducted to determine how incident vortices created by upstream blade rows interacted with a downstream turbine cascade. Specifically, the kinematics of the vortex transport through turbine blade passages was investigated. A stationary water table and a flow visualization system using the pH indicator Bromothymol Blue was used to visualize the vortices generated by vortex generators placed upstream of a turbine blade cascade. Two test series were conducted. In the first test series, stationary vortex generators were positioned at various locations along the turbine blade pitch to observe how a steady incident streamwise vortex was transported through the turbine cascade. Observations showed an unsteady vortex response of the streamwise vortex when the incident vortex was located at the stagnation area of the blade. In the second test series, the vortex generators were moved to simulate the relative motion of an upstream blade row. In these tests, the unsteady vortex response was no longer seen at the stagnation region but was instead located at the suction side of the blade. In addition, the breakdown of the vortex varied greatly with the reduced frequency of the incident vorticity and showed an explosive type vortex breakdown that occurred at reduced frequencies greater than 8. The dissimilar behavior between the stationary and moving incident vortices indicates that losses and leading edge heat transfer could differ to some degree when determined from a stationary test as opposed to a full-stage simulation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

In the proposed method, a fully implicit discretization is used to remove stability limitations. By means of a dual time-stepping approach, a four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme is used in conjunction with several accelerating techniques typical of steady-state solvers, instead of traditional time-expensive factorizations. The accelerating strategies include local time stepping, residual smoothing, and multigrid. Two-dimensional viscous calculations of unsteady rotor-stator interaction in the first stage of a modern gas turbine are presented. The stage analysis is based on the introduction of several blade passages to approximate the stator:rotor count ratio. Particular attention is dedicated to grid dependency in space and time as well as to the influence of the number of blades included in the calculations.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Boundary layer transition in this situation is investigated by triggering a wave packet, which evolves into a turbulent spot. The development from wave packet to turbulent spot is observed and the interactions of the turbulent spot with the ongoing natural transition and the ensuing turbulent boundary layer are examined. Under this steeply diffusing pressure distribution, strong amplification of primary instabilities prevails. Breakdown to turbulence is instigated near the centerline and propagates transversely along the wave packet until the turbulent region dominates. An extensive calmed region is present behind the spot, which persists well into the surrounding turbulent layer. Celerities of spot leading and trailing edges are presented, as is the spanwise spreading half-angle. Corresponding measurements for spots under a wide range of imposed pressure gradients are compiled and the present results are compared with those of other authors. Resulting correlations for spot propagation parameters are provided for use in computational modeling of the transition region under variable pressure gradients.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

"Unsteady numerical simulations of radial temperature profile redistribution in a single-stage turbine","Dorney, D J; Schwab, J R","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINES; SIMULATION; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; PRESSURE GRADIENTS; GAS FLOW","Experimental data taken from gas turbine combustors indicate that the flow exiting the combustor can contain both circumferential and radial temperature gradients. A significant amount of research recently has been devoted to studying turbine flows with inlet temperature gradients, but no total pressure gradients. Less attention has been given to flows containing both temperature and total pressure gradients at the inlet. The significance of the total pressure gradients is that the secondary flows and the temperature redistribution process in the vane blade row can be significantly altered. Experimental data previously obtained in a single-stage turbine with inlet total temperature and total pressure gradients indicated a redistribution of the warmer fluid to the pressure surface of the airfoils, and a severe underturning of the flow at the exit of the stage. In a concurrent numerical simulation, a steady, inviscid, three-dimensional flow analysis was able to capture the redistribution process, but not the exit flow angle distribution. In the current research program, a series of unsteady two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes simulations have been performed to study the redistribution of the radial temperature profile in the turbine stage. The three-dimensional analysis predicts both the temperature redistribution and the flow underturning observed in the experiments.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Round holes and holes with a diffusing expanded exit were directed laterally away from the free-stream direction with a compound angle of 60 deg. Comparisons were made with a baseline case of round holes aligned with the free stream. The effects of doubling the hole spacing to six hole diameters for each geometry were also examined. Experiments were performed at a density ratio of 1.6 with a range of blowing ratios from 0.5 to 2.5 and momentum flux ratios from 0.16 to 3.9. Lateral distributions of adiabatic effectiveness results were determined at streamwise distances from 3 D to 15 D downstream of the injection holes. All hole geometries had similar maximum spatially averaged effectiveness at a low momentum flux ratio of I = 0.25, but the round and expanded exit holes with compound angle had significantly greater effectiveness at larger momentum flux ratios. The compound angle holes with expanded exits had a much improved lateral distribution of coolant near the hole for all momentum flux ratios.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 807-813","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9653%%22","10.1115/1.2840938","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","404420","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404420","","Journal of Turbomachinery","4","118"

"The effects of adverse pressure gradients on momentum and thermal structures in transitional boundary layers.

The acceleration parameter, K, was kept constant along the test section. Both surface heat transfer and boundary layer measurements were conducted. The boundary layer measurements were conducted with a three-wire probe (two velocity wires and one temperature wire) for two representative cases, K1 = {minus}0.51 {times} 10{sup {minus}6} and K2 = {minus}1.05 {times} 10{sup {minus}6}. The surface heat transfer measurements were conducted for K values ranging from {minus}0.045 {times} 10{sup {minus}6} to {minus}1.44 {times} 10{sup {minus}6} over five divergent wall angles. The Stanton numbers of the cases with adverse pressure gradients were greater than that of the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent correlation in the low-Reynolds-number turbulent flow, and the difference increased as the adverse pressure gradient was increased. The adverse pressure gradient caused earlier transition onset and shorter transition length based on Re{sub x}, Re*{sub {delta}}, and Re{sub {theta}} in comparison to zero-pressure-gradient conditions. As expected, there was a reduction in skin friction as the adverse pressure gradient increased. In the U{sup +}-Y{sup +} coordinates, the adverse pressure gradients had a significant effect on the mean velocity profiles in the near-wall region for the late-laminar and early transition stations. The mean temperature profile was observed to precede the velocity profile in starting and ending the transition process, opposite to what occurred in favorable pressure gradient cases in previous studies. A curve fit of the turbulent temperature profile in the log-linear region for the K2 case gave a conduction layer thickness of Y{sup +}=9.8 and an average Pr{sub t}=0.71. The wake region of the turbulent mean temperature profile was significantly suppressed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

"An investigation of the effect of cascade area ratios on transonic compressor performance","Wadia, A R; Copenhaver, W W","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS COMPRESSORS; PERFORMANCE; GAS TURBINES; COMPRESSOR BLADES; DESIGN","Transonic compressor rotor performance is highly sensitive to variations in cascade area ratios. This paper reports on the design, experimental evaluation, and three-dimensional viscous analysis of four low-aspect-ratio transonic rotors that demonstrate the effects of cascade throat area, internal contraction, and trailing edge effective camber on compressor performance. The cascade throat area study revealed that tight throat margins result in increased high-speed efficiency with lower part-speed performance. Stall line was also improved slightly over a wide range of speeds with a lower throat-to-upstream capture area ratio. Higher internal contraction, expressed as throat-to-mouth area ratio, also results in increased design point peak efficiency, but again costs performance at the lower speeds. Reducing the trailing edge effective camber, expressed as throat-to-exit area ratio, results in an improvement in peak efficiency level without significantly lowering the stall line. Among all four rotors, the best high-speed efficiency was obtained by the rotor with a tight throat margin and highest internal contraction, but its efficiency was the lowest at part speed. The best compromise between high-speed and part-speed efficiency was achieved by the rotor with a large throat and a lower trailing edge effective camber. The difference in the shock structure and the shock boundary layer interaction of the four blades was analyzed using a three-dimensional viscous code. The analytical results are used to supplement the data and provide further insight into the detailed physics of the flow field.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 760-770","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9653%%17","10.1115/1.2840932","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","404415","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404415","","Journal of Turbomachinery","4","118"
"Assessment of two- and three-scale {kappa}-{epsilon} models for rotating cavity flows","Guo, Z; Rhode, D L","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBULENT FLOW; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; GAS COMPRESSORS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES; GAS FLOW","A three-scale {kappa}-{epsilon} turbulence model was recently developed for complex flows such as the rotor-rotor and rotor-stator cavities found in gas turbine engines. The three-scale model is a logical extension of the previous two-scale {kappa}-{epsilon} model of Ko and Rhode (1990). Both multiscale turbulence models are presented and assessed via comparison with measurements for possible adoption in future cavity computations. A single computer code solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with a switch for selecting among the various turbulence models being compared was used. It was found for both cavity cases that the three-scale model gives a marginal improvement over the two-scale model. Further, both multiscale models give a substantial improvement over the standard {kappa}-{epsilon} model for the rotor-stator case, especially in the near-wall region where different eddy sizes are found. However, the feasibility of using a multiscale model for the rotor-rotor case is unclear since it gives improved values over the standard high-Re model in some regions but worse values in other regions. In addition, the solutions provide enhanced insight concerning the large changes in flow pattern previously photographed in the rotor-rotor case as rotation increases. In particular, it is shown how: (a) the number of recirculation zones increase with increasing rotation rate and (b) the recirculation zones decrease in size with a decreasing G ratio.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Because these engines often need additional exhaust treatment to bring them into compliance with environmental regulations, Houston Industrial Silencing (HIS) of Houston, Texas, has developed the DeNOx silencer for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) service. This SCR process employs ammonia injection with a catalytic formulated specifically for reduction of NO{sub x} and CO to required levels. The outstanding feature of this catalyst application (and the others mentioned here), is that there is virtually no slip of ammonia to atmosphere. At operating conditions, the ammonia will be consumed in the catalyst. Hence, elaborate ammonia control and monitoring are not necessary. NO{sub x} reduction by more than 80% has been experienced over a two year period of continuous maintenance-free operation on a natural gas-fueled, spark-ignited, two-cycle engine. Carbon monoxide reduction is greater than 80% and ammonia slip to atmosphere has never exceeded 10 ppm when NO{sub x} reduction is at the level of 75 ppm.

Siemens KWU, in cooperation with Ansaldo Energia, developed the new machine for enhanced power output and efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The V64.3A gas turbine is basically a 5400 r/min engine scaled down from the 50 Hz (3000 r/min) and 60 Hz (3600 r/min) machines. While its size has remained unchanged compared to the previous .3 model, many components were redesigned using the same principles as the larger machines. This paper briefly describes the design and specifications of the turbines and its components.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 42, 44","","","","Journal ID: DGWODS; ISSN 0278-5994; TRN: 97:000694-031","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","420767","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420767","","Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide","8","28"
"Modular approach to energy production","Mullins, P","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; POWER PLANTS; DESIGN; ENERGY; PRODUCTION; POWER GENERATION; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; MODULAR STRUCTURES","Many generator set packagers have been looking for ways to minimize capital and installation costs. Two established Netherlands-based companies are trying a modular system approach in which energy plants can be built up from series-produced and standard modules. The modular idea allows for design flexibility enabling the gen-sets to be tailored to suit a wide variety of customer requirements. Moreover, most of the modules can be transported to the installation site in standard containers, often translating into considerable savings. Assembly on site is straightforward and is carried out by local personnel under MESCO supervision. The company points out that the plant can be applied in places where there is limited infrastructure. The modules can be installed on floating pontoons or on land. The plant can usually be operational within a year from date of order, where series production of the modules makes fast delivery possible. When fully installed, the plant is locally controlled with central monitoring of fuel and lube oil supply, as well as the engine cooling system.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 88","","","","Journal ID: DGWODS; ISSN 0278-5994; TRN: 97:000694-023","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","420759","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420759","","Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide","8","28"

This paper focuses on the thermodynamic aspects of these plants, in comparison with full gasification cycles, assessing their performance on the basis of a common advanced power plant technology level. Several plant configurations are considered, including pressurized or atmospheric fluidized-bed, air- or steam-cooled, with different carbon conversion in the gasifier. The calculation method, used for reproducing plant energy balances and for performance prediction, is described in the paper. A complete second-law analysis is carried out, pointing out the efficiency loss breakdown for both technologies. Results show that partial gasification plants can achieve efficiencies consistently higher than IGCC, depending on plant configuration and carbon conversion, making this solution a viable and attractive option for efficient coal utilization.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 8.

"A NO{sub x} prediction scheme for lean-premixed gas turbine combustion based on detailed chemical kinetics","Polifke, W; Doebbeling, K; Sattelmayer, T; Nicol, D G; Malte, P C","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINES; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; NITROGEN OXIDES; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION","The lean-premixed technique has proven very efficient in reducing the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) from gas turbine combustors. The numerical prediction of NO{sub x} levels in such combustors with multidimensional CFD codes has only met with limited success so far. This is to some extent due to the complexity of the NO{sub x} formation chemistry in lean-premixed combustion, i.e., all three known NO{sub x} formation routes (Zeldovich, nitrous, and prompt) can contribute significantly. Furthermore, NO{sub x} formation occurs almost exclusively in the flame zone, where radical concentrations significantly above equilibrium values are observed. A relatively large chemical mechanism is therefore required to predict radical concentrations and NO{sub x} formation rates under such conditions. These difficulties have prompted the development of a NO{sub x} postprocessing scheme, where rate and concentration information necessary to predict NO{sub x} formation is taken from one-dimensional combustion models with detailed chemistry and provided--via look-up tables--to the multidimensional CFD code. The look-up tables are prepared beforehand in accordance with the operating conditions and are based on CO concentrations, which are indicative of free radical chemistry. Once the reacting flow field has been computed with the main CFD code, the chemical source terms of the NO transport equation, i.e., local NO formation rates, are determined from the reacting flow field and the tabulated chemical data. Then the main code is turned on again to compute the NO concentration field. This NO{sub x} submodel has no adjustable parameters and converges very quickly. Good agreement with experiment has been observed and interesting conclusions concerning superequilibrium O-atom concentrations and fluctuations of temperature could be drawn.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

"Exergy analysis for a gas turbine cogeneration system","Oh, S D; Pang, H S; Kim, S M; Kwak, H Y","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; DUAL-PURPOSE POWER PLANTS; EXERGY; GAS TURBINES; ECONOMICS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY","A general exergy balance equation that is applicable to any component of thermal systems has been formulated in this study. One of distinct features of this formulation is that the exergy involved in the component of any thermal system can be decomposed into exergy flows, entropy production flows, and the appropriate exergy rate terms such as fuel and available work. The exergy analysis based on this equation permits one to predict the thermal efficiency of the system, the exergy destruction in each component as well as the mass flow rate, the composition, and the temperature of the exhaust gases. The authors have examined the performance of a 1,000 kW gas turbine cogeneration system when it is operated at part and full-load conditions through this analysis. They have also tested the effect of the inlet air temperature and the relative humidity of the inlet air on the performance of the system. The predicted values of the performances for the system have been compared with the actual performance data provided by the gas turbine manufacturer. It has been found that the measured data of net power and the properties of exhaust gases are in good agreement with calculation ones, differing by less than 3%. The exergy balance equation may be utilized in the exergoeconomic analysis to estimate the production costs depending on various input costs in a gas turbine cogeneration system.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 1995 International mechanical engineering congress and exhibition, San Francisco, CA (United States), 12-17 Nov 1995; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 782-791","","CONF-951135-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9649%%115","10.1115/1.2816994","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","397907","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/397907","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","4","118"

Although gas turbines provide the primary output and efficiency gains for IGCC systems, as compared with conventional coal-fired power generation systems, they are commercially available only in specific size ranges. Therefore, it is up to the IGCC system designer to optimize the IGCC power plant within the required output, efficiency, and site conditions by selecting the system configuration carefully, particularly for air separation unit (ASU) integration incorporated with oxygen blown gasification systems. An IGCC system, based on a generic, entrained flow, oxygen blown gasification system and a GE STAG 109FA combined cycle has been evaluated with varying degrees of ASU integration, two fuel equivalent heating values and two gas turbine firing temperatures to provide net plant output and efficiency results. The data presented illustrate the system flexibility afforded by variation of ASU integration and the potential performance gains available through the continued use of gas turbine advances. Emphasis is placed on system design choices that favor either low initial investment cost or low operating cost for a given IGCC system output.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

NO{sub 2} formation has been reported to occur through the so-called HO{sub 2} mechanism in which NO combines with HO{sub 2} to produce NO{sub 2} and OH. In this study, the formation of NO{sub 2} was investigated at superatmospheric pressures through experiments and computer modeling. Computer modeling utilized the CHEMKIN chemical kinetics program and a subset of a previously published C-H-O-N system mechanism. Experimental work was conducted using a high-pressure flow reactor designed and built in the course of the study. The effects of pressure, temperature, and the presence of a NO{sub 2}-promoting hydrocarbon, methane, were investigated. It was discovered that as pressure increased from 1 atm to 8.5 atm, the rate and amount of NO converted to NO{sub 2} also increased. The results also show a temperature window between approximately 800 K and 1,000 K in which NO to NO{sub 2} conversion readily occurred. The presence of methane was seen to enhance NO conversation to NO{sub 2}, and a ratio of [CH{sub 4}]/[NO] was found to be a useful parameter in predicting NO{sub 2} formation. Significant NO conversion to NO{sub 2} was noted for [CH{sub 4}]/[NO] > 1 at the hydrocarbon injection point. Experimental results validated those trends obtained from modeling with a modified C-H-O-N mechanism.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Through an adaptive control algorithm of the AMB controller, unknown cross-coupling parameters of a rotor are estimated on-line by a standard least-square estimator along with a time-varying so-called forgetting factor. The parameters of the AMB controller are adapted in order to compensate for the cross-coupling effects and to stabilize the rotor system. Transient cross-coupling response characteristics are calculated by numerical simulation of a rigid rotor supported by two active magnetic bearings. With this kind of control strategy, the stability of the system can be guaranteed for much higher values of cross-coupling coefficients than with common nonadaptive feedback controllers, designed with pole placement or least square algorithms.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 40.

Three different grids were employed to ensure that conclusions are not affected by the grid refinement. It was found that using a combustion model based on the chemical equilibrium assumption, the predicted gas species concentrations are in good agreement with the data and the temperature profiles display the correct trend, although the temperature was underpredicted, especially in the burner region.

The advantage of this approach over current methods lies in the use of an advanced neural network. The neural network is trained to contain the knowledge of a detailed finite-element model whose results are integrated with system measurements to produce accurate machine fault diagnostics and component stress predictions. This technique takes advantage of recent advances in neural network technology that enable real-time machinery diagnostics and component stress prediction to be performed on a PC with the accuracy of finite-element analysis.

Cogeneration plants, which are designed to maximize fuel efficiency by converting turbine exhaust into additional steam and/or electricity, need to boost performance during the peak demand periods in the summer. Gas-turbine output drops in the summer, however, because the air is hotter. One solution, known as refrigerative cooling, is to cool the air entering the gas-turbine inlet, which increases turbine power output by 25 to 30 percent during peak periods.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-72","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9705%%358","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","417984","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/417984","","Mechanical Engineering","10","118"
"Verifying ventilation flows","Laster, W R; Sanford, G W","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; COOLING; AIR FLOW; POWER PLANTS; HOT WIRE ANEMOMETERS","An innovative technique using a hot-film anemometer has been developed for measuring the flow distribution through generator rotors. When designing large air-cooled generators with the highest efficiency, engineers need to know the total flow rate to the rotor as well as the flow distribution to ensure there are no local hot spots. However, gaining an understanding of generator ventilation has been hampered by a lack of experimental data on rotating machines. Furthermore, while the axial flow distribution along the rotor body can be estimated using standard techniques, such methods average the flow in the circumferential direction. To overcome these limitations, engineers at Westinghouse Electric Corp.`s Power Generation Technology Division in Orlando, Fla., have developed a novel technique for measuring airflow through each vent hole. The technique uses a hot-film anemometer--a velocity-measurement device with a very-high-frequency response--to measure such flows separately while the rotor is spinning at a rated speed of 3,600 rpm.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 92-93","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9705%%359","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","417985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/417985","","Mechanical Engineering","10","118"
"Benzene hydrogenation as a tool for the determination of the percentage of metal exposed on low loaded ceria supported rhodium catalysts","Fajardie, F; Tempere, J F; Djega-Mariadassou, G","40 CHEMISTRY; 33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; BENZENE; HYDROGENATION; CERIUM OXIDES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; RHODIUM; CATALYST SUPPORTS; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS; CHEMISORPTION; SPECIFIC SURFACE AREA; CALCINATION; REDUCTION","Benzene hydrogenation, a structure insensitive reaction, was used to determine the percentage of metal exposed on low loaded ceria supported rhodium 0.15 to 0.33 wt% Rh/CeO{sub 2} catalysts. Catalysts were prepared from nitrated and chlorinated precursors. Freshly prepared catalysts and catalysts aged in air at 1173 K were studied. Hydrogen chemisorption carried out at 313 K on the chlorinated catalysts could be used to confirm the technique since, due to the presence of Cl{sup {minus}} ions on the samples, no hydrogen spillover was observed after reduction at 773 K. Data obtained from benzene hydrogenation were found to be in very good agreement with the percentages of metal exposed as calculated from hydrogen chemisorption measurements. Benzene hydrogenation was able to count very low percentages of metal exposed and it was shown from the data obtained for the nonchlorinated catalysts that, unlike hydrogen chemisorption, it was not disturbed by the hydrogen spillover occurring on some Rh/CeO{sub 2} systems. The stability of the metal phase was investigated when rhodium was deposited on both high and low surface area ceria. It appeared that anionic exchange on a low specific surface area ceria could lead to a catalyst which, after calcination at 1173 K and reduction at 773 K, exhibits the same amount of exposed metallic rhodium atoms compared to a catalyst prepared from a high specific surface area ceria, hence, containing 50% more rhodium. 34 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 77-86","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000207-0008","10.1006/jcat.1996.0306","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508460","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508460","","Journal of Catalysis","1","163"

As in earlier studies, the SERS-active transition-metal surfaces are prepared by electro-depositing ultrathin films onto electrochemically roughened gold. These surfaces display remarkably robust SERS activity, enabling intense Raman spectra to be obtained over a range of reactant pressures (here up to 1 atm) and at temperatures up to at least 400{degrees}C. During nitric oxide adsorption at 1 atm on Pt, both terminal (240 and 470 cm{sup {minus}1}) and bridged (325 cm{sup {minus}1}) states of molecular NO were detected at lower temperatures (25-200{degrees}C), with some dissociation occurring at higher (ca 250{degrees}C) temperatures as evidenced by the presence of atomic nitrogen (295 cm{sup {minus}1}). Similarly, a bridge NO species (310 cm{sup {minus}1}) was observed on Pd under similar conditions, with dissociation detected in the form of atomic nitrogen (285 cm{sup {minus}1}) and surface oxide (450 and 665 cm{sup {minus}1}). Co-dosing of reactants on platinum produced a surface dominated by NO and CO (470 and 2080 cm{sup {minus}1}), whereas the former was adsorbed preferentially on Pd. Simultaneous SERS/MS measurements were performed during reaction of an equimolar reactant mixture at 1 atm of total pressure over both metals. Both CO{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O were formed during reaction on Pt, with onset of detectable product formation correlating with depletion of adsorbed CO and NO, respectively. In contrast, CO{sub 2} was the only product detected over Pd, with the depletion of surface oxygen suggesting that NO dissociation may be rate limiting at higher temperatures (ca 300{degrees}C). 69 refs., 11 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 163; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 63-76","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CTS-9312008; TRN: 97:000207-0007","10.1006/jcat.1996.0305","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","508459","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/508459","","Journal of Catalysis","1","163"

For example, at 0.040 atm NO and 773 K, Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} had a specific activity of 3.5 x 10{sup {minus}4} {mu}mole N{sub 2}/s/m{sup 2} and an activation energy of 11 kcal/mole, while for Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} comparable values were 6.5 x 10{sup {minus}5} {mu}mole N{sub 2}/s/m{sup 2} and 15 kcal/mole, respectively. Based on NO chemisorption at 300 K, these specific activities correspond to turnover frequencies of 7.5 x 10{sup {minus}5} s{sup {minus}1} and 1.6 x 10{sup {minus}5} s{sup {minus}1} for Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} and Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4}, respectively. Pretreatment in He at 873 K produced more O{sub 2} desorption from Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} (6.1 molecules O{sub 2}/m{sup 2}) than from Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} (2.2 molecules O{sub 2}/m{sup 2}), but no charges in either XRD pattern were detected. Consequently, oxygen vacancies were formed and, as in previous studies, activity is associated with these vacancies. Reaction orders on NO ranged from 1.4 to 1.9 between 833 and 873 K, with the higher values occurring with O{sub 2} in the feed. Negative reaction orders on O{sub 2} were around - 0.3 and not strongly dependent on temperature. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood model involving a surface reaction between two adsorbed NO molecules fit the data well and gave kinetic parameters which provided the following values; for the reaction between two adsorbed NO molecules, E{sub a}=46 kcal/mole; for NO adsorption, {delta}H{sub ad}{sup o} = -25 kcal/mole and {delta}S{sub ad}{sup o} = 125 cal/mole/K; for O{sub 2} adsorption. {delta}H{sub ad}{sup o} = -35 kcal/mole and {delta}S{sub ad}{sup o} = -31 cal/mole/K.

The precursor samples were reduced in flowing hydrogen at 423 K. The NO-H{sub 2} reaction over these catalysts took place at relatively low temperatures under isothermal conditions from 373 to 673 K. The Au(I)/NaY catalysts were more active toward the above reaction compared with the Au{sup 0}/NaY catalysts. The NO selectivity was pointed to the N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O formation, with the former catalysts being more selective to N{sub 2}. In situ FT-IR study of the NO-H{sub 2} reaction compared with the Au{sup 0}/NaY catalysts. The NO selectivity was pointed to the N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O formation, with the former catalysts being more selective to N{sub 2}. In situ FT-IR study of the NO-H{sub 2} reaction on the gold catalysts demonstrated that NH{sub 3} was detected in the adsorbed NH{sub 4}{sup +} form at 1440 cm{sup -1}, along with N{sub 2}O at 2240 (2220) cm{sup -1} and H{sub 2}O at 1645 cm{sup -1}. Two characteristic bands due to the vibrations of N-O bond is adsorbed NO were identified. The bands at 1880 cm{sup -1} in the spectra of Au{sup 0}/NaY were assigned to Au{sup n+}-NO (n{approx}0) complexes, and the corresponding bands at 1910 cm{sup -1} in the spectra of Au(I)/NaY were assigned to Au{sup n+} NO (n=1) complexes in cages of zeolite. It was proposed that N{sub 2}O and NH{sub 3} formed simultaneously at low to moderate temperatures (<500 K) by the addition of N atom to NO and H atoms, respectively. The presence of adsorbed N atoms was confirmed by the coadsorption of NO/CO/H{sub 2} mixture onto Au(I)NaY at 423 K, where a band at 2280 cm{sup -1} ascribed to isocyanate [NCO] intermediate was developed intensively with time. This band did not deliver when mixture of NO/CO was admitted alone to the IR cell.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 169-178","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000357-0002","10.1006/jcat.1996.0274","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494268","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494268","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to statistically determine the number of components (oxidation states) that describe the V 2p{sub 3/2} envelope of the reduced V/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalyst. The peak positions and FWHMs of the components were obtained from iterative target transformation factor analysis (ITTFA). The V 2p{sub 3/2} envelope is composed of two components (oxidation states), which are centered at 517.2 and 515.5 eV (FWHMs of 2.6 and 2.3 eV, respectively) when H{sub 2} is the reducing agent and at 517.3 and 515.8 eV (FWHMs 2.7-2.8 eV) when CO is the reducing agent. The components were assigned to V{sup 5+} and V{sup 3+} based on the difference in the binding energies and the results of a volumetric study of catalyst reduction in CO. The spectral information gained from PCA and ITTFA was used to curve fit the V 2p envelopes. The extent of reduction of the V phase was estimated from the relative abundances of V{sup 5+} and V{sup 3+} determined by curve fitting and corrected for the presumably lower dispersion of the V{sup 3+} species. The results indicated a decrease in the average oxidation state of V to 3.5 with increasing the reduction temperature in H{sub 2} up to 662{degrees}C. Reduction in the presence of CO was measured volumetrically and showed a decrease in the average oxidation state from 5 to 3.3 over the temperature range 155-510{degrees}C. Curve fitting the spectra of the CO-reduced samples using the two spectral components identified through factor analysis yielded an average oxidation state of ca.3.6 upon reduction at 510{degrees}C. 40 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 162; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 27-34","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant CHE-9022135; TRN: 97:000357-0024","10.1006/jcat.1996.0120","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","494290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/494290","","Journal of Catalysis","2","162"

Solutions are obtained for temporal, spatial, and traveling waves using Navier Stokes, boundary layer, and perturbation expansion equations. A wide range of parameters are considered for all the three waves. The results are presented in terms of Stokes-layer overshoots, phase leads (lags), and streaming. The response to the temporal wave showed all the previously reported features. The magnitude and nature of the response are small and simple such that it is essentially a small disturbance on the steady solution. Results are explainable in terms of one parameter {zeta} (the frequency of oscillation). For the spatial wave, the magnitude and the nature of the response are significantly increased and complex such that it cannot be considered simply a small disturbance on the without-wave solution. The results are explainable in terms of the two parameters {lambda}{sup {minus}1} and x/{lambda} (where {lambda} is the wavelength). A clear asymmetry is observed in the wake response for the spatial wave. An examination of components of the perturbation expansion equations indicates that the asymmetry is a first-order effect due to nonlinear interaction between the steady and first-harmonic velocity components. For the traveling wave, the responses are more complex and an additional parameter, c (the wave speed), is required to explain the results. In general, for small wave speeds the results are similar to a spatial wave, whereas for higher wave speeds the response approaches the temporal wave response. The boundary layer and perturbation expansion solutions compares well with the Navier Stokes solution in their range of validity.","","","","Office of Naval Research, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 537-545","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9708%%312","10.1115/1.2817792","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","427985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/427985","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","3","118"

The purpose of the present paper is to introduce a novel method to aid in the evaluation of the various parameters that affect the fouling phenomenon. The method considers the particle-surface interaction from the energy balance at the point of impaction and takes into consideration the material properties of the particle and surface as well as the effect of the surrounding flow field on the particle movement and impaction. The calculated deposition flux is used to form the deposit evolution in time considering the removal mechanisms resulting from fluid shear stress and the eroding impacts of the particles. The model is validated against experimental measurements of particle deposition from a two phase flow of hot gases around a circular cylinder. The experimentally measured flow field around a staggered tube bundle is also predicted and a fouling analysis is performed regarding the validity of fouling studies in scaled down model configurations. It is concluded that the actual dimensions of the heat exchanger configuration are of vital importance to its fouling behavior and scaling laws are difficult to apply.","","","","Commission of the European Communities, Brussels (Belgium)","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 574-581","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9708%%317","10.1115/1.2817797","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","427990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/427990","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","3","118"
"Similarity solution for a turbulent round jet","Seffal, R; Michaelides, E E","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 42 ENGINEERING NOT INCLUDED IN OTHER CATEGORIES; JETS; FLOW MODELS; CALCULATION METHODS; TURBULENT FLOW; NUMERICAL SOLUTION","Turbulent round jets are encountered in a variety of forms in engineering and natural systems. Among the similarity solutions, Wollmers and Rotta used the self-preserving property of a turbulent jet and developed a k-kl model to solve the turbulence closure problem. So obtained similarity solutions for a round jet by assuming a velocity profile in the form of a gaussian error function. This assumption is very restrictive because it does not allow the shape of the velocity profile to evolve from the governing equations, but compels them to accommodate the assumed velocity profile. Paullay et al. used the principle of moving equilibrium, to derive a similarity solution for plane and radial jets. Their solution is not general enough to include the round axisymmetric jets, which are most commonly met in engineering practice, because the governing equations used are not applicable to round jets. The authors followed essentially the method by Paullay et al. and derived a similarity solution for the turbulent, axisymmetric round jet, without using any assumptions about the shape of the velocity profile.

A frequency scanning technique is implemented for eigenvalue analysis of the elastic system. Due to the uncertainty of the values of stiffness and damping coefficients, a sensitivity analysis method is also presented, suitable for the evaluation of the range of the mechanical stresses. Special consideration is given to the correct simulation of the coupling to the electric network, including the influence of generator regulators and possible network interactions. An exact formula is extracted for the synchronizing and damping torque coefficients.

Recent advances in this field make it possible to operate some power plants well beyond their nominal design life, with tremendous potential savings. The first step in conducting life assessment is to determine the present condition of a component. EPRI has championed a three-level approach to this task: calculations to screen for potential damage, nondestructive evaluation to detect degradation and cracks. and refined analysis based on destructive testing. In thin-section components, rupture results from uniform, bulk damage. In heavy-section components, on the other hand, failure results from cracking in localized regions of stress concentration. For components that are brittle and either highly stressed or subject to high cycle fatigue, crack initiation essentially signals the end of life. However, for components that are stationary or made from highly ductile steels, crack propagation can be tolerated up to some critical level, and periodic inspections can help keep the component in service. Research on advanced methods for assessing material condition nondestructively and more accurately is continuing.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-34","","","","Journal ID: EPRJDS; ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 96:006555-001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","420902","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420902","","EPRI Journal","5","21"

As the first step of prediction, the authors constructed the scenario from an estimation of the cavity generation rate to the prediction of impact force spectrum, including the estimations of collapsing cavity number and impact pressure. The prediction was compared with measurements of impact force spectra on a partially cavitating hydrofoil. A good quantitative agreement was obtained between the prediction and the experiment. However, the present method predicted a larger effect of main flow velocity than that observed.

Deregulation and downsizing have each had significant impact within the power industry. Because of these trends, power generators need to take advantage of every competitive strategy available to them. Increasingly, this means outsourcing non-core activities. More and more power generators are realizing the benefits of outsourcing their water treatment services, particularly for boiler make-up water. Working with a water treatment partner can be a cost-effective, hassle-free way of guaranteeing a consistent flow of pure water using the latest technologies with minimal environmental impact.

One way to increase capacity is to increase peaking combustion turbine efficiency, and lowering combustion turbine ambient temperature is an effective way of doing just that. In their paper, Modeling of Hybrid Combustion Turbine Inlet Air Cooling Systems, authors J. Cross, W. Beckman, J. Mitchell, University of Wisconsin-Madison Solar Energy Laboratory, D. Reindl, University of Wisconsin-Madison EPRI HVAC and R Center, and D. Knebel, CES Group, cited several combustion turbine inlet air cooling methods that have been used to compensate for performance decline at high temperatures. These include evaporative cooling; direct cooling with electric chillers; direct cooling with absorption chillers fired using exhaust heat; and cool storage, also called thermal energy storage. Cool storage charged during off-peak periods emerged as a viable, cost-effective means of increasing combustion turbine capacity. This was not only the above authors` conclusion, but J. Andrepont, Chicago Bridge and Iron Co., presented a similar opinion in his paper, Performance and Economics of CT Inlet Air Cooling Using Chilled Water Storage.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 32-39","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9705%%325","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","417952","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/417952","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","9","100"

The corona discharge current-voltage characteristics have two operating modes which have a significant influence on NO{sub x} removal characteristics, where the threshold value of the treatment gas to seed gas flow rate ratio is about 8. The hysteresis of corona current-voltage characteristics is observed in this system. For longer operational time, corona current and NO{sub x} removal rate significantly changes with time. When the operation of the apparatus starts at relatively low applied voltage, the corona current under constant applied voltage increases with time to reach a maximum value, then decreasing with time to reach a steady state. At this condition, high NO{sub x} removal efficiency can be achieved.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society annual meeting, October 2--7, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1058-1062","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9705%%378","10.1109/28.536866","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","418004","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/418004","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","5","32"

Martin station first rose up from the Everglades in the early 1980s, with the construction of two 814-MW oil-fired steam plants, Units 1 and 2. Natural-gas-firing capability was added to the balanced-draft, natural-circulation boilers in 1986, increasing the station`s fuel flexibility. Martin then leaped into the headlines in the early 1990s when it added combined-cycle (CC) Units 3 and 4. With this 860-MW expansion, FP and L boldly became the fleet leader for the advanced, 2350F-class 7FA gas turbines. Further pushing he technology envelope, the CC includes a three-pressure reheat steam system that raises net plant efficiency for Units 3 and 4 to 54%, on a lower-heating-value (LHV) basis. Incorporating the reheat cycle required significant redesign of the gas-turbine/heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) train, in order to maintain a rapid startup capability without exceeding metallurgical limits. Perhaps even more important than the technological achievements, Martin stands out from the crowd for its people power, which ensured that the promises of advanced technology actually came to fruition. This station`s aggressive, empowered O and M team shows that you can pioneer technology, reduce operating costs, and deliver high availability--all at the same time.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-50","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9705%%383","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","418008","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/418008","","Power (New York)","8","140"

In their relentless drive to remain competitive, electric utilities with oil-fired generating units are searching for lower cost fuel alternatives. Because of high fuel prices, oil-fired units have low capacity factors. Only 23 out of 142 oil-capable units in the US had capacity factors greater than 50% in 1993; the average was a mere 24%. Utility consumption of fuel oil slid from over 600,000 barrels (bbl)/day in 1989 to less than 200,000 bbl/day last year. Orimulsion now fuels nearly 3,000 MW/yr worldwide. The UK`s PowerGen Ltd, currently the world`s largest consumer of Orimulsion, fires some 10-million bbl/yr at two 500-MW units at its Ince plant and three 120-MW units at its Richborough plant. Both plants formerly burned fuel oil, and have been using Orimulsion since 1991. Canada`s New Brunswick Power Corp has fired Orimulsion in two units at its Dalhousie plant since 1994 (Power, April 1995, p 27); one 105-MW unit was originally designed for fuel oil, the other 212-MW unit was designed for coal. Last year, Denmark`s SK Power converted its coal-fired, 700-MW Asnaes Unit 5 to Orimulsion firing. And in the US, Florida Power and Light Co. (FP and L) has signed a 20-yr fuel supply contract with Bitor America Corp (Boca Raton, Fla.), for two 800-MW units at the oil-fired Manatee plant, contingent on securing necessary permits. The Manatee installation (Power, September 1994, p 57) would be the first in the US to burn the fuel. Today, five years after Orimulsion begun to be used commercially, many of the lingering questions involving the new fuel`s handling, transportation, combustion, emissions control, spill control, and waste utilization have been settled. Several US utilities have expressed serious interest in the fuel as an alternative to oil.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 113-116","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9705%%388","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","418011","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/418011","","Power (New York)","8","140"

"Magnetic bearings give new meaning to spin control","Swanekamp, R","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 42 ENGINEERING NOT INCLUDED IN OTHER CATEGORIES; TURBOMACHINERY; MAGNETIC BEARINGS; INDUSTRIAL PLANTS; GAS COMPRESSORS; NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; POWER PLANTS","In the past, their large size, high cost, and complicated controls ruled out practical application. But the last magnetic bearings are making commercial inroads in the natural-gas industry. Demonstration projects, limited in duration and results, may secure acceptance by powerplants, too. Alternatives to conventional oil-lubricated bearings have appeared from time to time. Steam- and gas-lubricated varieties are examples. But except for a few niche applications, no alternatives have garnered commercial acceptance. A relatively recent development, magnetic bearings, may finally break the mold. Potential benefits are enticing: A shaft suspended in air and positioned against end thrust by magnetic forces suffers negligible friction, thereby lowering starting torque and power losses; bearing wear, and in some cases, shaft seals, are eliminated, extending service life and reducing maintenance; repairs largely consist of a technician replacing a card in the control system, as opposed to a mechanical crew tearing down and replacing a conventional bearing; imbalance forces are canceled or controlled without transmitting large forces to the foundation; lubricants, which can contaminate process fluids and pose fire hazards, are eliminated or substantially reduced. These benefits have been realized for years in centrifuges, machine tools, and space applications. Now magnetic bearings are making substantial inroads in large-scale, industrial turbo-machinery, led by commercial use in gas pipeline compressors, along with demonstration projects on powerplant pumps and fans.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 117-121","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9705%%389","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","418012","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/418012","","Power (New York)","8","140"

One focus of the study is to evaluate the variability in feed coal compositions and resulting variability in the composition of combustion solids. Major, minor, and trace element composition and mineralogy are determined on most samples. In addition, modes of occurrence, magnetic properties, stable and radiogenic isotopic composition, organic chemistry, and leachability under different conditions are determined on selected samples. Mass balance calculations show that most elements (data for Hg are not available) are retained in the solid waste products except for Se. The ratios of trace elements in the fly ash to bottom ash for both units are very similar to the order of element volatility reported in the literature. Ni, Cr, and Co show substantial enrichment in the magnetic fraction of the fly ash from the low-sulfur unit. Laboratory leaching of the fly ash and bottom ash shows that the magnetic particles are very rapidly dissolved by mild acids. Fission track results indicate that U is uniformly distributed within some fly ash cenospheres. Dark, iron-rich glass may have higher concentrations of U than does clear glass. The distribution of As appears to be uniform at low levels in most fly ash particles.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AAPG Bulletin; Journal Volume: 80; Journal Issue: 9; Conference: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) gulf coast association of geological societies meeting, San Antonio, TX (United States), 2-4 Oct 1996; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1523b","","CONF-9610180-","","Journal ID: AABUD2; ISSN 0149-1423; TRN: 96:005901-0060","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","411928","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/411928","","AAPG Bulletin","9","80"

This so called magnetic slurry can, then, be regarded as a highly ductile magnetic conducting material for tentative use in magnetic circuit that can change shape under operation. The high particle content results in high saturation field densities that extend the application field towards electric power engineering. This paper, therefore, focuses on properties like relative permeability losses, the Q-factor and the efficiency for the power frequencies 50 and 400 Hz. It shows that the relative permeabilities are low (below 10). The values of the efficiency and the Q-factor decrease considerably above 0.5 T. That limits the application of the studied slurry in electric power engineering. In such applications, the powder properties must be improved.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 5Pt2; Conference: 1996 IEEE international magnetics conference, Seattle, WA (United States), 9-12 Apr 1996; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5109-5111","","CONF-960425-","","Journal ID: IEMGAQ; ISSN 0018-9464; TRN: IM9651%%212","10.1109/20.539506","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","403177","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/403177","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","5Pt2","32"

Estimating a range of exposures in a given population requires an understanding of the variability of ventilation rates in the population. Distribution of ventilation rates (Ve) were described based on the results of a large study where Ve were measured while subjects performed a variety of physical tasks. Three distinct ventilation levels were identified using cluster analyses of the mean Ve and then various activities were assigned to the three levels using a k-means procedure. Separate distributions were identified for the three Ve levels for adult males, adult females, and children. The variability of Ve was consistent with a lognormal distribution for all groups. An aggregate daily inhalation rate can be estimated based on the distributions of Ve. 41 refs., 1 fig., 5 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Health Perspectives; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 974-979","","","","Journal ID: EVHPAZ; ISSN 0091-6765; TRN: 97:003402-0001","10.1289/ehp.96104974","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","530567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/530567","","Environmental Health Perspectives","9","104"

It is widely agreed that gas turbines will remain the dominant form of technology for power generation for the next decade or two, making them the power generation technology of choice for today and the future. The pre-eminent stature of gas turbines can be attributed to their low capital costs, high efficiency, low emissions, short permitting and construction lead times, and proven reliability. The versatility of gas turbines also makes them unique among power generation technologies, as they can economically serve a wide spectrum of applications and sizes--from distributed generation to industrial cogeneration and central station generation. Three primary factors contribute to the growing interest in gas turbine-based power generation and the role gas turbines will play in the future power generation market: An optimistic outlook for the supply and price of natural gas; technology advances that have produced substantial improvements in efficiency and emissions; and emissions regulations that may favor the use of gas turbines over traditional fossil-fueled steam turbines. These three factors are discussed.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 94; Journal Issue: 33; Other Information: PBD: 12 Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-48","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9636%%322","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","276597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/276597","","Oil and Gas Journal","33","94"

The mainstream is akin to that under real engine conditions with stagnation temperature 1,900 K and stagnation pressure 3 MPa. It is found that with the ratio of coolant to mainstream mass flow being fixed, reducing the spanwise pitch for shower-head holes (P) from 7.5d to 3.0d, where d is the hole diameter, increases the average effectiveness considerably over the blade surface. However, when P/d = 7.5, increasing the coolant mass flow increases the effectiveness on the pressure surface but reduces it on the suction surface owing to coolant jet lift-off. For P/d = 4.5 or 3.0, such an anomaly does not occur within the range of coolant-to-mainstream-mass-flow ratios analyzed. In all cases, adiabatic effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient are highly three-dimensional.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-08-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Numerical Heat Transfer.

To develop suitable alloy chemistry, austenite and ferrite stabilizing elements were balanced to create an oxidation- and corrosion-resistant martensitic steel. It differs from other 9 to 12% chromium steels in two important ways: strength is provided by a uniform dispersion of coarsening-resistant titanium carbide (TiC) precipitates rather than chromium-rich, M{sub 23}C{sub 6} particles; and the TiC particles are precipitated in austenite prior to the martensitic transformation, not during tempering. As a result, the microstructure provides much higher creep strength than conventional martensitic steels. Potential applications include superheater and reheater tubes, steam headers and pipes in fossil-fueled power stations, and tubes and pipes in oil refineries. Other applications include casings in certain down-hole oil field operations, forged components for steam turbines, and valves for internal combustion engines. This article describes the methodology involved in designing the unique microstructure, and compares creep data of the new grade with that of Grade 91, a conventional 9% chromium martensitic steel.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advanced Materials and Processes; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 27-29","","","","Journal ID: AMAPEX; ISSN 0882-7958; TRN: IM9640%%18","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","367272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/367272","","Advanced Materials and Processes","2","150"

Intrinsic kinetics of NO{sub x} reduction were determined over the catalyst in powder form. The behavior of the catalyst in the shape of a honeycomb was investigated with respect to the influence of area velocity, reaction temperature, and NH{sub 3}/NO feed ratio on the NO reduction efficiency.

These steels are applied in a structurally non-stable state and, hence, a detailed knowledge of the structural change kinetics of the materials is needed. Carbides are an important structure component of these materials. Since chromium is the prevailing metallic constituent of the carbides in these Fe-Cr steels, its diffusion characteristics are factors of critical importance for better understanding of structural changes. The high-temperature volume diffusion of Cr in specified materials has been studied in papers, the chromium grain boundary diffusivity above 896 K has been measured. The operation temperatures of steam power generators, however, lie below 900 K, where the diffusion runs almost exclusively along the grain boundaries. The simple extrapolation of high-temperature data on grain boundary diffusion to lower temperatures can lead to a certain overestimation of the diffusivities and, therefore, new measurements in the low-temperature region are desirable. In this work, the diffusion characteristics of {sup 51}Cr were measured in the temperature range including the projected maximum temperatures of the rotors of steam-power generators.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1 Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 411-416","","","","Journal ID: XZ503X; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9635%%16","10.1016/1359-6462(96)00148-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","271589","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/271589","","Scripta Materialia","3","35"

(SCE) has freed itself from more expensive stack-gas measurement methods to achieve full compliance with government regulations for NO{sub x} emissions. SCE has reduced NO{sub x} emissions from 32 boilers at its nine gas-fired plants by an average of 86 percent, from a high of 140 ppm down to as low as 7 ppm in some units. SCE needed a system that would provide high accuracy and reliability, and also work with existing combustion control metering runs. In addition, they required a high turndown ratio (>15:1) to measure fuel-gas flow from light-off to full power operation with an accuracy of {+-}2 percent of the mass flow rate over the full turndown range. Accuracy was especially important because the utility had chosen to measure its flue-gas flows inferentially, by measuring flue-gas flows into its boilers and calculating NO{sub x} emissions, rather than through stack-gas flow measurement methods. The inferential technique is accepted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Pollution Engineering; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 59","","","","Journal ID: PLENBW; ISSN 0032-3640; TRN: IM9639%%138","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","287550","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/287550","","Pollution Engineering","8","28"

Original equipment manufacturers are catering to the needs of turbine owners by offering a smorgasbord of options for retrofit, whether or not they manufactured the original turbine. Not every retrofit requires total replacement of major components, and the diagnostic tools available to manufacturers today allow them to customize separate components to fit existing equipment with the highest efficiency and capacity boost possible. Higher efficiency and capacity are typical results expected from these retrofits, but the benefits extend beyond these obvious basics. Besides lower fuel costs and lower emissions resulting from increased emissions resulting from increased efficiency, the improvements to the steam turbine can ease the stress on other aging components such as the boiler and emissions controls and reduce costs associated with ash disposal. Furthermore, the improved reliability from replacing life-limited components leads to reduced inspection and maintenance costs. Engineers are lowering overall costs by improving steam path design, controlling leakage, refining blade profiles and controlling erosion and corrosion. These areas consume most of the efficiency-loss pie.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 21-23","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9705%%327","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","417953","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/417953","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","8","100"

These engineers applied advances in the knowledge of thermodynamics and aerodynamics, developments in metallurgy and new manufacturing techniques, and improved the new machine until it reached its current status as the dominant technology for producing electricity world wide.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-30","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9705%%328","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","417954","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/417954","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","8","100"

Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide stack gas concentrations were made for each oil. Flue gases were also sampled to determine levels of volatile and semivolatile organic compounds and of metals. Analytical procedures were used to provide more detailed information regarding the emissions rates for carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in addition to the standard analyses for volatile and semivolatile organics. Metals emissions were greater than organic emissions for all oils tested, by an order of magnitude. Carbonyls dominated the organic emissions, with emission rates more than double the remaining organics for all four oils tested. Formaldehyde made up the largest percentage of carbonyls, at roughly 50% of these emissions for three of the four oils, and approximately 30% of the carbonyl emissions from the low sulfur No. 6 oil. Naphthalene was found to be the largest part of the PAH emissions for three of the four oils, with phenanthrene being greatest for the No. 2 fuel oil.

The associations are observed at levels below the current US standard of 150 {mu}g/m{sup 3} (24 hr). Health effects include acute increased mortality from cardiopulmonary conditions and acute morbidity such as hospital admissions for related diseases. We reviewed recent epidemiology studies to evaluate whether criteria for causality are met, and we conclude that they are not. The weak associations are as likely to be due to confounding by weather, copollutants, or exposure mis-classification as by ambient particulate matter (PM). The results from the same metropolitan areas are inconsistent, and PM explains such a small amount of the variability in mortality/morbidity that the association has little practical significance. Finally, experimental chamber studies of susceptible individuals exposed to PM concentrations well above 150 {mu}g/m{sup 3} provide no evidence to support the morbidity/mortality findings. None of the criteria for establishing causality of the PM/mortality hypothesis are clearly met at ambient concentrations common in many US cities. 97 refs., 1 fig., 6 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Health Perspectives; Journal Volume: 104; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 838-850","","","","Journal ID: EVHPAZ; ISSN 0091-6765; TRN: 97:003867-0001","10.1289/ehp.96104838","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","539154","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/539154","","Environmental Health Perspectives","8","104"

Studies of the biological activities of stereochemically defined BP-DNA adducts and the comparison of the solution structure of the (-)-cis-anti-[BP]dG{center_dot}dC 11-mer duplex with its stereoisomeric counterparts should lead to new insights into the relationships between defined helical distortions and mutagenic specificity and activity. 55 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Biochemistry (Eaton); Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 30; Other Information: PBD: 30 Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 9850-9863","","","FG02-90ER60931; AC05-96OR22464","Journal ID: BICHAW; ISSN 0006-2960; CNN: Grant CA-46533;Grant CA-20851;Grant CA-28038;Grant RR-06458; TRN: 97:001058-0001","10.1021/bi9605346","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","490280","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/490280","","Biochemistry (Eaton)","30","35"

Although a modification of Peek`s formula for the hyperboid-to-plane was initially used to establish a boundary condition at the edge of the corona, predicted total current did not agree with measured values. As a result, it was necessary to use measured current-voltage characteristics to establish the space charge density at the outer surface of the corona sheath. An additional problem in modeling point discharges is specification of shape and size of the corona sheath.

The reduction of NO{sub x} emissions and increasing the inlet temperature of gas turbines are the most significant issues in gas turbine development in Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation systems. The coal gasified fuel, which is produced in a coal gasifier of an air-blown entrained-flow type has a calorific value as low as 1/10 of natural gas. Furthermore, the fuel gas contains ammonia when a gas cleaning system is a hot type, and ammonia will be converted to nitrogen oxides in the combustion process of a gas turbine. This study is performed in a 1,500 C-class gas turbine combustor firing low-Btu coal-gasified fuel in IGCC systems. An advanced rich-lean combustor of 150-MW class gas turbine was designed to hold stable combustion burning low-Btu gas and to reduce fuel NO{sub x} emissions from the ammonia in the fuel. The main fuel and the combustion air are supplied into a fuel-rich combustion chamber with strong swirl flow and make fuel-rich flame to decompose ammonia into intermediate reactants such as NHi and HCN. The secondary air is mixed with primary combustion gas dilatorily to suppress the oxidation of ammonia reactants in fuel-lean combustion chamber and to promote a reducing process to nitrogen. By testing under atmospheric pressure conditions, the authors have obtained a very significant result through investigating the effect of combustor exit gas temperature on combustion characteristics. Since they have ascertained the excellent performance of the tested combustor through their extensive investigation, they wish to report on the results.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 534-540","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9641%%263","10.1115/1.2816680","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","372186","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372186","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","118"

The FT8-2 digital fuel control system was developed to achieve the precise multizone fuel metering of both gas and liquid fuels, the calculation of combustor air flow necessary to achieve Dry Low NO{sub x} and the traditional governing/limiting control loops necessary for safe, stable engine operation. The system design goals were accomplished by the concurrent development of software-based fuel metering algorithms and fuel metering hardware. The fuel metering hardware utilizes an all-electronic valve positioner, employing a combination of feedback and software to achieve closed-loop control of actual fuel flow. Extensive testing under actual gas flow conditions and closed-loop bench testing using a real time engine model and fuel system model was conducted to prove system operation and develop system transient response prior to installation on the test engine. The setup and results of the flow testing and closed-loop testing are described. The paper describes the control scheme used to apportion the gas fuel between combustion zones and how external conditions such as ambient temperature and fuel gas composition affect the apportionment. The paper concludes with a description of the control system installation in the engine test cell and a review of engine test results.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 40.

Statements made by the Norwegian authorities imply regulations and/or taxes on NO{sub x} emissions in the near future. The existing CO{sub 2} tax of NOK 0.82/Sm{sup 3} (US Dollars 0.12/Sm{sup 3}) and possible future tax on NO{sub x} are analyzed mainly with respect to operating and maintenance costs for the gas turbine. Depending on actual tax levels, the machine should be operated on full load/optimum thermal efficiency or part load to reduce specific exhaust emissions. Based on field measurements, exhaust emissions (CO{sub 2}, CO, NO{sub x}, N{sub 2}O, UHC, etc.) are established with respect to load and gas turbine performance, including performance degradation. Different NO{sub x} emission correlations are analyzed based on test results, and a proposed prediction model presented. The impact of machinery performance degradation on emission levels is particularly analyzed. Good agreement is achieved between measured and predicted NO{sub x} emissions from the proposed correlation. To achieve continuous exhaust emission control, the proposed NO{sub x} model is implemented to the on-line condition monitoring system on the Sleipner A platform, rather than introducing sensitive emission sensors in the exhaust gas stack. The on-line condition monitoring system forms an important tool in detecting machinery condition/degradation and air pollution, and achieving optimum energy conservation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 40.

Data for three twisted-tape wavelengths, each with five different widths, have been collected with constant wall temperature boundary condition. Correlations for the friction factor and Nusselt number are also available. The correlations predict the experimental data to within 10 to 15 percent for the heat transfer and friction factor, respectively. The presence of the twisted tape has caused the friction factor to increase by a factor of 3 to 7 depending on Reynolds number and the twisted-tape geometry. Heat transfer results have shown an increase of 1.5 to 3 times that of plain tubes depending on the flow conditions and the twisted-tape geometry. The width shows no effect on friction factor and heat transfer in the low range of Reynolds number but has a more pronounced effect on heat transfer at the higher range of Reynolds number. It is recommended to use loose-fit tapes for low Reynolds number flows instead of tight-fit in the design of heat exchangers because they are easier to install and remove for cleaning purposes.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 40.

It is based upon the integration of an existing heavy duty gas turbine with an additional shaft comprising industrial compressors and high pressure expander. CHAT capitalizes on the latest proven gas turbine technology, which, combined with a sophisticated thermal cycle configuration, results in substantial improvement in gas turbine efficiency, compared to a simple cycle, while still maintaining typical advantages and merits of a combustion turbine plant. Built with a commercial combustion turbine and available industrial compressors and expanders, the CHAT plant does not require extensive product development and testing. As a result, the CHAT power plant can be offered with specific capital costs up to 20 percent lower than the combined cycle plant, and with competing efficiency. Compared to a combined cycle plant, the CHAT plant offers lower emissions (due to air humidification) and other significant operating advantages with regard to start-up time and costs, better efficiency at part load, lower power degradation at higher ambient temperatures, and simpler operations and maintenance due to elimination of the complexities and costs associated with steam production. The CHAT plant also integrates very effectively with coal gasification and particularly well with the water quench design.

Particular emphasis is placed on using the model equations to identify characteristic length and time scales relevant to the design of pressure-gain combustors for gas turbine applications. The model is a control volume description of conservation laws for several regions of the pulse combustor. Combustion is modeled as a bimolecular reaction. Mixing between the fresh charge and the combustion products is modeled using a turbulent eddy time estimated from the combustor geometry and flow conditions. The model equations identify two characteristic lengths, which should be held constant during combustor scaleup, as well as certain exceptions to this approach. The effect of ambient operating pressure and inlet air temperature is also discussed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 461-468","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9641%%341","10.1115/1.2816668","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","372264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372264","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","118"

Also, the computational model and the assumptions used to predict the overall performance of alternative BIG/GT cycles are outlined.

Particular emphasis is placed on the mean pressure differences through the combustor as an indicator of the so-called pressure gain performance. Both the operating conditions and combustor geometry are investigated. It is shown that complex fluid/combustion interactions within the combustor make it difficult to isolate the effect of geometric changes.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of different solutions for cooling the compressor inlet air for the LM6000 gas turbine in a cogeneration plant operated in base load. Absorption and evaporative cooling systems are considered and their performance and economic benefits compared for the dry low-NO{sub x} LM6000 version. Reference is made to two sites in Northern and Southern Italy, whose climate data series for modeling the variations in ambient temperature during the single day were used to account for the effects of climate in the simulation. The results confirmed the advantages of inlet air cooling systems. In particular, evaporative cooling proved to be cost effective, though capable of supplying only moderate cooling, while absorption systems have a higher cost but are also more versatile and powerful in base-load operation. An integration of the two systems proved to be able to give both maximum performance enhancement and net economic benefit.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 40.

The gas turbine is coupled in series with a biomass combustion furnace in which the gas turbine exhaust is used to support combustion. Three cogeneration systems have been simulated. They are systems without a gas turbine, with a non-top-fired gas turbine, and a top-fired gas turbine. For all systems, three types of combustion equipment have been selected: circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler, grate fired steam boiler, and grate fired hot water boiler. The sizes of biomass furnaces have been chosen as 20 MW and 100 MW fuel inputs. The total efficiencies based on electricity plus process heat, electrical efficiencies, and the power-to-heat ratios for various alternatives have been calculated. For each of the cogeneration systems, part-load performance with varying biomass fuel input is presented. Systems with CFB boilers have a higher total efficiency and electrical efficiency than other systems when a top-fired gas turbine is added. However, the systems with grate fired steam boilers allow higher combustion temperature in the furnace than CFB boilers do. Therefore, a top combustor may not be needed when high temperature is already available. Only one low-grade fuel system is then needed and the gas turbine can operate with a very clean working medium.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 604-609","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9641%%272","10.1115/1.2816691","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","372195","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372195","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","118"

The models are applicable to forward flow as in the filtration mode and reverse flow as in the back-pulse cleaning mode. General criteria are derived to size the filter passages from considerations of Darcy pressure drop, friction pressure drop, and the dynamic head. These criteria together with Reynolds numbers are shown to provide measures of nonuniformities in face velocity and pressure that develop in the filter passages for atmospheric and high-pressure applications. A methodology is presented for optimizing the venturi geometry from the standpoint of minimizing pulse gas usage and controlling the thermal load imposed on the filter assembly.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 526-533","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9641%%345","10.1115/1.2816679","","2011-03-10T00:00:00Z","372268","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372268","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","118"

Simplified theoretical reactions for NO{sub x} removal are discussed. Currently, development of catalytic NO{sub x} control technology for diesel engines is focused on systems that incorporate fuel hydrocarbons as the chemical reducing agent. Copper- and zeolite-based catalysts have been the predominant systems studied to date, but now catalysts containing precious metals are being investigated. Observed NO{sub x} reduction efficiencies typically ranged from 10 to 30 percent on actual engine exhaust systems when exhaust hydrocarbon enrichment strategies were used. Effects of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and water on NO{sub x} reduction efficiencies are reviewed. Recommendations for future research include attempts to broaden the temperature range of efficient NO{sub x} reduction, improving hydrocarbon selectivity toward the NO{sub x} reduction reaction, and the development of a supplementary reductant delivery system suitable for transient diesel engine operation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 16. annual fall technical conference of the ASME Internal Combustion Engine Division, October 2--6, 1994, Lafayette, IN (US); PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 668-672","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9641%%350","10.1115/1.2816700","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","372273","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372273","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","3","118"

Installed black-start combustion-turbine (CT) generators, which are primarily used as cycling units to meet the daily peak demands, provide an economical and very attractive options for remote cracking of SES under partial or total power system collapse. Remote cranking is complicated by the fact that unit and auxiliary transformers at the CT plants are equipped with no-load (fixed) taps for which optimum positions must be determined by simulation prior to a remote cranking test or operation. Today`s analytical tools (power flow and optimal power flow programs) used for simulation do not adequately represent the actual reactive capability of the generator to ensure safe operation; and addresses only a single state of the power system, whereas the remote cranking operation requires over two dozen discrete events representing the various large motor starting and running states. This article describes an attempt at simulating a remote cranking operation for the black start of two coal-fired drum-type units at Northern States Power Company. The simulation system uses power flow and generator reactive capability programs in an iterative process to determine the appropriate tap positions for the CT unit and auxiliary transformers, the various transformers installed in the CT-SES path, and for controlling a proper voltage level for the generator system bus at the CT plant.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications in Power; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-29","","","","Journal ID: ICAPEH; ISSN 0895-0156; TRN: IM9639%%10","10.1109/67.526850","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","287422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/287422","","IEEE Computer Applications in Power","3","9"

In addition to manufacturing quality control, other important aspects for this application include life prediction modeling and time between engine overhauls. One nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method that provides information about material condition involves an analysis of resonant vibrations. In previous work by this general approach, changes in modal parameters have been related to bulk defect mechanisms such as microcracking due to thermal shock damage. In this work resonant vibrations from monolithic ceramic specimens were excited by an instrumented impact hammer and detected by a noncontact acoustic microphone over frequencies up to 100 kHz. Computer-based analysis of vibration signatures from test specimens allowed extraction of modal frequencies and damping constants. Downward shifts in detected resonant frequencies and increases in internal friction of (specific) damping capacity measurements were obtained from SiC cylindrical rings, and these measurements were shown to relate to thermal shock severity. This NDE method not only provides measurable parameters that could be used as accept--reject criteria for in-line process inspection, it also provides a means for tracking the mechanical integrity of in-service engine components to support life prediction modeling.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 40.

On large coal and oil-fired systems, there is still some discretion left to the operator on how best to trim his system based upon current operating conditions. But there is a growing problem in achieving boiler efficiencies, and part of it is the lack of operator knowledge on the fundamentals of power plant systems. The basics of combustion and steam generation are often overlooked when considering upgrading training for plant operators. The military service schools (i.e. Navy) do not offer the same degree of steam plant training they once did due to the reduction of steam ships run by fossil fuel.

"Local heat transfer in a rotating two-pass triangular duct with smooth walls","Dutta, S; Han, J C; Zhang, Y; Lee, C P","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES; THERMAL EFFICIENCY; TURBINE BLADES; COOLING; HEAT TRANSFER; DUCTS","Earlier heat transfer studies with orthogonal rotation were conducted mostly on ducts of square cross section. This paper reports a different cross section, a triangular duct. Unlike a square cross section, the triangular shape provides more restriction to the formation of the secondary flows. Moreover, the studied orientation of the right triangular duct avoids formation of symmetric vortex structures in the crossflow plane. This paper presents turbulent heat transfer characteristics of a two-pass smooth-walled triangular duct. One pass is for radial outward flow and the other for radial inward flow. With rotation the radial outward and inward flow directions show different surface heat transfer characteristics. Like a square duct, differences between the trailing and the leading Nusselt number ratios for the triangular duct increase with rotation number. However, the rate of change of Nusselt number ratios with rotation number varies for the two duct geometries. Standard {kappa}-{epsilon} model predictions for a radial outward flow situation show that the Nusselt number ratio variations with Reynolds number are not drastic for the same rotation number.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 435-443","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9639%%42","10.1115/1.2836685","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","287454","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/287454","","Journal of Turbomachinery","3","118"

A variety of options are available to upgrade ESP performance, including flue-gas conditioning, intermittent and pulsed energization, precharging, increasing ESP size and replacing ESPs with baghouses. However, in specific situations, these options may not provide sufficient improvement to meet tightened opacity standards, may be inapplicable due to site-specific space constraints or may be too costly. The Compact Hybrid Particulate Collector (COHPAC), developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), provides an attractive, cost-effective alternative that can be configured in a variety of ways to suit plant-specific conditions and objectives.

Perhaps the most critical equipment modification enabling AGC was the re-enabling of automatic variable inlet guide vane (IGV) control. During control system modifications for automatic IGVs, the operators realized that the Woodward NetCon control system`s capabilities of control, monitoring and information display were better than anticipated. The relative ease with which IGV changes were made encouraged the operating team to continue to maximize efficiency and optimize plant operations.

As a result, designers are looking again at natural circulation heat recovery boilers, but with a vertical gas path. Tapada do Outeiro is probably the first project which has been specified with a vertical natural circulation configuration. Other boiler companies are experimenting with bypasses on the circulation pumps of tri-pressure boilers, so that natural circulation can be studied in a fully commercial environment. Effectively, the pumps are used at start-up, and then shut off so that the boiler effectively runs in natural circulation when stable conditions have been established. Although the plant is intended to run mainly for base load, it may also be used for load following with daily or weekly start. Aids to quick starting include provisions of weather damper to retain heat in the boiler overnight. There are no bypass stacks, but steam dumps to the condenser.

Temperature of the pond averaged 7.2 C warmer than the main reservoir sites. Samples of artificial substrates constructed to mimic macrophytic vegetation indicated that the pond generally had lower macroinvertebrate abundance and reduced taxonomic diversity, though direction and severity of effects varied over time for most taxa. Deleterious effects were most severe in summer when temperatures of 40-42 C in the pond eliminated macroinvertebrates.

Coal gasification technology received a big thrust with the concept of combined cycle power generation. The integration of coal gasification with combined cycle for power generation (IGCC) had the inherent characteristic of gas cleanup and waste minimization, which made this system environmentally preferable. Commercial-scale demonstration of a cool water plant and other studies have shown that the greenhouse gas and particulates emission from an IGCC plant is drastically lower than the recommended federal New Source Performance Standard levels. IGCC also offers a phased construction and repowering option, which allows multiple-fuel flexibility and the necessary economic viability. IGCC technology advances continue to improve efficiency and further reduce the emissions, making it the technology of the 21st century.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 537-568","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9643%%258","10.1080/00908319608908789","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","377985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/377985","","Energy Sources","5","18"

This ratio varies from 2.26 in seam 3 to 5.81 in seam 4, and is a good indicator of the clay minerals present in the coal. Poor ESP performance at the Wabamun power station is linked to low sodium content in coal and low Na{sub 2}O content in coal ash; the problem has been rectified with the addition of Na{sub 2}SO{sub 4} to the feed coal. Sodium is present mainly in an inactive form, in aluminosilicate minerals, this form being nonleachable. The same is true of K{sub 2}O, the inactive form of which is less effective in reducing ash resistivity. The active alkalis of sodium and potassium are organically or salt bound; are leachable following extraction with water, ammonium acetate, and hydrochloric acid; vary laterally in the mine site; and contribute to ESP performance. The CaO content is highest in seam 3 (17.11%), and its significance in affecting ash resistivity increases due to the low Na{sup 2}O and K{sub 2}O contents in the Whitewood Mine coals. Anomalous values of CaO, Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}, K{sub 2}O, and SO{sub 3} at various locations in the mine may be the result of recent deposition of gypsum on the coal seam faces due to groundwater discharge. These values are not indicative of the coal ash chemistry away from the face of the exposed coal, and thus are unlikely to contribute to ESP performance. The average Alkaline Sulfate Index (ASI) is highest in seam 3 (3.17), followed by seam 1L (2.56). The same index for seams 1U and 4 is about 1.50. Based on studies conducted at the nearby Keephills power station, ESP opacity is expected to be higher than 15% when the ASI is less than 4.0. No significant lateral trends within the Whitewood Mine coals seams in a north to south direction are observed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 585-600","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9643%%260","10.1080/00908319608908791","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","377987","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/377987","","Energy Sources","5","18"

This article describes how forward-thinking operators review their plans for winterization and hot-weather operation--before the thermometer darts toward either extreme. new cooling towers (CTs) are no longer oversized, leaving little room for fouling that can shoot up in hot weather. Also, powerplants are no longer being designed with surplus heat exchangers and redundant pumps--features that can help a plant get through extreme temperatures. And at a growing list of plants, the CTs are eliminated altogether, in favor of air-cooled (AC) condensers--which can have their own trouble holding condenser vacuum when the outdoor thermometer skyrockets; and, like their CT cousins, can suffer serious failures if improperly operated in winter`s freeze.

The method is predicted upon Hookean atomic interactions and Monte Carlo diffusion and makes no assumption of a specific precipitate shape. Precipitates having elastic constants different from those of the matrix phase are treated in both isotropic and anisotropic elastic systems. Shape evolution is examined under the condition of a constant precipitate size and an isotropic interfacial energy. The results show that in general, an elastically soft precipitate tends to have an equilibrium morphology of low symmetry such as a plate, whereas a hard particle tends to take up a shape of high symmetry such as a circle. Morphological evolution proceeds through dynamic activities of coherency-induced interfacial waves whose wavelength depends upon the difference in elastic constants, precipitate geometry, anisotropy, and diffusion temperature. Coherency-induced interfacial waves seem to be responsible for the protrusions often observed along elastically hard directions in {gamma}{prime} particles of Ni-base superalloys and also to be a source for fresh ledges for growth via the ledge mechanism. For a highly nonequilibrium precipitate, first splitting followed by coalescence appears to be a common feature in achieving its equilibrium morphology.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical Transactions, A; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: Materials week `94, Rosemont, IL (United States), 3-7 Oct 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1449-1460","","CONF-941016-","FG02-87ER45315","Journal ID: MTTABN; ISSN 0360-2133; TRN: IM9633%%2","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264068","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264068","","Metallurgical Transactions, A","6","27"

This paper reports on the 3experimental investigation of the two-dimensional wake behind a stationary circular cylinder in a curved channel at positive streamwise pressure gradient. Measurements of mean velocity and Reynolds stress components are carried out using a X-hot-film probe. The measured quantities obtained in probe coordinates are transformed to a curvilinear coordinate system along the wake center line and are presented in similarity coordinates. The results show strong asymmetry in velocity and Reynolds stress components. The Reynolds stress components have higher values at the inner half of the wake than at the outer half of the wake. However, the mean velocity defect profiles in similarity coordinates are almost symmetric and follow the same Gaussian function for the straight wake data. A comparison with the wake development in a curved channel at zero streamwise pressure gradient suggests the decay rate of velocity defect is slower and the growth of wake width is faster for a positive streamwise pressure gradient.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 292-299","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9634%%29","10.1115/1.2817376","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","267957","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/267957","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","2","118"

They are typically over 30 years old, difficult to maintain, and hard to keep in environmental compliance. Natural gas cofiring of industrial stoker boilers offers a wide range of operational benefits. Boiler efficiency is improved because combustion air requirements are reduced (low excess air of LEA) and carbon burnout is improved (loss on ignition or LOI). On the emissions side, opacity problems are reduced and NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2} emissions reduced as natural gas replaces a percentage of the coal. Further, operation is improved through easier, smoke-free start-up and warm-up, recovered steam generation, increased short-term peaking capacity, improved plant availability and improved low load operation. Fuel flexibility also increases and maintenance decreases. Cofire benefits and economics are, however, very site specific. Important factors include relative coal and gas pricing, coal and gas supply security, boiler capacity factor and seasonal use, and backup boiler capability. These factors are discussed using the example of the Dover Light and Power of Ohio.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Plant Engineering (Chicago); Journal Volume: 50; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. A10-A11","","","","Journal ID: PLENAV; ISSN 0032-082X; TRN: IM9632%%284","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","260714","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/260714","","Plant Engineering (Chicago)","6","50"
"Decomposition of SO{sub 2}, NO{sub x} and CO{sub 2} emissions from energy use of major economic sectors in Taiwan","Lin, Sue J; Chang, Tzu C","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; SULFUR DIOXIDE; EMISSION; CARBON DIOXIDE; NITROGEN OXIDES; INDUSTRY; GASEOUS WASTES; COMMERCIAL SECTOR; RESIDENTIAL SECTOR; TRANSPORTATION SECTOR; TAIWAN; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","In this paper we use the Divisia index approach to decompose emission changes of SO{sub 2}, NO, and CO{sub 2} from major economic sectors in Taiwan during 1980 to 1992. The study highlights the interrelationships between energy use and environmental quality, and provides insights for policy making. The emission changes are decomposed into five components-pollution coefficient, fuel mix, energy intensity, economic growth and industrial structure. Of all components analyzed, economic growth had the largest positive effect on emission changes for Taiwan`s major economic sectors. Emissions of SO{sub 2} in industry and other sectors showed a decreasing trend due to fuel quality improvements antipollution control. However, NO, and CO{sub 2} emissions increased sharply in all sectors. Comparisons were also made with Germany, Japan and USA. This study has shown that improvement in energy efficiency, pollution control and fuel substitution are major options to reduce SO{sub 2}, NO, and CO{sub 2} emissions.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Journal; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-18","","","","Journal ID: ENJODN; ISSN 0195-6574; TRN: 96:013468","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","237588","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/237588","","Energy Journal","1","17"

Cenospheres are a naturally occurring byproduct of the burning process at coal-fired power plants. They have properties similar to manufactured hollow-sphere products. Fly-ash, bottom ash and boiler slag are sluiced out of the power plant in the form of a slurry that is pumped into settling ponds. Once in the ponds, the cenospheres rise to the top of the pond because their specific gravity is less than that of water. Because an estimated 800 million ton/year of coal are burned, coal-combustion byproducts (CCBs) have become the nation`s third most-abundant mineral resource. Fabricated spherical products first appeared in the marketplace in the 1970s. Only in recent years have inorganic cenospheres harvested from power plants become important. Before they can be marketed, cenospheres must be reclaimed from the power plant settling pond and transported to a processing facility. The harvested cenospheres are dried, screened, sized and packaged. The paper discusses some of the use of cenospheres.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: American Ceramic Society Bulletin; Journal Volume: 75; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 79-84","","","","Journal ID: ACSBA7; ISSN 0002-7812; TRN: IM9631%%49","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","256843","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/256843","","American Ceramic Society Bulletin","6","75"

Of three large-scale demonstration plants in the US, one is well into startup, a second is expected to begin operating in the fall, and a third should startup by the end of the year; worldwide, over a dozen more projects are in the works.

It is natural to think in terms of function--such as boiler feed, condensate service, cooling-water circulation, chemical metering--rather than in terms of pump innovation and technology. Efficiency is more likely to be highlighted during negotiations for pump purchase, especially with boiler-feed (b-f) pumps. Few pumps in any service are tested for efficiency after acceptance and start of service. Nevertheless, pump manufacturers and research agencies concerned with research directed at utilities` concerns continue to make or exploit improvements where necessary. Three broad innovations are described here. The first is a novel drive for a boiler-related accessory. Second, the magnetic bearing for powerplant pumps will soon undergo a test in a size of plant representative of today`s cogen and small utility plants. And third, new research in metallurgy suggests a remedy for the long-term cavitation problems of high-energy first-stage impellers.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 71-77","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9632%%84","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","260425","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/260425","","Power (New York)","6","140"

Severe ice buildup is the biggest threat. American Electric Power Co. (AEP) has six crossflow and eight counterflow natural-draft hyperbolic cooling towers in operation today. In the crossflow designs, subject of this discussion, the fill sections are more exposed to wind and cold. Their design circulating-water flow rates range from 220,000 to 600,000 gal/min; they serve 600-, 800-, and 1,300-MW coal-fired generating units. The towers are located in the Midwest and experience long periods of sub-freezing conditions during the winter months. High winds accompanied by single-digit temperatures often prevail for days at a time. During the record cold spell in January 1994, average temperatures as low as {minus}20 F occurred throughout AEP`s service area. Fill bypass systems have been incorporated into the design of AEP`s natural-draft cooling towers, and can pass between 25 and 50% of full-rated circulating-water flow. These systems prevent ice formation within the fill sections (heat-transfer media) by recirculating water directly to the tower cold-water basin during winter startup, when heat content of the circulating water is relatively low.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 53-58","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9632%%81","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","260422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/260422","","Power (New York)","6","140"

Two base materials, one with a coarse-grain (155 {micro}m) and the other with a fine-grain (55 {micro}m) microstructure, were submitted to Gleeble HAZ weld simulations. Three peak temperatures were utilized: 1350, 1150, and 950 C. Some samples were single cycled, and others were exposed to a double cycle. The samples that were double cycled experienced a second peak temperature 150 to 250 C lower than the first peak temperature. The samples were then stressed in bending for different amounts and stress relieved under load to determine their reheat cracking susceptibility. All samples were metallurgically evaluated before and after the reheat cracking susceptibility. All samples were metallurgically evaluated before and after the reheat cracking test. It was found that the prior-austenite grain size of the original base metal did not influence the reheat cracking susceptibility, but increases in peak temperature did. It was observed that the grain size and grain matrix microhardness that developed after the Gleeble cycles affected reheat cracking. It was found that reheat cracking did not occur when the microhardness was below 350 DPH and the prior-austenite grain size was less than about 80 {micro}m.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 353-364","","","","Journal ID: JMEPEG; ISSN 1059-9495; TRN: IM9635%%174","10.1007/BF02649337","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","271747","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/271747","","Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance","3","5"

Due to operational cost pressures, competitiveness, life extension, and the desire for better productivity, condition assessment programs are being implemented. One aspect of this is the enhancement/upgrade of existing generator protection schemes with digital systems. Traditionally this protection has been provided by a complement of discrete component relays. These relays have included both electromechanical and static types. Considering a digital enhancement/upgrade offers the owner of installed generation equipment several unique advantages. These include more complete machine protection, diagnostics capabilities for greater productivity and maintenance optimization, life extension with minimal implementation, and the operational advantages of sequence of events, present values and communications capabilities.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 3Pt2; Conference: IEEE nuclear science symposium and medical imaging conference, San Francisco, CA (United States), 21-28 Oct 1995; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1910-1914","","CONF-951073-","","Journal ID: IETNAE; ISSN 0018-9499; TRN: 96:018023","10.1109/23.507245","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","276518","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/276518","","IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","3Pt2","43"

The speed-up and load-up pattern of the plant is automatically optimized through an iterative process. Plant dynamics models representing quantitative knowledge and fuzzy rules representing qualitative knowledge are alternately used in the optimization process to modify the schedule parameters. The rules represent expertise on causal relations between modification rates of the schedule parameters and operational margins for constraints, i.e., NO{sub x} emission and machine thermal stresses. Simulation analysis with a three pressure staged reheat type 235.7MW rated capacity plant shows that the system provides quick and economical plant startup under NO{sub x} emission regulation and reliable machine life management. Startup energy loss is reduced due to the reduction in startup time. Furthermore, optimum operating conditions are quickly reached with the expert system.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 414-422","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9636%%503","10.1109/60.507654","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","276828","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/276828","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","2","11"

Future estimates predict an even higher percentage of use of coal, the principal pollutant among the fossil fuels, in world electricity production, particularly in the industrially developed countries of the world. There is little doubt that electric utilities will have to become more involved in finding ways for abatement of these precursors for acid rain. A number of compliance options are reviewed. These include addition of scrubbers, retrofitting of existing plant equipment, and use of novel combustion technologies. Minimum emission dispatch is also discussed. Each of these options, individually or in combination, can bring about the desired end result.

The basic reason for the dominance is high efficiency. The rapid pace of gas-turbine technology improvement in the 1990s drove combined-cycle thermal efficiency to nearly 60 percent with natural gas as the fuel. It will probably go even higher after the year 2000. In addition, the gas-fired combined cycle is a bargain. With natural gas prices where they are right now, it is the least-cost generation operation for power producers with access to gas.

A 3 F temperature increase caused by an inefficient or poorly functioning cooling tower could cost a 300-kW power plant as much as $300,000 annually in lost sales. The revenue lost from operating a generating plant with circulating water temperatures hotter than those designed for the plant is illustrated. Colder water from cooling towers is responsible for producing better vacuums, relieving back pressure on turbines and lowering heat temperatures and pressures. As a result of cooling tower inefficiencies and the resulting higher temperature, the plant must burn additional fuel to overcome operation at lower efficiency levels and vacuums. The alternative is lower electricity generation and loss of sales. The added fuel costs caused by higher circulating water temperatures are illustrated.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 38-39","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%93","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250781","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250781","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","6","100"

"Coal cleaning controls HAP emissions","Akers, D J","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT; HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; COAL; CLEANING; SURFACE PROPERTIES","Federal and state regulation of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from utility boilers is still in question. But if such regulation occurs in the next few years, the least-cost, lowest-risk control method for many utilities is likely to be some form of coal cleaning. Approximately 75 percent of coal mined east of the Mississippi River is already cleaned before it is used by the electric utility industry. Coal cleaning already reduces the concentration of most of the elements named as HAPs because most of these elements are associated with ash-forming or sulfur-bearing minerals. There are also cases in which some of these elements are bound to organic matter, making them extremely difficult to remove by physical cleaning methods. Complicating the situation even more, the same trace element may be bound both organically and with minerals in the same coal. On the positive side, for decades there has been much research and development on improved methods of removing ash and sulfur from coal.

The generating facilities include a mix of nuclear, fossil-fired, and hydroelectric units. Not unlike other utilities, advanced maintenance welding technology is crucial to maintain the equipment in the most reliable, safe, and economic manner. Since the late 1970s, one focus at Ontario Hydro has been the ability to weld repair heavy section components without postweld heat treatment (PWHT). Temper-bead procedures developed by Ontario Hydro have been used successfully for over a decade to repair carbon steel components. Recently, considerable efforts have been spent to expand the scope of the temper-bead techniques and other self-tempering welding techniques for low-alloy steel, P4 (1.25Cr-0.5Mo) and P5A (2.25Cr-1Mo) materials. To perform successful repairs in these components, it is essential to understand the welding metallurgy of these materials and welding process variables. This paper summarizes the work by Ontario Hydro in non-PWHT weld repair technology with special emphasis on recent developments for Cr-Mo materials.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin - Welding Research Council; Journal Issue: 412; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35-42","","","","Journal ID: WRCBA2; ISSN 0043-2326; TRN: 97:008712","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471161","","Bulletin - Welding Research Council","412",""

The interest has stemmed in part from recent revisions to the National Board Inspection Code regarding welding repair of Cr-Mo steels and from the fact that many domestic utility power plants are nearing the end of their projected design life. EPRI is addressing a number of concerns expressed by utilities surrounding weld repair under a joint EPRI/utility program RP3484-01. The program is focused on procuring service-aged piping and header girth weldments, quantifying the level of damage associated with those weldments, performing weld repairs within the girth weldment region, testing the repair weldment mechanically and metallurgically, and comparing the increase or decrease in remaining life associated with the weld repair. This paper discusses four industry case histories along with two piping girth weld repairs performed under the EPRI program: (1) a repair performed with conventional postweld heat treatment and (2) a repair performed employing temper-bead welding repair technology.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin - Welding Research Council; Journal Issue: 412; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-59","","","","Journal ID: WRCBA2; ISSN 0043-2326; TRN: IM9722%%285","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471162","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471162","","Bulletin - Welding Research Council","412",""

The materials were tested as CO oxidation catalysts. Results show that autoclave treatment of Cu-OL-1 suspensions induces complete removal of chlorine as well as a change of the Cu/Mn ratio and average manganese oxidation state. Such changes depend on the initial MnO{sub 4}{sup -}/Mn{sup 2+} ratio. At a ratio of 0.34-0.40., autoclave treatment increases the manganese oxidation state and the Cu/Mn ratio. At a ratio of 0.44, however, treatment decreases manganese oxidation state and the Cu/Mn ratio. A possible mechanism is proposed for the hydrothermal transformation of Cu-OL-1 to Cu-OMS-1. CO oxidation data show that Cu-OMS-1 has a CO conversion of 89-99% at 60-100{degrees}C, while Cu-OL-1 has almost activity in the same temperature region. This dramatic difference is due to the fact that Cu-OMS-1 has more surface oxygen and a larger CO adsorption capacity, as compared to Cu-OL-1. Different structural properties may also contribute to the difference in catalytic activity, since the todorokite tunnel structure of OMS-1 is correlated with CO conversion. Blockage of the tunnels by water and tunnel collapse cause a significant decrease in CO oxidation. Kinetic studies of CO oxidation show that water vapor in the feed stream induces a small and reversible inhibition and that a positive reaction order is found with respect to CO partial pressure under these experimental conditions. 44 refs., 6 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 115-122","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0011","10.1006/jcat.1996.0168","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","476034","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/476034","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

Kinetic studies were conducted both in the presence and in the absence of H{sub 2}O and SO{sub 2}. The structure of the various catalysts, as well as adsorbed species present on their surface, was characterized by in situ Raman and infrared spectroscopies. Under dry and SO{sub 2}-free conditions, the turnover frequency of the SCR reaction was found to go through a maximum with vanadia surface coverage at approximately half a monolayer. The observed decrease in the SCR turnover frequency at vanadia surface coverages exceeding half a monolayer can be attributed to the loss of strong acid sites which are associated with the TiO{sub 2} support. Addition of H{sub 2}O to the reacting gas mixture results in a decrease in the SCR turnover frequency of approximately 40-50%, which is independent of the vanadia surface coverage. In situ Raman results suggest that such a decrease can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of H{sub 2}O on the active vanadia sites. The presence of SO{sub 2} in the gas phase during the SCR reaction results in a significant increase of the turnover frequency at low vanadia surface coverages, while is has no effect at vanadia surface coverages above half a monolayer. Raman and infrared results suggest that the effect of SO{sub 2} can be attributed to the formation of surface sulfate species, which are only present on the titania surface below half a monolayer coverage due to repulsive interactions between the surface vanadia and sulfate species. 32 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 247-253","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0024","10.1006/jcat.1996.0182","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471621","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471621","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 prepared by the ion-exchange method gave a higher catalytic activity than the physical mixture of Ga{sub 2}O{sub 3} and H-ZSM-5, of which the catalytic activity was comparable to that of H-ZSM-5. On the contrary, both ion-exchange and physical mixing methods yielded equally high catalytic activities of In-loaded H-ZSM-5. The reduction of No on these catalysts proceeds consecutively by way of oxidation of NO to NO{sub 2} and reduction of NO{sub 2} with CH{sub 4} to N{sub 2}. With increasing heat treatment temperature, the catalytic activity of the mixture of In{sub 2}O{sub 3} and H-ZSM-5 for the reduction of NO{sub 2} increased, while that for NO oxidation decreased. An IR study of OH groups on this catalyst indicated that the solid-state exchange reaction occurred between In{sub 2}O{sub 3} and H-ZSM-5 leading to the increase in the number of indium cation sites and consequently the catalytic activity for NO{sub 2} reduction. 21 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 465-470","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0045","10.1006/jcat.1996.0205","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471641","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471641","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

At high CO partial pressures (P{sub CO}) the EP effect is attenuated by CO island formation and limited availability of chemisorbed NO. At low P{sub CO} regime, Na pumping strongly accelerates the reaction: rate gains of up to 1300% for N{sub 2} production, relative to the unpromoted rate are observed. This can be understood in terms of Na-induced dissociation of chemisorbed molecular NO, which is thought to be the reaction initiating step. The overall kinetic behavior and the dependence of N{sub 2}/N{sub 2}O selectivity on catalyst potential are in good accord with this hypothesis. Thus the EP system also provides direct information about the nature of the reaction mechanism under conditions of elevated pressure. 31 refs., 7 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 471-479","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; CNN: Grant ATH/882/2/FUEL; TRN: 97:000028-0046","10.1006/jcat.1996.0206","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471642","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471642","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

An automated on-line gas chromatograph was employed to analyze CO, CO{sub 2}, and O{sub 2}. Based upon previous findings, the authors were able to prepare catalysts with only Pt-rich or only Rh-rich particles. The Cl concentration in these catalysts did not affect activity significantly. In net-oxidizing conditions, platinum was found to be more active than rhodium. The presence of synergism depends upon a certain metal particle composition-size distribution of Pt-rich alloy particles.

The respective specific activities were 6.3 x 10{sup {minus}4}, 2.5 x 10{sup {minus}3}, 4.8 x 10{sup {minus}3}, and 8.1 x 10{sup {minus}4} {mu}mol/s{center_dot}m{sup 2} at 623 K and 0.066 atm of N{sub 2}O. Apparent activation energies fell between 19 and 27 kcal/mol, and the reaction orders with respect to N{sub 2}O were between 0.74 and 0.89. XRD patterns showed that pretreatment at 773 K under He converted MnO{sub 2} into Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3}, which gave a specific activity similar to that of the original Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} sample; therefore, MnO{sub 2} was pretreated under pure oxygen at 645 K which gave a specific activity similar to that of the original Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3}, which gave a specific activity similar to that of the original Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} sample; therefore, MnO{sub 2} was pretreated under pure oxygen at 645 K prior to reaction to retain the bulk MnO{sub 2} phase. On the other hand, MnO was oxidized to Mn{sub 3}O{sub 4} during the course of N{sub 2}O decomposition. Thus Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} is the phase associated with the highest catalytic activity. A detailed kinetic study with the most active Mn{sub 2}O{sub 3} sample found that the reaction order at 648 K with respect to N{sub 2}O was near 0.8 over a wide pressure range, and the reaction rate was retarded by oxygen. The experimental data fit a simple Langmuir-Hinshelwood model well and both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters could be determined.

No catalyst deactivation was observed in the absence of H{sub 2}O at 400{degrees}C after 160 h. Catalyst deactivation was much faster if the feed contained C{sub 2}H{sub 8}, NO, O{sub 2}, and H{sub 2}O (lean NO{sub x} reduction conditions) than if one of these components was missing. Fresh and deactivated catalysts were characterized by a variety of techniques, including EPR, XRD, BET surface area measurements, IR spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction with H{sub 2}(H{sub 2}-TPR). With some techniques, the differences between fresh and deactivated catalysts were marginal, but very significant changes were observed with TPR and EPR. No gross destruction of the zeolite framework was detected by XRD or BET, even for a catalyst that was 50% deactivated. Isolated Cu{sup 2+} ions, [Cu-O-Cu]{sup 2+} oxocations and CuO particles were identified in fresh Cu/ZSM-5. In deactivated Cu/ZSM-5, the Cu species were redistributed. Besides isolated Cu{sup 2+} oxocations and CuO particles were identified in fresh Cu/ZSM-5. In deactivated Cu/ZSM-5, the Cu species were redistributed. Besides isolated Cu{sup 2+} ions (in two different coordination environments), highly dispersed Cu ions in Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and a CuAl{sub 2}O{sub 4} compound were detected. Ion exchange of Cu{sub 2+} into partially dealuminated H/ZSM-5 yielded TPR and EPR evidence strikingly similar to deactivated Cu/ZSM-5. These results suggested that the formation of proton exchange sites plays a crucial role in catalyst deactivation. In the presence of steam, it induces dealumination of the zeolite, and the copper states are irreversibly changed due to copper interacting with the alumina formed in the dealumination process. 34 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-54","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0005","10.1006/jcat.1996.0160","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471603","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471603","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"
"Catalytic activity and selectivity of H-ZSM5 for the reduction of nitric oxide by propane in the presence of oxygen","Halasz, I; Brenner, A; Hou, Ying","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 40 CHEMISTRY; ZEOLITES; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; NITRIC OXIDE; REDUCTION; PROPANE; OXIDATION; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS","The reactions of No, C{sub 3}H{sub 8}, and O{sub 2} were studied over a H-ZSM5 catalyst at various conditions. The reaction can result in the formation of either NO{sub 2} or N{sub 2}. The selectivity for N{sub 2} mainly depends on the ratio of NO/C{sub 5}H{sub 8} in the feedstock; the reaction temperature and the concentration of O{sub 2} have only minor influence. When the concentration of NO is 1000 ppm (which is typical for automotive exhausts) and NO/C{sub 3}H{sub 8}> 1, the oxidation of NO to NO{sub 2} dominates, but the NO{sub 2} does not react significantly with C{sub 3}H{sub 8} at these reaction conditions. NO can be reduced by C{sub 3}H{sub 8} selectively to N{sub 2} at NO/C{sub 3}H{sub 8}{le} 1 when oxygen is present. Results suggest that the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO can proceed via two different reaction pathways below and above 500{degrees}C. At low temperatures the oxidation of NO by O{sub 2} to NO{sub 2} might be the initial reaction step. Below 500{degrees}C, this reaction is much faster than other possible reactions in the mono- or bimolecular mixtures of the three reactants. At 500{degrees}C, the reaction rate of the oxidation of C{sub 3}H{sub 8} by O{sub 2} is comparable to that of the NO oxidation. At 600{degrees}C, the oxidation of C{sub 3}H{sub 8} is faster than other reactions in the mono-or bimolecular mixtures of reactants. Thus, probably the combustion of propane initiates the SCR process above 500{degrees}C.

The influence of surface vanadia coverage, promoters (surface tungsten oxide, niobium oxide, and sulfate species), and the specific oxide support (TiO{sub 2}, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and SiO{sub 2}) was examined. The molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species were determined by in situ Raman spectroscopy, and the corresponding surface acidity properties were monitored with infrared spectroscopy employing pyridine adsorption. The redox properties of the surface metal oxide species were probed with the sensitive methanol oxidation reaction and temperature-programmed reduction. The SCR reactivity of the various catalysts was determined over a wide temperature range. The current findings suggest that a dual-site (a surface vanadia redox site and an adjacent nonreducible metal oxide site) mechanism is required for the efficient selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH{sub 3} over supported vanadia catalysts. The SCR reaction is sensitive to the immediate environment of the surface vanadia species: overall surface coverage of the metal oxide overlayer (factor of 5 in turnover frequency), nature of adjacent surface metal oxide species (factor of 10 in turnover frequency) and oxide support ligands (factor of 3 in turnover frequency). 39 refs., 10 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 161; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 211-221","","","FG02-93ER14350","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:000028-0021","10.1006/jcat.1996.0179","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471618","","Journal of Catalysis","1","161"

The incorporation of a SiC dispersed second phase in form of whisker or platelets into an alumina matrix has allowed to improve material toughness, thermal shock resistance and R-curve behavior. Recently, considerable interest in the acquisition of slow crack growth (SCG) data for ceramic materials has arisen in order to predict the service lifetime of brittle components. Non-oxide ceramics such as SiC and Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} are extremely resistant to crack growth at low temperatures, whereas oxide ceramics are susceptible to stress corrosion because of the chemical interaction between water and stressed cracks. Up to date, there are not many papers devoted to SCG of SiC whiskers reinforced Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} composites and none about SiC platelets used as reinforcement. The objective of the present work has been to evaluate the slow crack growth in a Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}/SiC-platelet composite by double torsion testing analysis. The results will be compared with those obtained for SiC whisker reinforced Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} composite tested using the same conditions.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: 15 May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1621-1626","","","","Journal ID: XZ503X; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9628%%84","10.1016/1359-6462(96)00026-7","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","247984","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/247984","","Scripta Materialia","10","34"

The fluidelastic instability was identified as the main driving force behind the vibrations and is highly dependent on the flow regime (single-phase versus two-phase flow). The vorticity formulation has been shown in the past to sufficiently describe the phenomena of cross-flow-induced vibrations in cylindrical arrays. This paper attempts to use the existing, well-established equations (see Bottoni and Sengpiel, 1992) and compares the results of a fluidelastic instability of an air-water mixture to available experimental data.

Using selected test data about case studies stored in the structural failure database of a knowledge-based system, the network is trained: either to predict possible failure mechanisms like creep, overheating (OH), or overstressing (OS)-induced failure (network of Type A), or to classify a root failure cause of each case study into either a primary or secondary cause (network of Type B). In the present study, the primary root cause is defined as manufacturing, material or design-induced causes, while the secondary one as not manufacturing, material or design-induced causes, e.g., failures due to operation or mal-operation. An ordinary three-layer neutral network employing the back propagation algorithm with the momentum method is utilized in this study. The results clearly show that the neural network is a powerful tool for analyzing case studies of failure in structural components. For example, the trained network of Type A predicts creep-induced failure in unknown case studies with an accuracy of 86%, while the network of Type B classifies root failure causes of unknown case studies with an accuracy of 88%. It should be noted that, due to a shortage of available case studies, an appropriate selection of case studies and input parameters to be used for network training was necessary in order to attain high accuracy. A collection of more case studies should, however, resolve this problem, and improve the accuracy of the analyses. An analysis module for case studies using the neural network has also been developed and successfully implemented in a knowledge-based system.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 237-246","","","","Journal ID: JPVTAS; ISSN 0094-9930; TRN: IM9623%%348","10.1115/1.2842186","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","231038","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/231038","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology","2","118"

An interactive decision-making process is formulated in which decision-maker can learn to recognize good solutions by considering all possibilities of fuzziness. The application of the fuzzy formulation is accompanied by a careful examination of the definition of fuzziness, appropriateness of the membership function and interpretation of results. The proposed concept provides a decision support system with integration-oriented features, whereby the decision-maker can learn to recognize the relative importance of factors in the specific domain of optimal fuel scheduling (OFS) problem. The formulation of a fuzzy linear programming problem to obtain a reasonable nonfuzzy solution under consideration of the ambiguity of parameters, represented by fuzzy numbers, is introduced.

The purpose is to develop a new method for performing probabilistic production simulation. This is done by extending the probabilistic approach for power generation simulation to include heat generation as well. The probabilistic approach is based on two-dimensional probability load density functions. By convolution of the combined heat and power units, the equivalent load functions are obtained and the expected energy generation of the units, the expected unserved energy, and the expected overflow are determined. It is shown that in the CHP system a trade off between unserved energy and overflow energy is inherent and therefore the analysis is qualitatively different from analysis of systems with only power units. The corresponding theory is developed and case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1031-1036","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9633%%218","10.1109/59.496191","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264282","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264282","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","11"

Environmental protection, resource conservation, community opposition, and other issues with major impact are often encountered along the way.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19-27","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9633%%115","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264180","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264180","","Power (New York)","5","140"

The steady state operation model precisely includes the effect of the magnetic saturation in the generator by using the M.M.F.-E.M.F. phasor diagram method and also meets the real-time simulation requirement by using the iteration method with a changeable step size. Based on the artificial neutral networks method, the transient state operation of the generator can be simulated on a real-time basis and the simulation results are precise. With the addition of the generator transient state operation model, the function of power plant training simulators is expanded.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1090-1095","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9633%%226","10.1109/59.496199","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264290","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","11"

This article describes the first power barge using combined-cycle technology which has began operation in the Dominican Republic. The construction of a new mobile power plant in Puerto Plata, the Dominican Republic, marks the first time a power barge has been coupled with the efficiency of combined-cycle generation. The 185-megawatt plant, which became fully operational in January, provides 25% of the power required by the Dominican state-owned utility, the Corporacion Dominicana de Electricidad (CDE). The new plant is designed to end the power shortages and blackouts that have traditionally plagued the Caribbean nation. The Puerto Plata plant consists of two barges that were built in the US, transported to the Dominican Republic, installed, and backfilled into place. One barge, delivered in May 1994, contains a 76-megawatt gas turbine. The second barge, installed in April 1995, contains a 45-megawatt heat-recovery steam generator to recover heat energy from the turbine exhaust, two auxiliary boilers to produce additional steam, and a 118-megawatt steam-turbine generator.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mechanical Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 62-66","","","","Journal ID: MEENAH; ISSN 0025-6501; TRN: IM9629%%57","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250745","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250745","","Mechanical Engineering","5","118"
"Structural-mode instability can lead to unexpected strut failure","Chu, K Y","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; SUPPORTS; FAILURES; DESIGN; PIPES; THERMAL POWER PLANTS","This article describes evaluating instability of short, linear-type pipe supports to ensure conservative design. Linear-type pipe supports such as rigid struts and snubbers are normally checked for buckling strength using Euler`s buckling load, which is inversely proportional to the square of the effective column lengths. This check of compression members for buckling load is sufficient when they are supported rigidly at the two ends. However, when the end supports in the orthogonal directions are not quite rigid, there may exist another unstable condition for the compression members, whereby the critical load may be smaller than the Euler load. This condition could occur for pipe supports attached to flexible piping systems, especially when the length of the compression member is very short. Therefore, when the design involves a very short strut, the piping stiffness at the strut location should be evaluated to assure that the specific allowable load provided by strut manufacturers is indeed conservative.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 37-39","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%88","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250776","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250776","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","5","100"

Up until the 1950s when they were replaced by natural gas pipelines, thousands of American communities had manufactured gas plants (MGP). The MGPs converted coal into coal gas that was piped to individual homes for heating, cooking and, before electricity, lighting. The switch to natural gas forced the MGPs to shut down, leaving some 3,500 abandoned plants around the United States with rusting facilities, leaking underground tanks, tar lagoons, piles of unknown materials and other wastes that represent a significant contamination threat to the environment.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Public Power; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May-Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-25","","","","Journal ID: PUPOAG; ISSN 0033-3654; TRN: 96:002876-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","381245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/381245","","Public Power","3","54"

Plant 3 has three units with a combined turbine capacity of 540 MW, (3 {times} 180) electrical and 780 (3 {times} 260) Gkal an hour thermal capacity with steam productivity of 2010 (3 {times} 670) tons per hour at 540 C. Coal fired thermal electric power plants rely on the equipment of the fuel supply section. The mechanism of the fuel supply section includes: conveyor belts, hammer crushers, guiding devices, dumping devices, systems for dust neutralizing, iron separators, metal detectors and other devices. As a rule, the fuel path in the power plant has three main directions: from the railroad car unloading terminal to the coal warehouse; from the coal warehouse to the acceptance bunkers of the power units, and the railroad car unloading terminal to the acceptance bunkers of power units. The fuel supply section always has a reserve and is capable of uninterruptible fuel supply during routine maintenance and/or repair work. This flexibility requires a large number of fuel traffic routes, some of which operate simultaneously with the feeding of coal from the warehouse to the acceptance bunkers of the power units, or in cases when rapid filling of the bunkers is needed, two fuel supply routes operate at the same time. The remote control of the fuel handling system at Power Plant 3 is described.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-50","","","","Journal ID: EENGDO; ISSN 0199-8595; TRN: IM9619%%278","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","218557","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/218557","","Energy Engineering","1","93"

The system under consideration has oil units with storage constraints, gas units with delivery constraints, and unconstrained coal units. An optimal approach to transfer the fuel delivery constraints into unit capacity limits using a closed-form dual dispatch is introduced. As a result, the gas units can be viewed as fuel-unconstrained, this greatly reducing complexity. It is shown that the optimization problem, which requires that storage levels be parameterized, leads to two different dispatch rules. The oil units are dispatched to maximize the power they generate for a binding fuel amount or cost, whereas the gas and coal units are economically dispatched to provide for the remaining power. In addition to the standard constraints, the system is required to meet a minimum system spinning reserve. Test results are provided to illustrate the merits of the proposed method.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1059-1066","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9633%%222","10.1109/59.496195","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264286","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264286","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","11"

The sampler was located centrally in the community whenever possible and samples were collected every other day. Concentrations of particle strong acidity, mass, sulfate, and ozone were highly correlated both in the region of the country defined as a high-sulfur source area and in the downwind transport regions. These regions of the eastern United States and southern Canada experienced the greatest particle strong acidity, sulfate, and particle mass concentrations during the spring and summer months (May-September). The particle strong acidity concentrations were highest in regions close to the high sulfur emission areas of the United States; that is, in the area immediately to the west of the Appalachian Plateau and west of the Allegheny Mountains (western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, and West Virginia) up through southern Ontario. The frequency of particle strong acidity events decreased with transport distance from the region of highest sulfur emissions. Low particle strong acidity and sulfates were found at the western and midwestern sites of both the United States and Canada. Substantial concentrations of nitric acid were found in two of the California sites as well as many sites in the northeastern portion of the United States.

For a comparative study of the performance of the ESP the same high resistivity coal was burned at both sites. In addition, measurements were carried out for an easy to handle coal at the newer state-of-the-art power station. Effects on the size distribution caused by nonintermittent pulse energization of the ESP were also investigated. The results revealed a significantly stronger influence of the boiler than of the coal type on the size distribution at the inlet of the ESPs. In all cases the distribution was unimodal and a pronounced peak could be observed around 100 nm particle diameter. The ESP outlet distributions varied much more and showed also a dependence on the coal type. The maximum of the penetration through the ESP was determined in the range from 300 to 400 nm for all configurations. At the newer power station the number of ultrafine particles (< 30 nm) at the ESP outlet exceeded the inlet concentration under certain conditions. This effect was strongly influenced by the ESP energization and seemed to be related to the denitrification unit (DeNO{sub x}) installed upstream of the ESP where ammonia is injected as reducing agent. 14 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Aerosol Science and Technology; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 191-204","","","","Journal ID: ASTYDQ; ISSN 0278-6826; TRN: 96:003094-026","10.1080/02786829608965363","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","232523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/232523","","Aerosol Science and Technology","3","24"

Two designs of this cycle were adopted and the influences of various operating parameters, such as compressor pressure ratio, ambient temperature, inlet gas temperature of gas turbine, percentage of excess air, and number of feedwater heaters, were studied. Three techniques were applied to increase the overall cycle efficiency: first, increasing the mean temperature of heat supplied by increasing the inlet gas temperature of the gas turbine; second, decreasing the mean temperature of heat rejected through a heat recovery cycle; and third, reducing the percentage of excess air in the supercharged boiler. A performance comparison between the adopted cycles and a conventional heat recovery cycle was made. The results show that there is an improvement in overall cycle efficiency of about 9.5--9.5 percent with the first design of the adopted cycle over the conventional heat recovery cycle, while an improvement of overall cycle efficiency of about 1.0--5.5 percent is obtained for the second design.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at JSME-ASME ICOPE-93, Tokyo (JP) September 12--16, 1993; PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 453-460","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9627%%44","10.1115/1.2816611","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","244722","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/244722","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","118"

SN-88 silicon nitride was selected as the candidate material. The objective was to validate the failure prediction methodology using rectangular plates, which were thermally shocked in a fluidized bed. The failure prediction methodology would then be applied to the representative component geometry. Refined ANSYS finite element modeling of both the plate and component geometries was undertaken. The CARES/LIFE reliability analysis of the component geometry for fast fracture was performed for two cases: (1) steady-state thermomechanical loads during normal gas turbine operation and (2) transient thermal shock loading during a turbine trip. Thermal shock testing of alumina disks was performed in order to gain confidence in the testing and analysis procedures. Both notched and unnotched SN88 plates were then tested. Failure modes were identified through flexure tests and data censoring was performed using SAS. Weibull modulus was assumed to be invariant with temperature and the scale parameter was assumed to vary through a scaling variable such that multiple data could be pooled.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 40.

In 1992, Chambiere experienced a major turning point in its history with the installation of a new unit based on one MS 6001B ``Heavy Duty`` gas turbine. This model, rated 38 MWe-ISO and burning natural gas or fuel oil, has become the core of a new cogeneration unit exhibiting outstanding performance: efficiency higher than 80 percent (LHV) providing a 20 percent energy saving in comparison to a conventional plant; low pollutant emissions (NO{sub x}, CO, HC) and low contribution to the greenhouse effect (CO{sub 2}). The gas turbine has been equipped with two steam injection devices, for DeNO{sub x} and power augmentation, respectively, resulting in a very flexible system.

This paper describes a number of new steam path design features that have been introduced in the GE steam turbine product line to improve turbine performance and reliability. These features include diaphragms with contoured sidewalls, advanced vortex blading with compound tangential lean, new continuously coupled last-stage buckets with improved aerodynamic efficiency and reliability, improved downward and axial flow exhaust hoods, and better steam leakage control devices. The benefits of these new features for both new units and retrofits of existing units are discussed. In addition, the paper discusses the new generation of three-dimensional viscous CFD analysis codes being used to develop new design concepts, including codes developed by GE as well as those obtained externally. Also described are the extensive laboratory test programs being conducted to validate the CFD codes and verify the predicted efficiency gains for new design features.

Cumulative figures such as total fuel consumption and production efficiency serve as the basis for a subsequent detailed economic analysis. Basic inputs to the model are the energy demand curves for a specific site on a daily, hourly, or even per minute basis. The plant performance model takes into account the varying load levels, ambient conditions, fuel price, and revenues from electric power delivered off-site. The load/performance simulator calculates plant performance and basic economic parameters at each point in time of the load demand curve to exactly match the given energy demand. The results are critical economic data like cumulated fuel consumption and expenses, total energy production, and overall averaged plant efficiency. The performance model delivers detailed plant performance data on an overall plant as well as component level. The results reflect real plant operation under all varying conditions, hence produce highly significant performance and economic parameters.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at Cogen-Turbo Power, Vienna (AT) August 23--25, 1995; PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 353-358","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9627%%29","10.1115/1.2816596","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","244707","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/244707","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","118"

Today`s Westinghouse Process Control Division traces its ancestry through a century of control advancements, from fly-ball turbine governors to advanced microprocessor technologies. It`s a history that follows the paths of two industry leaders, Westinghouse and the Hagan Controls Co. Founded in 1886 by inventor George Westinghouse, The Westinghouse Electric Corp. became a world leader in the design and manufacture of generators, turbines, motors and a host of other industrial products. The Hagan Co., founded three decades later in 1916, also assumed a leadership role in combustion control and instrumentation technologies. Through the next five decades, Westinghouse and Hagan often worked together to meet their customers` needs while remaining focused on different aspects of power generation control technology. That changed in 1963 when Westinghouse and Hagan Controls combined forces and together launched a new era of computerized, plant-wide control system technologies.","","","","","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-26","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%95","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250783","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250783","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","4","100"

Corrosion problems in fire protection water systems (FPWS) have been the subject of Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigation for some time. In the worst case, FPWS corrosion could, if undetected and untreated, lead to failure of a plant`s fire protection system (FPS). The permanent or periodic water exposure of low-carbon-steel piping components` internal surfaces subjects them to inevitable cumulative damage by initiating and sustaining the corrosion process. It is imperative that nuclear facilities, as well as other utilities, have in place a corrosion monitoring and prevention program that specifically addresses FPWS corrosion. Ignoring this widespread problem can be very costly for utilities that must finally repair or replace these systems.","","","","","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 39-42","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9629%%97","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","250784","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250784","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","4","100"

The compressible form of the Reynolds-averaged governing equations is solved using a high-order, upwind biased numerical scheme. The turbulent flow region is computed using a one-equation turbulence model. The computed results show that the key to the accurate prediction of the unsteady loads at stall flutter conditions is the modeling of the transitional flow region at the leading edge. A simplified criterion for the transition onset is used. The transitional flow region is computed with a modified form of the turbulence model. The computed solution, where the transitional flow region is included, shows that the small laminar/transitional separation bubble forming during the pitch-up motion has a decisive effect on the near-wall flow and the development of the unsteady loads.

The samples with rod axes near the [001] direction were investigated in the initially undeformed state and after creep deformation at different temperatures and stresses. For the measurements of the (002) and (020) line profiles, a special X-ray double crystal diffractometer with negligible line broadening was used which was equipped with a high-temperature vacuum chamber. The line profiles were evaluated for the lattice parameters of the matrix phase {gamma} and the precipitated {gamma}{prime} phase and for values of the lattice mismatch parallel and perpendicular to the stress axis, respectively, which were found to be different. Elastic, tetragonal distortions of the phases {gamma} and {gamma}{prime} could be determined between room temperature and about 900 C. These distortions are thermally induced due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the two phases and deformation induced due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the deformation. At the high temperatures of the X-ray measurements, at least partial recovery of the deformation-induced internal stresses occurred, depending on the temperature of the X-ray measurements.

The results were also compared with those of the physically long crack. It was found that the propagation resistance and the fatigue threshold of the long cracks increased with temperature in all the materials. The long crack growth rates at three temperatures were approximately represented by an unique curve, after taking account of crack closure level and elastic modulus. In contrast, the small crack growth resistance decreased with temperature even when the crack closure phenomenon was taken into consideration. Furthermore, the small fatigue cracks exhibited considerably higher growth rates than the long cracks at a given effective stress intensity factor range and also grew under effective stress intensity factor ranges below the long crack threshold. The factors responsible for the lack of similitude in propagation rates between small and long cracks were also discussed, based on these observations and the chemical analysis near the crack tip using the electron probe microanalyzer.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical Transactions, A; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1021-1032","","","","Journal ID: MTTABN; ISSN 0360-2133; TRN: IM9629%%41","10.1007/BF02649770","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","250729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/250729","","Metallurgical Transactions, A","4","27"

In these new combustors, the formation of carbonaceous deposits, especially in prevaporizers, affects the reliability and effectiveness of operation. To avoid deposits, a detailed knowledge of the origins and mechanisms of formation is required. To obtain a deeper insight, the phenomena were studied systematically. The deposits under consideration show differing characteristics suggesting more than one formation mechanism in the combustor. Consequently, the primary goal was to identify the formation mechanisms and, subsequently, to simulate the mechanisms under well-defined conditions in bench tests for determining the relevant parameters of deposit build-up. The mechanisms of formation were identified based on the properties of the deposits in the combustion chamber. In order to characterize the deposits, physical and chemical analysis techniques were utilized. In summary, tests and numerical predictions identified two major paths of formation: a deposit build-up resulting from flame products such as soot or coked droplets and a deposit build-up resulting from liquid fuel impinging the wall accompanied with chemical reactions at the wall. The deposits caused by fuel droplet impingement were intensively studied in bench tests. In analyzing the processes, the influence of wall temperature, fuel composition, and the oxygen content in the environment is shown in detail. In addition, the importance of thermal instabilities of the fuel, previously studied under fuel supply system conditions, is demonstrated for a deposit formation inside a combustion chamber.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 40.

The LM2500PE gas turbine contributes with 36.1 percent while the ABC adds 10.5 percent points to the gas turbine efficiency. The ABC shaft power output is 6.6 MW when utilizing the waste heat of an LM2500PE gas turbine. A preliminary thermal and hydraulic design of the ABC main components (compressor, turbine, intercoolers, and recuperator) was carried out. The recuperator is the largest and heaviest component (45 tons). A weight and cost breakdown of the ABC is presented. The total weight of the ABC package was calculated to 154 metric tons, and the ABC package cost to 9.4 million US$. An economical examination for three different cases was carried out. The results show that the ABC alternative (LM2500PE + ABC) is economical, with a rather good margin, compared to the other alternatives. The conclusion is that the Air Bottoming Cycle is an economical alternative for power generation on both new platforms and on existing platforms with demand for more power.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at Cogen-Turbo Power, Vienna (AT) August 23--25, 1995; PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 359-368","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9627%%30","10.1115/1.2816597","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","244708","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/244708","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","2","118"

"A test and demonstration unit for concentrating sulfur dioxide from flue gas","Dunn, J P; Cai, Y; Liebmann, L S; Stenger, Jr, H G; Simpson, D R","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; FLUE GAS; DESULFURIZATION; SULFUR DIOXIDE; ADSORPTION; WASTE PROCESSING PLANTS; ECONOMICS; MORDENITE; SORPTIVE PROPERTIES; POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT; SEPARATION EQUIPMENT; OPERATION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS","A bench-scale system to continuously separate and concentrate SO{sub 2} from flue gas has been developed and tested. The separation is accomplished due to the relative adsorption strengths of SO{sub 2} and water on a synthetic mordenite, a phenomenon known as rollup. The continuous concentration system (CCS) is comprised of two pairs of packed beds that cycle between cleaning, roll-up, and regeneration modes. The bed pairs behave identically, with cycles staggered by half of one adsorption-desorption-regeneration period. The cycle for each pair involves regeneration of one bed with dry air, while the other is cleaning the flue gas and subsequently rolling up the SO{sub 2}. This bench-scale CCS is able to split a 6 standard liters per minute (SLPM) gas stream containing 2,000 ppm SO{sub 2} into two streams of equal flowrate, one containing 3,400 ppm SO{sub 2} and the other 70 ppm SO{sub 2}. The influence of water is strong, with the rollup being optimal at 13% moisture in the flue gas. Adsorption starting with the bed at 75 C is optimal, and air regeneration at 200 C and 8 SLPM for 76 min is adequate. An economic analysis of an industrial-scaled CCS capable of treating a 1,000,000 scfm flue gas stream containing 2,000 ppm SO{sub 2} (typical of a 400-MW coal-fired power plant) was conducted. The CCS installation permits smaller flue gas scrubbers to be installed and can potentially save a 400-MW power plant $2.6 million in annual operating costs.","","","","","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1409-1416","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9625%%377","10.1021/ie950585j","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","238052","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/238052","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","4","35"

Crack initiation was found to be controlled by mechanical effects during fatigue testing in air, high-pH hydroxide solutions, concentrated phosphate solutions, and silicate solutions. In these environments, a large number of cracks initiated by an intrusion-extrusion mechanism. These cracks sometimes were associated with mechanical separation of nonmetallic inclusions and debonded zones. Environmentally controlled crack initiation occurred during fatigue testing in chloride and sulfate solutions. In these aggressive environments, pitting contributed to the crack initiation stage, in addition to dissolved nonmetallic inclusions and emergent boundary etching. Under these conditions, a significant reduction occurred in the number of cracks and the number of cycles to failure, reflecting an increased stress concentration at fewer cracks. When a combination of environmental and mechanical effects controlled the behavior, the characteristics of the initiated cracks became quite variable, being a function of material properties and the properties of the mildly aggressive environments, such as distilled water, low-pH OH{sup {minus}} solutions, and dilute phosphate solutions. The observed fracture mode was found to be a function of potential. At potentials < {minus}350 mV, ductile fracture was the dominant mode of failure. Intergranular cracking was the dominant mode of failure in the potential range from {minus}350 mV to {minus}150 mV, while transgranular cracking took place at potentials > {minus}150 mV.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; Journal Volume: 52; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 262-274","","","","Journal ID: CORRAK; ISSN 0010-9312; TRN: IM9619%%306","10.5006/1.3293638","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","218585","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/218585","","Corrosion","4","52"

This approach was compared with alternative weather modeling approaches. Although seasonality explained a significant amount of variability in mortality, other weather variables explained only a very small amount of additional variability in mortality. The synoptic climatological approach performed as well or slightly better than alternative approaches to controlling for weather. However, th estimated effect of particulate pollution on mortality was mostly unchanged or slightly larger when synoptic categories were used to control for weather. Furthermore, the shape of the estimated dose-response relationship was similar when alternative approaches to controlling for weather were used.

"Particle dispersion in flowing gases -- 1994 Freeman scholar lecture","Stock, D E","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; PARTICULATES; TURBULENT FLOW; DISPERSIONS; TWO-PHASE FLOW; POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT","Particle-laden gas flows are common in many man-made and natural environments. Their importance to industrial processes, agriculture, and human health has made them of great theoretical and practical interest over the past 50 years. Because particles are often carried by a turbulent gas stream, progress in understanding and predicting behavior of particle-laden flows has closely followed developments in understanding and prediction of turbulent flow. The motion of a particle in a gas flow is governed by gravity and the particle`s interaction with the turbulent fluid surrounding it. However, to determine the location and thus the local turbulence surrounding the particle, the trajectory of the particle must be known. It is this nonlinear coupling between the particle motion and the turbulence that makes predicting particle dispersion in gas flow difficult. During the past two decades, fundamental understanding of the dispersion of particles in simple turbulent gas flows has been reached, and the capability of predictive tools has increased exponentially as a result. This review is an attempt to summarize the current state of knowledge about gas-particle flows, and to highlight areas where more research is needed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4-17","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%91","10.1115/1.2817510","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","215410","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215410","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

The linear analysis in the present report shows that the critical flow angle and the propagation velocity are functions of only the diffuser radius ratio. It is shown that the present analysis can reproduce most of the general characteristics observed in experiments: critical flow angle, propagation velocity, velocity, and pressure disturbance fields. It is shown that the vanishing velocity disturbance at the diffuser inlet is caused by the nature of impellers as a resistance and an inertial resistance, which is generally strong enough to suppress the velocity disturbance at the diffuser inlet. This explains the general experimental observations that vaneless diffuser rotating stalls are not largely affected by the impeller.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 123-127","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%104","10.1115/1.2817489","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","215423","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215423","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

The experiments were performed under experimental conditions which have not been examined before. The branch orientation was found to be a significant parameter affecting phase redistribution in the junction. Increasing the downward inclination of the branch was found to reduce the degree of phase separation in the junction under the present test conditions. This is caused by the nonuniform distribution of the liquid film thickness associated with the horizontal inlet annular flow. The phase redistribution data were compared with available models. The need for additional modeling studies was evident. The pressure changes of two-phase flow in the junction were closely correlated with the phase redistribution phenomenon. The data on pressure changes in the junction were correlated using simple models based on momentum and mechanical energy balances.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 166-171","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%110","10.1115/1.2817496","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","215429","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215429","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

These equations include such effects as particle-phase viscous stresses, variable position-dependent particle slip coefficient, and general power-law viscosity-temperature and thermal conductivity-temperature relations. The dimensionless form of the equations are applied to the problem of flow over a semi-infinite flat surface. An appropriate transformation is employed to allow proper comparison with previously published results for special cases of this problem. The full coupled system of equations is solved numerically via an implicit finite-difference method. Graphical results for the density, and temperature profiles as well as the displacement thicknesses, skin-friction coefficients, and the wall heat transfer coefficient for both the fluid and particle phases are presented and discussed in detail. In addition, a parametric study is performed to illustrate the influence of the particle to fluid viscosity ratio and the viscosity-temperature power exponent on the flow properties.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 179-185","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%112","10.1115/1.2817498","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","215431","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215431","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"
"Wall suction effects on the structure of fully developed turbulent pipe flow","Sofialidis, D; Prinos, P","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBULENT FLOW; DYNAMICS; PIPES; MASS TRANSFER; NUMERICAL ANALYSIS","The effects of wall suction on the structure of fully developed pipe flow are studied numerically by solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Linear and nonlinear {kappa}-{epsilon} or {kappa}-{omega} low-Re models of turbulence are used for closing the system of the governing equations. Computed results are compared satisfactorily against experimental measurements. Analytical results, based on boundary layer assumptions and the mixing length concept, provide a law of the wall for pipe flow under the influence of low suction rates. The analytical solution is found in satisfactory agreement with computed and experimental data for a suction rate of A = 0.46%. For the much higher rate of A = 2.53% the above assumptions are not valid and analytical velocities do not follow the computed and experimental profiles, especially in the near-wall region. Near-wall velocities, as well as the boundary shear stress, are increased with increasing suction rates. The excess wall shear stress, resulting from suction, is found to be 1.5 to 5.5 times the respective one with no suction. The turbulence levels are reduced with the presence of the wall suction. Computed results of the turbulent shear stress {ovr uv} are in close agreement with experimental measurements. The distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy {kappa} is predicted better by the {kappa}-{omega} model of Wilcox (1993). Nonlinear models of the {kappa}-{epsilon} and {kappa}-{omega} type predict the reduction of the turbulence intensities u{prime}, v{prime}, w{prime}, and the correct levels of v{prime} and w{prime} but they underpredict the level of u{prime}.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 33-39","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%94","10.1115/1.2817507","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","215413","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215413","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

The configuration considered is related to the design of a centrifugal desalinator, and includes the flow in the annular as well as in the axial gap regions. The computed flowfield shows significant variations in the axial distribution of the azimuthal shear stress due to the secondary flow associated with Taylor vortices. The averaged azimuthal shear stress (or torque) is however not very sensitive to the number of vortices. Computational results also show that, where the aspect ratio of the annulus (rotor length to radial gap width) is relatively small, this azimuthal variation results in a higher average azimuthal shear stress than for the case where the aspect ratio of the annulus is relatively large. Various functional relations for windage torque of infinite cylinders, developed by other researchers on the basis of power law relations or assuming a log-law velocity distribution, are evaluated. Three such relations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results when coupled with a correction for end effects. These relations are also the most useful with respect to the design of rotating equipment.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 116-122","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%103","10.1115/1.2817488","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","215422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215422","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

Over the past several years, practical methods have been developed for measuring the partial discharge activity in the high voltage insulation of stator windings, since partial discharges are a symptom of most of the insulation failure mechanisms in motors and generators rated 4 kV or more. The turbine generator analyzer (TGA) test has now been specifically developed to enable industrial plant staff to reliably perform a partial discharge test on operating motors and turbine generators. This paper presents several case studies of the use of these new partial discharge test technologies on rotating machines. Test results show that machines with deteriorated windings have a partial discharge activity at least 30 times higher than good windings. The availability of these test methods enables plant staff to economically and reliably plan stator winding maintenance, avoid unexpected failures and often extend the time between major maintenance outages.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1994 IEEE petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference, Vancouver, British Columbia (CA), September 12--14, 1994; PBD: Mar-Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 459-464","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9626%%48","10.1109/28.491498","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","242220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/242220","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","2","32"

For CO adsorption on freshly deposited Pd films, a substantial fraction of the CO reacts to CO{sub 2} in TPD, between 450 and 550 K, indicating that oxygen from ceria can react with CO on Pd. Prereduction of the catalyst by heating in CO or H{sub 2} results in TPD curves which are virtually identical to that observed for Pd/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(0001), suggesting that electronic interactions between ceria and Pd have a negligible effect on the adsorption properties. For NO, there are differences between Pd/ceria and Pd/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(0001). A significantly higher fraction of the NO on Pd/ceria reacts to N{sub 2} and N{sub 2}O, and prereduction of the Pd/ceria increases the amount of NO that can adsorb. Both of these results are interpreted as indicating that NO can adsorb on reduced ceria sites which are formed when lattice oxygen at the Pd-ceria interface is transferred to the Pd. For H{sub 2}, the desorption curves are similar to that observed on Pd/{alpha}-Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}(0001), except that the low-temperature feature assigned to the bulk hydride is less well resolved. If water is formed upon H{sub 2} adsorption, it apparently readsorbs on the ceria.

Although most current activity involves credits for sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}), nitrogen oxide (NO{sub x}) trading is under way in certain areas as well, although NO{sub x} markets are local and thus slower to develop. However, utilities see economic development potential in this area; some are providing NO{sub x} credits to their industrial customers to help them comply with environmental regulations - and to retain their loyalty when deregulation affords them a choice of electricity suppliers.

After examination of many different reaction mechanisms and the rate expressions derived from each of them, the sequence of elementary steps and the resulting rate equation which best describe the experimental results for each are reported here. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type expressions indicate that N{sub 2}O proceeds via unimolecular decomposition, whereas the rate determining step for NO decomposition involves a surface reaction between two adsorbed NO molecules. The reduction of NO by CH{sub 4} in the absence of O{sub 2} proceeds with methyl radical formation via hydride abstraction by NO implied as the slow step, and the rate determining step for NO reduction when both CH{sub 4} and O{sub 2} are present again appears to be methyl radical formation by reaction between adsorbed CH{sub 4} and NO{sub 2}. The rate enhancements for NO reduction to N{sub 2} and O{sub 2} when CH{sub 4}, or CH{sub 4} plus O{sub 2}, is utilized are attributed to the formation of methyl radicals and subsequent C-containing surface intermediates which rapidly interact with NO. The proposed chemistry is consistent with both that associated with methane oxidative coupling over rare earth oxides and that describing homogeneous free-radical reactions involving these intermediates. Consequently, a complete catalytic cycle of elementary steps is proposed for each reaction to demonstrate the possible presence of these various intermediates and to allow the testing of these models in the future. 31 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 159; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 119-126","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003197-0014","10.1006/jcat.1996.0071","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263778","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263778","","Journal of Catalysis","1","159"

The fly ash adsorbed 67, 20, and 22 mg/g for phenol, chlorophenol, and 2,4-dichlorophenol, respectively, for the highest water phase concentrations used. The affinity of phenolic compounds for fly ash is above the expected amount corresponding to a monolayer coverage considering that the surface area of fly ash is only 1.87 m{sup 2}/g. The isotherms for contaminants studied were unfavorable, indicating that adsorption becomes progressively easier as more solutes are taken up.

The methods are based on the hardware characteristics of 20-kW/100-kWh and 1-MW/4-MWh prototype BESSs, which are already developed and are being developed, respectively. The candidate site of BESS installation is the secondary side of a distribution substation`s main transformer (MTr). These tacks are performed by first classifying the load pattern of an MTr and comparing it to the load pattern of a total power system. If the load factor improves, then the location is determined to be a BESS installation site. Subsequently, the optimal BESS capacity for an MTr is determined using the given operation pattern, the charging/discharging characteristics, and efficiency. Computational experimentation was performed on an actual distribution system in Korea. After determining the optimal capacity, they verified that installing the BESS on the selected MTr improved both daily and nightly load factors.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 162-167","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9628%%138","10.1109/60.486591","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","248038","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/248038","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","11"

We investigated the effect of sulfur dioxide, a major air pollutant, on the production of these cytokines by alveolar macrophages. The cells were layered on a polycarbonate membrane and exposed for 30 min to 0.0, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 ppm sulfur dioxide at 37 {degrees}C and 100% air humidity. The cells were incubated for 24 h after exposure, thus allowing cytokine release. Cytotoxic effects of sulfur dioxide were evaluated by trypan flue exclusion. Cytokine release. Cytotoxic effects of sulfur dioxide were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. Cytokines were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}, interleukin-1{Beta}, and interleukin-6) or by use of a specific bioassay (i.e., transforming growth factor-{Beta}). The toxicity of sulfur dioxide for alveolar macrophages ranged from 3.1% to 9.5%. A 30-min exposure to sulfur dioxide induced a significant decrease in spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} (p < .001) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-1{Beta} release (p < .05). The release of interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-{Beta} was not affected significantly by sulfur dioxide exposure. Our results demonstrated a functional impairment of alveolar macrophages after sulfur dioxide exposure (i.e., release of tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} and interleukin-1{Beta}).

In the application of the material in electrical machines, the authors find large areas with rotational flux conditions, i.e., in the T-joint region of three-phase power transformers or above the stator teeth of three-phase motors and generators. The most general description of the magnetization process in this case is an elliptically rotating flux. The paper outlines the magnetic behavior of steel sheet under these flux conditions, and finally defines a simple method to predict the total power loss under elliptically rotating flux from data measured under linearly alternating and circularly rotating flux conditions only.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 567-571","","","","Journal ID: IEMGAQ; ISSN 0018-9464; TRN: IM9622%%189","10.1109/20.486549","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","227912","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/227912","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","2","32"

This fuel is required to supply safety-related emergency diesel generators--the backup power systems associated with the safe shutdown of reactors. One important parameter being regulated is the level of particulate contamination in the diesel fuel. Carbon particulate is a natural byproduct of aging diesel fuel. Carbon particulate precipitates from the fuel`s hydrocarbons, then remains suspended or settles to the bottom of fuel oil storage tanks. If the carbon particulate is not removed, unacceptable levels of particulate contamination will eventually occur. The oil must be discarded or filtered. Having an outside contractor come to the plant to filter the diesel fuel can be costly and time consuming. Time is an even more critical factor if a nuclear plant is in a Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) situation. A most effective way to reduce both cost and risk is for a utility to build and install its own diesel fuel filtration system. The cost savings associated with designing, fabricating and operating the system inhouse can be significant, and the value of reducing the risk of reactor shutdown because of uncertified diesel fuel may be even higher. This article describes such a fuel filtering system.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19-20","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9620%%2","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220608","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220608","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","3","100"

Paired with the personal computer, the program permits information, traditionally created and stored on hard copy, to be stored electronically--in effect, it is an on-line reference library. The electronic information can be retrieved, manipulated, and presented to the user based on a set of established criteria. By consolidating documents--electrical schematics, drawings, device specifications, operator logs, calibration data, etc.--the plant staff becomes privy to both real-time and historical information regarding gas-turbine operation. With ready access to such information, the staff is able to troubleshoot quickly and efficiently. The library runs in conjunction with a Windows-based turbine-operating interface (TOI) that graphically represents the on-base devices necessary for operational control. Although operators may not be familiar with the exact purpose of each device represented, they can associate them with the process represented by the particular control screen on which it is shown. For example, an operator may recognize the graphical representation of an auxiliary motor as an important device within the lubrication system because it is shown on the corresponding interface screen, but may have neither knowledge regarding what master control circuit it is wired to, nor where it is located. The on-line reference library is accessed through these graphical representations by triggering a mouse, touch screen, or other input device, or automatically launched from specific alarms generated by the turbine controller. The operator need not be skilled in a particular set of commands or phrases.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 40-42","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9620%%9","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220615","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220615","","Power (New York)","3","140"

The zeolite-based catalysts offers several advantages over both vanadia/titania SCRs and dry low-NO{sub x} combustors. Selective catalytic reduction systems (SCR) have provided efficient, reliable service in hundreds of installations worldwide. These systems can lower NO{sub x} emissions by 80 to 90% with a useful catalyst life of more than five years. But conventional SCR technology is limited in one very important way: the typical vanadia/titania catalyst works only in a temperature range of approximately 575 to 800 F. Any higher, the catalyst undergoes irreversible changes, losing conversion efficiency and active life. High-temperature SCR technology was introduced commercially in the late 1980s to overcome the limitations of precious-metal designs. The zeolite-based catalysts, which have been applied to gas turbines as large as 36 MW, offer comparable NO{sub x} reduction at operating temperatures up to 1,125 F. They open up new system design options for gas-turbine facilities. Applications for high-temperature SCR include simple-cycle gas turbines, cogeneration plant retrofits, and stationary engines.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55-56","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9620%%12","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220618","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220618","","Power (New York)","3","140"

Engineers from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) determined that the Intermountain Generating Station (IGS) in Delta, Utah, could save $26.8 million in fuel and maintenance costs by converting the plant from stack gas reheat (SGR) to wet stack operation. The SGR system was absorbing approximately 1% of the plant`s output, and excessive SGR-bundle corrosion led to frequent bundle replacements, reliability concerns and iron carryover into the boiler feed water. In addition to concerns about modifications to the operating permit and corrosion of downstream equipment, LADWP engineers realized that converting to wet stack operation would increase the potential for liquid fallout in the stack/duct system. This could have meant an additional $1 million in conversion costs depending on the amount of stack modification necessary to control liquid fallout. Before moving ahead with the project, LADWP engineers used a video droplet analyzer to quantify liquid fallout.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 28-31","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9620%%4","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220610","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220610","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","3","100"

With myriad operational and chemical variables to contend with, selecting a tube material that can hold up against an army of corrosion-causing elements is no small task. Corrosion can occur in environments that seem benign, or be initiated by seemingly insignificant defects in the tube material. In an era where utilities are extending the life of units while making do with reduced budgets, corrosion prevention has taken on added importance. This article describes replacement tubes material selection at City Water, Light and Power`s (CWLP) two 80-MW cyclone units (Units 31 and 32) and one 200-MW pulverized coal-fired unit (Unit 33). The condensers for all three units are supplied by once-through cooling, sourced locally from Lake Springfield. The Unit 31 and 32 condensers, commissioned in 1968 and 1972 respectively, were originally tubed with inhibited Admiralty Brass.

The risks are very real; extensive damage at several recent jobs confirms that all blasters are not created equal. At solid-fuel-fired powerplants, slag removal can be a constant battle. Conventional weapons include picks, jackhammers, shotguns fired through portholes, hydro-blasting, and CO{sub 2}-blasting. But each of these methods is labor intensive, consumes substantial amounts of downtime, and may not dislodge severe deposits. In the 1960s, a midwestern plant superintendent, short of personnel because of a labor strike and frustrated by seemingly immovable slagging, resorted to dynamite. The good results surprised both the superintendent and the blasting contractor who had been called in from a nearby civil engineering job. Over the next two decades or so, the technique spread through a core group of believers at powerplants who largely relied on the one original blasting contractor. In recent years, explosive deslagging has become more widely accepted as a state-of-the-art combat technique and several hundred powerplants through the US now make use of it during annual outages. As the technique`s acceptance has grown, so has the number of contractors entering the field. Some veterans worry that the industry has expanded too fast, and unqualified blasters are being allowed into the powerplant.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 49-51","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9620%%10","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220616","","Power (New York)","3","140"

Results reported here from the first full-scale demo are encouraging. In the 1970s, SO{sub 3} conditioning of flue gas rescued utility boilers that switched coals to meet SO{sub 2} compliance limits, but operators found that flyash collection suffered. Since then, conditioning has become a fixture at many coal-fired plants equipped with old electrostatic precipitators (ESPs)--both to maintain compliance with flyash emission limits and fuel flexibility. Although capital costs for these systems came down after patent protection ran out for the one supplier through the late 1980s, reagent costs continue to dog users. Now emerging is a potential solution: convert the SO{sub 2} already in the flue gas to SO{sub 3} in-situ. One process to do this, originally developed by EPRI and called Epricon, recently passed its full-scale trials at New England Power Co.`s coal-fired Brayton Point station Unit 1. Although simple and elegant in theory, the process poses unique challenges.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 52-54","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9620%%11","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","220617","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/220617","","Power (New York)","3","140"

Each power plant component is represented by its typical equations relating to fundamental mechanical and thermodynamic laws, so a power plant system is represented by algebraic equations, which are the typical equations of components, continuity equations, and data concerning plant conditions. This equation system is not linear, but can be reduced to a linear equation system with variable coefficients. The solution is simultaneous for each component and it is determined by an iterative process. An example of a simple gas turbine cycle demonstrates the applied technique.

Milner Generating Station of Alberta Power Limited (145-MW capacity, down-shut firing mechanism of Combustion Engineering Ltd.) utilizes the by-products of the Smoke River coal (low-volatile bituminous) mine. These by-products are composed of run-of-mine, tailings, and reject. High-ash, low-volatile matter content and low char combustion reactivity cause low carbon burnout and low flame stability, and high auxiliary fuel consumption. To improve combustion efficiency of the generating station, combustion reactivity tests were conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a laminar drop tube reactor. In addition, the microscopic characteristics of the coal, bottom ash, and fly ash were also studied. Some of the chars formed from vitrinite, causing low combustion reactivity. Particle size, gas temperature, and oxygen partial pressure have an effect on the apparent rate of coal combustion. Char combustion rate is controlled by oxygen diffusion. Combustion efficiency could be improved by increasing turbulence intensity in the furnace, by blending the coal with a more reactive fuel, or by reducing the ash content of the coal.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 151-166","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9619%%326","10.1080/00908319608908756","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","218605","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/218605","","Energy Sources","2","18"

Meanwhile, HRSG design reflects the escalating demands placed on modern combined cycles. In the US, emphasis continues to center around reducing construction time and cost. The large capital investment, particularly during the erection phase of the project, and the need to get projects on-line as quickly as possible, have placed a significant premium on fast cycle time. Innovations appear in project implementation strategies rather than on advanced boiler technologies. Perhaps nothing illustrates this last statement better than comparing recent large utility units in the US to those in Europe and japan. At the other end of the scale, heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) technology is advancing rapidly to keep pace with ever more powerful gas turbines in combined-cycle (CC) configurations. In fact, the once simple HRSG now anchors a complex steam cycle fully integrated with the gas turbine. Triple pressure levels, NO{sub x} injection steam, steam turbine bypass, elevating steam pressures and temperatures, supplementary firing, selective catalytic reduction, and even accommodating a coal-gasification process are a sampling of extras HRSG designers must accommodate.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 33-37","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9618%%130","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215447","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215447","","Power (New York)","2","140"

This article describes possibilities and limitations of automatic, continuous monitoring of water on-line. Present regulations require analysis of volatile organic compounds only on a daily, weekly, sometimes even monthly basis. Because significant changes in the concentration of volatiles can occur within seconds for waste and process water, within minutes for surface water, and within hours for well water, a system that allows automatic on-line monitoring of water for specific contaminants and provides results within minutes is highly desirable. Continuous extraction of volatile organic compounds with a sparger followed by separation of individual contaminants using gas chromatography is probably the most popular technique for analyzing these compounds (schematic). Sparging is a process by which volatiles are extracted from water by bubbling a clean gas through the water. Evaluations from industrial plants as well as from regulatory agencies over the last several years have established advantages and disadvantages concerning this type of analytical monitoring system.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 45-47","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9618%%133","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215450","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215450","","Power (New York)","2","140"

While many still swear by standard methods, others swear at them, and seek better ways. Laser-based alignment, promising in theory but difficult in practice, has been performed in at least one case as described here. The tightwire method is still the most popular turbine-alignment technique, but it still poses plenty of difficulties. Collecting the data necessary to determine component position relative to the wire is long and tedious. Collection of tops-on data is nearly impossible--for example, there is physically no way to access the center of an 18-in. bore to take readings without disturbing the wire running through the center. Tops on refers to data taken with the machine`s cover on. Yet the tops-on data, when properly analyzed, are important: they can reveal the component movement from the tops-on to the tops-off condition. The tightwire method requires adequately trained personnel with sufficient feel for accurate, repeatable readings. Ambient conditions, especially important for outdoor units, and the outage environment can affect readings, making data repeatability difficult. Errors are inherent in taking manual data, correcting them for wire sag, and then evaluating the results. Those skilled in the art swear by it. For many, however, the technique is not performed frequently enough to develop and maintain that necessary skill level. Two new approaches to this age-old task have been developed that have reduced outage times and led to more accurate and repeatable results. One is a laser-based method applied with results that make its proponents beam; another is an automated transducer-based method.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 48-52","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9618%%134","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215451","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215451","","Power (New York)","2","140"

Optimizing operations has always been a fundamental objective at powerplants. Now, several software packages are emerging to help do the job. They are already being applied, with impressive results reported, in narrower functions, including: (1) reducing NO{sub x} emissions with minimum sacrifice in boiler performance; (2) indicating stack emissions, optimizing emissions among units, and, in some cases, avoiding continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) systems; and (3) optimizing emissions control processes themselves--such as flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) and urea and ammonia injection systems for NO{sub x} control. Today, software packages using various process-optimizing techniques, serve as off-line advisors to operators about plant conditions. One reason such software is not used in closed-loop mode is that virtually all plant distributed control systems (DCS) now operating were not originally designed to support the intense numerical analysis performed by optimization software. But DCS suppliers are taking their cue: their latest offerings include the capability to run optimization software; soon, DCSs may even be supplied with such software already integrated. Next step, say software developers, is to achieve true closed-loop control by having intelligent controllers automatically accept and respond to new setpoint adjustments recommended by the software.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 26-28","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9618%%128","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215445","","Power (New York)","2","140"

At 200-300{degrees}C Mn-Zr oxide exhibited the highest NO removal among the oxides investigated and it was facilitated in the presence of O{sub 2}. The removal was accompanied by the sorption of oxidized NO species on or in the solid and stored via formation of nitrite. Since the sorption and desorption was reversible, the oxide sorbent was regenerated on heating the sample at 400{degrees}C after NO uptake. The stored NO{sub x} species were also eliminated from the solid by reduction with C{sub 3}H{sub 8} or C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH at 300{degrees}C. The amorphous phase of the Mn-Zr oxide which is formed after heating this oxide at 450{degrees}C was extremely effective for NO removal due to good mixing between Mn and Zr oxides. The surface area of the oxide was a maximum and the amorphous phase was dominant for the oxide with Mn/Zr = 1. The removal of NO was not influenced by coexisting CO{sub 2} and was promoted by the presence of H{sub 2}O. 19 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 420-426","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:003799-0006","10.1006/jcat.1996.0043","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263697","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263697","","Journal of Catalysis","2","158"

The effect of exposure to high temperatures under long-term aging or service causes carbide reactions, the kinetics and type of which depend on aging and alloying conditions and metallurgical history. In this research, carbide transformations were investigated in several low-alloy Cr-Mo-V steels during prolonged aging and after service duration by means of physical-chemical phase analysis. The results and conclusions are summarized as follows. Generally, carbide reactions in all steels during martensite aging proceed as follows: M{sub 3}C {yields} MC + M{sub 2}C + M{sub 7}C{sub 3} {yields} M{sub 23}C{sub 6} {yields} M{sub 6}C. Carbide diagrams showing the regions of existence of different carbides have been developed. The type of carbide diagram for each steel is determined by alloying. The rate of preliminary cooling from {gamma} region causes the carbide diagram type to change. A decrease in the rate of cooling leads to the formation of more stable carbides. It was concluded that the M{sub 3}C {yields} M{sub 7}C{sub 3} reaction is replaced with M{sub 3}C {yields} M{sub 23}C{sub 6}. All the carbides typical for the given alloying are formed during martensite aging, since the metal proceeds through the successive stages of carbide transformations. After long-term service at 520 C to 560 C, Mo is mainly in carbides independent of its original content. Molybdenum precipitation in carbides during service occurs in the first 30,000 to 40,000 hours, and for times up to 200,000 hours, there is no significant change in Mo content in carbides. A carbide of M{sub 6}C was formed in the steel with 1% Mo, and M{sub 23}C{sub 6} carbide was found in all steels investigated.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical Transactions, A; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 498-502","","","","Journal ID: MTTABN; ISSN 0360-2133; TRN: IM9616%%32","10.1007/BF02648434","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","207704","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207704","","Metallurgical Transactions, A","2","27"

One example is a nuclear station located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, which has been able to control the mollusk with chlorine (in the form of sodium hypochlorite, generated on-site), non-oxidizing biocide, and mechanical removal of adult mussels. Recently, the plant evaluated the possibility of substituting chlorine dioxide (ClO{sub 2}) to achieve the same result more economically, without additional impact on the environment.

Reasons, by now, are clear: the CC powerplant--in its basic form, a gas turbine exhausting into a heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) that supplies a steam turbine--is the most efficient electric generating system commercially available today. It also exhibits capital costs significantly lower than competing nuclear, fossil-fired steam, and renewable-energy stations. In addition, its low air emissions, water consumption, space requirements, and physical profile are no trifling advantages in an era marked by tough permitting and siting processes. A relatively recent advance that may further cement the CC`s front-running position is combining the gas turbine, steam turbine, and electric generator on a single shaft. Locking together the turbines and generator to form one single-train operating system promises to simplify plant design and operation, and may lower first costs. Trade-offs of the single-shaft approach, however, include the need for higher starting power and less operating flexibility, particularly if no synchronous clutch is used between the gas and steam turbine. Also worth noting: the arrangement takes away the phased construction option where a simple-cycle gas turbine is installed first and the steam cycle is added later. But depending on project specifics, the rewards of the single-shaft CC can outweigh its drawbacks, as a look at several recent installations reveals in this article.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 24-28","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9618%%174","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","215491","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215491","","Power (New York)","1","140"

The reaction chemistry is thought to be similar to that of spray-drying absorption. The liquid-phase mass-transfer coefficient was successfully modeled as a function of the sorbent particle spacing on the wetted surfaces. Gas-phase mass-transfer resistances were assumed to be insignificant. Due to the high surface area available in a CDS reactor, the evaporation rate of water from the slurry was modeled as constant-rate drying according to classic spray-dryer theory. However, the falling-rate and diffusion evaporation stages were negligible in CDS since sorbent particle bunching at the surface of the slurry is nonexistent.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 259-268","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9613%%416","10.1002/aic.690420123","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","201439","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/201439","","AIChE Journal","1","42"

However, it may be desirable to use a dry process because dewatering finely pulverized coal is difficult and expensive, and burning wet coal reduces the thermal efficiency of the combustion process. It has been shown that high gradient magnetic filters can be constructed which will extract micron-sized paramagnetic particles from a pulverized coal-air stream passing through the filter. Conventional magnetic separators are generally restricted to separating strongly magnetic materials, such as iron and magnetite. High gradient magnetic filters are capable of separating weakly paramagnetic particles, the magnetic force being proportional to the product of field strength and gradient. Only superconducting magnets are currently economic to generate sufficiently large background magnetic fields of, say, more than 2 Tesla, over the volumes required for the desulfurization of coal. These experimental tests indicated that the dry magnetic desulfurization process was able to remove up to 69% of the pyritic sulfur and 33% of the ash content from a typical pulverized coal in a vertically upward airstream rig, and the heating value recovery is 97%. Increasing magnetic fields increases the percentage of reductions of pyritic sulfur, total sulfur, and ash. The penalty for the improved sulfur removals was the reduced heating value recoveries.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIChE Journal; Journal Volume: 42; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 277-284","","","","Journal ID: AICEAC; ISSN 0001-1541; TRN: IM9613%%417","10.1002/aic.690420126","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","201440","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/201440","","AIChE Journal","1","42"

The chemistry and the surface acidity are found to vary dramatically as the weight loading of vanadia is increased from 0 to 10%. NO reacts over evacuated TiO{sub 2} and V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} at room temperature to form nitrous oxide (N{sub 2}O). Over the V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2} catalysts N{sub 2} is also produced upon room temperature adsorption. The chemical shift of the terminal nitrogen of N{sub 2}O adsorbed on the catalyst is an indicator of the Lewis acid character of the surface. The Lewis acidity of the surface is found to decrease with the loading of V{sub 2}O{sub 5} on the titania support. Ammonia adsorbs in two forms on evacuated TiO{sub 2} and V{sub 2}O{sub 5}/TiO{sub 2}. These two forms differ in their surface mobility. The reaction of NO with NH{sub 3} over the catalysts proceeds to a measurable degree at room temperature. N{sub 2} is the predominant product; however, N{sub 2}O is also produced by the partial reduction of NO. Following preadsorption of ammonia, the chemical shift of the terminal nitrogen of N{sub 2}O is similar to that of samples with a high V{sub 2}O{sub 5} loading regardless of the actual vanadia loading. This indicates that ammonia is adsorbed predominately on the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst, blocking the access of N{sub 2}O to these sites. 41 refs., 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 199-204","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0019","10.1006/jcat.1996.0019","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223981","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

The polynomials in transformed variables obtained are intended for fast industrial calculations. The approach is applied on eleven thermodynamic dependencies with pairs of independent variables most frequently encountered in turbine calculations. These functional forms were originally derived for the description of steam properties, but they are equally applicable to any gas in adequate region of state parameters. Approximation function for the dependence T(h, s) of steam is presented as an example including the values of 18 fitted parameters.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 210-213","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%47","10.1115/1.2816542","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","207719","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207719","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"
"Low-NO{sub x} premixed combustion of MBtu fuels using the ABB Double Cone Burner (EV burner)","Doebbeling, K; Knoepfel, H P; Polifke, W; Winkler, D; Steinbach, C; Sattelmayer, T","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; GAS TURBINE ENGINES; FUEL INJECTION SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN OXIDES; AIR POLLUTION ABATEMENT","A novel combustion technique, based on the Double Cone Burner, has been developed and tested. NO{sub x} emissions down to very low levels are reached without the usual strong dilution of the fuel for MBtu syngases from oxygen-blown gasification of coal or residual oil. A limited amount of dilution is necessary in order to prevent ignition during the mixing of fuel and combustion air. The relevant properties of the fuel are reviewed in relation to the goal of achieving premised combustion. The basic considerations lead to a fuel injection strategy completely different from that for natural gas. A high-speed premixing system is necessary due to the very short chemical reaction times of MBtu fuel. Fuel must be prevented from forming ignitable mixtures inside the burner for reliability reasons. A suitable fuel injection method, which can be easily added to the ABB double cone burner, is described. In common with the design of the standard EV burner, the MBtu EV burner with this fuel injection method is inherently safe against flashback. Three-dimensional flow field and combustion modeling is used to investigate the mixing patterns and the location of the reaction front. Two burner test facilities, one operating at ambient and the other at full gas turbine pressure, have been used for the evaluation of different burner designs. The full-pressure tests were carried out with the original gas turbine burner size and geometry. Combining the presented numerical predictive capabilities and the experimental test facilities, burner performance can be reliably assessed for a wide range of MBtu and LBtu fuels (residue oil gasification, waste gasification, coal gasification, etc.). The atmospheric tests of the burner show NO{sub x} values below 2 ppm at an equivalence ratio equal to full-load gas turbine operation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 46-53","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%81","10.1115/1.2816548","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","207753","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207753","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

The bladed disk-system must be considered either fin whole, or as a structure composed of cyclically symmetric sectors. The latter approach, while being computationally more economical, is more complicated to implement because both the structural system and the applied forces must be transformed to a system based on the geometry of a single sector. However, the sector transformation permits a natural ordering of the modes that cannot be obtained from a complete system model. This paper describes the development of the sector model, and the associated transformation of the applied harmonic forces typically prevalent in turbomachinery. The displacements are expressed in a series of the natural modes of a transformed sector, and expressions are developed for maximum displacements of the complete structure. This approach leads to an easier interpretation of the analytical results and an improved physical understanding of the response. For example, it is shown that a single harmonic, or engine-order excitation, can cause response in only a restricted subset of modes.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 130-136","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%87","10.1115/1.2816528","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","207759","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207759","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

The principal difficulty of employing a gas turbine in a coal-fired power generation system is the possible erosion and corrosion of the high-temperature rotating gas turbine components caused by the coal`s inorganic and organically bound constituents (ash, sulfur, and alkali metals). One route to overcome this problem is the development of an externally fired gas turbine system employing a coal fired heat exchanger. The solution discussed in this paper is the design of a Radiatively Enhanced, Aerodynamically Cleaned Heat-Exchanger (REACH-Exchanger). The REACH-Exchanger is fired by radiative an convective heat transfer from a moderately clean fuel stream and radiative heat transfer from the flame of a much larger uncleaned fuel stream, which supplies most of the heat. The approach is to utilize the best ceramic technology available for high-temperature parts of the REACH-Exchanger and to shield the high-temperature surfaces from interaction with coal minerals by employing clean combustion gases that sweep the tube surface exposed to the coal flame. This paper presents a combined experimental/computational study to assess the viability of the REACH-Exchanger concept. Experimental results indicated that the REACH-Exchanger can be effectively fired using radiation from the coal flame. Both computation and experiments indicate that the ceramic heat exchanger can be aerodynamically protected by a tertiary stream with an acceptably low flow rate.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 22-31","","","FG05-92ER81323; AC22-92PC92196","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%37","10.1115/1.2816545","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","207709","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207709","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

Results showed that hydrogen addition into a steam-injected diffusion combustor at hydrogen/fuel molar ratios of approximately 20% was associated with somewhat increased NO{sub x} production and reduced CO emissions. Both effects are attributed to an increase in the local stoichiometric flame temperature. However, the decrease in CO was greater than the increase in NO{sub x}, resulting in a net emissions benefit, or a shifting of the NO{sub x}-CO curve toward the origin. Consequently, a greater range of NO{sub x}/CO emissions targets could be achieved when hydrogen was available. Additional experiments on premixed systems with hydrogen injection showed a significant increase in operability. Cost estimates for producing hydrogen with a conventional fired steam reformer suggested high capital costs unless ample steam is already available. Hence, the technology is particularly well suited for turbines that use steam for power augmentation. Alternate reforming technology, such as catalytic partial oxidation, offers the potential for reduced capital costs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the ASME Cogen Turbo Power `94, Portland, OR (US), October 25--27, 1994; PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 78-85","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%40","10.1115/1.2816553","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","207712","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207712","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

To validate the fuzzy logic approach, the fuzzy controller is compared to a classical proportional and integral (PI) controller, commonly used in industrial applications, designed by Ziegler-Nichols tuning.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 204-209","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%46","10.1115/1.2816541","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","207718","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207718","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

A Navier-Stokes solver, capable of modeling all the viscous terms, in a Reynolds-averaged formulation, was used. The work had two major goals. The first was to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex three-dimensional flow fields that exist in the exhaust hood at representative operating conditions. The second was to evaluate the relative benefits of a flow guide modification to optimize performance at a selected operating condition. Also, the influence of simulated turbine discharge characteristics, relative to uniform hood entrance conditions, was evaluated. The calculations show several interesting and possibly unique results. They support use of an integrated approach to the design of turbine exhaust stage blading and hood geometry for optimum efficiency.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 214-224","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%48","10.1115/1.2816543","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","207720","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207720","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

Combustion performance was evaluated at high power conditions in a high-pressure, single-nozzle test facility, which operates at full baseload conditions. Single digit NO{sub x} levels and high combustion efficiency were achieved. A wide operability range with no signs of flashback, autoignition, or thermal problems was demonstrated. NO{sub x} sensitivities to pressure and residence time were found to be small at flame temperatures below 1,850 K (2,870 F). Above 1,850 K some NO{sub x} sensitivity to pressure and residence time was observed and was associated with the increase role of the thermal NO{sub x} production mechanism at elevated flame temperatures.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 38-45","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%80","10.1115/1.2816547","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","207752","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207752","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

The relationships between the imbalance masses on the rotor and frequency response functions are also analyzed based upon the modal balancing method, and the equations related to the static and dynamic imbalance masses and the frequency response function are obtained. Experiments on a high-speed rotor balancing rig were performed to verify the theory, and the experimental data agree satisfactorily with the analytical solutions. The improvement on the traditional balancing method proposed in this paper will substantially reduce the number of rotor startups required during the balancing process of rotating machinery.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 95-99","","","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%41","10.1115/1.2816556","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","207713","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207713","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"
"Nonlinear analysis of rotordynamic instabilities in high-speed turbomachinery","Chan, D S.H.","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBOMACHINERY; INSTABILITY; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; CALCULATION METHODS","A nonlinear approach based on the method of averaging has been developed to study unstable lateral vibrations of rotors in high-speed turbomachinery. The method makes use of an extended concept of bearing dynamic coefficients, which are defined by applying small perturbations to the dynamic equilibrium positions. The approach has been applied to determine the stability threshold of flexible rotors supported on short and tilting-pad journal bearings, respectively. Stability performance of systems supported on short journal bearings is improved by the presence of mass unbalance. However, for flexible rotors supported on tilting-pad journal bearings, increased unbalance can lead to lower rotordynamic stability margins. This has the significant implication that stability estimates from linear analysis are not always conservative. The present method provides a computationally more efficient way to understand the nonlinear vibration behavior of high-speed turbomachinery.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 122-129","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%86","10.1115/1.2816527","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","207758","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207758","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

In this paper, a numerical model, based on the theory of cyclically symmetric structures, is applied to the vibration analysis, and in particular, the harmonic response, of a flexible disk supporting a number of groups, or packets, of turbine blades. Results are presented to show variations in the modal participation factors as a function of such parameters as disk flexibility, blade density, and the total number of assembled groups.

The surface chemistry of three systems has been studied using IR spectra of adsorbed NO. Most of the copper in Cu-ZSM5 was in the form of Cu(I). Cu(II) species were predominant in Cu-mordenite. For Cu-UHSY the number of Cu(I) species increased as the level of copper loading increased. The catalytic activity for NO decomposition appeared to depend on a Cu(I)- Cu(II) redox cycle which resulted in the formation of an ON-Cu{sup 2+}-NO{sub 2}{sup -} complex, previously postulated as the critical intermediate in the reaction. Both oxidation and regeneration of the Cu(I) sites in Cu-ZSM5 occurred readily. In Cu-UHSY oxidation was low, suggesting that Cu(I) species were more stable. Cu(II) was the prominent copper species in Cu-mordenite, and regeneration of the Cu(I) sites was difficult. Stability, oxidation, and regeneration of Cu(I) sites play a major role in NO decomposition. In over-exchanged Cu-ZSM5, the Cu(I) sites were more stable, and the rate of oxidation was high. Furthermore a large number of reduced sites were readily regenerated from the Cu(II), thus making it the most effective catalyst for the decomposition of NO. 27 refs., 24 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 301-310","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0029","10.1006/jcat.1996.0029","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223991","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223991","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

Nitrito groups are most prominent on Co/ZSM-5. These complexes are stable at 150{degrees}C in He but are reduced upon exposure to either C{sub 3}H{sub 8} or CH{sub 4} leading to the formation of N{sub 2}. Conversely, Cu/ZSM-5 forms nitro and nitrate groups which are stable at 200{degrees}C. At this temperature these complexes are chemically reduced to N{sub 2} upon exposure to CA yet remain inert to CH{sub 4}. At higher temperatures, thermal decomposition yields NO/NO{sub 2}, O{sub 2}, and H{sub 2}O. The specific rate of NO reduction over Cu/ZSM-5 decreases with Cu loading indicating that isolated Cu{sup 2+}{center_dot}NO{sub 2} complexes pay a significant role in the mechanism. The hydrocarbon specificity of these complexes thus matches the known catalytic specificity of NO, reduction over Cu/ZSM-5 and Co/ZSM-5. The mechanistic cause for the catalytic specificity of the ZSM-5 hosted metals in NO, reduction thus is traced back to the structure and reactivity of the specific NO{sub y} adsorption complexes which these metals produce upon interacting with NO + O{sub 2}. The consumption of CH{sub 4} when feeds containing NO, CH{sub 4} and O{sub 2} are exposed to Cu/ZSM-5 can be attributed to nonselective combustion with adsorbed oxygen and not to reactions with NO{sub y}. 26 refs., 8 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 327-335","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0031","10.1006/jcat.1996.0031","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223993","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

The most active catalysts are produced by N{sub 2}O treatment of Pt{sub 3}Ce{sub 7} at 720 K, which leads to the highest dispersion of both the Pt and ceria phases. This reflects the smaller exotherm, which occurs with N{sub 2}O, apparently a critical requirement for production of a highly active catalyst. The Performance of these Pt{sub 3}Ce{sub 7}-derived catalysts is comparable with that of the best, recently announced, materials prepared by wet chemical techniques. In all cases, most of the active material is invisible to X-ray diffraction and the catalysts exhibit very low CO-titratable Pt area (<0.05 CO/Pt). Prereduction in H{sub 2} at 570 K greatly enhances the reactivity of a given catalyst. CO TPR shows that highest activity correlates with a reduction state at {approximately}510 K, suggesting metal-promoted CO oxidation by the ceria. It seems possible that this high activity is associated with ceria spillover onto Pt, the spillover being facilitated by atomic-level mixing of Pt and Ce in the alloy precursor. 37 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 102-108","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0011","10.1006/jcat.1996.0011","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223973","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223973","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

Five inundation correction factors are tested against the experimental data. Comparisons between the predicted results and the experimental data are made in terms of total condensation rates and local heat flux distributions. The effects of noncondensable gases and cooling water velocity are assessed by comparing local heat flux distributions, total condensation rates, and average steam-side and average overall heat transfer coefficients under different inlet air mass fraction and inlet cooling water velocity conditions. A quasi-three-dimensional approach is used in the numerical analysis, in which three-dimensional effects due to the rise of the cooling water temperature along the cooling water flow direction have been included in the simulations. The governing equations are solved in primitive variable form using a semiimplicit consistent control-volume formulation in which a segregated pressure correction-linked algorithm is employed. The modeling is carried out based on porous media concepts using flow, heat, and mass transfer resistances.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Heat Transfer Engineering; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19-30","","","","Journal ID: HTEND2; ISSN 0145-7632; TRN: IM9628%%123","10.1080/01457639608939865","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","248023","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/248023","","Heat Transfer Engineering","1","17"

"Computation and simulation of wake-generated unsteady pressure and boundary layers in cascades.

Numerical simulations are carried out to understand the effects of the wake velocity defect and the wake turbulence intensity on the development of unsteady blade boundary layers. The boundary layer transition on the blade is found to be strongly influenced by the unsteady wake passing. Periodic transitional patches are generated by the high turbulence intensity in the passing wakes and transported downstream. The time-dependent transition results in large unsteadiness in the instantaneous local skin friction coefficient and a smoother time-averaged transition curve than the one observed in the steady boundary layer. A parametric study is then carried out to determine the influence of wake parameters on the development of the unsteady blade boundary layers. It is shown that the unsteadiness in the blade boundary layer increases with a decrease in the axial gap, an increase in wake/blade count ratio, or an increase in the wake traverse speed. The time-averaged boundary layer momentum thickness at the trailing edge of the blade is found to increase significantly for higher wake/blade count ratio and larger wake traverse speed. Increase of the wake/blade count ratio also results in higher frictional drag of the blade.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 109-120","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%65","10.1115/1.2836589","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","194224","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194224","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"
"The streamwise development of Goertler vortices in a favorable pressure gradient","Finnis, M V; Brown, A","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; TURBINE BLADES; BOUNDARY LAYERS; VORTICES; GAS TURBINES; PRESSURE GRADIENTS","Measurements are presented of the streamwise velocity variation within a laminar boundary layer on a concave surface of 4 m radius of curvature for which the free-stream velocity gradient factor ({nu}/U{sub 0}{sup 2})dU{sub 0}/dx was approximately 1 {times} 10{sup {minus}6}. The velocity variation was consistent with the presence of counterrotating vortices resulting from the Goertler instability. The vortices exhibited exponential growth over the streamwise extent of the measurements to a disturbance amplitude of approximately 13% of the local free-stream velocity. The vortex growth rates were found to be less than those for a zero velocity gradient factor, indicating that a favorable pressure gradient stabilizes the flow with respect to the Goertler instability. Boundary layer profiles at local upwash and downwash positions are compared with the linear theory for which the mean flow was modeled using the Pohlhausen approximation to the solution of the boundary layer equations. The agreement between the measured and predicted profiles indicates that the linear stability theory can provide a fair approximation to the small amplitude growth of the Goertler instability.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 162-171","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%67","10.1115/1.2836597","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","194226","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194226","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

Because of the high temperatures, the turbine vanes and blades have to be cooled, and also knowledge of the mechanically and thermally stressed parts in the hottest zones of the rotor is of great interest. The present paper deals with investigations on a pure axially directed heat flux. An experimental setup was designed to realize a wide range of Ra numbers (2 {times} 10{sup 8} < Ra < 5 {times} 10{sup 10}) usually encountered in cavities of gas turbine rotors. Parallel to the experiments, numerical calculations have been conducted. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data. The numerical scheme is also used to account for the influence of Re on heat transfer without changing Ra. This influence could not be pointed out by experiments, because a variation of the Re-Ra characteristic of the employed annuli was not possible. It was found that the numerical and experimental data are in quite good agreement, with exception of high Ra, where the numerical scheme predicts higher heat transfer than the experiments show. One reason may be that in the experiments the inner and outer cylindrical walls were not really adiabatic, an assumption used in the numerical procedure. Moreover, the assumption of a two-dimensional flow pattern may become invalid for high Ra. The influence of three-dimensional effects was studied with the three-dimensional version of the numerical code. In contrast to the radial directed heat transfer, it was found that Nu is much smaller and depends strongly on Re, whereas the radial heat transfer is only weakly influenced by Re.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-19","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%55","10.1115/1.2836590","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","194214","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194214","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

The variable nature of the brush during operation makes leakage prediction difficult. A simple semi-empirical model based on an effective brush thickness parameter has been successfully used to correlate and predict brush seal leakage in engine environments. The model was extended to correlate a range of brush densities using a physically realistic brush thickness. Later, the model was based on mean diametric brush properties for a large range of circular brush seal geometries. However, the best basis for modeling bristle distribution was unknown. This paper proposes a solution to the distribution problem by assuming a randomly distributed bristle bed. A random distribution leads to a rectangular array model that is supported by the quality of leakage data generalization. Applying the resultant effective thickness parameter to predict brush seal performance in turbine engines is discussed.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 153-161","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%66","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","194225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194225","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

In Section 1, a steady-state injection model of the film cooling is incorporated into a two-dimensional, thin shear layer, multiblade row CFD code. This injection model accounts for the penetration and spreading of the coolant jet, as well as the entrainment of the boundary layer fluid by the coolant. The code is validated, in the steady state, by comparing its predictions to data from a blade tested in linear cascade. In Section 2, time-resolved film cooled turbine rotor heat transfer measurements are compared with numerical predictions. Data were taken on a fully film cooled blade in a transonic, high pressure ratio, single-stage turbine in a short duration turbine test facility, which simulates full-engine non-dimensional conditions. Film cooled heat flux on the pressure surface is predicted to be as much as a factor of two higher in the time average of the unsteady calculations compared to the steady-state case. Time-resolved film cooled heat transfer comparison of data to prediction at two spanwise positions is used to validate the numerical code. The unsteady stator-rotor interaction results in the pulsation of the coolant injection flow out of the film holes with large-scale fluctuations. The combination of pulsating coolant flow and the interaction of the coolant with this unsteady external flow is shown to lower the local pressure side adiabatic film effectiveness by as much as 64% when compared to the steady-state case.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 123-133","","","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%91","10.1115/1.2836593","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","194250","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194250","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

Secondary flows generated by the angled ribs are believed to be responsible for these higher heat transfer coefficients. In an effort basically to double the area of high heat transfer coefficients, the angled rib is broken at the center to form a V-shaped rib, and tests are conducted to investigate the resulting heat transfer coefficients and friction factors. Three different square rib geometries, corresponding to blockage ratios of 0.083, 0.125, and 0.167, with a fixed pitch-to-height ratio of 10, mounted on two opposite walls of a square channel in a staggered configuration, are tested in a stationary channel for 5,000 < Re < 30,000. Heat transfer coefficients, friction factors, and thermal performances are compared with those of 90 deg, 45 deg, and discrete angled ribs. The V-shaped ribs are tested for both pointing upstream and downstream of the main flow. Test results show that: (a) 90 deg ribs represent the lowest thermal performance, based on the same pumping power, and is essentially the same for the 2:1 change in blockage ratio, (b) low-blockage-ratio (E/D{sub h} = 0.083) V-shaped ribs pointing downstream produced the highest heat transfer enhancement and friction factors. Among all other geometries with blockage ratios of 0.125 and 0.167, 45 deg ribs showed the highest heat transfer enhancements with friction factors less than those of V-shaped ribs, (c) thermal performance of 45 deg ribs and the lowest blockage discrete ribs are among the highest of the geometries tested in this investigation, and (d) discrete angled ribs, although inferior to 45 deg and V-shaped ribs, produce much higher heat transfer coefficients and lower friction factors compared to 90 deg ribs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 20-28","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%56","10.1115/1.2836602","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","194215","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194215","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

Two-dimensional unsteady nonreflecting boundary conditions are used at the inlet and the outlet of the computational domain. The unsteady Euler solver captures the wake propagation and the resulting unsteady pressure field, which is then used as the input for a two-dimensional unsteady boundary layer procedure to predict the unsteady response of blade boundary layers. The boundary layer code includes an advanced {kappa}-{epsilon} model developed for unsteady turbulent boundary layers. The present computational procedure has been validated against analytic solutions and experimental measurements. The validation cases include unsteady inviscid flows in a flat-plate cascade and a compressor exit guide vane (EGV) cascade, unsteady turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate subject to a traveling wave, unsteady transitional boundary layer due to wake passing, and unsteady flow at the midspan section of an axial compressor stator.

The experiments are conducted with negligible streamwise acceleration and a nominal free-stream turbulence intensity of {approximately} 8%. Comparisons are made with data taken in an earlier study in the same test facility but with a 0.6% free-stream turbulence intensity. Results show that elevated free-stream turbulence intensity enhances turbulence transport quantities like {ovr uv} and {ovr vt} in most of the boundary layer. In contrast to the low-turbulence cases, high levels of transport of momentum are measured outside the boundary layer. Stable, Goertlerlike vortices, present in the flow under low-turbulence conditions, do not form when the free-stream turbulence intensity is elevated. Turbulent Prandtl numbers, Pr{sub t}, within the log region of the boundary layer over the concave wall increase with streamwise distance to values as high as 1.2. Profiles of Pr{sub t} suggest that the increase in momentum transport with increased free-stream turbulence intensity precedes the increase in heat transport. Distributions of near-wall mixing length for momentum remain unchanged on the concave wall when free-stream turbulence intensity is elevated. Both for this level of free-stream turbulence and for the lower level, mixing length distributions increase linearly with distance from the wall, following the standard slope. However, when free-stream turbulence intensity is elevated, this linear region extends farther into the boundary layer, indicating the emerging importance of larger eddies in the wake of the boundary layer with the high-turbulence free stream. Because these eddies are damped by the wall, the influence of the wall grows with eddy size.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Turbomachinery; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 172-180","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JOTUEI; ISSN 0889-504X; TRN: IM9611%%68","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","194227","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194227","","Journal of Turbomachinery","1","118"

Erosion-corrosion accelerated on the seawater side because heating decreased the critical flow rate and enhanced formation of deposits which were obstacles to the flow.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Performance; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 67-68","","","","Journal ID: MTPFBI; ISSN 0094-1492; TRN: IM9605%%39","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","170020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/170020","","Materials Performance","1","35"

Intermetallics, of composition Fe{sub 3}Al and FeAl, can become commercially attractive if the hydrogen embrittlement problem in these materials can be overcome. These intermetallic materials are ideal for application in high temperature fossil fuel fired energy conversion systems due to their superior oxidation and sulfidation resistance, and most importantly, low cost. The effect of Cr additions on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of iron aluminides is addressed in this paper from an electrochemical viewpoint. The importance of hydrogen liberation rates in affecting HE would be clearly seen. The possible HE mechanism will also be considered. Finally, a possible criterion for the selection of alloying elements (other than the normally reported Cr) to provide enhanced room temperature ductilities to iron aluminides will be outlined.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scripta Materialia; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 127-133","","","","Journal ID: XZ503X; ISSN 1359-6462; TRN: IM9609%%51","10.1016/1359-6462(95)00495-5","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","186779","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/186779","","Scripta Materialia","1","34"
"Mass customization in power plant design and construction","Choi, K C; Jarboe, T B","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; COMBINED-CYCLE POWER PLANTS; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; FOSSIL-FUEL POWER PLANTS; COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN; CAPITALIZED COST","This article describes how Bechtel`s PowerLine concept brings economies of scale and the fundamentals of mass production to plant design and construction. Privatization, globalization and commoditization will shape the power industry for decades to come. Diverse as these forces are, they are bound together by a common business imperative: the need for low-cost, high-quality energy that provides operators and developers with the great potential for a return on equity. One solution to this challenge is predicated chiefly on the design and construction of reliable, low-cost generating plants--the concept of mass customization. More than simply standardization, mass customization achieves the economies of mass production but also provides the flexibility needed by individual plants and owners. This process reaps the benefits of standardization and, at the same time, permits a degree of customization so the design will meet the differing needs of independents, utilities and other power producers.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering (Barrington); Journal Volume: 100; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 33-36","","","","Journal ID: POENAI; ISSN 0032-5961; TRN: IM9609%%172","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","186899","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/186899","","Power Engineering (Barrington)","1","100"

EPRI`s Fossil Assets Management methodologies provide a formal value-analysis process for determining which investment and utilization options for fossil plants provide the greatest benfits at the corporate level. Three major types of asset management decisions are involved: how to deploy each unit in a utility`s fossil plant fleet, what investments should be made at specific plants, and how to modify operation and maintenance practices in view of present equipment condition. EPRI has also developed the Strategic Asset Management methodology which focuses on even border alternatives for allocating budgets and staff time across the utility. The FAM and SAM methodologies can be used together to analyze a full suite of asset management decisions, ranging from corporate-level reorganization to key equipment purchases at specific plants. This paper describes these strategies.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EPRI Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15","","","","Journal ID: EPRJDS; ISSN 0362-3416; TRN: 96:002226-013","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","219653","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/219653","","EPRI Journal","1","21"

Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, recently required an upgrade to load management, fuel management, and governor control systems after installing two new Stewart & Stevenson GE LM5000 gas turbine generator systems. These generators were installed to replace seven older diesel generators and also to meet current and anticipated future load demand. The installation of the gas turbines changed dramatically the power management strategy of the plant. As a result of the new-plant configuration, a power management system had to be developed to adequately protect the cement plant`s manufacturing and power generating equipment. The control system was divided into several main sections. These comprised load shedding, including pro-active load shedding; plant power factor control using capacitor banks; diesel engine load management and engine fuel management; automatic bus-to-bus synchronizing and transformer tap changer control; gas turbine monitoring/control, remote power plant control and monitoring: and overall power plant monitoring. This system is briefly described in this paper.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10, 12","","","","Journal ID: DGWODS; ISSN 0278-5994; TRN: 96:001832-030","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","199422","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/199422","","Diesel and Gas Turbine Worldwide","1","28"

A coal-oil agglomeration technique has been tested as a possible option to treat the feed in order to improve the quality. The recovered coal from this agglomeration/flotation treatment had a significantly reduced ash content and increased calorific value. Char reactivity was determined using thermogravimetry and results show no difference in reactivity between the raw and treated coal tailings feed. Evolved gas analysis performed during the thermogravimetric runs also showed no significant difference in the evolved gases except for an increase in volatile hydrocarbon release. The final product would lead to improved flame stability and reduced mechanical and ash-handling problems.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-50","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9617%%494","10.1080/00908319608908745","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","212178","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/212178","","Energy Sources","1","18"

"A catalytic combustor for high-temperature gas turbines","Vortmeyer, N; Valk, M; Kappler, G","33 ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEMS; 20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; CATALYTIC COMBUSTORS; PERFORMANCE; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; GAS TURBINES; AIR POLLUTION CONTROL","Catalytic combustion has been the subject of thorough research work for over two decades, mainly in the US and Japan. However, severe material problems in the ceramic or metallic monolith prevented regular operation in most cases. Still, during these two decades, turbine inlet temperatures were raised remarkably, and lean premix combustors have become standard in stationary gas turbines. In view of these facts, a simple monolith-in-tube concept of a catalytic combustor was adapted for the use in high-temperature gas turbines. Its essential feature is the fact that a considerable portion of the homogeneous gas phase reaction is shifted to the thermal reactor, thus lowering the catalyst temperature. This is achieved by the employment of very short catalyst segments. The viability of this concept has been demonstrated for a variety of pure hydrocarbons, alcohols as well as common liquid fuels. Extensive experimental investigations of the atmospheric combustor led to the assessment of parameters such as reference velocity, fuel-to-air ratio, and fuel properties. The maximum combustor exit temperature was 1,673 K with a corresponding catalyst temperature of less than 1,300 K for diesel fuel. Boundary conditions were in all cases combustion efficiency (over 99.9%) and pressure loss (less than 6%). Additionally, a model has been developed to predict the characteristic values of the catalytic combustor such as necessary catalyst length, combustor volume, and emission characteristics. The homogeneous reaction in the thermal reactor can be calculated by a one-dimensional reacting flow model.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 39. international gas turbine and aeroengine congress and exposition, The Hague (Netherlands), 13-16 Jun 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 61-64","","CONF-940626-","","Journal ID: JETPEZ; ISSN 0742-4795; TRN: IM9616%%82","10.1115/1.2816550","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","207754","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207754","","Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power","1","118"

The other units burn medium- and high-sulfur (> 1 wt %) coal in an atmospheric fluidized-bed combustion unit and in a research unit. The eight low-sulfur coal units were sampled in a 1992 survey of Kentucky utilities. Little between-unit variation is seen in the ash-basis major oxide and minor element chemistry. The carbon content of the fly ashes varies from 5 to 25 wt %. Similarly, the isotropic and anisotropic coke in the fly ash varies from 6% to 42% (volume basis). Much of the anisotropic coke is a thin-walled macroporous variety, but there is a portion that is a thick-walled variety similar to a petroleum coke.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 107-118","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9617%%500","10.1080/00908319608908751","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","212184","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/212184","","Energy Sources","1","18"
