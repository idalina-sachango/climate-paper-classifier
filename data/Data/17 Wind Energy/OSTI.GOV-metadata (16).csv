"Controlled power transfer from wind driven reluctance generator","Rahim, Y H.A.; Al-Sabbagh, A M.L.","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; PERFORMANCE; CONTROL EQUIPMENT; ENERGY TRANSFER","The paper describes the dynamic performance of a wind driven reluctance generator connected to an electric network of large capacity. A controller that makes possible the regular flow of power to the network has been considered. Controller parameters that successfully suppress unwanted mechanical and electrical stresses and overshoots due to wind gust, have been estimated. The performance of the controller has also been examined for short-circuit faults at the terminals of the generators.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 275-281","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9813%%51","10.1109/60.638861","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","603820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/603820","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","12"
"Annualized wind energy improvement using variable speeds","Zinger, D S; Muljadi, E","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; OPERATION; OPTIMIZATION; SPEED REGULATORS; VELOCITY; VARIATIONS; POWER GENERATION","To optimize the operation of a wind turbine, variable turbine speeds are desirable. To determine the advantages of a variable-speed turbine, the annualized energy production of the turbine needs to be considered. This is done by using a Rayleigh probability distribution to determine the number of hours of a particular wind speed which occur in a given year. This distribution is used with the aerodynamic power generated at a given average wind speed to determine the total energy generated during the year. The total energy for fixed- and variable-speed turbine control are compared. The variable-speed turbines show improved energy production over the constant-speed systems.","","","","","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 33; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1997 IEEE/IAS industrial and commercial power systems technical conference, May 12--14, Philadelphia, PA (US); PBD: Nov-Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1444-1447","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9812%%161","10.1109/28.649954","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","597020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/597020","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","6","33"
"Wind turbine cost of electricity and capacity factor","Cavallo, A J","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; DESIGN; COST; POWER GENERATION; CAPACITY; COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS","Wind turbines are currently designed to minimize the cost of electricity at the wind turbine (the busbar cost) in a given wind regime, ignoring constraints on the capacity factor (the ratio of the average power output to the maximum power output). The trade-off between these two quantities can be examined in a straightforward fashion; it is found that the capacity factor can be increased by a factor of 30 percent above its value at the cost minimum for a ten percent increase in the busbar cost of electricity. This has important implications for the large-scale integration of wind electricity on utility grids where the cost of transmission may be a significant fraction of the cost of delivered electricity, or where transmission line capacity may be limited.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 312-314","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9811%%81","10.1115/1.2888038","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","590140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/590140","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","119"

This and growing global environmental concerns have led governments to encourage and plan for wind energy development, a typical aim being 10% of electricity consumption. The successful operation of the three major power systems of Cape Verde, with a total wind energy penetration of about 15% since December 1994, demonstrates that power systems can be operated with high penetration of wind energy by adding simple control and monitoring systems only. Thorough analyses conclude that expanding to even above 155 wind energy penetration in the Cape Verde power systems is economical. Worldwide, numerous locations with favorable wind conditions and power systems similar to the Capeverdean provide good opportunities for installing wind farms and achieving high wind energy penetration.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 803-811","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9803%%153","10.1080/00908319708908892","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","562169","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/562169","","Energy Sources","8","19"

"Optimal planning of wind energy conversion systems over an energy scenario","Roy, S","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; PLANNING; ENERGY ANALYSIS; SIZE; POWER GENERATION; OPTIMIZATION","This paper introduces an optimization model that may be used for planning wind turbine installations over a global energy scenario. The model follows from the observation that, in most practical cases, installations may have to be made under space constraints, and that this may limit the overall energy output per unit land area. In such cases, it may be wise to install wind turbines of large ratings, in an attempt to extract large amounts of energy from each installed turbine. This would evidently lead to better utilization of the installed units. An illustrative case-study, involving eight possible sites for wind-turbine installations, is included to highlight the various features of the model.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented IEEE/PES Summer Meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 248-254","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9744%%220","10.1109/60.629710","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","533097","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/533097","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","12"
"Desirable airfoil characteristics for large variable-speed horizontal axis wind turbines","Giguere, P; Selig, M S","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; AIRFOILS; P CODES; ROUGHNESS; COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN","In an effort to define the desirable airfoil characteristics for large variable-speed wind turbines, a systematic study was performed using a series of airfoils designed to have similar aerodynamic properties, except for the amount of lift, which varied over a wide range. For several airfoil combinations, blade shapes were designed for a 750-kW wind turbine with a 48.8-m diameter rotor using the optimization code PROPGA together with PROPID, which is an inverse design method for horizontal-axis wind turbines. Roughness effects, including the consideration of dirty-blade performance in the blade-shape optimization process, were also considered and are discussed. The results and conclusions reveal practical design implications that should aid in the aerodynamic blade design of not only large but also other sizes of variable-speed wind turbines.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 253-260","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9804%%36","10.1115/1.2888028","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","563902","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563902","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","119"
"The effects of static and dynamic imbalance on a horizontal axis wind turbine","Borg, J P; Kirchhoff, R H","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; DYNAMICS; TORQUE; ORIENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; ANGULAR MOMENTUM","In this note the differences between static and dynamic balancing of a wind turbine rotor are addressed. The paper begins with a definition of each type of balancing. It is demonstrated that even if a horizontal axis wind turbine rotor is in static balance, the rotor can still be dynamically imbalanced. Dynamic imbalance can result in a yaw and/or teeter producing torque. A turbine rotor is only in a state of dynamic balance when the principle axes of inertia are aligned with the angular velocity vector. This criteria is illustrated with a point mass model.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 261-262","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9804%%37","10.1115/1.2888029","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","563903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563903","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","119"

This work is sponsored by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with the intent of making it straightforward and practical for wind turbine designers to determine those aspects of their design and wind environment that will cause the most fatigue damage. Several parameters suspected of affecting turbine fatigue life are investigated through a model of the NREL Phase III Combined Experiment Rotor. This study proved the Dyn2LIFE code useful in creating LIFE2 input from YawDyn and ADAMS output, and also revealed some areas of possible expansion and improvement. Results from this study of a steel blade root suggest changes affecting the normal operation of the turbine alter fatigue life more than rare, high load events. Understanding how the material fatigue characteristics affect lifetime estimates is discussed in terms of the S-N curve utilized in this study. This paper presents the first results from an ongoing project. In the future, the authors plan to analyze a variety of turbine configurations to help identify those variables which may have the greatest influence on fatigue life.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 242-247","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9746%%44","10.1115/1.2888026","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","538119","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538119","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","119"
"Influence of pitch, twist, and taper on a blade`s performance loss due to roughness","Tangler, J L","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; PERFORMANCE TESTING; ORIENTATION; SURFACE CONTAMINATION; P CODES","The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of blade geometric parameters such as pitch, twist, and taper on a blade`s sensitivity to leading edge roughness. The approach began with an evaluation of available test data of performance degradation due to roughness effects for several rotors. In addition to airfoil geometry, this evaluation suggested that a rotor`s sensitivity to roughness was also influenced by the blade geometric parameters. Parametric studies were conducted using the PROP93 computer code with wind tunnel airfoil characteristics for smooth and rough surface conditions to quantify the performance loss due to roughness for tapered and twisted blades relative to a constant-chord nontwisted blade at several blade pitch angles. The results indicate that a constant-chord nontwisted blade pitched toward stall will have the greatest losses due to roughness. The use of twist, taper, and positive blade-pitch angles all help reduce the angle-of-attack distribution along the blade for a given wind speed and the associated performance degradation due to roughness.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 248-252","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9746%%45","10.1115/1.2888027","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","538120","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538120","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","119"

"Europe takes wind energy lead","Gipe, P","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND POWER INDUSTRY; EUROPE; INSTALLATION; POWER GENERATION","California, once the undisputed leader in windpower capacity, has finally slipped from its top spot. America`s longtime lead in wind energy development is expected to fall to Europe by mid-1997. Germany`s installed windpower capacity has now surpassed California`s. According to data compiled by the Deutches Windenergie Institut in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, total installed wind-generating capacity reached 1,546 MW in Germany at the end of 1996. Despite the slowdown in German development in 1996, an astonishing 428 MW were installed. For comparison, 400 MW were installed during peak California windpower development in 1985. German companies installed nearly 500 MW of windpower capacity in 1995. Analysts estimate there are 1,497 MW operating in California, nearly 50 MW less than what is now installed in Germany. The German market alone represents $500,000 in turbine sales. Revenues from electricity sales approached $250 million last year. Installed windpower capacity in Germany at the start of 1997 was only 50 MW shy of total installed capacity in the entire United States, a nation with 22 times the land area and four times the population as Germany. At the present growth rate, Germany was expected to surpass the United States during the first quarter of 1997. By the end of the year, installed capacity in Germany will approach 2,000 MW, exceeding North America`s 1,614 MW.","","","","","","United States","1997-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 47-50","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 98:000556-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","577457","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/577457","","Independent Energy","5","27"

The cornerstone of this technique is a simple model for the blade`s root flap bending moment. The model requires as input a simple set of wind measurements that may be obtained as part of a routine site characterization study. By using the model to simulate a time series of the root flap bending moment, fatigue damage rates may be estimated at the potential wind energy sites. The model is evaluated by comparing these estimates with damage estimates derived from actual bending moment data; the agreement between the two is good, Data from two different turbine types were used for the evaluation. For each type the model was tested at only one site because data from other sites were not available. To more firmly establish the universality of the model, further evaluation is necessary using the model applied to the same turbine located at different sites.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 174-186","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9738%%18","10.1115/1.2887900","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","516709","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/516709","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","2","119"
"Unit sizing and control of hybrid wind-solar power systems","Chedid, R; Rahman, S","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; WIND POWER PLANTS; SOLAR THERMAL POWER PLANTS; HYBRID SYSTEMS; COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN; CONTROL EQUIPMENT; ELECTRIC BATTERIES; COST","The aim of this paper is to provide the core of a CAD/CAA tool that can help designers determine the optimal design of a hybrid wind-solar power system for either autonomous or grid-linked applications. The proposed analysis employs linear programming techniques to minimize the average production cost of electricity while meeting the load requirements in a reliable manner, and takes environmental factors into consideration both in the design and operation phases. While in autonomous systems, the environmental credit gained as compared to diesel alternatives can be obtained through direct optimization, in grid-linked systems emission is another variable to be minimized such that the use of renewable energy can be justified. A controller that monitors the operation of the autonomous/grid-linked systems is designed.

The model variables are expressed in the d-q rotor reference frame. The wind turbine was considered as the only source of power in this study. Using this model the system response to a recorded wind gust is investigated by calculating the generator current, the rectifier current, the load current, the battery charging current, and the battery voltage. The calculated results are then verified by comparing them with the actual values obtained from the data acquisition system.

"Performance predictions of VAWTs with NLF airfoil blades","Masson, C; Leclerc, C; Paraschivoiu, I","17 WIND ENERGY; VERTICAL AXIS TURBINES; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; EFFICIENCY; LAMINAR FLOW","The successful design of an efficient Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) can be obtained only when appropriate airfoil sections have been selected. Most VAWTs currently operating worldwide use blades of symmetrical NACA airfoil series. As these blades were designed for aviation applications, Sandia National Laboratories developed a family of airfoils specifically designed for VAWTs in order to decrease the Cost of Energy (COE) of the VAWT (Berg, 1990). Objectives formulated for the blade profile were: modest values of maximum lift coefficient, low drag at low angle of attack, high drag at high angle of attack, sharp stall, and low thickness-to-chord ratio. These features are similar to those of Natural Laminar Flow airfoils (NLF) and gave birth to the SNLA airfoil series. This technical brief illustrates the benefits and losses resulting from using NLF airfoils on VAWT blades. To achieve this goal, the streamtube model of Paraschivoiu (1988) is used to predict the performance of VAWTs equipped with blades of various airfoil shapes. The airfoil shapes considered are the conventional airfoils NACA 0018 and NACA 0021, and the SNLA 0018/50 airfoil designed at Sandia. Furthermore, the potential benefit of reducing the airfoil drag is clearly illustrated by the presentation of the individual contributions of lift and drag to power.","","","","Federal Panel on Energy Research and Development, Ottawa, ON (Canada)","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 97-99","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9728%%128","10.1115/1.2871873","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","488937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/488937","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","119"

In order to provide a net contribution to this issue a detailed wind park model has been developed and is briefly presented. However, the computational costs associated with the performance of such a detailed model in describing the behavior of a wind park composed by a considerable number of units may render its practical application very difficult. To overcome this problem singular perturbations theory has been applied to reduce the order of the detailed wind park model, and therefore create the conditions for the development of a dynamic equivalent which is able to retain the relevant dynamics with respect to the existing a.c. system. Validation results proving the ability of singular perturbations reduced order model to match the results provided by the detailed model are shown and commented.","","","","North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Brussels (Belgium)","","United States","1996-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 735-741","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9711%%268","10.1109/60.556372","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","438804","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438804","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","11"

In this paper, a sequential Monte Carlo simulation technique is proposed for adequacy evaluation of a generating system including WECS. The method is based on an hourly random simulation to mimic the operation of a generating system, taking into account the auto-correlation and fluctuating characteristics of wind speeds, the random failure of generating units, and other recognized dependencies. The hourly wind speeds are simulated utilizing auto-regressive and moving average time series models that are established based on the F-criterion.

The key to their success is simplicity (direct coupling, no dc-ac conversion, no storage batteries, etc.). Because of the relatively high cost of the PV array, the system designer is interested in maximizing its utilization efficiency. A PV powered dc motor can also be used to drive a three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG). This arrangement is useful as part of an integrated renewable energy system (IRES), which takes advantage of the inherent diversity of wind and solar energy in most developing countries to improve power quality. The SEIG is driven by a wind-turbine, dc motor, or both. Another advantage of this arrangement is its versatile control characteristics through the dc motor control.

Direct mechanically coupled wind turbines are the most common method for pumping water to croplands and livestock. Many more recent wind turbines are electrically coupled, with the water pump connected to the wind turbine via a motor-generator connection. With electrical coupling, the distance and location of the water pump is independent of the location of the wind turbine. Therefore, the wind turbine can be located at an optimal wind energy site while the water pump is close to the water well or water tank.

"Using a collision model to design safer wind turbine rotors for birds","Tucker, V A","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; ROTORS; BIRDS; MORTALITY","A mathematical model for collisions between birds and propeller-type turbine rotors identifies the variables that can be manipulated to reduce the probability that birds will collide with the rotor. This study defines a safety index--the clearance power density--that allows rotors of different sizes and designs to be compared in terms of the amount of wind energy converted to electrical energy per bird collision. The collision model accounts for variations in wind speed during the year and shows that for model rotors with simple, one-dimensional blades, the safety index increases in proportion to rotor diameter, and variable speed rotors have higher safety indexes than constant speed rotors. The safety index can also be increased by enlarging the region near the center of the rotor hub where the blades move slowly enough for birds to avoid them. Painting the blades to make them more visible might have this effect. Model rotors with practical designs can have safety indexes an order of magnitude higher than those for model rotors typical of the constant speeds rotors in common use today. This finding suggests that redesigned rotors could have collision rates with birds perhaps an order of magnitude lower than today`s rotors, with no reduction in the production of wind power. The empirical data that exist for collisions between raptors, such as hawks and eagles, and rotors are consistent with the model: the numbers of raptor carcasses found beneath large variable speed rotors, relative to the numbers found under small constant speed rotors, are in the proportions predicted by the collision model rather than in proportion to the areas swept by the rotor blades. However, uncontrolled variables associated with these data prevent a stronger claim of support for the model.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 263-269","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: 97:004462","10.1115/1.2871791","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","438772","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438772","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"

"Frequency domain analysis of the fatigue loads on typical wind turbine blades","Sutherland, H J","17 WIND ENERGY; VERTICAL AXIS TURBINES; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; FATIGUE; L CODES; FOURIER ANALYSIS","The fatigue analysis of a wind turbine blade typically depends on converting time-series data to a series of load cycles using one of several cyclic counting algorithms. However, many structural analysis techniques yield frequency-domain stress spectra, and a large body of experimental loads (stress) data is reported in the frequency domain. To permit the fatigue analysis of this class of data, a series of computational algorithms based on Fourier analysis techniques has been developed. The principle underlying these algorithms is the use of an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to transform the frequency spectrum to an equivalent time series suitable for cycle counting. In addition to analyzing the fatigue loads along the primary blade axes, this analysis technique also permits the examination of off-axis bending loads. These algorithms, which have been incorporated in the LIFE2 fatigue analysis code for wind turbines, are illustrated and evaluated with data from typical wind turbine blades.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 204-211","","","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%227","10.1115/1.2871779","","2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","438763","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438763","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"
"The effects of controls on fatigue loads in two-bladed teetered rotor wind turbines","Wu, K C; Guardia, R De La","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; FATIGUE; DYNAMIC LOADS; CONTROL; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS; FUZZY LOGIC; E CODES; ELECTRIC CONTROLLERS","This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the fatigue loads in a down wind, yaw-controlled, fixed pitch, two-bladed teetered-rotor wind turbine using proportional-integral, full-state optimal, and fuzzy logic controllers. Time-domain simulation data is generated using the EASY5x/WT software developed at the University of Texas at El Paso. The simulation data reveal that the choice of controller type, or the controller dynamics, can play a very important role in the fatigue life of a wind turbine and should be considered early in the design process of the wind turbine. In summary, the fuzzy logic controller is the most robust controller under a wide regime of wind conditions. It provides the best overall performance in terms of power regulation capability and minimum fatigue loads. The optimal controller with a full-state Kalman filter observer provides a satisfactory performance in terms of power regulation capability and loads when the operating condition is close to the design point at which the controller was optimized. It fails to regulate the power output when the actual operating point deviated too far, about 30 percent in the computer simulations, from the designed operating point. The PI controller provided satisfactory performance in power regulation. However, it produced the worst fatigue loads to the wind turbine among the three controllers.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 228-234","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%231","10.1115/1.2871783","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","438767","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438767","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"
"Effects of blade bending on aerodynamic control of fluctuating loads on teetered HAWT rotors","Eggers, Jr, A J; Ashley, H; Rock, S M; Chaney, K; Digumarthi, R","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL; LOAD ANALYSIS; WIND POWER PLANTS; FATIGUE; WIND LOADS; STRESSES","Active aerodynamic control, in the form of closed-loop actuation of blade-tip ailerons or all-movable blades, is investigated as a means of increasing the structural fatigue life of HAWT rotors. The rotor considered is upwind and teetered, with two blades of diameter 29.2 m., fiberglass construction and other properties representative of modern light-weight construction. The paper begins with a review of prior work which studied the problem for an essentially rigid structure. For that and the present research, two loading conditions were invoked: exposure to a Rayleigh distribution of operating winds with vertical shear and a 15 percent superimposed spectrum of turbulence; and occasional exposure to 62 m/s hurricanes. Accounted for herein is the effect of flatwise bending flexibility on the loads spectra of root flatwise bending moment, thrust, and torque (both open loop and closed loop). Using Miner`s rule, the moments are converted to fatigue lives. With aerodynamic control, RMS flatwise moments for the flexible blade in turbulence are found to be less than {1/2} of those without control. At a fixed blade weight of 540 kg when hurricane loads are added, the aileron-controlled blade is designed by that limit-load condition. In contrast, the all-movable blade can be feather controlled in the high wind so that its life is dominated by turbulent loads. Simplified fatigue analysis permits weight reductions to be estimated which yield controlled blades capable of 30 years` operation with a safety factor of 11. The resulting weights are about 400 kg for the aileron-controlled blade, and 230 kg for the all-movable blade. However, such light-weight rotors require attention to other design considerations, such as start-stop cycles. Apart from limit loads, the methods of analysis are linearized (locally for aerodynamic loads). It follows that the results are likely to be meaningful in terms of comparative, rather than absolute, values of fatigue life and weight.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 239-245","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%233","10.1115/1.2871785","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","438769","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438769","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"
"A mathematical model of bird collisions with wind turbine rotors","Tucker, V A","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; ROTORS; BIRDS; MORTALITY","When a bird flies through the disk swept out by the blades of a wind turbine rotor, the probability of collision depends on the motions and dimensions of the bird and the blades. The collision model in this paper predicts the probability for birds that glide upwind, downwind, an across the wind past simple one-dimensional blades represented by straight lines, and upwind and downwind past more realistic three-dimensional blades with chord and twist. Probabilities vary over the surface of the disk, and in most cases, the tip of the blade is less likely to collide with a bird than parts of the blade nearer the hub. The mean probability may be found by integration over the disk area. The collision model identifies the rotor characteristics that could be altered to make turbines safer for birds.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 253-262","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: 97:004461","10.1115/1.2871788","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","438771","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438771","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"

"Wind tunnel test of the S814 thick root airfoil","Somers, D M; Tangler, J L","17 WIND ENERGY; AIRFOILS; WIND TURBINES; PERFORMANCE TESTING; WIND TUNNELS; COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN","The objective of this wind-tunnel test was to verify the predictions of the Eppler Airfoil Design and Analysis Code for a very thick airfoil having a high maximum lift coefficient designed to be largely insensitive to leading-edge roughness effects. The 24 percent thick S814 airfoil was designed with these characteristics to accommodate aerodynamic and structural considerations for the root region of a wind-turbine blade. In addition, the airfoil`s maximum lift-to-drag ratio was designed to occur at a high lift coefficient. To accomplish the objective, a two-dimensional wind tunnel test of the S814 thick root airfoil was conducted in January 1994 in the low-turbulence wind tunnel of the Delft University of Technology Low Speed Laboratory, The Netherlands. Data were obtained with transition free and transition fixed for Reynolds numbers of 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 {times} 10{sup 6}. For the design Reynolds number of 1.5 {times} 10{sup 6}, the maximum lift coefficient with transition free is 1.32, which satisfies the design specification. However, this value is significantly lower than the predicted maximum lift coefficient of almost 1.6. With transition fixed at the leading edge, the maximum lift coefficient is 1.22. The small difference in maximum lift coefficient between the transition-free and transition-fixed conditions demonstrates the airfoil`s minimal sensitivity to roughness effects. The S814 root airfoil was designed to complement existing NREL low maximum-lift-coefficient tip-region airfoils for rotor blades 10 to 15 meters in length.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 217-221","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%229","10.1115/1.2871781","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","438765","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438765","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"
"Fatigue reliability of wind turbine fleets: The effect of uncertainty on projected costs","Veers, P S","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINE ARRAYS; FATIGUE; RELIABILITY; COST ESTIMATION; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; REPAIR; F CODES","The cost of repairing or replacing failed components depends on the number and timing of failures. Although the total probability of individual component failure is sometimes interpreted as the percentage of components likely to fail, this perception is often far from correct. Different amounts of common versus independent uncertainty can cause different numbers of components to be at risk of failure. The FAROW tool for fatigue and reliability analysis of wind turbines makes it possible for the first time to conduct a detailed economic analysis of the effects of uncertainty on fleet costs. By dividing the uncertainty into common and independent parts, the percentage of components expected to fail in each year of operation is estimated. Costs are assigned to the failures and the yearly costs and present values are computed. If replacement cost is simply a constant multiple of the number of failures, the average, or expected cost is the same as would be calculated by multiplying by the probability of individual component failure. However, more complicated cost models require a breakdown of how many components are likely to fail. The breakdown enables the calculation of costs associated with various probability of occurrence levels, illustrating the variability in projected costs. Estimating how the numbers of components expected to fail evolves over time is also useful in calculating the present value of projected costs and in understanding the nature of the financial risk.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 222-227","","","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%230","10.1115/1.2871782","","2010-02-18T00:00:00Z","438766","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438766","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"
"Variable speed operation of generators with rotor-speed feedback in wind power applications","Muljadi, E; Butterfield, C P; Migliore, P","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; CONTROL THEORY; FEEDBACK; FLUCTUATIONS; WIND; VELOCITY","The use of induction generators in wind power applications has been common since the early development of the wind industry. Most of these generators operate at fixed frequency and are connected directly to the utility grid. Unfortunately, this mode of operation limits the rotor speed to a specific rpm. Variable speed operation is preferred in order to facilitate maximum energy capture over a wide range of wind speeds. This paper explores variable speed operating strategies for wind turbine applications. The objectives are to maximize energy production, provide controlled start-up, and reduce torque loading. This paper focuses on optimizing the energy captured by operating at maximum aerodynamic efficiency at any wind speed. The control strategy the authors analyze uses rotor speed and generator power as the feedback signals. In the normal operating region, rotor speed is used to compute a target power that corresponds to optimum operation. With power as the control objective, the power converter and generator are controlled to track the target power at any rpm. Thus, the torque-speed characteristic of the generator is shaped to optimize the energy capture. The target power is continuously updated at any rpm. In extreme areas of the operating envelope, during start-up, shutdown, generator overload, or overspeed, different strategies driven by other system considerations must be used.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 270-277","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9711%%237","10.1115/1.2871793","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","438773","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/438773","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","118"

The spatial coverage of stations with radiation data was found to be unsatisfactory for the purpose of a countrywide solar energy assessment exercise. Therefore, radiation had to be predicted from sunshine hours by employing empirical models. Using data from seven stations in Ethiopia, linear and quadratic correlation relationships between monthly mean daily solar radiation and sunshine hours per day have been developed. These regional models show a distinct improvement over previously employed countrywide models. To produce a national solar-energy distribution profile, a spatial extension of the radiation/sunshine relationships had to be carried out. To do this, the intercepts(a) and slopes(b) of each of the seven linear regression equations and another six from previous studies, completed in neighbouring Sudan, Kenya and Yemen, were used to interpolate the corresponding values to areas between them. Subsequent to these procedures, 142 stations providing only sunshine data were assigned their `appropriate` a and b values to estimate the amount of solar radiation received, which was then used to produce annual and monthly solar radiation distribution maps for Ethiopia. The results show that in all regions solar energy is an abundant resource. 19 refs., 11 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 205-217","","","","Journal ID: SRENA4; ISSN 0038-092X; TRN: 97:004299-042","10.1016/S0038-092X(96)00094-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","501993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/501993","","Solar Energy","3","57"

The present semi-empirical downscaling method consists of two elements. Since general circulation models (GCMs) are able o reproduce the features of the present atmospheric general circulation quite correctly, the first element represents the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. The second element is a link between local wind speed and large-scale circulation pattern (CP). The linkage is expressed by a stochastic model conditioned on CP types. Parameters of the linkage model are estimated using observed data series; then this model is utilized with GCM-generated CP type data corresponding to a 2 x CO{sub 2} scenario. Under the climate of Nebraska the lognormal distribution is the best two-parameter distribution to describe daily mean wind speed. The space-time variability of wind speed is described by a transformed multivariate autoregressive (AR) process, and the linkage between local wind and large-scale circulation is expressed as a conditional AR process, i.e. the autoregressive parameters depend on the actual daily CP type. The basic tendency of change under 2 x CO{sub 2} climate is a considerable increase of wind speed from the beginning of summer to the end of winter and a somewhat smaller wind decrease in spring. 18 refs., 6 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 239-248","","","","Journal ID: SRENA4; ISSN 0038-092X; CNN: Grant EAR-9205717/9217818; TRN: 97:004299-039","10.1016/S0038-092X(96)00076-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","501990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/501990","","Solar Energy","3","57"

The simulation program was further used to investigate the disconnection process of WT under various circumstances. It is shown that during the WT disconnection, a sudden increase in stator currents may appear. So voltage dips may distort the power quality of the grid. Self-excitation of WT, with large induced voltage, occurs when they operate at low-load even with relatively small capacitive compensation. The amount of energy, that the brake of WT absorbs during the disconnection, has been studied under various disconnection procedures. Suggestions are made for the proper moment of brake application, so that the energy absorbed is minimum.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 636-642","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9653%%290","10.1109/60.537036","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404688","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","11"

Auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions of the strain-gauge data have been shown to consist of decaying sinusoids which correspond to the modal frequencies and damping ratios of the wind turbine. The authors have verified the method by extracting damping values from an analytically generated data set. Actual operating response data from the DOE/Sandia 34-m Test Bed has been used to calculate modal damping ratios as a function of rotor rotation rate.

Since wind turbines are inherently modular, with medium-sized units typically in the range of a few hundred kilowatts each, they lend themselves well to distributed generation service. A patented wind power technology, the Toroidal Accelerator Rotor Platform (TARP) Windframe, forms the basis for a proposed network-distributed, wind power plant combining electric generation and transmission. While heavily building on proven wind turbine technology, this system is projected to surpass traditional configuration windmills through a unique distribution/transmission combination, superior performance, user-friendly operation and maintenance, and high availability and reliability. Furthermore, its environmental benefits include little new land requirements, relatively attractive appearance, lower noise and EMI/TV interference, and reduced avian (bird) mortality potential. Its cost of energy is projected to be very competitive, in the range of from approximately 2{cents}/kWh to 5{cents}/kWh, depending on the wind resource.","","","","","","United States","1996-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1995 IEEE rural electric power conference, April 30--May 2, 1995, Nashville, TN (US); PBD: Jul-Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 778-787","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9641%%227","10.1109/28.511632","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","372150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/372150","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","4","32"

Several technical constraints are applied among them the most significant are the limitation of wind power penetration due to both the load demand and a minimum permissible power of the diesel generators. Startup-shutdown costs, two-fuel diesel units and reliability are considered. The proposed method divides the total simulation period into time intervals and for every time interval uses dynamic programming techniques to determine the diesel unit commitment. Results are presented for two Greek islands.

A hybrid approach is used that combines the advantages of a genetic algorithm with an inverse design method. This method is used to determine the optimum blade pitch and blade chord and twist distributions that maximize the annual energy production. To illustrate the method, a family of 25 wind turbines was designed to examine the sensitivity of annual energy product to changes in the rotor blade length and peak rotor power. Trends are revealed that should aid in the design of new rotors for existing turbines. In the second application, five wind turbines were designed to determine the benefits of specifically tailoring wind turbine blades for the average wind speed at a particular site. The results have important practical implications related to rotors designed for the Midwestern US versus those where the average wind speed may be greater.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 22-28","","","","Journal ID: JERTD2; ISSN 0195-0738; TRN: IM9615%%332","10.1115/1.2792688","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","205552","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/205552","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","1","118"

The key to their success is simplicity (direct coupling, no dc-ac inversion, no storage batteries, etc.). In this paper a PV powered dc motor is used to drive an isolated three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG). It is found that due to the unique torque-speed characteristics of the SEIG, utilization efficiency is close to maximum at all insolation levels with no peak-power tracking. The proposed arrangement is useful as part of an integrated renewable energy system (IRES), which takes advantage of the inherent diversity of wind and insolation in most developing countries to improve power quality. The SEIG is driven by wind turbine, dc motor, or both. Performance of the system under different insolation conditions is analyzed.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 155-161","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9628%%137","10.1109/60.486590","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","248037","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/248037","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","11"

The impact of different models on fatigue damage is shown. Common one-parameter probability models, such as the Rayleigh and exponential, are found to give significantly different estimates of load distributions and damage. Greatest differences occur in materials with relatively high values of the S-N exponent b, such as composites. In such cases more accurate damage estimates are found by matching at least two moments of the load data (Weibull model), or still higher moments as well. For this purpose, a new, four-moment generalized Weibull model is introduced. For edgewise loads is appears a notable improvement over the basic Weibull model, while it supports the Weibull model in the flapwise case. Uncertainty in damage estimates is also quantified, along with the implied data needs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 64-68","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9623%%129","10.1115/1.2847953","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","230819","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/230819","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","118"
"A rule-based fuzzy logic controller for a PWM inverter in a stand alone wind energy conversion scheme","Hilloowala, R M; Sharaf, A M","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; PERFORMANCE; INVERTERS; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS; FUZZY LOGIC","The paper presents a rule-based fuzzy logic controller to control the output power of a pulse width modulated (PWM) inverter used in a stand alone wind energy conversion scheme (SAWECS). The self-excited induction generator used in SAWECS has the inherent problem of fluctuations in the magnitude and frequency of its terminal voltage with changes in wind velocity and load. To overcome this drawback the variable magnitude, variable frequency voltage at the generator terminals is rectified and the dc power is transferred to the load through a PWM inverter. The objective is to track and extract maximum power from the wind energy system (WES) and transfer this power to the local isolated load. This is achieved by using the fuzzy logic controller which regulates the modulation index of the PWM inverter based on the input signals: the power error e = (P{sub ref} {minus} P{sub o}) and its rate of change {dot e}. These input signals are fuzzified, that is defined by a set of linguistic labels characterized by their membership functions predefined for each class. Using a set of 49 rules which relate the fuzzified input signals (e, {dot e}) to the fuzzy controller output U, fuzzy set theory and associated fuzzy logic operations, the fuzzy controller`s output (in terms of linguistic labels) is defuzzified to obtain the actual analog (numerical) output signal which is then used to control the PWM inverter and ensure complete utilization of the available wind energy. The proposed rule-based fuzzy logic controller is simulated and the results are experimentally verified on a scaled down laboratory prototype of the SAWECS.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: DN: Presented at Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting, Toronto, Ontario (CA) October 3--8, 1993; PBD: Jan-Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 57-65","","","","Journal ID: ITIACR; ISSN 0093-9994; TRN: IM9625%%194","10.1109/28.485813","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","237869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/237869","","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","1","32"

Generally, maximum wind energy is recorded on the 300-hPa surface, and the intensities are greater by about 25%-30% in winter than in summer. The greatest continental wind energy resources are experienced over the southern tip of the southern African subcontinent, where it was established that the free atmospheric resources exceed those near the surface by at least an order of magnitude. The two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of the wind vector has been used to provide an indirect estimate of the wind energy resource. Good agreement between this measure and the direct estimate of wind energy was obtained, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the two-dimensional Gaussian distribution in estimating upper-air wind energy resources. 9 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Meteorology; Journal Volume: 34; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2565-2571","","","","Journal ID: JOAMEZ; ISSN 0894-8763; TRN: 96:003395-0012","10.1175/1520-0450(1995)034&lt;2565:WEREOT&gt;2.0.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","273964","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/273964","","Journal of Applied Meteorology","11","34"

The 450 MW of new installations in Europe last year rivaled the peak of California`s great wind rush when nearly 400 MW were installed in 1985. European manufacturers are building more than 12 MW of new wind turbines per week. The current burst of activity in the Netherlands will come to a halt at the end of 1996 when capital subsidies expire. New projects will then depend solely on a recently negotiated buyback rate and low-interest loans from tax-free investments.","","","","","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-72","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 95:008935-0013","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","183352","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/183352","","Independent Energy","9","25"

"Navier-Stokes computations of the NREL airfoil using a {kappa}-{omega} turbulent model at high angles of attack","Yang, S L; Chang, Y L; Arici, O","17 WIND ENERGY; AIRFOILS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; WIND TURBINES; FLOW MODELS; TURBULENT FLOW","This paper presents a two-dimensional numerical simulation of the turbulent flow fields for the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) S809 airfoil. The flow is modeled as steady, viscous, turbulent, and incompressible. The pseudo-compressible formulation is used for the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations so that a time marching scheme developed for the compressible flow can be applied directly. The turbulent flow is simulated using Wilcox`s modified {kappa}-{omega} model to account for the low Reynolds number effects near a solid wall and the model`s sensitivity to the freestream conditions. The governing equations are solved by an implicit approximate-factorization scheme. To correctly model the convection terms in the mean-flow and turbulence model equations, the symmetric TVD (Total Variational Diminishing) scheme is incorporated. The methodology developed is then applied to analyze the NREL S809 airfoil at various angles of attack ({alpha}) from 1 to 45 degrees. The accuracy of the numerical results is compared with the available Delft wind tunnel test data. For comparison, two Eppler code results at low angles of attack are also included. Depending on the value of {alpha}, preliminary results show excellent to fairly good agreement with the experimental data. Directions for future work are also discussed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 304-310","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9611%%75","10.1115/1.2847864","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","194234","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194234","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","117"

The maximum C{sub p} with a Mie type tip vane is found to be 15% larger than that without the Mie type tip vane. Power augmentation caused by the Mie type tip vane is mainly due to the reduction of tip vortex and the diffusing effect by the Mie type tip vane. The effects of a Mie type tip vane are quantitatively verified by the velocity distributions around the tip of the main blade. The velocity distribution was measured by three-dimensional hot wire probes, which measured the axial, radial, and tangential velocity components. The circulation distributions along the main blade with a Mie type tip vane and without a Mie type tip vane were obtained from the measured velocity distributions. A strong reduction of bound vorticity is found for the main blade tip without the Mie type tip vane, whereas the bound vorticity persists on the main blade tip with the Mie type tip vane.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 297-303","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9611%%74","10.1115/1.2847850","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","194233","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/194233","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","117"

"U.S. wind reserves accessible to transmission lines","Parsons, B; Wan, Y H","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND POWER; RESOURCE ASSESSMENT; ENERGY SOURCE DEVELOPMENT; OVERHEAD POWER TRANSMISSION; POWER TRANSMISSION LINES; AVAILABILITY","Recent advances in wind power technology, coupled with federal incentives for deployment established as part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, have resulted in a noticeable increase in discussions of and plans for wind power projects in many areas of the US. Good wind resources are widely distributed, but a common perception is that much of the land with good wind resources is unavailable for development because of environmental and land use restrictions. Furthermore, results of some earlier wind resource and transmission studies have contributed to the notions that the wind resources are located far from load centers and that existing transmission facilities and transmission requirements will make the development of such resources infeasible. The first issue has been addressed on a national level. As part of its ongoing work with wind resource assessment, the Wind Energy Resource Assessment team from Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL, now part of the Wind Energy Research Center at NREL) has produced estimates of the available wind resource, accounting for environmental and land use restrictions. This work builds on the PNL efforts and addresses the second issue by examining the amount of wind resource that is within a short distance of the existing transmission lines. The analysis was done with a geographic information system (GIS) program. Results indicate that a large amount of wind resource is near existing transmission facilities.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Power Engineering Review; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 5-6","","","","Journal ID: IPERDV; ISSN 0272-1724; TRN: IM9553%%97","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","137095","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/137095","","IEEE Power Engineering Review","9","15"

This annual average was approximately 1 mile per hour higher than any other area NSP had monitored. Since this location was close to NSP`s service territory and to NSP`s transmission system, they installed a wind research test facility on the system in 1986. The purpose of the test facility, which consisted of three 65 kW turbines, was to examine the performance of commercial wind turbines in the climate of the upper midwest. As a result of what was learned from the research facility and given the customers` increasing interest in emission-free energy resources like wind, NSP proceeded with plans to develop 100 MW of wind generation by 1998. The 25 MW project, which is owned and operated by KENETECH Windpower, Inc., was the first step in meeting that goal.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Power Engineering Review; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 6-7","","","","Journal ID: IPERDV; ISSN 0272-1724; TRN: IM9553%%98","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","137096","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/137096","","IEEE Power Engineering Review","9","15"
"Windpower`s future grows brighter","Flavin, C","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; WIND POWER; ECONOMICS; MARKET; COMPETITION; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; ENERGY SOURCE DEVELOPMENT","Modern technologies to generate electricity from windpower were introduced only 15 years ago. Today, equipment and control improvements have moved this benign process into a strong competitive position, both nationally and internationally. Altogether, the world had roughly 20,000 wind turbines in operation by the end of 1993, producing 3,000 megawatts of electricity. More than a dozen American and European companies, many with government assistance, are pursuing advanced wind technologies that are believed capable of closing the remaining cost gap with fossil fuel plants. According to one study, the average capacity factor of Californian wind turbines -- the percentage of their annual power potential generated -- rose from 13 in 1987 to 24 in 1990. These machines are now estimated to be ``available`` to operate 95 percent of the time, which is better than most fossil fuel plants. The machines now entering the market generate 300--750 kilowatts per turbine rather than the 100-kilowatt average of the late eighties` models. They have lighter and more aerodynamic blades made of synthetic materials, improved rotor-hub connections and drive trains, new blade controls, and more advanced power electronics, including some that operate at variable speeds, which allows the turbines to run more efficiently in a range of winds. The new designs are less expensive and can be deployed in more moderate wind regimes. In 1994, wind developers using the new technology signed contracts to sell wind-generated electricity for as low as 4--5{cents} per kilowatt-hour.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Strategic Planning for Energy and the Environment; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Sum 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 55-61","","","","Journal ID: SEENEJ; ISSN 1048-5236; TRN: 95:018772","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","94305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94305","","Strategic Planning for Energy and the Environment","1","15"

In these applications, an attractive candidate is the slip power recovery system comprising of doubly excited induction machine or doubly excited brushless reluctance machine and PWM converters with a dc link. In this paper, a flexible active and reactive power control strategy is developed, such that the optimal torque-speed profile of the turbine can be followed and overall reactive power can be controlled, while the machine copper losses have been minimized. At the same time, harmonics injected into the power network has also been minimized. In this manner, the system can function as both a high-efficient power generator and a flexible reactive power compensator.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 472-478","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9551%%196","10.1109/63.391945","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","131597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/131597","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","4","10"

Two parameters are defined by means of which the siting can be optimized, the site effectiveness (ratio output/available energy) and the cut-in speed. It is shown that the site effectiveness achieves a maximum for a value of the cut-in speed which depends on the rated speed and on the site. The cut-in speed of a WECS should be chosen according to the rated speed of the turbine and the cubic mean wind speed of the site. The wind data of two regions (Somalia and Calabria, Italy) with very different climates are examined and compared, showing correlation with the cubic mean wind speed.

The experimental site is the Samos Island Wind Park comprising nine wind turbines installed on the top of a 400 m-high saddle. The analysis is based on experimental data obtained mainly under strong wind conditions by two masts erected upstream and downstream of a wind turbine. The field of wind turbulence is examined both in integral and spectral form. Consideration of the perturbation produced by the tower construction is crucial in the interpretation of results. Observations show that the turbulent field varies from the edge to the center of the wake and strongly depends on the incident wind speed. Increased turbulent levels are observed near the blade tips, with evidence of a similar trend around the hub height for all wind speeds. Decreases of wind turbulence are observed in mid frequencies inside the wake due to the reduced shear associated with the flat crosswind velocity profile. This effect seems to dominate in the variation of the integral values of the longitudinal wind component variance. The low frequency portion of wind spectra reverses behavior in high wind speeds, i.e., an increase in energy relative to background values is observed. This is probably due to the shape of the turbine characteristic power curve. Cross-wind profiles of turbulent shear stresses at the lower boundary of the wake are also discussed. 15 refs., 15 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 55; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 61-72","","","","Journal ID: SRENA4; ISSN 0038-092X; TRN: 96:002227-023","10.1016/0038-092X(95)00024-L","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","219642","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/219642","","Solar Energy","1","55"

Results from a field experiment, comprising in-situ and remote sensing techniques (high-resolution acoustic sounders), concerning the upwind area and the near-wake region behind a single medium-sized wind turbine are presented. The experimental site is the Samos Island Wind Park installed on top of a 390 m-high saddle. Because of the topography, wind speed acceleration and channeling effects are expected; thus, the commonly used logarithmic profile is not valid, and the choice of a representative surface roughness length z{sub o} is difficult. Interesting features of the profiles of the standard deviation of the ambient wind speed are also presented. The obtained results reveal a nonlinear interaction of the near wake with the turbine-tower shadowing, while cross-wind wake profiles indicate a potential core structure. The effect of ambient turbulence is apparent, especially at lower wind speeds, even at a distance of one rotor diameter (1 D) behind the turbine. The wake centerline at distances greater than 1 D is often observed at heights greater than the hub-height and attributed to the wind flow characteristics over the Wind Park. Finally, evidence of rotational motion inside the wake is identified. 40 refs., 18 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 413-428","","","","Journal ID: SRENA4; ISSN 0038-092X; TRN: 96:002227-015","10.1016/0038-092X(95)00009-G","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","219634","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/219634","","Solar Energy","6","54"

The purpose of the present study is to develop a model capable of predicting the aerodynamic loads on the Darrieus rotor in a turbulent wind. This model is based on the double-multiple streamtube method (DMS) and incorporates a stochastic wind model. The method used to simulate turbulent velocity fluctuations is based on the power spectral density. The problem consists in generating a region of turbulent flow with a relevant spectrum and spatial correlation. The first aerodynamic code developed is based on a one-dimensional turbulent wind model. However, since this model ignores the structure of the turbulence in the crossflow plane, an extension to three dimensions has been made. The computer code developed, CARDAAS, has been used to predict aerodynamic loads for the Sandia-17m rotor and compared to CARDAAV results and experimental data. Results have shown that the computed aerodynamic loads have been improved by including stochastic wind into the aerodynamic model.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 128-136","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9531%%315","10.1115/1.2870839","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","78264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/78264","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","2","117"

For the case of long distance transmission of wind electricity, this change can be achieved at a negligible increase or even a decrease in the per unit cost of electricity. The economic and technical feasibility of this process can be illustrated by studying the example of a wind farm located in central Kansas and a 2,000 km, 2,000 megawatt transmission line to southern California. Such a system can have a capacity factor of 60%, with no economic penalty and without storage. With compressed air energy storage (CAES) (and with a negligible economic penalty), capacity factors of 70--95% can be achieved.

The induction generators have applications in wind power systems. Generators connected to the infinite bus are not sources for voltage harmonics. Autonomous generators are variable frequency variable voltage systems and their steady state voltage is distorted in transient state the transient frequencies are superposed on the steady state waveform, increasing the harmonic distortion. In this paper the transient model of induction generator is extended and adapted for the prediction of the higher order transient harmonics in the generated voltage. Then, using experimental equipment a new numerical technique for their identification is implemented. A data acquisition system records, the generated stator voltage during transients from various types of disturbances and the spectral analysis identifies the transient frequencies produced the steady state fundamental and by its fractional and subfractional order harmonics. The identification of harmonics validates the predicted values by the analytical method.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers/Power Engineering Society (IEEE/PES) summer meeting, San Francisco, CA (United States), 24-28 Jul 1994; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 118-125","","CONF-940702-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9520%%485","10.1109/60.372576","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","40290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40290","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","10"

Such actions can dramatically improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people living in remote villages in the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The environmentally benign nature of renewable resource utilization and the potability of exploiting locally available resources with the consequent growth of job opportunities are some of the many benefits that can accrue by the deployment of IRES. Even small amounts of energy can be very beneficial in remote rural areas of developing countries with no grid connection as compared to the massive urban sprawls in both developed and developing countries. A concerted global effort in this direction can build the much-needed market potential for renewables now, resulting in future cost reductions.

This problem has been solved by several authors using finite differences or standard finite element techniques. In this paper, this problem is solved by two different adaptive finite element methods. The first makes use of standard finite element techniques, using linear interpolation of a potential function. In the second, a direct computation of the velocity field is undertaken by means of a mixed finite element method. Several error indicators are proposed for both formulations together with an adaptive strategy. We have applied both methods to several typical test problems, as well as to realistic data corresponding to the Island of Fuerteventura, with satisfactory results from a numerical point of view. 13 refs., 16 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1995-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 54; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 49-56","","","","Journal ID: SRENA4; ISSN 0038-092X; TRN: 96:002226-023","10.1016/0038-092X(94)00100-R","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","219663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/219663","","Solar Energy","1","54"

In addition to the coupling of PV and wind energy plants to existing grids, stand-alone systems are described. The latter offer early potential for market introduction of renewable energies at a premium price, since remote supply of electricity is currently linked with higher cost. In order to reduce the cost and to improve availability, the scalability to any nominal power and the suitability to central and decentral applications is discussed on the system level. The basic variants of converter technology in conjunction with current concentration are explained and assessed in regard to PV application. For wind energy conversion, the interaction between mechano-electrical transformation, grid connection, and control concept are analysed. Grid- and consumer-specific measures for power conditioning are displayed and analyzed with regard to voltage variation and harmonics. Concepts that are successfully used in practice are presented, main causes of disturbances of operating plants are listed, and new trends are outlined. For stand-alone systems, a combination of synchronous machines and battery-coupled inverter is suitable for grid formation. With advanced control methods, the standard permissable tolerances of voltage, frequency and harmonics can be achieved. Modular unit-kit construction allows high reliability and simple installation, operation and low maintenance, and the expansion of the supply system according to increasing needs. 35 refs., 61 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advances in Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 9; Other Information: PBD: 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 161-243","","","","Journal ID: ASOED9; ISSN 0731-8618; TRN: 96:002796-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","245116","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245116","","Advances in Solar Energy","","9"

To most observers, Rattlesnake Ridge is hardly a landmark worth capturing on film, or even acknowledging in one`s nature journal. Set in the brush and wheat fields of eastern Washington State, the dry, rocky ridge has none of the lush forests and swift streams that are hallmarks of the glorious landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Nevertheless, when well-heeled developers from that much-despised state o the south, California, put forth a proposal for a project at the ridge, local citizens organized in its defense. Headed by Clifford Groof, a city councilman from the town of Kennewick, they formed Save Our Rattlesnake Environment (SORE). SORE enlisted help from the Sierra Club and state wildlife officials to kill the proposal. This article points out that the conflict was not just for wildlife, but instead a conflic between nuclear power, a positive force in the same general area who used wildlife as a lever to reject the plant, and wind power.The history of both wind power and this particular situation are described in the article.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Amicus Journal; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Fal 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 30-35","","","","Journal ID: AMJOE7; ISSN 0276-7201; TRN: 96:001988-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","272764","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/272764","","Amicus Journal","3","16"

Spatial discretization is achieved by the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin finite element method on a hybrid mesh composed of a structured region of quadrilateral elements in the vicinity of solid boundaries, an unstructured region of triangular elements elsewhere, and a layer of infinite elements surrounding the domain and projecting the external boundary to infinity. Temporal discretization is achieved by an implicit second order finite difference scheme. At each time step, a nonlinear algebraic system is solved by a Newton method. To accelerate computations, the generalized minimum residual method with an incomplete triangular factorization preconditioning is used to solve the linearized Newton systems. The solver is applied to simulate the flow around a NACA 0015 airfoil in Darrieus motion and the results are compared to experimental observations. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that the simulation of such a motion has been performed using the Navier-Stokes equations.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 870-876","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0098-2202; CODEN: JFEGA4","10.1115/1.2911863","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6803233","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6803233","","Journal of Fluids Engineering; (United States)","","116:4"

It involves a combined time series and statistical approach to estimate the fuel use of diesel generators. In addition to provision for modeling non-identical diesels, the model allows the inclusion of multiple, non-identical wind turbines whose output may or may not be correlated. Three diesel dispatching strategies are provided. One assumes no storage, and when storage is employed, either a peak shaving or cycle charge control option can be used. The storage module uses a flexible battery model specially designed for time series simulation codes. A key assumption for the main analytical model is that, within each time step, the load and wind power are assumed to be normally distributed. The mean net load is the mean load less the mean wind power and its variance is found from the variance of the load and the wind power. A loss of load probability is used to find the maximum and minimum anticipated values of the net load. In addition to summarizing the overall analytical model, this article presents the results of a number of simulations demonstrating the performance prediction (diesel fuel usage) capabilities of the model. For one of these cases (a no storage system), the results show excellent correlation between the model and actual data. Other cases summarized show that the use of the model greatly facilitates the integration of storage into the control scheme, and gives the fuel saving potential for several different wind/diesel system configurations.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States); Journal Volume: 53:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 481-490","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA4; CNN: XK-7-07106-1; XL-1-11126-1","10.1016/0038-092X(94)90127-N","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7045848","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7045848","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States)","","53:6"

Normally, this could result in high mechanical stresses, generator instability, and voltage and frequency fluctuations on the utility network. Generating electric energy from wind has some unique features not shared by steam, hydro, or other electric energy conversion systems. These are the variability of resources, the dispersed character of generating units, and the low mechanical stiffness of the turbine generator that results from the use of a gearbox interface. These features characterize the electromechanical stress environment to which both the mechanical design allowance and quality of power are subjected. Models for dynamic interaction of wind turbine generators (WTGs) on electric utility networks have been suggested, but only a few publications have addressed the aggregation of hundreds of turbine generators. This topic has a significant impact on studies related to power system dynamics, because it helps reduce system complexity and computation cost. This article features a study that set out to: Simulate the electromechanical dynamics of a typical grid-connected wind turbine generator. Test an aggregation technique for representing a group of WTGs by a single unit.

The control objective is to track and extract maximum power from the wind energy system (WES) and transfer this power to the utility. This is achieved by controlling the firing delay angle of the inverter. Since the diode bridge rectifier has no control on the dc link voltage, a supplementary control loop is used to limit the voltage within a preset voltage threshold. The proposed scheme for regulating the flow of power through the dc link ensures reduced reactive power burden on the self-excitation capacitor banks and better utilization of available wind energy, while limiting the dc link voltage within a preset voltage threshold. The simulated results are experimentally verified and found to give good power tracking performance.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 9:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 558-563","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE4","10.1109/60.326477","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6896290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6896290","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","9:3"

These data were used to calculate the probability density functions of the wind speed and the irradiance for each hour of a typical day in a month. The wind speed and irradiance probability density functions and manufacturer's specification on a wind turbine and a PV module were used to calculate the average power generated by the wind turbine and the PV module for each hour of a typical day in a month. The least square method is used to determine the best fit of the PV array and wind turbine to a given load.

It is theoretically possible to increase the energy capture of the 56--100 by adjusting the blade angle to the optimum pitch angle on a continuing basis at below rated speeds. This concept was field tested on the 56--100, but it was found that the optimum pitch control logic opens a pathway for the 56--100 to fall into stall operation when the winds are above the rated wind speed. The 56--100 then operates as a stall-regulated wind turbine with an overall reduction of energy capture and an increase in system loads.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 153-157","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEEDO","10.1115/1.2930075","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6994950","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6994950","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States)","","116:3"

The energy sources considered are batteries, fuel cells, windmills and photovoltaic arrays. In most cases, the electrical energy produced is direct current, dc, which must be converted to alternating current, ac, for connection to the electric utility network. The interface between the dc source and the utility ac is often a static power converter (SPC). The purpose of the publication is to illustrate those SPC characteristics that can obviate the need for the interface relay protection package normally required by a utility. A qualifying SPC can detect utility system disturbances or other conditions that would require generator separation in addition to its normal function of protection and control of the DSG.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 9:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1325-1331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8977; CODEN: ITPDE5","10.1109/61.311159","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","6963223","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6963223","","IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","9:3"

In view of the fact that the reactive power is drawn from the grid while the active power is fed into the grid, the extent of variations in power fed to the grid and the reactive VAR due to unbalanced grid voltages for different wind power conditions need to be estimated to provide guidelines in the design and operation of wind energy conversion system.

The purpose of this study if to present the main design parameters and economic estimates of a wind-assisted RO system using a diesel engine as the baseline energy source and an electric wind turbine for the wind energy source. It is found that brackish water pumping and desalinating using WECs costs 0.67 to 1.16 JD/m[sup 3] (JD = Jordanian Dinar, 1US$ = 0.68 JD), which is less than using conventional diesel engines especially in remote areas.

The Netherlands topped 100 MW capacity at the beginning of this year. Most of this capacity consists of utility-run wind power plants, and a lesser number of small turbines, mainly operated by farmers. An ambitious government program pushes for 1,000 MW installed capacity by the year 2000. By then, 30 to 40 windpower plants, with more than 700 wind turbines, will crank out electricity along the coastal areas and dikes. With limited land space and dense population, planners see maximum room for 1,000 MW, of large turbines, to conserve space. For this reason, the market does not favor a wide range of turbine sizes. Currently, the 10 largest wind power plants in the Netherlands turn out 71.5 MW. The largest wind farm, in Noordoostpolder, southwest of Groningen, whips out 15 MW. To bolster wind power development, government subsidies shorten paybacks. Any many Dutch utilities apparently pay a good rate for wind-generated electricity. The rates are said to be better than those in the United States. Under the government plan, utilities will stimulate further development of technology to improve quality, lower costs, and introduce larger turbines. As this progresses, the government subsidy is expected to decrease. The second oil crisis of the late 1970s fanned Holland's wind energy surge. Since then, wind-electricity costs have fallen by half. The current government push is driven by the desire to reduce dependence on gas and oil, and reduce CO[sub 2] and coal emissions by increasing clean energy sources.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 99","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7247811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7247811","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:4"

Europe is projected to cement its leading role in new wind energy development, assuming Denmark's 1993 wind power generation exceeds that in California's Altamont Pass. This will force the Altamont Pass, the former world's leader, into third place. Equally as striking, upstart Germany may now rival production in Palm Springs, leaving the Tehachapi pass as the only American resource area not challenged by a European rival. By the end of 1993 worldwide wind generation exceeded 5 TWh for the first time, most of that from California and Western Europe. Development activity was concentrated in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom with a total of 200 MW in new capacity.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 75-79","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5202811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5202811","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:1"

While anemometer spectra drop at 1 Hz, the kite shows considerable energy up to several Hz. The rain flow count method identified discrete and nested cycles in the data. When registering a large amplitude cycle, the kite moved significantly from it`s no cycle position demonstrating that the kite actively seeks out and samples turbulence lumps over an area as opposed to a fixed anemometer. The kite simulated measured number of cycles and durations reasonably well while the anemometer failed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 115; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 226-230","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9413%%448","10.1115/1.2930054","","2016-04-13T00:00:00Z","143937","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/143937","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","115"

A special technique is used to determine the operating point of the wind turbine by using the measured rotor speed and power.

Two parameters are identified which control blade geometry under combined rotational and gravitational loads. Representative zero-bending-moment shapes are calculated, both for constant mass distribution and for several new variable-mass families. The latter include one case whose mathematical solution proves remarkably simple. Steady design stresses are found to be severely affected by deviations from the ideal shape. The concept of aerodynamic Troposkien, ' which preserves zero bending moments in the presence of 1-P cyclic normal forces, is extended to account for gravity as well as inertial effects on blade shape. This concept is limited to unstalled flow and it is found to require unrealistic blade chord distributions near the tower when gravity effects are included. It is noted that both steady gravitational loads and nonsteady aerodynamic normal force loads will become increasingly important in achieving high-cycle fatigue life with larger-scale rotor blades. It is indicated that this achievement will depend primarily on configuring the rotor blades to minimize the cyclic flatwise bending moments and stresses due to the nonsteady normal forces.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 115:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 143-150","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEEDO","10.1115/1.2930041","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","6359811","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6359811","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States)","","115:3"

Part of an ambitious US government program to support research and development on renewable energy sources, the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautic and Space Agency sponsored the construction of a wide variety of large wind turbines-most accompanied by exaggerated claims by the promoters. But by the 1980s, US interest in wind power almost disappeared due to a drop in world oil prices, the Reagan administrations curtailment of funding, and the disappointing results of the initial wind turbines. The problems with the initial wind turbines was overly optimistic economic projections, siting snags, difficulties connecting wind-generated electricity to utility power grids. Today, however the wind farms in California are a highly productive, inexpensive source of energy. The author presents arguments dispelling the following four widely-believed myths about wind energy: (1) Wind power is not a significant energy source; (2) Wind-generated electricity is expensive and unreliable; (3) New and improved machine designs are needed to make wind power feasible; and (4) The technology is impractical for use by utilities because of problems connecting wind machines to the electricity grid, and because wind itself is intermittent. A study at Battelle Pacific Northwest Lab estimates that turbine technology could supply 20% of the country's electrical needs. Investor-owned wind-power plants in California generate electricity at a rate ranging from 4.7 to 7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour. The reality is that wind-produced electricity is now less expensive that electricity produced by conventional fossil- or nuclear-powered generating plants in many parts of the world. And unlike some of the proposed renewable electric-power sources like photovoltaics, wind power's future is not dependent on further breakthroughs in engineering or materials technology.","","","","","","United States","1993-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Technology Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 96:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 38-46","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0040-1692; CODEN: TEREAU; TRN: 93-017275","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6155630","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6155630","","Technology Review; (United States)","","96:5"

Another boost comes from the National Energy Policy Act, signed into law last fall by George Bush. It permits a 1.5 cent per kilowatt-hour tax credit for generators of electricity from renewable sources. Emphasizing energy production is [open quotes]a much smarter approach[close quotes] than just rewarding construction of new windmills, says Alexander Ellis, an executive at Kenetech/US Windpower, because it encourages companies to deliver durable products. Today, the wind energy business seems to be booming, bearing out the Administration's faith that environmental technologies can open new markets. There are now more than 16,000 wind turbines installed in the United States, according to DeMeo, most of them still in California. Europe is also moving ahead. Although European countries have installed fewer machines to date, DeMeo says, the European Community has ambitious plans, calling for double the current US wind energy capacity by the end of the decade.

The model is intended to overcome some of the difficulties associated with currently used methods. It is based on the approach of chemical kinetics. This model, which can be used for charging and discharging, is specifically concerned with the apparent change in capacity as a function of charge and discharge rates.

Examples of the deviation of the battery model constants and comparisons of the new model with those used previously are given. Based on the success of the new model, it has been incorporated into the latest versions of the University of Massachusetts's wind/diesel simulation codes.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States); Journal Volume: 50:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 399-405","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA4","10.1016/0038-092X(93)90060-2","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6356256","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6356256","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States)","","50:5"

Instrument performance is compared for five different wind profilers. Each was equipped with Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) capability to measure virtual temperature. This was the first side-by-side comparison of all three of the most common wind- profiler frequencies: 50, 404, and 915 MHz. The 404-MHz system was a NOAA Wind Profiler Demonstration Network (WPDN) unit. Dual-frequency microwave radiometers that measured path-integrated water vapor and liquid water content were also evaluated. Frequent rawinsonde launches from the remote-sensor sites provided an extensive set of in situ measurements for comparison. The winter operations provide a severe test of the profiler/RASS capabilities because atmospheric scattering is relatively weak and acoustic attenuation is relatively strong in cold, dry conditions. Nevertheless, the lower-frequency systems exhibited impressive height coverage for wind and virtual temperature profiling, whereas the high-frequency units provided higher-resolution measurements near the surface. Comparisons between remote sensor and rawinsonde data generally showed excellent agreement. The results support more widespread use of these emerging technologies.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 74:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 599-613","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-0007; CODEN: BAMIAT","10.1175/1520-0477(1993)074<0599:AEOWPR>2.0.CO;2","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","6758289","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6758289","","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society; (United States)","","74:4"

It provided continuous measurements of winds up to the height of the trade-wind inversion, which varied in altitude from about 2 to 4 km during the course of the experiments. The inversion was readily discernible in the data as an elevated layer of high reflectivity, caused by the sharp gradient of refractive index at that level. With a wavelength of 33 cm, the profiler has about the same sensitivity to light rain as to moderately reflective clear air. The data have provided unexpected information on rain development, wave motions on the inversion, sustained vertical air motions at low levels, and interactions between convection and the inversion echo.

Based upon a study of the ASOS specifications and an informal survey of potential ASOS wind data users, defects of the wind sampling and archival strategy chosen for ASOS are discussed in terms of their impact on various user groups. Limitations include: (1) hourly observation average periods that do not conform to international recommendations for wind reporting made by the World Meteorological Organization, (2) no regular archival of high-resolution data-potentially valuable research data are destroyed if not identified within a 12-h period, and (3) no emergency power for operation in severe weather conditions.

This work was initiated within the framework of a Dutch research program on land ice and sea level change. Seven meteostations were operated along a transect running from the tundra well onto the ice sheet. At the ice edge, humidity, temperature, and wind profiles were obtained with a tethered balloon. On the ice sheet, 90 km from the edge, a boundary-layer research unit, including a sound detecting and ranging system (SODAR) and a radio acoustic sounding system (RASS), was established. Although focusing on the relation between surface energy balance, glacier mass balance, and ice flow, the experiment has also delivered a unique dataset on the dynamics of the atmospheric boundary layer around the warm tundra-cold ice sheet transition. Unexpected behavior was found for the surface albedo during the melt season. Lowest values are not found close to the ice edge, which is usual for glaciers, but higher on the ice sheet. Meltwater accumulation due to inefficient surface drainage was found to be the cause for this. The wind regime is dominated by katabatic flow from the ice sheet. The katabatic layer is typically 100-200 m thick. Close to the ice edge, the flow exhibits a very regular daily rhythm, with maximum wind speed in the afternoon. Farther on the ice sheet, the regime changes, and wind speed reaches maximum values in late night/early morning.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 74:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 355-365","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-0007; CODEN: BAMIAT","10.1175/1520-0477(1993)074<0355:AMEITM>2.0.CO;2","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6601196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6601196","","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society; (United States)","","74:3"

It has been found that the events are associated with strong katabatic and strong gradient flow operating together. Both components are found to increase threefold on average for these strong winds, and although the geostrophic flow is the stronger, it rarely produces strong winds without katabatic flow becoming stronger than it is in the mean. The two wind components do not flow in the same direction; indeed, there is some cancellation between them, since katabatic flow acts in a predominant downslope direction, while the geostrophic wind acts across slope. The stronger geostrophic flow is associated with higher-than-average pressures over the continent and the approach of a strong cyclonic system toward the coast and a blocking system downstream. The anomalous synoptic patterns leading up to the occasions display a strong wavenumber 4 structure. The very strong katabatic flow appears to be related to the production of a supply of cold air inland from Casey by the stronger-than-average surface temperature inversions inland a few days before the strong winds occur. The acceleration of this negatively buoyant air mass down the steep, ice-sheet escarpment results in strong katabatic flow near the coast. 24 refs., 11 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Monthly Weather Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 121:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 522-534","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0027-0644; CODEN: MWREAB","10.1175/1520-0493(1993)121<0522:AAOSWE>2.0.CO;2","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7065236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7065236","","Monthly Weather Review; (United States)","","121:2"

Reliability is now satisfactory; in addition, wind farm operation and maintenance procedures have been mastered. Unit size has increased by a factor of 10 during the past decade: wind turbines rated at 0.5 megawatts are now available commercially from several manufacturers. Moreover, advances in wind turbine technology in the next 20 years (such as advanced materials for airfoils and transmissions, better controls and operating strategies, improved high-power-handling electronics) will substantially reduce capital costs as well as operation and maintenance costs. In areas with good wind resources (450 watts per square meter [m[sup [minus]2]] wind power density at hub height), wind turbines now generate electricity at a cost of $0.053 per kilowatt-hour (kWh[sup [minus]1]) (6 percent interest, all taxes neglected). With a mature wind turbine technology, the cost is expected to decline to less than $0.03 kWh[sup [minus]1], rendering wind-generated electricity fully competitive with electricity from coal-fired generating stations. In addition, economically exploitable wind resources (wind power density >300 watts m[sup [minus]2] at 50 meters) are extensive and widely distributed, and, in general, wind-generated electricity can be easily integrated into utility grids without provision for storage.

This forecast is based upon economic analyses indicating that the costs of wind-generated electricity could be cost competitive with conventional fossil-fuel-based generation by early next century. The key to realizing this objective is overcoming technical challenges to the development of a next-generation of advanced wind turbines. These challenges include the detailed characterization of wind inflow to turbines at wind-power-plant sites, an understanding of unsteady aerodynamics, the development of sophisticated computer models of all aspects of turbine operation, and the application of a better understanding of component and system fatigue to new designs. Advanced wind systems will include such new technologies as blade designs incorporating advanced airfoils and new materials, variable-speed operation, advanced power electronics, rotor-hub enhancements, tall towers, aerodynamic controls, advanced drive trains, and expert control systems. A larger market share for wind energy will also require the resolution of issues surrounding transmission, storage, and the integration of an intermittent energy source into the utility grid. 49 refs., 37 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Advances in Solar Energy; Journal Volume: 7; Other Information: PBD: 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 309-371","","","","Journal ID: ASOED9; ISSN 0731-8618; TRN: 96:002794-0009","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","460363","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/460363","","Advances in Solar Energy","","7"

The approach is based on the fuzzy sets theory. The fuzzy variables are both the wind speed and its frequency of occurrence, as they are measured on the site. The method is developed step-by-step and it is applied to the wind data of Greek islands, focusing the interest on the extreme wind events. The results of the application are compared to those obtained through a classical risk analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed Fuzzy Risk Index (FRI) approach.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 638-643","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE4","10.1109/60.182645","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6810675","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6810675","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","7:4"

The wind speed and direction distributions are represented with Weibull functions. Besides, a mass-consistent numerical mesoscale model was used to give an overview of the wind prospecting and siting problem, and an example of its use for Corfu (Kerkira), an island in the Ionian Sea, is given.

The objectives of this paper are to evaluate this call in more detail in some parts of the Federal Republic of Germany by analyzing possibilities, restrictions, and production costs of electricity generation from wind energy in Baden-Wurttemberg, an inland state in the southwest of Germany. Based on zones with similar average wind velocities, the theoretical potential to install converters is assessed for each municipality, considering among other things residential areas, highways, roads, rivers, and nature conservation areas as not usable territories. The result is a technical area potential suitable for the installation of wind energy converters. Based on this area potential, a methodological approach is presented that allows the definition and the analysis of strategies of a wind energy use on a high spatial and timely resolution.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; (United States); Journal Volume: 14:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 411-422","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; CODEN: EGYSA","10.1080/00908319208908737","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","7003747","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7003747","","Energy Sources; (United States)","","14:4"

The statistics of the diesel plant loading, which is the initial system load net the wind generation are calculated. Expected annual wind and diesel energy production as well as fuel consumption and cost are calculated. In order to retain acceptable service reliability, the operation of the wind-diesel system is constrained by the requirement that the wind generation must not exceed a certain percentage of the system load. This requirement introduces interdependence between the wind generation and the system load which is taken into account in the derivation of the statistics of the diesel plant loading.

This analysis assumes that the rotating blade airfoils will perform as they do in the wind tunnel. Results to date have shown that unsteady aerodynamics exist during all operating conditions and dynamic stall can exist for high yaw angle operation. Stall hysteresis occurs for even small way angles and delayed stall is a very persistent reality in all operating conditions. delayed stall is indicated by a leading edge suction peak which remains attached through angles of attack (AOA) up to 30 degrees. Wind tunnel results show this peak separating from the leading edge at 18 deg AOA. The effect of this anomaly is to raise normal force coefficients and tangent force coefficients for high AOA. Increase tangent forces will directly affect HAWT performance in high wind speed operation. This paper describes pressure distribution data resulting from both wind tunnel and HAWT tests. A method of bins is used to average the HAWT data which is compared to the wind tunnel data. The analysis technique and the test set-up for each test are described.","","","","","","United States","1992-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the ASAE; (United States); Journal Volume: 114","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 119-124","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0001-2351; CODEN: TAAEA","10.1115/1.2929989","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","7032037","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7032037","","Transactions of the ASAE; (United States)","","114"

It is assumed that t the primary focusing of the dynamic yaw originates from the variations from wind turbulence in the average wind direction and the horizontal gradient of the wind speed across the rotor. The horizontal components of the turbulence velocity are modeled as random processes with spectral characteristics calibrated from measurements. The corresponding statistics of the wind direction and the gradient are derived and used as input for an equivalent linear model of the system dynamics. The parameters in the simplified system model are identified from the results of a numerical test of a comprehensive yaw response and energy capture simulation model, developed at U.S. Windpower. The yaw response of the USW Model 56-100 machine to turbulence has been analyzed for a number of wind conditions and compared to test results with satisfactory agreement. The analysis shows that the effect on the yaw error from the horizontal wind gradient is twice the effect from wind direction changes.","","","","","","United States","1991-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 113:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 102-111","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEED","10.1115/1.2929953","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","5861616","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5861616","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (United States)","","113:2"

As summarized, a major design problem is to build a system that will allow the rotor to turn at a variable speed, while the machine is feeding power of constant frequency to the load. Although many approaches have been suggested for variable speed operation, they can be grouped into two main classes: (i) discretely variable, and (ii) continuously variable. It is concluded that, based on the current state-of-the-art, the systems with the most promise appear to be those incorporating power electronics.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA); Journal Volume: 46:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 41-51","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA","10.1016/0038-092X(91)90105-6","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","5897164","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5897164","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA)","","46:1"

The models take into account several basic features of wind speed data including autocorrelation, non-Gaussian distribution, and diurnal nonstationarity. The positive correlation between consecutive wind speed observations is taken into account by fitting an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process to wind speed data which were transformed to make their distribution approximately Gaussian and standardized to remove diurnal nonstationarity. Based on three years of data, separate models were obtained for the months of June, July, and August. Tests were performed to verify the adequacy of the models and comparisons were made between generated and real series and between forecasted and real series to check if the wind speed behavior was faithfully reproduced.

Two of these models, MS3DJH/3R and BZ, are descendants of the Jackson-Hunt (J-H) theory, while the third, NOABL, is a mass-consistent model. The NOABL model was operated in both optimizing and normal modes. The models were evaluated by comparing model-derived simulations of the wind to actual wind data collected from two areas of complex terrain: Askervein Hill in Scotland and the Altamont Pass area of California. The overall performance of the models was about the same. When the models were applied to Askervein Hill, the errors in the prediction of averaged winds were in a range of about 8% to 10% for all models. Wind speed prediction errors for Altamont Pass were sensitive to the number of wind observations available for either model input, in the case of mass-consistent models, or post-processing of the model simulations, in the case of J-H models (or the NOABL model operated without optimization). With only one wind input wind station employed for model input, all models performed poorly and exhibited wind speed prediction errors of about 25%. Using six wind input stations reduced the errors to about 9% to 10%. Errors of this magnitude are essentially identical to those found for the Askervein Hill model simulations. The greatly improved model simulations that follow from the use of the six wind observations underscore the necessity for wind data at more than one point for some modeling situations.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States); Journal Volume: 46:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 283-294","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA","10.1016/0038-092X(91)90096-F","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","5137350","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5137350","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (United States)","","46:5"

This paper reports results of a validation study of YawDyn using full-scale test results from the Combined Experiment rotor developed and operated by the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI). A primary finding of recent research is that stall hysteresis has a large influence on yaw monents on the Combined Experiment rotor. Instantaneous pressure disturbances measured on the rotor provide conclusive evidence that stall hysteresis is present and calculations using YawDyn shown that the hysteresis increases the mean yaw moment dramatically (typically over 100 percent) and the cyclic yaw moments to a lesser extent. This paper provides details of the effect of stall hysteresis and shows the results of representing hysteresis using a Gormont model for dynamic stall. Results of validation efforts using YawDyn to analyze both fixed and free-yaw behavior demonstrate the model is qualitatively correct. The quantitative accuracy of the model varies depending upon the test conditions and the rotor. In some situations the model is adequate while in other situations the accuracy must be improved. consideration of stall hysteresis and skewed wake aerodynamics is vital to the success that has been obtained to date.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 310-314","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEED","10.1115/1.2929939","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","5782957","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5782957","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA)","","112:4"

Although vegetation at the site consisted primarily of grass, scattered areas of trees that penetrated the site provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate the effects of surface roughness changes on the wind flow characteristics. Wind data collected at nine towers across the site revealed that surface roughness changes in the upwind fetch caused pronounced variations in the wind flow over site. At two towers that were frequently 200 m to 300 m downwind of a grove of 10-m to 18-m trees, 20-30 percent reductions in wind speed and a factor of two to three increase in turbulence were measured at a height of 32 m. A substantial increase in the magnitude of the wind gusts, as well as a considerable decrease in the mean wind speed, was observed when a tower was downwind of the trees. Implications for a wind turbine located downwind of the trees, with a hub height near 30m, would be reduced power output, more variable power output, more start-stop cycles, and increased stress caused by the tree-induced turbulence. The effects of the trees on the wind flow characteristics were considerably reduced at heights of 60 m and at distances greater than 500 m.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 320-325","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEED","10.1115/1.2929942","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5561993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5561993","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA)","","112:4"

The necessity of including turbulent wind effects in structural dynamics models has long been recognized. At SERI, the structural dynamics model, or FLAP (Force and Loads Analysis Program), is being modified to include turbulent wind fluctuations in predicting rotor blade forces and moments. The objective of this paper is to show FLAP code predictions compared to measured blade loads using actual anemometer array data and a curve-fitting routine to form series expansion coefficients as the turbulence input to FLAP. The predictions are performed for a three-bladed upwind field test turbine. An array of nine anemometers was located 0.8 rotor diameters (D) upwind of the turbine, and data from each anemometer are used in a least-squares curve-fitting routine to obtain a series expansion of the turbulence field over the rotor disk. Three 10-min data cases are used to compare FLAP predictions to measured results. Each case represents a different mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. The time series of coefficients in the expansion of the turbulent velocity field are input to the FLAP code. Time series of predicted flap-bending moments at two blade radial stations are obtained, and power spectra of the predictions are then compared to power spectra of the measured blade bending moments. Conclusions are then drawn about the FLAP codes' ability to predict the blade loads for these three data cases. Recommendations for future work are also made.","","","","","","United States","1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 112:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 326-332","","","AC02-83CH10093","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; CODEN: JSEED","10.1115/1.2929943","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","5562033","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5562033","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; (USA)","","112:4"

In a 260-km{sup 2} observation area, a total of 3,134 dust devils were counted on 97 days (out of 112 observing days). Within the observation area, the dust devils were concentrated in a relatively small area and showed strong correlation with roadways and other cleared areas. However, from the summer of 1986 to the spring of 1987, the center of activity shifted from a relatively undisturbed region to an area whose surface had been recently modified. This shift is attributed to changes in soil moisture and surface thermal properties. It is suggested that the co-location of the center of activity in 1987 with the modified surface is an example of inadvertent weather modification on a very local scale. The dust devils had a daily distribution very similar to that found by Sinclair (1969) in comparable terrain in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona. The time of the first observed dust devil was very regular on days with dry surface conditions at sunrise and clear skies through the morning. The time of the first dust devil was delayed and the degree of activity reduced if precipitation had occurred on a previous day in the observation area.

Kinetic energy spectra of the surface wind show a peak at a period of 1.1 days in the clockwise component spectrum. This period is slightly (6%) shorter than the local inertial period (1.2 days). The peak period varies slightly during the record analyzed, but tends to remain below the local inertial period. Complex demodulation with a filter shows that the large inertial amplitudes occur intermittently and decay rapidly. Most of the occurrences of large inertial events seem to be related to passing cold frontal systems or migrating low-pressure systems.","","","","","","United States","1990-07-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:D8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 11777-11783","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0148-0227; CODEN: JGREA","10.1029/JD095iD08p11777","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5488903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5488903","","Journal of Geophysical Research; (United States)","","95:D8"

This situation has been only partially redressed by wind monitoring studies since these provide site specific wind data, usually at heights significantly below turbine height. Such measurements, when used in conjunction with simple data extrapolation methods such as the one-seventh power law, can seriously underestimate wind speeds at hub height, particularly at inland sites. To overcome these limitations, a numerical model developed for the extrapolation of site specific wind data, the WA{sup s}P model, has been developed by the Riso National Laboratory, Denmark and has recently been used to produce the European Wind Atlas. This article describes the Western Australian Wind Atlas project which aims to increase the understanding of the state's wind energy resource, as well as provide a tool for estimating the hub height wind resource at proposed wind energy sites.","","","","","","United States","1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sunworld; (USA); Journal Volume: 14:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 53-54, 43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0149-1938; CODEN: SUNWD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5684293","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5684293","","Sunworld; (USA)","","14:2"

Wind power plants in California generated 2.1 billion (2,124 million) kWh of electricity during 1989 - a 17 percent increase over the previous year. The electricity is equal to about one percent of the electricity consumed in California. In Denmark, production of wind-generated electricity jumped an impressive 62 percent to 465 million kWh - equal to about 1.6 percent of electrical consumption in the country. At current rates, generation by wind plants in California should stabilize at nearly 2.8 kWh per year in 1992. The 134 MW of new capacity added last year should be able to produce about 275 million kWh annually. If an additional 150 MW are installed this year and next, annual generation should increase by another 300 million kWh per year. According to the Danish consulting firm Birger Madsen Consult, 356 turbines were installed in Denmark last year - increasing the total number of turbines operating in the country by 17 percent to 2,406. The average size of the turbines installed last year reached nearly 200 kW. This brings the total capacity installed in the country to 253 MW. Last year turbines generated 2,133 kWh and had a capacity factor 24.3 percent.

The first, a mail survey Consumer Attitude and Choice in Local Energy Development, was conducted by Robert Thayer at the University of California's Davis campus. The other survey, conducted by Dr. Phyllis Bosley at Towson State University targeted national environmental leaders. The Thayer survey examined how people view four energy technologies - biomass, nuclear, fossil, and wind - and where they would find them most acceptable. Of the six factors Thayer measure - safety, reliability, environmental impacts, cost, dependence on foreign oil, and visual impacts - wind energy's big bugaboo, visual impact, was the least important. Wind turbines do produce a strong NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) response among customers, however. The Bosley study of national environmental leaders found, somewhat surprisingly, that the Sierra Club held slightly more positive views toward wind energy than environmental leaders in general. Nationally, solar was seen as the most cost effective energy source, followed by wind. The survey compared attitudes toward four energy technologies: solar, wind, fossil fuels, and nuclear power. There was general agreement among the environmentalists that both wind and solar were environmentally superior energy sources to fossil fuels and nuclear power.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-65","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: XY987","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5424623","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5424623","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","20:3"

Stoddard's revelation coupled with the announcement by Pacific Gas Electric Co. of its re-entry into wind development set an optimistic tone for the annual gathering despite findings by the California Energy Commission (CEC) that operating wind capacity decreased by nearly 200 MW. The CEC's preliminary report on the 1988 performance of the wind industry concluded that capacity decreased for the first time in the four-year old program. Sam Rashkin, the report's author, attributes the capacity attrition to projects that are dropping out of the reporting system. Projects are not required to report, says Rashkin, if they do not generate electricity during the year.

When using the method of bins, recommended by the International Energy Agency, to determine the power curve, the pre-average occults the wind's irregularity. The study of this irregularity allows one to give a weighting to each test data. Before defining this method two lines of study were developed. The first one concerns the regularity of a function and its application to the variation, for a given machine, of the wind vector module over time. The second one deals with the estimation of the mean value of a random variable by the calculation of the mean of the observed values, given a weighting by a coefficient allowing the diminution or increase then importance of a result. For a given place, whose turbulence intensity during the measurements is known, the weighted curve and the unweighted curve should be the same. Using the weighting brings either increase in the accuracy or decrease in the number of tests. This method has been tested on two WECS. The tests were carried out at the Centre National d'Essais Eoliens de Lannion (CNEEL France).

For this method, equations were derived to calculate the cost of a kWh generated by wind turbines with different characteristics as a function of the capital investment per kW installed capacity. The method was applied to the sites at which Royal Scientific Society performs wind speed measurements, and the results indicate that some of these sites are well suited for cost efficient generation of electricity by wind energy. The results also show that a wind tribine which is designed to have a relatively low rated speed has a wider range of economical operation than a wind turbine with a higher rated speed for the sites investigated assuming that the maximum rated power for all for the wind turbines is held constant.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA); Journal Volume: 45:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 167-175","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA","10.1016/0038-092X(90)90050-M","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6124152","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6124152","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA)","","45:3"

These estimates are typically based on wind data that have been collected on-site for one or more years. Rarely have the wind data records exceeded three years. Variations in the mean annual wind speeds have been assumed to be {plus minus}10% of the long-term mean wind speed with a 90% confidence interval. This assumption, however, is based on previous work using long-term airport wind data and it has not been verified at high wind locations. In addition, most of the strong wind sites that have been developed for wind energy display distinct seasonal variations in the wind speed. In the Altamont and San Gorgonio Passes about 80% of the energy is produced during the spring and summer months. If the winds are abnormally weak during any of these months (particularly May-August), the annual energy production can be significantly reduced. Similarly, stronger than normal winds during this time period can greatly enhance the annual production. Over 10 years of hourly wind data have been collected at several moderate-to-high wind sites in the Pacific Northwest for the Bonneville Power Administration.

Free-flow characteristics examined were the variability of wind speed and turbulence intensity across the site as a function of wind direction and surface roughness. The nine towers' data revealed that scattered areas of trees upwind of the site caused pronounced variations in the wind flow over the site. Wind turbine wake characteristics analyzed included the average velocity deficits, wake turbulence, wake width, wake trajectory, vertical profile of the wake, and the stratification of wake properties as a function of the ambient wind speed and turbulence intensity. The wind turbine rotor disk spanned a height of 15 m to 107 m. The nine towers' data permitted a detailed analysis of the wake behavior at a height of 32 m at various downwind distances from 2 to 10 rotor diameters (D). The relationship between velocity deficit and downwind distance was surprisingly linear, with average maximum deficits ranging from 34% at 2 D to 7% at 10 D. Largest deficits were at low wind speeds and low turbulence intensities. Average wake widths were 2.8 D at a downwind distance of 10 D. Implications for turbine spacing are that, for a wind farm with a 10-D row separation, array losses would be significantly greater for a 2-D than a 3-D spacing because of incremental effects caused by overlapping wakes. Other interesting wake properties observed were the wake turbulence, the vertical variation of deficits, and the trajectory of the wake.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA); Journal Volume: 45:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 265-283","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA","10.1016/0038-092X(90)90012-2","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6342731","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6342731","","Solar Energy (Journal of Solar Energy Science and Engineering); (USA)","","45:5"

Antigua, an island country in the eastern Caribbean covering approximately 171 square miles and supporting a population of 83,000, is one of many well-known tourist attractions. Since 1979, the power generated by local stations has more than doubled from 45,000 MW in 1979 to 115,000 MW 1989. Annual peak demand for electricity has doubled as well, increasing from a peak demand of eight MW in 1979 to 18 MW in 1989. Although installed capacity is small by U.S. utility standards, growth on the island is nevertheless straining existing power generating facilities, a fact amply demonstrated by routine power outages. Many of the tourists who flock to Antigua do so because of its reputation as a sunny place, and to sail in the trade winds which blow steadily across the comparatively flat island. These two characteristics also bode well for potential solar and wind energy opportunities, and effort made to tap these resources are described.","","","","","","United States","1989-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (USA); Journal Volume: 19:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: XY987","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6960239","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6960239","","Independent Energy; (USA)","","19:8"

He added that during the past year several common market members have announced plans to develop substantial amounts of wind energy. The United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands have each stated their intent to build 1,000 MW of wind generation by the turn of the century, and Italy recently announced plans to add from 300-600 MW. Germany has also made plans to promote wind generation. The decision to include firms from non-EEC countries is left to the utility.

Longitudinal distributions of the monthly mean zonal component were markedly different in each ocean: in the Pacific the zonal profile resembled a semicircle; a linear change occurred in the Atlantic, and quasi-uniform values prevailed in the Indian Ocean. Only in the Atlantic and Pacific was the prevailing direction of the zonal component westward. In the Pacific the monthly mean standard deviations increased towards the west. This indicated that the larger day-to-day wind variability observed at the western islands compared to moored buoy measurements in the eastern region was a natural phenomenon and not caused by islands. The average monthly mean slope of the wave number spectra throughout the 550- to 2,200-km wavelength band was {minus}1.7, which was approximately equal to the {minus}5/3 power law associated with turbulent motions. That the spectra levels of the zonal wind, but not the meridional component, were substantially different in each equatorial ocean represents an enigma.

These measurements were taken at seven levels spanning the WTS-4 rotor height on a single meteorological tower 1.75 rotor diameters upstream of the turbine. Concurrent measurements of rotor response were also made. Analysis of the winds at the Medicine Bow site reveals the influence of atmospheric and geographic conditions on what may, at first glance, appear to be a classic, simple, flat terrain case. The turbulence data are analyzed to (1) characterize the wind in terms of fixed-point, single-tower properties and (2) model the wind properties as they would be experienced by points on rotating turbine blades. The STRS-2 model, developed by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, is used to convert single-tower wind characteristics into an estimate of those that would be measured from an array of towers arranged in a crosswind line covering the rotor disk. A response function for the flatwise root bending moment of one of the WTS-4 turbine blades is computed using the turbine data and the STRS-2 data. The STRS-2 model provides a substantially improved correlation with wind turbine blade bending moment over other single-tower estimation methods.","","","Colorado State Univ., Engineering Research Center, Fort Collins, CO (US); Pacific Northwest Lab., Battellle Labs., Richland, WA (US)","","","United States","1989-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Of particular interest is the blockage correction procedure which is vital for application of the wind tunnel results to a prototype design, and facilitates comparison of data obtained by other investigators. Next, using the concept of a central vortex, substantiated by a flow visualization study, a semiempirical approach to predict the rotor performance using measured stationary blade pressure data is developed. The simple approach promises to be quite effective in predicting the rotor performance, even in the presence of blockage, and should prove useful at least in the preliminary design stages.","","","Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC (CA)","","","United States","1989-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The absence of long-term wind speed makes siting of wind-energy conversion systems (WECS) extremely risky. Before investing in precise anemometry, wind prospectors may arrive at a first approximation with biological indicators, which are fairly inexpensive. This article describes an effort at calibrating three characteristics of mesquite trees at two sites in Texas, with wind speeds above and below the apparent economic threshold. These indicators differ in their cost of data acquisition. A discriminant analysis indicates the accuracy of these indicators in classifying samples. The value, risks, and cost effectiveness of biological information in assessing regional wind resources is illustrated through decision analysis.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Energy; (USA); Journal Volume: 42:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 15-25","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0038-092X; CODEN: SRENA","10.1016/0038-092X(89)90126-6","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","5195496","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5195496","","Solar Energy; (USA)","","42:1"

The numbers of variables involved in a typical atmospheric test, the poor correlation between measured instantaneous winds and the actual wind across a rotor disc, and the range of input and response time scales involved all make the correlation task formidable. This paper describes a method which has proven effective for analyzing test data and gaining insight into wind turbine behavior. The method basically consists of representing the dynamic response data in terms of its Fourier Series. A time-series of Fourier coefficients is then created to replace the original time-series raw data. The entire data set, consisting of thousands of rotor revolutions is subdivided into hundreds of sets, each consisting of the azimuth average of (typically) two to ten revolutions. One set of Fourier coefficients (magnitudes and phases of response) is calculated for each azimuth average. The resulting reduced data has a greatly compressed volume with virtually no loss of information. The result is greater insight and a manageable data set size. This new technique is demonstrated for two different wind turbines, an ESI-80 and a Hamilton Standard WTS-4.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT (US)","","","United States","1988-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The control techniques are applied to a practical problem related with the dynamical performance of a Darrieus aerogenerator which is connected to a remote alternative current network through back-to-back direct current converters. The converters, arranged as a dc link, serve as static frequency changer and they provide the means for controlling the dynamics of the aerogenerator. Design on the aerogenerator regulators with eigen-values and transfer functions analysis is described. In addition of providing speed and power regulation, the dc link controls contribute to the reduction, in a simple and low cost manner, of torsional vibrations in the drive train of the wind turbine.

The single blade can also take advantage of reduced parking loads, caused by the windvane effect of the blade and reduced blade surface. The turbine also offers freedom to adapt the rotor length to the local wind regime.

The AC system was selected because AC motors, in multiple kilowatt sizes, can be more practical than DC motors. A wind turbine which produces electricity has a lower overall efficiency than a system producing mechanical power but offers more flexibility in adapting to varying loads and in locating the wind turbine near the load. A permanent magnet alternator designed to operate with a rotor speed from 70 to 150 r/min was first operated in the laboratory. The frequency of the output varied from 30 to 65Hz, while the voltage changed from 85 to 218 V, resulting in voltage to frequency ratios (V/f) from 2.6 to 3.3 with various loads. The alternator, with a maximum rated output of 9kW, provided power to resistive load or induction motor loads. The tests revealed that standard three-phase, 240 V, 60 Hz, AC induction motors will operate with any input of 85 V and 30 Hz. A motor temperature rise of 40/sup 0/C above ambient was not exceeded when power was supplied by the alternator to a 7.6 kW motor. System efficiencies were nearly equivalent to those obtained with utility power, even though the V/f was below that calculated from the motor's nameplate. The wind energy conversion system (WECS) was then operated in windspeeds of 3.5 m/s or greater. The WECS was capable of providing power to satisfactorily operate induction motors in an autonomous system.","","","U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Conservation and Production Research Lab., Bushland, TX (US)","","","United States","1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A procedure for accounting for Reynolds number effects on airfoil section models was developed and implemented for NACA 0012 and NACA 4415 profiles; both of these models is valid through angles of attack up to 90 deg and for Reynolds numbers ranging from 4 x 10/sup 4/ to 3 x 10/sup 6/. These models were incorporated into both a lifting line computer code, LL200R, adapted for this report. This enabled greater uncertainty to be obtained in evaluating theoretical performance codes with respect to actual data, as well as providing a means by which a parametric analysis of the relative effects of Re changes on rotor performance to be performed. The use of low Reynolds number section data was found to significantly lower the predicted values of power coefficient, particularly at off-design tip speed-ratios. For symmetrical airfoils, this effect on performance was only significant for low tip-speed- ratios, while cambered airfoils were affected more uniformly at all operating conditions. Changes in performance were induced by parametric variations of wind speed, rotor scale, and rotor generating mode using the Reynolds number dependent section models. Results show that wind speed variations are more significant for smaller rotors at lower wind-speeds, and section models represented at only a single Reynolds number are more suitable for the analysis of constant RPM rotors.","","","Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA (US)","","","United States","1988-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Also, eight 10 m towers with anemometers were used to measure wind speeds at locations surrounding the main towers, so wind speed correlation across a hypothetical windfarm could be determined. All eight 10 m towers were placed around the main tower at Plainville from mid-April through mid-June, 1984 to obtain data across a windfarm site. Autocorrelation functions were calculated using a 1 min average wind speeds for lag times up to 32 min and using 10 min average speeds for lags up to 85 hr. The autocorrelation functions varied little with height and with location across a site. All autocorrelations showed a fast initial drop, then a fairly steady slow drop, with 10 min averaged wind speeds remaining correlated for lags up to 20 hr or longer. A diurnal variation was sometimes apparent in Summer; the major cycle appeared to have a several day period in Fall and Winter. Autocorrelation functions were also calculated for single MOD-2 wind machine power output; these functions were similar to those of wind speed except for lower correlations at small lag times. Cross-correlations as a function of separation distance were calculated for wind speed and wind machine outputs. The wind machine output cross-correlations were used to calculate the autocorrelation functions of various sized windfarms. A windfarm consisting of a 10 x 10 array of MOD-2's with .80 km by 1.61 km spacing was one example. For this windfarm the correlation of 1 min averaged output was still .9 for a 32 min lag time.","","","Center for Energy Studies, College of Engineering, Wichita State Univ., Wichita, KS (US)","","","United States","1988-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

This phenomenon has been observed by the flow visualization of a two-straight-bladed Darrieus rotor in the IMST water tunnel. Also introduced into the aerodynamic model are the effects of the blade tip and finite aspect ratio on the aerodynamic performance of the Darrieus wind turbine. These improvements are compatible with the double-multiple-streamtube model and have been included in the CARDAAV computer code for predicting the aerodynamic performance. Very good agreement has been observed between the test data (Sandia 17 m) and theoretical predictions; a significant improvement over the previous dynamic stall model was obtained for the rotor power at low tip speed ratios, while the inclusion of the finite aspect ratio effects enhances the prediction of the rotor power for high tip speed ratios. The tip losses and finite aspect ratio effects were also calculated for a small-scale vertical-axis wind turbine, with a two-straight-bladed (NACA 0015) rotor. 15 references.","","","Montreal Universite (Canada)","","","United States","1988-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

There exists a physical gap in blade chord between the pitchable outer portion of the rotor blade and the inner, fixed portion of the blade. On the MOD-2, the gap is 0.28 m (11 inches) wide and the gap is situated at 70 percent of the rotor radius or 32.0 m (105 fet) from the rotor centerline. The chord at the gap is over 2.3 m (90 inches). A gap in the chord of the blade of a wind turbine causes the circulation to drop to zero at the opening. As a result of the drop in circulation, vorticity is shed in the wake with vorticity of opposite signs being present; the vorticity shed outboard of the gap is of the opposite sign of the vorticity shed inboard of the gap. Let us model the effect of this shed vorticity as a semi-infinite vortex doublet extending downwind of the gap. The vortex shed at the gap due to the difference in circulation between the inner and outer portions of the blade is neglected.

In the past, trial and error or intuition have been used in the selection of pre-averaging time and researchers and institutions have differed widely in their pre-averaging practice. In this paper a standardized method is proposed for selection of the optimum pre-averaging time. The method selects an averaging time such that the test data are low-pass filtered at the same frequency as the response frequency of the test wind turbine/anemometer system. A theoretical method is provided for estimation of the wind system transfer function as a function of the anemometer location, rotor moment of inertia, the stiffness of the connection between the rotor and the electrical grid, hub height, rotor speed and wind speed. The method is based in proven theory, repeatable, easy to use and applicable to a wide range of wind turbines and test conditions. Results of the transfer function predictions are compared with the measured response of two wind systems. Agreement between the predicted and measured response is completely adequate for the purposes of the method. Example results of calculated averaging times are presented for several wind turbines. In addition, a case study is used to demonstrate the dramatic effects of test design and data analysis methods on the results of a power coefficient measurement.","","","Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112","","","United States","1986-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

An optimal level to which the wind output should be limited is found in terms of the distribution of wind power output and the relative cost of the fast acting and base loaded units. Using the optimal cutting point for the wind output each wind farm can be included in the economic dispatch calculation. The economic advantage of limiting wind power output is demonstrated on an example system. Using a hypothetical system it is shown that wind penetrations as high as 16.75% may be economical using the optimal strategy made possible by the AC/DC/AC interface.","","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY","","","United States","1985-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

A NWS model anemometer was calibrated, and when the calibration results were applied to the NWS data, the difference was largely removed. Second, there was considerable variation between the measured average wind speeds at the 19 sites, even though the sites were fairly close together, had similar surface cover near each site, and had only very small elevation changes around the towers. An attempt was made to reduce the difference between the measured average wind speeds by a correction based on the small elevation features in the 10-mile radius area surrounding each measurement tower. This measurement correction significantly reduced the differences in the measured wind speeds.","","","College of Engineering, Wichita State University, Wichita, Kan.","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These blade lift forces are transmitted via the blade support arms to the tower. The resulting tower force vector is a composite of: a downwind and a crosswind average force component, rotating force vectors, and force vectors oscillating in the crosswind direction. The frequency of the rotating and oscillating forces are multiples of the product of Bw, where B is the number of blades used and ..omega.. is the rotor angular velocity. The magnitude of the largest tower shake force vector is of the same order as the average downwind force component, and may represent a serious design constraint in the calculation of the required tower stiffness. A closed-form solution for the tower force vectors has been derived, by introducing a suitable wind interference model. It shows that the magnitude of the largest tower shake force vector, using a threebladed rotor, is four times smaller than a two-bladed rotor. The Betz limit and the optimum tip speed ratio as a function of solidity has been derived by comparison with two semicylindrical actuators in series.","","","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, W.Va.","","","United States","1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Numerous experimental and analytical research efforts have investigated the potential of the TWES as a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The present paper summarizes and analyzes much of the research to date on the TWES. A simplified cost analysis incorporating these research results is also included. Based on these analyses, the TWES does not show any significant promise of improving on either the performance or the cost of energy attainable by conventional WECS. The prospects for achieving either a system power coefficient above 0.20 or a cost of energy less than $0.50/kWh (1979 dollars) appear to be poor.","","","Solar Energy Research Institute, Golden, Colo.","","","United States","1985-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The model results suggest that no one solution for optimizing a wid generatot location would safisfy both coastlines owing to their differing characteristics. On the east coast, the most favorable location is approximately 55 km inland on the high-lying terrain, whereas on the west coast the best location is generally about 10 km offshore. The application of the two-dimesional form of a primitive equation model in areas where the topography and the coastline are in accordance with model constraints is shown to provide a useful framework for measurements and analysis of the potential wind power of a such a region.","","","Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903","","","United States","1984-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This paper presents the design optimization process, identifies and discusses the influence of the various parameters, and then reviews the procedure by looking at two examples. The results of this process emphasize the relative importance of the design on rated wind speed, rotor rpm, generator size, and rotor blade characteristics. These results in general show that wind turbines have been designed for excessively high-rated wind speeds and generator capacities, except for those machines intended for wind farm applications and sites with particularly high winds. Machines designed for residential use should be sized to closely match the expected load and should be rated at a wind speed close to that value where the maximum energy contribution occurs. This wind speed is much lower than the rated wind speed for most currently available machines particularly for regions of relatively low annual mean wind speeds.

And according to the current trend most of these WTG's will be owned and operated by entities other than the utility. Consequently, a large fraction of these machines will be placed in clusters in relatively small windrich areas. Also ways and means have to be found for properly evaluating the power from wind. This paper presents a methodology to analyze the effects of clusters on the capacity factors of WTG's in a windfarm. Using the atmospheric boundary layer effect we calculate the reduction in the wind velocity due to the turbulence caused by WTG's (upwind) in a cluster. Using a Weibull distribution for the wind speed we then calculate the capacity factor for the WTG in each row of the cluster. The method is simple and computationally very efficient. Moreover, there is excellent agreement between our results (of capacity factor) for the first row and results obtained from a more rigorous SERI study (referenced in the paper) which does not consider the cluster effect. Also, the velocity deficity profile compares favorably with the results from the well known Lissaman model discussed in the paper. The applicability of this paper lies in its use as a screening tool for comparing various sites, cluster geometries and capital costs of different alternatives.","","","Electrical Engineering Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA 24061","","","United States","1984-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

These are identified as: 1) constant var (reactive), 2) constant voltage, and 3) constant power factor (PF) control. The power system environment in which the wind turbine generator (WTG) exists ultimately determines which method of control is the most suitable. In the case of the BIPCO installation, the major emphasis was to insure sufficient WTG electrical torque during wind gusts in low power output periods. Subsequent use of constant PF control demonstrated an adequacy of performance equivalent to that of constant var control while constant voltage control indicated a diminished capacity to maintain synchronism with the utility, when compared to constant var or PF control.

The 150-kW wind turbine, designated MOD-OA by the U.S. Department of Energy is typically operated in parallel with two diesel generators to serve an average winter load of 350 kW. As part of an experimental program to evaluate wind turbine generator performance on the isolated diesel power system, the recordings from an extensive data measurement effort were reviewed and analyzed to define the nature of the dynamic interaction effects. The data were collected over a three-month period on the system to which the DOE/NASA experimental wind turbine was connected. During this time, the diesel units were lightly loaded resulting in up to 60% of the total load demand being supplied by the MOD-OA in periods of severely gusting winds. In three of the modes of normal MOD-OA operation -- startup synchronization, shutdown/cutout, and continuous fixed pitch running -power, frequency and voltage transients were comparable with those produced by typical load changes on the diesel system alone. In the fourth mode, variable pitch (constant power) control, a significant reduction in system damping sometimes occurred which gave rise to increased frequency and voltage perturbations under gusty wind conditions. Based on a linear model of the system it is shown that changes in control system settings could be made to improve damping. The main study conclusion is that wind turbine generation, even when providing a large portion of the power required by an isolated utility, can be a practical option resulting in system disturbances no greater than those found in conventional diesel systems.","","","Advanced Systems Technology, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Pittsburgh, PA","","","United States","1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The use of a dc machine as a generator to recover the energy and as a motor to start the engine, allows simplified power electronics. The architecture of the control unit is built to ensure four different functions: starting, optimization of the recoverable energy, regulation of the speed, and braking. An experimental study of the system in a wind tunnel allowed us to optimize the coefficients of the proportional and integral (pi) control algorithm. We found that the electrical energy recovery was much more efficient using our feedback system than without the control unit. This system allows a better characterization of the wind turbine and a regulation adapted to the wind statistics observed in one given geographical location.","","","Groupe de Microelectronique, Institut d'Electronique Fondamentale, Bat. 220, Universite Paris-Sud, 91405, Orsay Cedex, France","","","United States","1984-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Rev.

This model, called System Analysis Model (SAM), employs the Monte-Carlo technique to incorporate quantifiable uncertainties. Explicit uncertainties in SAM include: hydro conditions, load forecast errors, construction duration, availability of thermal units, renewable resources (wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass), cogeneration, and conservation. This paper presents an approach to modeling renewable resources, especially wind energy availability. Due to randomness of wind velocity at a wind site, and randomness from one site to another, it is important to have a model of uncertain wind energy availability. The model starts with historical hourly wind data at each site in the area covered by the Pacific Northwest Power Act (7). Using wind data, machine and site characteristics, along with Justus, et al. time series model for simulating hourly wind power, hourly energy for each site is calculated.

Calculations were made using the complete Glauert vortex blade element theory in annular streamtube elements with the complete turbine performance being the sum of the elemental results up to a specified tip speed ratio. The objective here is to exhibit a new computational technique which yields performance directly when tangential speed ratio and section aerodynamic characteristics are specified. It was found that for a tip speed ratio of 4, turbines with drag/lift ratios of 0.00 and 0.01 had power coefficients of 0.575 and 0.55, respectively. The off-design performance of the finite drag/lift was far better than that of their zero drag counterparts, except in a + or - 20% region about the design conditions. Tolerance to off-design operation increased with decreasing tip speed ratios so that the annual energy capture for tip speed ratios between 2 and 4 was about 87% of the ideal turbine value. The results are intended to provide a basis for re-evaluation of the power range classes of fixed pitch turbines and design tip speed ratios.","","","California State University at Fullerton, Fullerton, California","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Since the power density in moving air (wind) varies as the cube of the wind speed, the power output of a wind energy system will have wide variations similar to the variations in the wind speed. To provide a reliable supply (electrical, mechanical, or thermal) to consumers, one has to employ some type of energy storage and reconversion system to smooth out the variations and supply energy during calm periods. The articale shows how energy can be stored in mechanical, chemical, thermal, or electrical (electromagnetic) form. Discussed are hydrofirming (in conjunction with hydroelectric systems), pneumatic storage (under- or overground compressed air storage without fuel assist), compressed air storage (under- or overground with fuel assist), flywheels (kinetic energy), hydrogen storage (in compressed gaseous, cryogenic liquid, or hydride form), synthetic fuels and fertilizer (with nitrogen fixation), secondary batteries (electrochemical), and regenerative systems.

A vertical axis turbine which is located underneath the tower floor admits air vertically and exhausts it into the vortex core. The pressure drop in the vortex core can be high, depending upon the vortex concentration, thus enhancing manyfold the total pressure drop across the turbine. The power coefficient C /SUB p/ of this system depends mainly on how low a pressure can be created in the vortex core. A maximum C /SUB p/ of about 2.5 was obtained by Yen for a spiral shaped tower. This is about 6.25 times the C /SUB p/ of conventional windmills. Analytical studies have been carried out by several investigators to study the C /SUB p/ of this vortex machine.

Preliminary designs are described for three DAWT sizes (ratings) in each of three construction approaches: all-aluminum, ferrocement, and a hybrid fiberglass reinforced plastics (FRP) diffuser shell on an aluminum frame. Common design criteria are employed in designs for these three materials. Installed cost estimates are generated by professional industrial estimators. Excluding the foundation, it is concluded that for geometrically similar DAWTs the weight-to-power ratio varies approximately as the rotor diameter to the one third power, over a 4 to 1 change in rotor diameter, 2.7-11 m (9-36 ft). Furthermore, because the total direct production cost of these various DAWT units and designs proves to change by about D /SUP 3/2/ , the cost-to-power ratio is approximately proportional to D /SUP -1/2/ and the cost/weight ratio varies as D /SUP -1/6/ . Therefore, for the investigated DAWT unit ratings between 5 and 200 kW, the larger units appear increasingly to become more efficient structures with apparently lower specific costs (dollars per kW) for each of three candidate construction approaches.","","","Research and Development Center, Grumman Aerospace Corporation, Bethpage, NY","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This is followed by the performance data on a larger, self-starting, two-stage model operating in conjunction with several different pumps. Results suggest that the two-stage configuration with a projected blade area of 1.12 m/sup 2/ is capable of delivering 250 L/hr to a head of 4 m at a windspeed of around 16 km/hr using a gear pump. The performance appears quite promising, and a prototype is being designed to meet the objective.

This maximum appears independent of sigma and there are values of T and alpha/sub 0/ for which the speed through the disk becomes complex and the model breaks down. Extending this model to a tandem disk system leads to a difficulty in defining the power coefficient. Attempts to optimize the system output based on reference areas A/sub 1/, A/sub 2/, and A/sub 4/ prove futile and the sum of the coefficients is chosen for this purpose. For thin blades and zero drag the analytic solution is available and it shows that the maximum value of 2 X 0.593 is attained over a narrow range of slightly negative alpha/sub 0/ (blade nose in) and medium values of T. The maximum is independent of sigma. As T is increased, the model breaks down either after C /SUB psum/ becomes large and negative or after backflow through the downwind disk occurs. There appears to be no requirement on load distribution between the disks. By comparison, modeling a machine with NACA 0012 blades at Re = 1.34 X 10/sup 6/ shows that the maximum value of C /SUB psum/ depends on the solidity. For example, at sigma = 0.4, the maximum value of C /SUB psum/ is 83% of 2 X 0.593. At such high values of sigma, however, the ranges of alpha/sub 0/ and T over which solutions are available become very limited.","","","The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast","","","United States","1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

An analysis of wind generation change from an echelon and a farm for passage of a thunderstorm is presented to establish the factors concerning the wind turbine model and siting configuration that contribute to these variations. Detailed simulation results indicate more precisely how these factors can be exploited to minimize the WECS generation changes observed. Reduction of the wind generation change over ten minutes is shown to reduce the increase in spinning reserve, unloadable generation and load following requirements on unit commitment when significant WECS generation is present and the farm penetration constraint is satisfied. Controls on the blade pitch angle of all wind turbines in an array or a battery control are shown to reduce both the wind generation change out of an array and the effective farm penetration in anticipation of a storm so that the farm penetration constraint may be satisfied.","","","Michigan State Univ., E.

The 150-kW wind turbine, designated MOD-OA by the U.S. Department of Energy is typically operated in parallel with two diesel generators to serve an average winter load of 350 kW. Wind generation serves up to 60% of the system demand depending on wind speed and total system load. Results of diesel fuel consumption measurements are given for the diesel units operated in parallel with the wind turbine and again without the wind turbine. The fuel consumption data are used to calculate the amount of fuel displaced by wind energy. Results indicate that the wind turbine displaced 25,700 lbs. of the diesel fuel during the test period, representing a calculated reduction in fuel consumption of 6.7% while generating 11% of the total electrical energy. The amount of displaced fuel depends on operating conditions and system load. It is also shown that diesel engine throttle activity resulting from wind gusts which rapidly change the wind turbine output do not significantly influence fuel consumption.","","","Advanced Systems Tech., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, PA","","","United States","1983-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

A comparison is made of the rotor performance for several blade geometries (parabola, catenary, troposkien, and Sandia shape). A new formulation is given for an approximate troposkien shape by considering the effect of the gravitational field. The effects of three NACA symmetrical profiles, 0012, 0015 and 0018, on the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are shown.

The original DMS model has been improved (DMSV model) by considering the variation in the upwind and downwind induced velocities as a function of the azimuthal angle for each streamtube. A comparison is made of the rotor performance for several blade geometries (parabola, catenary, troposkien, and Sandia shape). A new formulation is given for an approximate troposkien shape by considering the effect of the gravitational field. The effects of three NACA symmetrical profiles, 0012, 0015 and 0018, on the aerodynamic performance of the turbine are shown. Finally, a semiempirical dynamic-stall model has been incorporated and a better approximation obtained for modeling the local aerodynamic forces and performance for a Darrieus rotor.","","","Institut de recherche d'Hydro-Quebec (IREQ) Varennes, Quebec","","","United States","1983-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Recently, a new concept for wind energy conversion based on aeroelastic instability was introduced. It is well known that couplings between the vibration of an elastic structure and fluid stream may lead to aeroelastic instability. Energy then is transferred from the airstream into the elastic structure, which results in a destructive monotonic increase of the vibration amplitude of the structure. The failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge is one of the well-known examples of such a disaster. The use of an aeroelastic instability (or flutter) mechanism for constructing a wind energy converter was suggested. The theory for a torsional wind energy converter and the results of some model tests were also presented. Recently, some studies on similar types of wind energy converters using oscillating airfoils were reported. In the present study an angular flange H-section model of a torsional aeroelastic wind energy converter is constructed, and its performances under various conditions are investigated. The effects of the variations of the flange angle and the flange width on the performance of the model are studied. The weight of the pendulum is also varied, and its effects on the power coefficient of the model are investigated. It is observed that the efficiency of energy conversion decreases with an increase in wind speed. A method for possible improvement of the theoretical prediction is suggested and discussed.","","","Clarkson College of Technology, Potsdam, New York","","","United States","1983-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This type of rotor was found capable of high yaw rates without imposing vibratory hub moments and without producing noticeable flapping amplitudes. Experiments were conducted with a tail vane stabilized 7.6-m-diam wind rotor driving a three-phase alternator tuned and loaded to produce a rotor torque proportional to the square of the rotor speed. Two yaw control systems which replaced the usual blade feathering controls were investigated: an active yaw control system using a hydraulic rotor speed governor, and a passive system responding to a combination of rotor thrust and torque. During strong gusts both systems limited rotor speed quite accurately. The passive system appeared to be more promising because of its greater reliability and because of the greater ease of adapting it to larger size wind turbines.","","","Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri","","","United States","1983-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Lift, drag, and moment coefficients were measured for two blades whose angle of attack and chord-to-radius ratio were varied. The first blade used an NACA 0015 airfoil section; the second used a 15% elliptical cross section with a modified circular arc trailing edge. Blade aerodynamic coefficients were corrected to section coefficients for comparison to published rectilinear flow data. Although the airfoil sections were symmetrical, moment coefficients were not zero and the lift and drag curves were asymmetrical about zero lift coefficient and angle of attack. These features verified the predicted virtual camber and incidence phenomena. Boundary-layer centrifugal effects were manifested by discontinuous lift curves and large differences in the angle of zero lift between th NACA 0015 and elliptical airfoils.

The tower serves as a low pressure exhaust for the turbine. The author carried out a numerical solution of the tower flow, using the two-equation (kappa-epsilon) turbulence model, for the small size system tested by Yen, with a 0.127-m- (5-in.-) diam tower standing in a uniform wind flow. A comparison of the results with the measured pressure values verified the model. In the present work the same numerical model is used for a system with a tower that is completely embedded in an atmospheric boundary layer. The results show, for a tower in a boundary layer of the one-seventh power-law profile, about a 28% reduction of the values of power coefficient from those for a tower in a uniform stream. Calculations for the performance of a system with different tower heights and the same tower and turbine diameters show a sharp decrease of power for H/D less than or equal to 0.5. Analysis of the tangential velocity shows that the vortex should be maintained up to heights /ZETA//D less than or equal to 0.9 to avoid the decrease in power extraction. Numerical predictions are made for systems with tower diameters between 0.5 and 8 m (1.64 and 26.24 ft) using the same system geometry and approach flow conditions. The results show that the scale effect is negligible for systems of 4-m tower diameter or larger.","","","Faculty of Engineering at Shoubra, Cairo","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This method combines the effects of wind turbine forced outage rates and varying power output due to wind speed variations. Since individual wind turbines on a windfarm all have an output related to wind speed, each turbine's output cannot be assumed to be independent random variables. Because of this situation, special steps must be taken in order to arrive at the cumulative distribution function for the windfarm. This distribution function may be combined with the system distribution function using simple convolution and so the windfarm can be easily incorporated into a Loss of Load Expectation computer program. The method can then be used to determine the effective load carrying capability of a windfarm and also to supply better estimates of the benefits of wind generation to the overall system.","","","Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., Honolulu, Hawaii 96840","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The theoretical worst case change and rates of change of generation from an array of wind turbines due to passage of a thunderstorm front is given for a coastal farm. Constraints on the penetration of the portion of an echelon and farm that are affected by the front are derived so that power variation rates from a farm satisfying these constraints will not exceed the response rate capability of a typical system. These penetration constraints would eliminate the occurrence of excessive frequency excursions and violations of NAPSIC performance requirements on automatic generation control. The penetration constraints effect on the size of an array and the maximum power variation rates allowed on a particular system are discussed. The effects of simultaneous load and Wind Electric Conversion System (WECS) generation changes on automatic generation control, frequency regulation, and economic dispatch are then determined via simulation. It is shown that the total of load and WECS generation change in a ten minute interval must be less than load following capability for that period or a severe saturation problem occurs.","","","Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

A wind farm penetration constraint is determined, that limits worst case wind generation change from an array due to a thunderstorm to be less than the worst first contingency loss of conventional generation resource or commitment. The farm penetration constraint only acts as an indicator that additional spinning reserve, load following, and unloadable generation capability is required through adjustment of unit commitment and AGC controls if the farm penetration constraint was violated. A discussion of the methodology, costs, and benefits of changing unit commitment when WECS generation is significant (and either satisfies or violates this farm penetration constraint) is then discussed. A further discussion of the modification of regulation and economic dispatch controls to exploit the changes in response rate capability provided by the unit commitment is also discussed. A modified echelon penetration constraint that limits instantaneous rate of change and change from a wind array that must be handled by governor frequency regulation and regulation controls. This constraint is imposed to limit cycling of units which can incur additional operating and maintainance costs on conventional steam units and possibly safety concerns on nuclear units.","","","Mich.

Several thousand windmills are still used today to provide water for livestock and domestic needs. Because of the large water volume needed for irrigation, irrigators have selected natural gas, electricity, or diesel fuel as power sources for their irrigation pump. Wind turbines have been successfully used to generate electricity to supplement electrical requirements of irrigation systems; however, not all irrigation pumps have electricity readily available. Because of the need for an independent, high-volume pumping system powered by the wind, the USDA-ARS, Bushland, TX and the Alternative Energy Institute, Canyon, TX have designed and constructed a stand-alone wind-powered pumping system. The initial effort was an in-depth study of all types of pumps in order to locate a pump which could deliver a steady 15-to-20 l/s flow rate while the input power varied in rpm and torque. A progressive-cavity pump was selected as being best for use in moderate and deep well applications where the total head was more than 15 m. A 10-cm progressive-cavity pump was purchased and installed on a 4-kW vertical-axis wind turbine with a mechanical linkage between the wind turbine and pump. Performance data indicated that flow was 10 l/s, and head 12 m at a windspeed of 16 m/s. When the windspeed dropped to 9 m/s, the pumping load caused the wind turbine to stall. Because of the highly variable power output of the wind turbine, no presently-manufactured pump is satisfactory for stand-alone irrigation pumping.","","","USDA Conservation and Production Research Lab., Bushland, Texas","","","United States","1982-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ASAE Tech.

A vertical-axis wind turbine has its rotational axis perpendicular to the flow of wind and requires no orientation to keep the rotor in the windstream. The vertical-axis wind turbine operates on the same principle as an airfoil and produces lift and drag as any airfoil. A newly designed 100-kW vertical-axis wind turbine has been operated for one year at the USDA Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX. The turbine has an induction generator and supplies power to a sprinkler irrigation system with excess power being sold to the electric utility. The turbine begins producing power at 5.5 m/s windspeed and reaches its rated output of 100-kW at 15 m/s. The unit has obtained a peak efficiency of 48% at a windspeed of 8 m/s or 81% of theoretical maximum. Using 17 years of windspeed data from the National Weather Service, the annual energy output is estimated at 200,000 kWh. The unit has experienced several operational problems during its initial testing. Guy cables were enlarged to provide greater stiffness to reduce blade stress levels, lightning shorted the main contactor, and the brake system required a complete redesign and modification. The turbine was operational about 60% of the time.","","","USDA Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Bushland, Texas","","","United States","1982-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ASAE Tech.

This design minimized the cost of a cantilevered Darrieus and was suitable for testing purposes. All turbine components operated satisfactorily during testing, but the upper bearing and torque tube may fail after extended use. Performance characteristics of a variable-speed Darrieus were found by measuring wind speed, turbine torque, and turbine rotational speed, while the Darrieus operated. A hydraulic dynamometer was used to step-wise load the Darrieus to maintain high efficiencies. Performance curves were developed by using the statistical method of bins and multiple, least square regression analysis. Optimal performance for a variable-speed Darrieus system was determined and used to evaluate the turbine performance. Cantilevered support of the Darrieus was adequate for shaft rotational speeds less than 180 r/min. Vibrations due to a mass imbalance prevented the rotational speeds from being higher. Resonance conditions were detected at rotational speeds of 50 and possibly 180 r/min. The variable-speed system operated near the predicted optimal efficiency to a rotational speed of 120 r/min but above 120 r/min efficiencies decreased because the rotor was loaded down to prevent overspeeding and because of the inertial effect of the turbine. Variable-speed operation resulted in an efficiency of 31.8 percent. Efficiency of the variable-speed system would have been higher if the turbine had operated at higher rotational speeds and if a more optimal method of loading was used.","","","Agr. Eng.

Under local aerodynamic conditions a closed-form analytical solution is obtained for two functions, one for the upwind and one for the downwind hal of the turbine.

The method uses the terrain heights of an area surrounding the site and a series of wind and pressure reports from the nearest four or five National Weather Service stations. An initial estimate of the winds in the atmospheric boundary layer is made and these winds are then adjusted to satisfy the continuity equation. In this manner the flow is made to reflect the influences of the terrain and the shape of the boundary-layer top.","","","SRI International, Menlo Park, CA 94025","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Experimental results indicate that the confined vortex in the tower of TWECS rotates approximately as a solid body and only supplements total power production, most of which comes from the tower acting as a bluff body. Wrapped tower experiments were performed by fitting a plastic shroud 360 deg around the tower from the top of the bottom inlet to the tower exit level which transformed the TWECS into a hollow, raised cylinder. Coefficient of power is compared for louvered towers vs. wrapped tower. The fact that the wrapped tower performs as well as the louvered tower suggests that it is the pressure difference between the bottom inlet region and the region above the tower (where the pressure of the ambient flow will be somewhat reduced owing to its acceleration over the bluff body of the tower) which determines the vertical force on the fluid within the tower.","","","Department of Applied Science New York University, New York, NY","","","United States","1982-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The lack of an appropriate methodology to efficiently derive this modification has prevented inclusion of non-dispatchable technologies as decision variables in capacity expansion models. This paper develops a stochastic approach to load modification which explicitly models two types of interdependencies between load and non-dispatchable generation: through time of day and through weather. If more than one non-dispatchable generation technology is considered, the dependency among them is also modeled. Furthermore, the total as well as the marginal impact of non-dispatchable capacity on system reliability and operating cost is derived. This allows us to model non-dispatchable generation in the context of two broad classes of optimization algorithms. Dynamic programming and mathematical decomposition are considered in this paper as characteristic examples of algorithms in each class. Load modification models already in use derive total cost impact only, and are based on hourly chronological simulation which is a computationally cumbersome method. The methodology developed here provides marginal impact in addition to total impact values, is computationally efficient and is applicable to future demand projections at almost any level of detail. Finally, its accuracy proved very satisfactory when tested on 1975 Miami load and insolation data.","","","","","","United States","1982-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

As a financial bridge between utilities and new technology, their primary role is to raise capital. A spokesman for Windfarms considers the federal income tax credit for business investment and a DOE demonstration plant as essential for commercialization to succeed, but both are threatened by the administration.

The battery terminal voltage under load determines the discharge level. The system's design is adaptable to varying wind and load situations.

It is shown that this joint distribution reduces in the single site case to a wind speed distribution closely approximating the widely used Weibull; the multiple site power distribution is also shown to fit adequately to data on wind speeds from four sites in Western Australia. Results presented in graphical and tabular form for a range of representative cases show that a significant reduction in the variability of total wind power output results from dispersion of aerogenerator sites; a quantitive guide to the magnitude of these effects is also provided.","","","CSIRO Division of Mathematics and Statistics, P.O.

The most recent figures for solar thermal energy are encouraging. For 1980, 19.5 million square feet (msf) of solar collectors were produced, a 37% increase over 1979. Figures for the first six months of 1981 were 10.8 msf compared to 8.3 msf in 1980. About 60% of the collectors are for swimming pools, hot waters take another 21%, and space heating takes an additional 12%.

The energy generating home must be able to sell as well as purchase power from the local utility. This interface, a safe and reliable inverter, is described for homes capable of generating up to 10 kW of power. The problems and various approaches which have been used are discussed. Problems are intensified as the number of producers increases. The conversion of the direct current power (from photovoltaics or wind machines) to the suitable alternating current required is discussed. Three requirements considered are: (1) inversion of dc to ac; (2) regulation; and (3) waveshaping. Current work in the areas of reactive power, harmonics, control, and safety is described and wave forms are illustrated. Need for additional work in the utility-interactive systems area is stressed. 3 references.

For many of these technologies, insufficient historical data are available from which to assess the health risks and environmental impacts. However, their similarities to other projects make certain predictions possible, and some examples of these are discussed with respect to worker safety in the construction and operation of various systems. Satellite power systems have several unique risks. These include the effects of long-term space travel for construction workers, effects on the ozone layer and the attendant risk of skin cancer in the general public, and the as-yet-undetermined effects of long-term, low-level microwave exposure. Hazards may arise from three sources in solar heating and cooling systems: water contamination from corrosion inhibitors, heat transfer fluids, and bactericides; collector over-heating, fires, and ''out-gassing''; and handling and disposal of system fluids and wastes. Similar concerns exist for solar thermal power systems. Even passive solar systems may increase indoor exposure levels to various air pollutants and toxic substances.

From simulation experiments using different strengths and time delays of the secondary signals relative to the primary signal at the receiver, a criterion has been established for interference that is unacceptable for extended periods of viewing. For a given TV transmission and given wind turbine, the interference zone can be computed by considering the propagation conditions. Small wind turbines of a few kilowatts capacity are found to produce interference with zones extending only a few tens of feet. The effect of a large wind turbine on other electromagnetic systems has been investigated, including aircraft navigational radars and Loran-C, which are relatively insensitive to interference.

Which ones should be given preference, and which ones will give the quickest, most economic return on investment. The exploration of converting potential plant life to energy is already underway. One such plant is the milkweed. The milky latex substance of the weed contains 30% hydrocarbon and 70% water. About 7% to 10% of the plant weight is extractable crude oil. The unused plant residue can be processed to produce alcohol. In Utah, a milkweed project yielded 2.5 pounds of oil from 35 lbs. of milkweed. The California Commission is looking into the possibility of using two million tons of rice straw, now left in the fields to be burned. The basic thrust of geothermal activity is still the dry steam plants in the Geyser field in California, but the movement to develop more prevalent hot water persists. Binary production and the use of moderate hot water are gaining in acceptance. The government's goal for wind for the year 2000 is 2% of total energy usage. Both utility and consumer participation will be required to meet that goal. Utilities will have to install 20,000 to 30,000 large-scale machines and nearly 1 million would have to be installed by consumers for homes and farms. Movement is already underway.","","","","","","United States","1981-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy (Stamford, Conn.); (United States)","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 30-31","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENGYD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6315639","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6315639","","Energy (Stamford, Conn.); (United States)","",""

There is also a growing effort in the private sector to produce and market wind machines, but the major effort is in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-DOE projects.

Until pending legislation that will increase tax credits for commercial investors in alternative energy sources is passed, the per-kilowatt-hour cost barrier remains too high in some areas. Guarantees to purchase surplus power from wind machines were included in the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1978 to improve the economics. Other cost factors are wind speed, the need to find favorable installation sites, and public reluctance to risk unproven technologies. Experiments with vertical-axis wind turbines, which can accept wind from any direction and are self-regulating, are expected to provide a persuasive demonstration.

Multi-wing types are suited to drive pumps, and propeller types are suited for wind-power generation. Since the wind varies in time with respect to its speed and direction, a windmill of any type should be controlled in rotation speed and/or direction. To realize this, auxiliary blades or other wind speed or direction detectors are combined with controllers of the windmills.

Wind power research projects range from the already commercially available 200-kilovolt (kV) range to the 2,000-kV unit being tested in Boone, NC. Because economies of scale may not be applicable to wind systems, the recommended aproaches are for a large number of widely scattered windmills and for the construction of large arrays on energy farms.

The three issues which determine whether and when an environmental impact statement is required can be summarized as follows: (1) is there a recommendation or report on a proposal for (2) Federal action (3) that is major and will significantly affect the environment. A lively awareness of how NEPA works serves two important functions. First, an agency or individual attuned to the requirements of NEPA is more likely to take the necessary procedural steps to comply with the statute and less likely to see a worthwhile project mired in litigation, as lawyers quarrel over the precise meaning of a federal or significant action. Second, the process of preparing an environmental assessment (and, if necessary, an environmental impact statement) can serve important ends. By forcing project proponents to confront the full range of possible environmental impacts, balance competing values and search out mitigating actions, NEPA promotes decision making by federal agencies which will be environmentally more sensitive and ultimately more wise. Wind may well be one of the most environmentally sound energy alternatives available. Nevertheless, as the inventories of impacts in this article illustrate, even wind energy has its environmental effects.","","","","","","United States","1979-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sol.

Only the two-rotor interference problem is considered. The windmill performance is obtained from momentum theory with the approach velocity of the blanketed part of the rotor assumed to correspond to the fully developed wake velocity of the upstream windmill. It is shown that wake interference between windmills in a closely spaced array strongly degrades system performance, the power output varying cosine-like from interference-free to fully blanketed operation. Performance improvement results from a more favorable distribution of the kinetic energy of the impinging air over each rotor of the array.","","","Aerospace Corp., El Segundo, CA","","","United States","1979-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The rotor assembly is mounted on a steel turntable so that the rotor is always perpendicular to the wind direction. The sail assembly contains three dacron sails with an arrangement for automatic feathering and furling. Power is transferred along the rotating axle through a pair of commercial bearings. Five distinct stroke settings are provided by holes drilled at different radiations on the adjustable crank disc. From the disc, the power is carried down a wooden lattice tower (8 m) along a 7.6-cm diameter shaft to a diaphragm tire pump at ground level. The windmill discharges 3.3 liter/50-mm stroke at a 13- to 15-km windspeed.

In the energy assessment, two thermodynamic concepts were developed: that no mechanical work can be performed without the use of matter in bulk, and that no closed system can perform mechanical work at a constant rate idefinitely. Developed from these concepts is the statement that, for a technology such as solar energy to be viable, it must be capable of reproducing itself after being established by the technology now in use. Mathematical models developed from these concepts were used to assess the viability of the direct use of solar energy. These models incorporate the flow matrix of technology based on direct use of solar energy, collectors produced by solar energy, the capital equipment produced by solar energy, and the actual case of solar schemes. It was concluded that the direct use of solar energy in outer space where intensity is greater, may be feasible but that fossil fuels are more easily utilized.","","","","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Atl.

The combination of these energy sources into an integrated and optimized system has the potential for supplying a major portion of the future energy requirements of Oregon, Idaho, Washington, western Montana and northeastern Nevada.The objective of the Pacific Northwest Wind Regional Energy Assessment Program (PNW WIND-REAP) is to identify areas of high wind-power density and develop an order-of-magnitude estimate of the maximum installed capacity, seasonal and annual energy and possible firm capacity available to the region from wind power when integrated with the Columbia River hydroelectric system. This paper presents an assessment of the potential resource and is not a recommended plan of implementation since obvious nontechnical considerations, i.e., institutional, environmental, aesthetics, etc., must be included in the final decision-making process before sites could be selected and technical specifications for wind energy conversion systems be prepared, ordered and installed.This resource assessment is being accomplished by installing wind data recording stations in those areas which, because of topography, signs of flagging or carpeted vegetation, and/or soil erosion provide evidence of strong or persistent winds. In addition to national weather service stations, 33 active data stations, ranging from strip chart recorders to simple wind run recorders, are currently functional.The proven wind energy resources are concentrated in several regions in the Pacific Northwest, namely, the coastal zone of Oregon and Washington and the adjoining offshore waters, the Columbia River Gorge and adjacent ridge tops running from central Washington to just east of Portland, and portions of northeastern Nevada.","","","Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331","","","United States","1978-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Application of modern boundary-layer control techniques has reduced the surface area requirements of an efficient diffuser by an order of magnitude. Many parameters that affect the performance of the diffuser system have been examined in small-scale wind tunnel tests with a family of compact diffusers, using screens and centerbodies to simulate the presence of a turbine. Flowfield surveys, overall performance, the effect of ground proximity, and the prospects for further improvement are described. The baseline configuration is a conical, 60 deg included angle diffuser with an area ratio of 2.78 controlled by two tangential injection slots. This first-generation DAWT can provide about twice the power of a conventional WECS with the same turbine diameter and wind. Economic estimates show that this DAWT can be as much as 50% cheaper than coventional WECS for the same rated power.","","","Grumman Aerospace Corp.

A 1000-hr inspection of a windmill at Clayton, N. Mex. disclosed, e.g., loose and missing rivets and propellor-blade cracks due to deficiencies in the design and construction of the yaw mechanism. The DOE wind-systems division has repaired the damage and plans three new machines for testing at Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Block Island, R.I. Transport problems and cable-television interference will increase the already high costs at the Block Island site. The restriction of sites to those with extraordinary winds is criticized by some who contend that most of the energy is extracted in the 10 to 35 mile per hour range. A wind project conducted by the New England Telephone Co. on Block Island was cancelled after running into problems of noise and a breakdown in the servo mechanism. The basic technology and configuration of wind systems are felt to be sound, leaving economics the only major problem to be solved.","","","","","","United States","1978-10-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Res.

The wind averages from 400 to 700 watts per square meter where on land in New England the wind averages only about 150 watts per square meter. William E. Heronemus proposed such a design in 1972. He also proposed that power from thousands of these units could be converted to hydrogen at sea and part of the hydrogen could be put aside for windless periods in expandable storage tanks under the pressure of the deep sea and it would all be conducted ashore by pipeline, either to be used directly or to be converted into electric power stored in fuel cells. Private and Federal land-based windmill projects are discussed. The present rejection of offshore wind power as an important energy resource for the near future stands squarely on DOE's economic perceptions, not on lack of technical feasibility. The commercial costs of these units are important for the prospects of offshore wind power in two ways - they are so much lower than the costs the DOE has been experiencing for its windmills in gentler winds and the 40-kW windmills will probably soon be in production in at least limited quantities, making it possible to construct a floating offshore demonstration unit using some of these tested turbines. Harvesting the strong offshore winds involves the extra cost of floatation and mooring, but does not require the expensive yaw mechanism that keeps a land-based unit facing the wind.","","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst","","","United States","1978-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environment; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-20","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENVTA","10.1080/00139157.1978.9933081","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6046094","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6046094","","Environment; (United States)","","20:8"

Two laboratory-scale models were constructed, instrumented, and tested in a specially modified section of the NYU 30-m wind tunnel at freestream velocities (U/sub infinity/) of 0 to 15.4 m/s (0 to 34.5 mph) and blade diameter Reynolds numbers (Re/sub D/) of 0.5-3.7 x 10/sup 5/. At all U/sub infinity/ the shaft rotation rate decreased nearly linearly with applied load. However, the (no-load tip speed)/(U/sub infinity/) ratio X/sub 0/ and the torque coefficient at zero rotation were found to be Re/sub D/-dependent, with X/sub 0/ first decreasing for Re/sub D/ <2 x 10/sup 5/ and then increasing (presumably, X/sub 0/ levels off at about 1.0 at the end of the transitional regime).

Based on this theory, a parabolic correlation for the power coefficient based on projected blade frontal area is found.

Results are given for both parallel-axis and curved-blade configurations. Blade stall and variable inflow are neglected; it is hypothesized that unsteady effects support the former approximation down to lower values of tip-speed ratio than hitherto believed. Both profile and induced drag are included, and their influences on power and downwind force are expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. Comparisons are presented with power data from the Sandia 2-m turbine. Three values of profile drag coefficient are employed, and it is argued that numbers in the range C/sub D/sub 0// approx. = 0.015 to 0.017 are most appropriate to the example chosen. Finally, a linearized analysis of unsteady flow effects on performance is summarized. Calculations suggest that they may be larger than might be expected in view of the low operating reduced frequencies of these machines.","","","Stanford Univ., CA","","","United States","1978-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

However, it was discovered empirically that the specific output of windmills is practically independent of their location on the earth, or of the mean annual wind velocity. It depends instead on the ratio of the rated speed V/sub r/, the wind speed at which full rating is realized, to the mean annual wind velocity V/sub m/. This is demonstrated by data from many designs and wind-power sites. The resulting curve of specific output versus V/sub r//V/sub m/, together with the fundamental formula for power extracted from the wind by a windmill constitutes a useful approximate design and optimizing method. Examples are given.","","","","","","United States","1977-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proc.

Reasonably reliable and accurate estimates of the mean seasonal wind can be obtained in one or two years for the sites analyzed.Autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis confirms the existence of significant correlation in the wind at a single site for a period of 8--12 h and between sites for similar time lags and separations up to 100 km or more. Meaningful prediction of variation from the mean appears possible in these cases. The diurnal cycle effect is seen to depend significantly on season and elevation.","","","Department of Civil Engineering, The Technological Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill. 60201","","","United States","1977-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Shore-based and sea-based devices have been invented. Three types of the more practical sea-based devices are flapping plates, floating rafts, and air bells. Much further work needs to be done before the technical and economic viability can be reliably assessed. There are other possible methods of harnessing solar energy by using the sea. Ocean currents could be used to drive turbines in a manner analogous to wind generation. Another possible way of generating electricity is to use the difference in salt concentration between fresh water and sea water where rivers enter the sea to drive a voltaic cell. The method of power generation, explored 50 years ago, is to make use of the temperature difference between the depths of the ocean and the surface to drive a heat engine. Of the many ideas that have been proposed for harnessing the tides, barrage schemes offer the best prospects for economic power generation. Tidal power cannot contribute much to global power generation due to the number of limited sites and uncertainties in costs and feasibility of large schemes.

The exact relationship between the mean wind speed and the mean of the cube of the wind speed is discussed. The Weibull probability density function, a good model for wind speed distributions, leads to a Weibull model for the distribution of the cube of the wind speed. This model facilitates the computation of the mean and the standard deviation of the total wind power density, the usable wind power density, and the wnd power density during the hours when an aerogenerator is operating. The Weibull model is applied to data from three Oregon wind power sites located in rugged terrain. It is concluded that the mean and standard deviation of the wind speed are the minimum statistics necessary for wind power estimates, that the Weibull model for the wind power density has many computational advantages, and that the existing wind power studies based solely on the total mean wind power density omit much valuable information about the wind power potential of a site.","","","Department of Atmospheric Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis 97331","","","United States","1977-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Windmills have been in use over 2000 years, and have been vital to such endeavors as western irrigation. Failures of past large-scale projects are under study and new designs are sought to overcome problems of stress, erratic wind, energy storage, and esthetics. Since the wind is free, inexhaustible, and non-polluting, a national effort to overcome technological and economic problems is justified. Windmills, which are rated on output per unit capital cost rather than efficiency, can be improved by extracting more power from the wind or by making the machines less costly. A two-blade propeller can deliver 3000 to 3500 megawatt-hours a year, with 100,000 wind generators capable of supplying 15 percent of the U.S. electricity. Near-future applications for wind energy are small- and large-volume water pumping, battery chargers in remote locations, and supplementary sources for power grids. The search for suitable windmill sites could be alleviated with better instruments to integrate wind speed. An incentive program similar to that used for uranium prospecting could locate new sites overlooked by bureaucratic surveys. A subsidy to windmill users might be a better government approach than the construction of expensive prototypes. 8 references.

Wind energy is widely available but irregular and variable, the basic problem being storage. Tidal and wave power are of practical interest only to large electricity supply organizations; wave power is more of a conventional base-load energy source for which storage is needed if the full potential is to be realized; an expanded tidal scheme could provide this storage because it is complementary to any primary source. Estuaries like the Severn provide suitable conditions--pumping at night combined with an intermittent tidal input can give steady daytime output to meet up to 30 percent of the present maximum excess of daytime over night load; no other storage is needed for either source. This would reduce by 40 percent the amount of thermal plant operating by day and would lower total thermal generating capacity by 10 percent. Technical and economic constraints are present for geothermal energy, but the total heat content under Britain is enough to supply all her energy needs at present consumption rates, for 20,000 years. Solar energy is by far the most versatile of the renewable sources. Thermal applications for space heating, hot water heating, and electricity generation through solar thermal power cycles are well known. Solar cells are potentially an attractive means of generating electricity for all sectors (except transportation) because they have no running costs or moving parts and no waste products. The present capital cost is too high to be competitive. The economics of the development of all the alternative sources is summarized.

Technological, economic, budgetary, and institutional factors have been named as key impediments slowing the pace of contribution of solar-electric technologies to the generation of electric energy. In this article, the budgetary and developmental targets of various solar-electric technologies are examined--namely, wind, photovoltaic, solar-thermal, ocean-thermal, and satellite power generation--in comparison with other technologies that are expected to contribute significantly, in the long term, to the generation of electric power. The present status and problems of some of the solar-electric technologies are also addressed. According to projections by ERDA, by 1985 solar power will account for 0.07 percent of the entire energy consumption of the U.S. ERDA's requested budget for fiscal year (FY) 1977, as well as its developmental program for solar energy and other, long-term technologies, show a marked emphasis on nuclear technologies such as breeder reactors and fusion. Although, in terms of absolute figures, the total solar-energy budget has increased greatly--from near zero in 1971 to the $160 million requested by ERDA for FY 1977--there is a general feeling that the program is moving too slowly in terms of the individual budgets allotted to various solar-energy technologies, including those intended for the generation of electricity.

Some have offered to provide sites, control rooms, and personnel for the testing of the Plum Brook wind turbine-generators (WTGs) developed by the Energy Research and Development Administration. Under ERDA sponsorship, NASA designed the 100-kW WTG, currently the largest in the world, and started construction in September 1975. Plans are now in progress for 200-kW units, 500-kW units, and later a 1.5-MW unit. Results of a study on comparative capital costs using data at Northwest Utilities are presented, but economic factors will vary from utility to utility. Some financial data from the Plum Brook WTG indicates its cost is five times higher than utilities can afford to pay. Near New Bedford, Mass., (Cuttyhunk Island), the world's largest working WTG will provide 40 to 50 percent of the small community..nu..s power in 1976. The Cuttyhunk Island WTG is an updated version of the Danish Gedser Mill, and is rated at 200-kW capacity for a wind velocity of 28 mph. It will deliver power at a lower cost per kWh than the diesel-electric system.

The proven technological feasibility of using large-scale wind turbines to produce electricity, combined with the vast amount of potential energy available, give this source its attractiveness. Given the diffuse and capricious nature of the wind, however, the actualization of this potential becomes constrained by economic considerations. The costs of both base-load and supplementary wind systems are examined.

The schemes can be generally classified as constant speed constant frequency(CSCF) and variable speed constant frequency (VSCF) systems. Historically, only CSCF systems have been used for large power generation in wind power plants. However, with the advent of power electronics and the availability of solid state devices capable of handling large amounts of power, VSCF systems are becoming competitive. Various schemes under each classification are discussed and compared. (auth)","","","","","","United States","1975-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans. Aerosp.

The operation of the Smith-Putnam generator in Vermont from October 1941 to March 1945 marked the first synchronous generation of power from the wind. In 1951, Congress refused to appropriate funds for a prototype project. A windmill charges the batteries of a small experimental ''Urban Car'' with a range of 25 miles at the University of Oklahoma. In 1972, it was predicted that by the year 2000, about 19 percent of the U.S. energy requirements could be supplied by windpower utilized in windy areas. A workshop on Wind Energy Conversion Systems in 1973 sought to assess the present state of the art of wind energy systems technology and recommended concrete directions. The workshop was then divided into four committees and recommendations were provided for: wind characteristics and siting, rotor characteristics, energy storage and energy conversion systems, and applications. The NASA research programs on wind energy utilization are described.
