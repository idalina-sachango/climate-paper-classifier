"Validation of turbulence intensity as simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model off the US northeast coast","Tai, Sheng-Lun; Berg, Larry K.; Krishnamurthy, Raghavendra; Newsom, Rob; Kirincich, Anthony","17 WIND ENERGY","We report turbulence intensity (TI) is often used to quantify the strength of turbulence in wind energy applications and serves as the basis of standards in wind turbine design. Thus, accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal variability in TI should lead to improved predictions of power production. Nevertheless, turbulence measurements over the ocean are far less prevalent than over land due to challenges in instrumental deployment, maintenance, and operation. Atmospheric models such as mesoscale (weather prediction) and large-eddy simulation (LES) models are commonly used in the wind energy industry to assess the spatial variability of a given site. However, the TI derivation from atmospheric models has not been well examined. An algorithm is proposed in this study to realize online calculation of TI in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Simulated TI is divided into two components depending on scale, including sub-grid (parameterized based on turbulence kinetic energy (TKE)) and grid resolved. The sensitivity of sea surface temperature (SST) on simulated TI is also tested. An assessment is performed by using observations collected during a field campaign conducted from February to June 2020 near the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. Results show that while simulated TKE is generally smaller than the lidar-observed value, wind speed bias is usually small. Overall, this leads to a slight underestimation in sub-grid-scale estimated TI. Improved SST representation subsequently reduces model biases in atmospheric stability as well as wind speed and sub-grid TI near the hub height. Large TI events in conjunction with mesoscale weather systems observed during the studied period pose a challenge to accurately estimating TI from models. Due to notable uncertainty in accurately simulating those events, this suggests summing up sub-grid and resolved TI may not be an ideal solution. Efforts in further improving skills in simulating mesoscale flow and cloud systems are necessary as the next steps.","Copernicus Publications","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Using observational mean-flow data to drive large-eddy simulations of a diurnal cycle at the SWiFT site","Allaerts, Dries; Quon, Eliot; Churchfield, Matt","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric boundary layer; diurnal cycle; large-eddy simulation; low-level jet; mesoscale-to-microscale coupling; profile assimilation; SWiFT","Reproducing realistic date- and site-specific unsteady wind conditions in large-eddy simulations is becoming increasingly useful in wind energy. How to run a large-eddy simulation to match observed conditions, however, remains an open research question. One approach that has received considerable attention is mesoscale-to-microscale coupling, in which information about the mesoscale weather, most commonly acquired from a mesoscale numerical weather model, is passed on to a microscale model. In this paper, we demonstrate how the recently developed profile-assimilation technique, a form of mesoscale-to-microscale coupling, can be used to drive large-eddy simulations solely based on observed mean-flow profiles at a single location, bypassing the need for auxiliary mesoscale simulations. The new approach is evaluated for a diurnal cycle at the Scaled Wind Farm Technology site. Observed mean-flow profiles from the ground up to a height of 2 km are reconstructed by aggregating measurements from multiple instruments, and gaps in the data are infilled with natural neighbor interpolation. We perform nine simulations using various forcing approaches to deal with data limitations. The results show that it is indeed possible to drive microscale large-eddy simulation with observations using the profile-assimilation technique, notwithstanding large gaps in virtual potential temperature measurements. However, profile assimilation with vertical smoothing of the error between the desired and actual profiles is required. Without that smoothing, the microscale simulations develop unrealistically high turbulence levels under many situations. Finally, we show that simulated mesoscale data can account for missing observations, although care is needed as both data sources are not necessarily compatible.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A decoupled approach is employed where global analysis is performed first. Second, the load effects from the global analysis are applied on a reference pitch bearing designed based on best industrial practices. For the case study onshore site, it is found that the Kernel density estimation best fits the wind distribution, while the International Electrotechnical Commission proposed distribution appears to be not suitable. Moreover, it is shown that the seed number has high effect on the bearing life in turbulence wind and the wind speeds around rated have the highest contribution in both bearing fatigue damage and extreme load failure. The results contribute to better understanding of the wind field characteristics on the pitch bearing life.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Enabling Floating Offshore VAWT Design by Coupling OWENS and OpenFAST","Devin, Michael C.; Mendoza, Nicole R.; Platt, Andrew; Moore, Kevin; Jonkman, Jason; Ennis, Brandon L.","17 WIND ENERGY; floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT); FOWT; hydrodynamics; OpenFAST; OWENS; VAWT; vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT)","Vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs) have a long history, with a wide variety of turbine archetypes that have been designed and tested since the 1970s. While few utility-scale VAWTs currently exist, the placement of the generator near the turbine base could make VAWTs advantageous over tradition horizontal-axis wind turbines for floating offshore wind applications via reduced platform costs and improved scaling potential. However, there are currently few numerical design and analysis tools available for VAWTs. One existing engineering toolset for aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation of VAWTs is the Offshore Wind ENergy Simulator (OWENS), but its current modeling capability for floating systems is non-standard and not ideal. This article describes how OWENS has been coupled to several OpenFAST modules to update and improve modeling of floating offshore VAWTs and discusses the verification of these new capabilities and features. The results of the coupled OWENS verification test agree well with a parallel OpenFAST simulation, validating the new modeling and simulation capabilities in OWENS for floating VAWT applications. These developments will enable the design and optimization of floating offshore VAWTs in the future.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By revisiting the fundamental physics which drive these systems, potential issues in existing models have been identified. Furthermore, in pure rolling conditions it was found that governing differential equations become ""stiff"", requiring the use of implicit methods of time integration. The problem of individual roller macro slip in a wind turbine main bearing is then investigated using a simplified representation of system dynamics. Model results indicate clear links between slip/friction and the operational strategy of the wind turbine, as well as significantly higher frictional effects in the downwind main bearing row. Due to modelling simplifications, these results should not yet be considered conclusive, with further work required.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Comparisons are also made with the top-down model with entrance effects of Meneveau ( <italic>J. Turbul.</italic> , vol. 13, 2012, N7) and data from the literature. The finite-length entrainment model is shown to be capable of capturing the power drop between contiguous rows of turbines as well as describing the advection and turbulent transport of kinetic energy in both the entrance and fully developed regions. The fully developed regime is approximated only deep in the wind farm, after approximately 15 rows of turbines. Our data suggest that for the cases considered in this study, the empirical coefficients that can be used to describe turbulent entrainment and transfers above the wind farm exhibit little dependence on the farm layout and may be considered constant for modelling purposes. However, the flow field within the wind farm layer can be strongly modulated by the turbine density (spacing) as well as the array layout, and to that extent it can be argued that they are both primary factors determining the wind farm power output. </p>","Cambridge University Press (CUP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind turbines are designed using a set of simulations to determine the fatigue and ultimate loads, which are typically focused solely on unwaked wind turbine operation. These structural loads can be significantly influenced by the wind inflow conditions. Turbines experience altered inflow conditions when placed in the wake of upstream turbines, which can additionally influence the fatigue and ultimate loads. It is important to understand the impact of uncertainty on the resulting loads of both unwaked and waked turbines. The goal of this work is to assess which wind-inflow-related and wake-related parameters have the greatest influence on fatigue and ultimate loads during normal operation for turbines in a three-turbine wind farm. Twenty-eight wind inflow and wake parameters are screened using an elementary effects sensitivity analysis approach to identify the parameters that lead to the largest variation in the fatigue and ultimate loads of each turbine. This study uses the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW baseline wind turbine, simulated with OpenFAST and synthetically generated inflow based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Kaimal turbulence spectrum with the IEC exponential coherence model using the NREL tool TurbSim. The focus is on sensitivity to individual parameters, though interactions between parameters are considered, and how sensitivity differs between waked and unwaked turbines. The results of this work show that for both waked and unwaked turbines, ambient turbulence in the primary wind direction and shear are the most sensitive parameters for turbine fatigue and ultimate loads. Secondary parameters of importance for all turbines are identified as yaw misalignment, streamwise integral length, and the exponent and streamwise components of the IEC coherence model. The tertiary parameters of importance differ between waked and unwaked turbines. Tertiary effects account for up to 9.0 % of the significant events for waked turbine ultimate loads and include veer, non-streamwise components of the IEC coherence model, Reynolds stresses, wind direction, air density, and several wake calibration parameters. For fatigue loads, tertiary effects account for up to 5.4 % of the significant events and include vertical turbulence standard deviation, lateral and vertical wind integral lengths, non-streamwise components of the IEC coherence model, Reynolds stresses, wind direction, and all wake calibration parameters. This information shows the increased importance of non-streamwise wind components and wake parameters in the fatigue and ultimate load sensitivity of downstream turbines.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As offshore wind farm development expands, accurate wind resource forecasting over the ocean is needed. One important yet relatively unexplored aspect of offshore wind resource assessment is the role of sea surface temperature (SST). Models are generally forced with reanalysis data sets, which employ daily SST products. Compared with observations, significant variations in SSTs that occur on finer timescales are often not captured. Consequently, shorter-lived events such as sea breezes and low-level jets (among others), which are influenced by SSTs, may not be correctly represented in model results. The use of hourly SST products may improve the forecasting of these events. In this study, we examine the sensitivity of model output from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) 4.2.1 to different SST products. We first evaluate three different data sets: the Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR25) SST analysis, a daily, 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ resolution product; the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Analysis (OSTIA), a daily, 0.054∘ × 0.054∘ resolution product; and SSTs from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-16), an hourly, 0.02∘ × 0.02∘ resolution product. GOES-16 is not processed at the same level as OSTIA and MUR25; therefore, the product requires gap-filling using an interpolation method to create a complete map with no missing data points. OSTIA and GOES-16 SSTs validate markedly better against buoy observations than MUR25, so these two products are selected for use with model simulations, while MUR25 is at this point removed from consideration. We run the model for June and July of 2020 and find that for this time period, in the Mid-Atlantic, although OSTIA SSTs overall validate better against in situ observations taken via a buoy array in the area, the two products result in comparable hub-height (140 m) wind characterization performance on monthly timescales. Additionally, during hours-long flagged events (< 30 h each) that show statistically significant wind speed deviations between the two simulations, both simulations once again demonstrate similar validation performance (differences in bias, earth mover's distance, correlation, and root mean square error on the order of 10−1 or less), with GOES-16 winds validating nominally better than OSTIA winds. With a more refined GOES-16 product, which has been not only gap-filled but also assimilated with in situ SST measurements in the region, it is likely that hub-height winds characterized by GOES-16-informed simulations would definitively validate better than those informed by OSTIA SSTs.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This consideration is important to ensuring an understanding of how each individual aspect can affect the resulting systemic resilience. The combination of co-simulation of these time-based characteristics and a resilience-specific metric provides a likely method to inform both design planning and implementation/operational goals to ensure resilience in power systems. The Microgrids, Infrastructure Resilience, and Advanced Controls Launchpad co-simulation platform (MIRACL-CSP) has been developed to allow the modular integration of power grid models with control and metrics applications. This paper introduces MIRACL-CSP as a fundamental platform to study and improve the resilient operation of a microgrid. It offers a holistic investigation environment for systemically comparing the cyber-physical resilience to natural and manmade events. We emphasize the importance/advantage of intertwining the distribution system simulator GridLAB-D with the Power Distribution Designing for Resilience (PowDDeR) application to analyze the resilience of the St. Mary’s microgrid in Alaska. The resilience is evaluated in both short-term (frequency stability) and long-term (energy constrained) metrics. The results of the analysis of the St. Mary’s microgrid show that there is a trade-off between the two. As inertia-based generation assets are taken off-line, short-term resilience drops. However, the long-term resilience is retained longer as less fuel is being used.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","Idaho National Lab.

Wind turbine components were parameterized using an actuator surface model to simulate the rotor blades and the turbine nacelle. The baseline CPC and IPC algorithms, consisting of single-input single-output proportional–integral controllers and two integral controllers, respectively, were incorporated into the numerical framework. A series of simulations were carried out to investigate the relative performance of the two controllers under various turbulent inflow conditions, spanning hub-height velocities of 7 to 14 m/s. The numerical simulation results of this study showed that, in comparison to the CPC, the IPC controller could successfully reduce the damage equivalent loads of utility-scale turbines at regions 2 and 3 of turbine operation by about 3% and 40%, respectively, without any penalty on the power production of the turbine. It was also shown that, despite its minor impact on the turbulence kinetic energy of the wake, the IPC controller did not influence the recovery of the turbine wake.","Elsevier","","Stony Brook Univ., NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Curled-Skewed Wakes behind Yawed Wind Turbines Subject to Veered Inflow","Mohammadi, Mohammadreza; Bastankhah, Majid; Fleming, Paul; Churchfield, Matthew; Bossanyi, Ervin; Landberg, Lars; Ruisi, Renzo","17 WIND ENERGY; offshore; wakes; wind farm control; analytical wake model; wind veer; Coriolis force; wind turbine; wake steering; yaw angle","This work presents a new engineering analytical model that predicts the effect of both the turbine yaw misalignment and the inflow wind veer on the wake flow distribution downwind of a wind turbine. To consider the veered inflow, two methods were examined. In the first method, the curled shape of the wake due to the yaw offset is initially modelled. The wake shape is then laterally skewed at each height due to the wind veer based on the assumption that the turbine wake is transported downstream by the incoming flow. The second method is a more realistic approach that accounts for the effect of wind veer on the wind velocity direction and the yaw angle seen by the wind turbine. This models the wake region in a local coordinate system defined based on the wind direction at each height. A coordinate transformation is then performed to represent the wake flow distribution in the global coordinate system attached to the ground. The results show that while the two methods provide similar outputs for small variations in the wind direction across the rotor, the difference becomes more evident with an increase in wind veer. High-fidelity simulations for a turbine subject to a neutral atmospheric boundary layer were employed to validate model predictions for different operating conditions.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the increasing level of offshore wind energy investment, it is correspondingly important to be able to accurately characterize the wind resource in terms of energy potential as well as operating conditions affecting wind plant performance, maintenance, and lifespan. Accurate resource assessment at a particular site supports investment decisions. Following construction, accurate wind forecasts are needed to support efficient power markets and integration of wind power with the electrical grid. To optimize the design of wind turbines, it is necessary to accurately describe the environmental characteristics, such as precipitation and waves, that erode turbine surfaces and generate structural loads as a complicated response to the combined impact of shear, atmospheric turbulence, and wave stresses. Despite recent considerable progress both in improvements to numerical weather prediction models and in coupling these models to turbulent flows within wind plants, major challenges remain, especially in the offshore environment. Accurately simulating the interactions among winds, waves, wakes, and their structural interactions with offshore wind turbines requires accounting for spatial (and associated temporal) scales from O(1 m) to O(100 km). Computing capabilities for the foreseeable future will not be able to resolve all of these scales simultaneously, necessitating continuing improvement in subgrid-scale parameterizations within highly nonlinear models. In addition, observations to constrain and validate these models, especially in the rotor-swept area of turbines over the ocean, remains largely absent. Thus, gaining sufficient understanding of the physics of atmospheric flow within and around wind plants remains one of the grand challenges of wind energy, particularly in the offshore environment. This paper provides a review of prominent scientific challenges to characterizing the offshore wind resource using as examples phenomena that occur in the rapidly developing wind energy areas off the United States. Such phenomena include horizontal temperature gradients that lead to strong vertical stratification; consequent features such as low-level jets and internal boundary layers; highly nonstationary conditions, which occur with both extratropical storms (e.g., nor'easters) and tropical storms; air–sea interaction, including deformation of conventional wind profiles by the wave boundary layer; and precipitation with its contributions to leading-edge erosion of wind turbine blades. The paper also describes the current state of modeling and observations in the marine atmospheric boundary layer and provides specific recommendations for filling key current knowledge gaps.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Parked aeroelastic field rotor response for a 20% scaled demonstrator of a 13‐MW downwind turbine","Kaminski, Meghan; Loth, Eric; Fingersh, Lee Jay; Scholbrock, Andy; Selig, Michael","17 WIND ENERGY; extreme-scale; gravo-aeroelastic scaling; renewable energy; SUMR; wind energy; wind turbine","Aeroelastic parked testing of a unique downwind two-bladed subscale rotor was completed to characterize the response of an extreme-scale 13-MW turbine in high-wind parked conditions. A 20% geometric scaling was used resulting in scaled 20-m-long blades, whose structural and stiffness properties were designed using aeroelastic scaling to replicate the nondimensional structural aeroelastic deflections and dynamics that would occur for a lightweight, downwind 13-MW rotor. The subscale rotor was mounted and field tested on the two-bladed Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART2) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Flatiron Campus (NREL FC). The parked testing of these highly flexible blades included both pitch-to-run and pitch-to-feather configurations with the blades in the horizontal braked orientation. The collected experimental data includes the unsteady flapwise root bending moments and tip deflections as a function of inflow wind conditions. The bending moments are based on strain gauges located in the root section, whereas the tip deflections are captured by a video camera on the hub of the turbine pointed toward the tip of the blade. The experimental results are compared against computational predictions generated by FAST, a wind turbine simulation software, for the subscale and full-scale models with consistent unsteady wind fields. FAST reasonably predicted the bending moments and deflections of the experimental data in terms of both the mean and standard deviations. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the first such aeroelastically scaled turbine test and demonstrate that a highly flexible lightweight downwind coned rotor can be designed to withstand extreme loads in parked conditions.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The Weibull distribution law has been used extensively to analyze the wind characteristics of candidate WPP sites, and to estimate the available and deliverable energy. This paper presents a comparative study of five wind energy resource assessment methods as they applied to the context of wind sites in West Sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated three numerical approaches, namely, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the multilayer perceptron method (MLP), and support vector regression (SVR), to derive the distribution law of wind speeds and to optimally quantify the corresponding wind energy potential. Next, we compared these three approaches to two well-known Weibull distribution law-based methods: the empirical method of Justus (EMJ) and the maximum likelihood method (MLM). Case study results indicated that the neural network-based methods, ANFIS and MLP, yielded the most accurate distribution fits and wind energy potential estimates, and consequently, are the most recommended methods for the wind sites in Togo and Benin. The orders of magnitude of the root mean squared error (RMSE) in estimating the recoverable energy using ANFIS were, respectively, 10-4 and 10-5 for Lomé and Cotonou, while MLP achieved an RMSE order of magnitude of 10-3 for both sites.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Can lidars assess wind plant blockage in simple terrain? A WRF-LES study","Sanchez Gomez, Miguel; Lundquist, Julie K.; Mirocha, Jeffrey D.; Arthur, Robert S.; Muñoz-Esparza, Domingo; Robey, Rachel","17 WIND ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; AWAKEN; lidar; wind plant blockage","Wind plant blockage reduces wind velocity upstream of wind plants, potentially reducing the power output of the turbine array. The mechanism that amplifies blockage, as well as the velocity reductions associated are not well understood. Field observations can provide valuable insight into the characteristics of the induction zone and the mechanisms that amplify it. However, the small velocity reductions that have been measured experimentally pose a challenge in quantifying blockage, especially onshore, where flow heterogeneities may be of the same scale as the blockage effect itself. We simulate the flow around the King Plains wind plant in the simple terrain of Oklahoma, the location of the American WAKE experimeNt (AWAKEN), to evaluate blockage in this environment. We find the induction zone of the wind plant extends 24D upstream, with velocity deficits smaller than 0.64m/s (8%) throughout. We also use virtual measurements upstream of the wind plant to analyze the uncertainties and difficulties in measuring blockage using a scanning lidar onshore. Based on our virtual lidar study, the induction zone of land-based wind plants can be incorrectly estimated using observations if the effects of nonuniform terrain on the flow are not carefully considered. Changes in terrain elevation produce local variations in wind speed (as measured by a scanning lidar) that exceed in magnitude the deceleration within the induction zone. We propose a methodology to differentiate between these local changes in wind speed and blockage in experimental settings, highlighting the difficulties associated with measurement of blockage in even relatively simple onshore environments.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The revised FLORIDyn model: implementation of heterogeneous flow and the Gaussian wake","Becker, Marcus; Ritter, Bastian; Doekemeijer, Bart; van der Hoek, Daan; Konigorski, Ulrich; Allaerts, Dries; van Wingerden, Jan-Willem","17 WIND ENERGY; FLORIDyn; FLORIS; FLOw redirection and induction dynamics","In this paper, a new version of the FLOw Redirection and Induction Dynamics (FLORIDyn) model is presented. The new model uses the three-dimensional parametric Gaussian FLORIS model and can provide dynamic wind farm simulations at a low computational cost under heterogeneous and changing wind conditions. Both FLORIS and FLORIDyn are parametric models which can be used to simulate wind farms, evaluate controller performance and can serve as a control-oriented model. One central element in which they differ is in their representation of flow dynamics: FLORIS neglects these and provides a computationally very cheap approximation of the mean wind farm flow. FLORIDyn defines a framework which utilizes this low computational cost of FLORIS to simulate basic wake dynamics. This is achieved by creating so-called observation points (OPs) at each time step at the rotor plane which inherit the turbine state. In this work, we develop the initial FLORIDyn framework further considering multiple aspects. The underlying FLORIS wake model is replaced by a Gaussian wake model. The distribution and characteristics of the OPs are adapted to account for the new parametric model but also to take complex flow conditions into account. To achieve this, a mathematical approach is developed to combine the parametric model and the changing, heterogeneous world conditions and link them with each OP. We also present a computationally lightweight wind field model to allow for a simulation environment in which heterogeneous flow conditions are possible. FLORIDyn is compared to Simulator for Offshore Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) simulations in three- and nine-turbine cases under static and changing environmental conditions. The results show a good agreement with the timing of the impact of upstream state changes on downstream turbines. They also show a good agreement in terms of how wakes are displaced by wind direction changes and when the resulting velocity deficit is experienced by downstream turbines. A good fit of the mean generated power is ensured by the underlying FLORIS model. In the three-turbine case, FLORIDyn simulates 4 s simulation time in 24.49 ms computational time. The resulting new FLORIDyn model proves to be a computationally attractive and capable tool for model-based dynamic wind farm control.","Copernicus Publications","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Seabed bathymetry and friction modeling in MoorDyn","Housner, Stein; Lozon, Ericka; Martin, Bruce; Brefort, Dorian; Hall, Matthew","17 WIND ENERGY; bathymetry; floating offshore wind; friction; mooring modeling","This paper presents the implementation and verification of a seabed bathymetry feature and seabed friction feature to the open-source, lumped-mass mooring system dynamics modeler, MoorDyn, which is part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool, OpenFAST. Variations in seabed slope, as well as the frictional effects of mooring lines moving along the seabed, will affect the mooring line tensions of a floating platform and the consequent platform response. These new features are especially relevant for modeling mooring systems in deep-water coastal areas where seabed depth can change significantly over an entire mooring footprint. The bathymetry feature models the seabed as a rectangular grid of variable water depths in place of the existing, uniform water depth in MoorDyn. The friction force is primarily represented as a Coulombic friction force, or the product of a kinetic friction coefficient and the seabed contact normal force, with the ability to differentiate between transverse and axial motion of a line node on the seabed in any bathymetry grid. These capabilities were tested by running MoorDyn and OpenFAST simulations over a variety of seabed and environmental conditions; the resulting fairlead tensions, node tensions, and mooring line kinematics were verified against equivalent OrcaFlex simulations. The results match closely, meaning the features are verified, which will increase the overall fidelity of OpenFAST and FAST.Farm simulations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Shared mooring lines tether adjacent floating platforms together, reducing the number of anchors required but increasing system complexity. We present a systematic, multistage design process for shared mooring systems, involving linearized analysis of array layout options, quasi-static mooring line optimization, and design refinement based on coupled dynamic loads analysis. The design developed from this process is thought to represent one of the most advantageous shared-mooring configurations for this scale of floating wind array. It features perpendicular anchor line pairs and allows shared, multiline anchors, making it an example of a shared-mooring-and-anchor array. Comparing the performance and cost characteristics of the shared-mooring design with more conventional three-line individual mooring systems shows equivalent dynamic response characteristics and stationkeeping system cost savings of 25% when using shared mooring lines and shared anchors. The design is also advantageous in the case of a mooring line failure, with offsets and redundancy characteristics similar to four-line individual mooring systems.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind plant wake impacts can be estimated with a number of simulation methodologies, each with its own fidelity and sensitivity to model inputs. In turbine-free mesoscale simulations, hub-height wind speeds often significantly vary with the choice of a planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. However, the sensitivity of wind plant wakes to a PBL scheme has not been explored because, as of the Weather Research and Forecasting model v4.3.3, wake parameterizations were only compatible with one PBL scheme. We couple the Fitch wind farm parameterization with the new NCAR 3DPBL scheme and compare the resulting wakes to those simulated with a widely used PBL scheme. We simulate a wind plant in pseudo-steady states under idealized stable, neutral, and unstable conditions with matching hub-height wind speeds using two PBL schemes: MYNN and the NCAR 3DPBL. For these idealized scenarios, average hub-height wind speed losses within the plant differ between PBL schemes by between −0.20 and 0.22 m s−1, and correspondingly, capacity factors range between 39.5 %–53.8 %. These simulations suggest that PBL schemes represent a meaningful source of modeled wind resource uncertainty; therefore, we recommend incorporating PBL variability into future wind plant planning sensitivity studies as well as wind forecasting studies.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The California Pacific coast is characterized by considerable wind resource and areas of dense population, propelling interest in offshore wind energy as the United States moves toward a sustainable and decarbonized energy future. Reanalysis models continue to serve the wind energy community in a multitude of ways, and the need for validation in locations where observations have been historically limited, such as offshore environments, is strong. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) owns two lidar buoys that collect wind speed observations across the wind turbine rotor layer along with meteorological and oceanographic data near the surface to characterize the wind resource. Lidar buoy data collected from recent deployments off the northern California coast near Humboldt County and the central California coast near Morro Bay allow for validation of commonly used reanalysis products. In this article, wind speeds from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2), the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), and the analysis system of the Rapid Refresh (RAP) are validated at heights within the wind turbine rotor layer ranging from 50 to 100 m. The validation results offer guidance on the performance and uncertainty associated with utilizing reanalyses for offshore wind resource characterization, providing the offshore wind energy community with information on the conditions that lead to reanalysis error. At both California coast locations, the reanalyses tend to underestimate the observed rotor-level wind resource. Occasions of large reanalysis error occur in conjunction with stable atmospheric conditions, wind speeds associated with peak turbine power production (> 10 m s−1), and mischaracterization of the diurnal wind speed cycle in summer months.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Small machines have traditionally not received the same level of aerodynamic refinement as their larger counterparts, resulting in lower efficiency, lower capacity factors, and therefore a higher cost of energy. In an effort to reduce this gap, research programs are developing worldwide. With this background, the scope of the present study is 2-fold. In the first part of this paper, an overview of the current status of the technology is presented in terms of technical maturity, diffusion, and cost. The second part of the study proposes five grand challenges that are thought to be key to fostering the development of small wind turbine technology in the near future, i.e. (1) improving energy conversion of modern SWTs through better design and control, especially in the case of turbulent wind; (2) better predicting long-term turbine performance with limited resource measurements and proving reliability; (3) improving the economic viability of small wind energy; (4) facilitating the contribution of SWTs to the energy demand and electrical system integration; (5) fostering engagement, social acceptance, and deployment for global distributed wind markets. To tackle these challenges, a series of unknowns and gaps are first identified and discussed. Based on them, improvement areas are suggested, for which 10 key enabling actions are finally proposed.","Copernicus Publications","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Floating wind model-scale experiments in wind–wave facilities have been performed over the last two decades with varying levels of fidelity and limitations. However, the turbine controls in these experiments have considered only limited control strategies and implementations. To allow for control co-design, this research focuses on implementing and experimentally validating more advanced turbine control actions and strategies in a wind–wave basin for a 1:70-scale model of the International Energy Agency’s wind 15 MW reference wind turbine. The control strategies analyzed include torque control, collective pitch control, and transition region control (setpoint smoothing). Our experimental and numerical results include the effects of varying rotor speeds, blade pitches, and wind environments on the turbine thrust and torque. Numerical models from three different software tools are presented and compared to the experimental results. Their ability to effectively represent the aero-dynamic response of the wind turbine to the control actions is successfully validated. Finally, turbine controller tuning parameters based on the derivatives of thrust and torque are derived to allow for improved offshore wind turbine dynamics and to validate the ability of modeling tools to model the dynamics of floating offshore wind turbines with control co-design.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we explore an application of deep learning (DL) to learn the wake model from hierarchies of physics-based approaches ranging from analytical models to an approximate form of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. We first illustrate the application of principal component analysis to obtain a lower-dimensional representation that allows a computationally tractable training and deployment of DL models. Then, the DL model is trained to learn the mapping from input parameter space to the principal components, which are then used to reconstruct the three-dimensional flow field. Additionally, we investigate a composite framework consisting of two neural networks to learn the correlation between low- and high-fidelity data with Gauss and curl models treated as proxies for low- and high-fidelity models, respectively. The prediction from both DL models matches well with the high-fidelity data with a maximum relative percentage error for the kinetic energy flux of <1%. This work opens up possibilities for data-efficient construction of surrogate models for wake prediction that can be used to study the influence of wind speed and yaw angles on wind farm power production.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Stronger together: The value impacts of hybridizing distributed wind","Kazimierczuk, K.; Mongird, K.; Barrows, S. E.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; hybrid power systems, wind energy, solar energy, battery storage","Renewable energy technology adoption is on the rise in the United States, with high levels of new resources expected to be needed to meet national clean energy goals. While distributed wind energy has over 1,400 GW of potentially profitable deployment, less than 0.01% of that has currently been deployed. One barrier to distributed wind energy adoption is the variability of the wind resource, which can cause uncertainty and instability in the grid if not accounted for. Pairing distributed wind with other technologies, such as solar photovoltaics and/or energy storage, can alleviate some of the issues related to variability due to potential complementarity of resources and dispatchability. In this study we describe the potential impacts of adding solar photovoltaics and/or energy storage to a distributed wind energy installation, providing a qualitative ranking system for each value stream that might be available for the new hybrid power system, and quantitative results for the potential dollars per year that might be possible for select value streams. We find that hybridizing can add value to all value streams, though adding energy storage makes these impacts much larger than simply adding solar photovoltaics.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Wake steering is an emerging wind power plant control strategy where upstream turbines are intentionally yawed out of perpendicular alignment with the incoming wind, thereby “steering” wakes away from downstream turbines. However, trade-offs between the gains in power production and fatigue loads induced by this control strategy are the subject of continuing investigation. In this study, we present a multifidelity multiobjective optimization approach for exploring the Pareto front of trade-offs between power and loading during wake steering. A large eddy simulation is used as the high-fidelity model, where an actuator line representation is used to model wind turbine blades and a rainflow-counting algorithm is used to compute damage equivalent loads. A coarser simulation with a simpler loads model is employed as a supplementary low-fidelity model. Multifidelity Bayesian optimization is performed to iteratively learn both a surrogate of the low-fidelity model and an additive discrepancy function, which maps the low-fidelity model to the high-fidelity model. Each optimization uses the expected hypervolume improvement acquisition function, weighted by the total cost of a proposed model evaluation in the multifidelity case. The multifidelity approach is able to capture the logit function shape of the Pareto frontier at a computational cost only 30 % that of the single-fidelity approach. Additionally, we provide physical insights into the vortical structures in the wake that contribute to the Pareto front shape.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

MV multiport SSTs are promising in integrating low-voltage DC sources or loads such as solar photovoltaic, energy storage, and electric vehicles into smart grids without bulky line-frequency transformers. Compared to voltage-source SST, current-source (CS) SST features single-stage isolated bidirectional AC/AC, AC/DC, or DC/DC conversion using an inductive DC link. For a multiport CS SST, it is revealed in this article that the PPP capability can be enabled through the proposed control without extra hardware, different from the case of voltage-source converters where special hardware architecture is required for the PPP. With the PPP, most power exchange between LV ports is processed by only a fraction of the entire conversion stage, leading to reduced DC-link current, volume, loss, and improved efficiency. The proposed multiport PPP control scheme is analyzed to verify the advantages across a wide voltage and power range against conventional full power processing (FPP) multiport control, using the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss as an example. Comparative experimental results based on a SiC three-port S4T prototype verify the effectiveness of the proposed PPP scheme against the FPP scheme under both steady state and dynamic conditions. Here, the DC-link current reduction is measured to be more than 36%. Significantly, the proposed multiport PPP control scheme is generic and applicable to any hard-switching or soft-switching CS SSTs without extra hardware.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2606-2616","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3211000","","2023-03-27T00:00:00Z","1892471","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892471","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","2","38"

We established an open-source Python code base tailored for wind speed and wind power forecast validation, WE-Validate. The code base can evaluate model forecasts with observations in a coherent manner. To demonstrate the systematic validation framework of WE-Validate, we designed and hosted a forecast evaluation benchmark exercise. We invited forecast providers in industry and academia to participate and submit forecasts for two case studies. We then evaluated the submissions with WE-Validate. Our findings suggest that ensemble means have reasonable skills in time series forecasting, whereas they are often inferior to single ensemble members in wind ramp forecasting. Adopting a voting scheme in ramp forecasting that allows ensemble members to detect ramps independently leads to satisfactory skill scores. Throughout this document, we also emphasize the importance of using statistically robust and resistant metrics as well as equitable skill scores in forecast evaluation.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A time‐varying formulation of the curled wake model within the FAST.Farm framework","Branlard, Emmanuel; Martínez‐Tossas, Luis A.; Jonkman, Jason","17 WIND ENERGY; FAST.Farm; skewed wake; wind farm","In this article, we present a time-varying formulation of the curled wake model that we implemented in FAST.Farm. The curled wake model, originally developed for steady-state conditions, is used to produce realistic wake profiles behind a wind turbine in yawed (or skewed) conditions. We begin by introducing the key elements of the FAST.Farm framework. Then, after briefly summarizing the original wake dynamics formulation of FAST.Farm based on a polar wake profile, we present the new time-varying formulation of the curled wake model, compare the two, and highlight the differences with the original curled wake model. After discussing some implementation details, we present different applications with increasing levels of complexity: single turbine with uniform and turbulent inflow, fixed and transient yaw, and multiple turbines. We verify our results using the original FAST.Farm implementation and large-eddy simulations. The results with the new curled wake model are improved compared to the original implementation, as they include cross-flow velocities and wake asymmetry. Yet, large-eddy simulation results show a more pronounced lateral convection of the wake and a stronger concentration of vorticity at the top vortex. The new curled wake implementation in FAST.Farm should enable the calculation of not only generator power but also wind turbine structural loads for applications involving intentional or unintentional skewed flow and wind-farm control involving wake steering.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This letter reveals why such oscillations occur in the individual var measurement, while being insignificant in the total var measurement, regardless of the varying grid impedance. We adopt two analysis approaches: open-loop single-input single-output analysis and network decomposition. The two approaches differ in their treatment of turbine-network interaction. The open-loop analysis shows that the turbine-turbine oscillation mode is due to an open-loop system pole being attracted to an open-loop system zero. Furthermore, we use network decomposition method to explain why this mode is observable in individual vars while not observable in the total var. The entire system of n -turbines can be viewed as n decoupled circuits. For the two-turbine case, the system has an aggregated mode and a turbine-turbine oscillation mode. Here, the aggregated mode is associated with a circuit associated with the total var, while the turbine-turbine oscillation mode is associated with the var difference and is insensitive to the grid parameters.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Some of the planned development sites coincide with important habitat for critically endangered North Atlantic right whales. Both exclusion zones and passive acoustic monitoring are important tools for managing interactions between marine mammals and human activities. Understanding where animals are with respect to exclusion zones is important to avoid costly construction delays while minimizing the potential for negative impacts. Impact piling from construction of hundreds of offshore wind turbines likely require exclusion zones as large as 10 km. We have developed a three-hydrophone passive acoustic monitoring system that provides bearing information along with marine mammal detections to allow for informed management decisions in real-time. Multiple units form a monitoring system designed to determine whether marine mammal calls originate from inside or outside of an exclusion zone. In October 2021 we undertook a full system validation, with a focus on evaluating the detection range and bearing accuracy of the system with respect to right whale upcalls. Five units were deployed in Mid-Atlantic waters and we played more than >3,500 simulated right whale upcalls at known locations to characterize the detection function and bearing accuracy of each unit. The modelled results of the detection function error were then used to compare the effectiveness of a bearing-based system to a single sensor that can only detect a signal but not ascertain directivity. Field trials indicated maximum detection ranges from 4-7.3 km depending on source and ambient noise levels. Simulations showed that incorporating bearing detections provide a substantial improvement in false alarm rates (6 to 12 times depending on number of units, placement, and signal to noise conditions) for a small increase in the risk of missed detections inside of an exclusion zone (1-3%). We show that the system can be used for monitoring exclusion zones and clearly highlight the value of including bearing estimation into exclusion zone monitoring plans while noting that placement and configuration of units should reflect anticipated ambient noise conditions.","Wiley-Blackwell","","SMRU Consulting, Friday Harbor, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United Kingdom","2022-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Methods in Ecology and Evolution (Online) Journal Volume: 13 Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X; Size: p. 2491-2502","","","DE‐EE00087; EE0008732","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-210X","10.1111/2041-210X.13973","","2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","1887911","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1887911","","Methods in Ecology and Evolution (Online)","11","13"

"Large-eddy simulation of helical- and straight-bladed vertical-axis wind turbines in boundary layer turbulence","Gharaati, Masoumeh; Xiao, Shuolin; Wei, Nathaniel J.; Martínez-Tossas, Luis A.; Dabiri, John O.; Yang, Di","17 WIND ENERGY; actuator line; LES; vertical axis","Here, turbulent wake flows behind helical- and straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in boundary layer turbulence are numerically studied using the large-eddy simulation (LES) method combined with the actuator line model. Based on the LES data, systematic statistical analyses are performed to explore the effects of blade geometry on the characteristics of the turbine wake. The time-averaged velocity fields show that the helical-bladed VAWT generates a mean vertical velocity along the center of the turbine wake, which causes a vertical inclination of the turbine wake and alters the vertical gradient of the mean streamwise velocity. Consequently, the intensities of the turbulent fluctuations and Reynolds shear stresses are also affected by the helical-shaped blades when compared with those in the straight-bladed VAWT case. The LES results also show that reversing the twist direction of the helical-bladed VAWT causes the spatial patterns of the turbulent wake flow statistics to be reversed in the vertical direction.

"The impact of swirl and wake strength on turbulent axisymmetric wake evolution","Holmes, Marlin J.; Naughton, Jonathan W.","17 WIND ENERGY; energy sciences; turbulence; wake; swirl; wind turbine wake","<p>An experimental investigation of swirl and wake strength influence on axisymmetric turbulent wake evolution was conducted. A novel wake generator design wire mounted in a wind tunnel test section with low free-stream turbulence produced wake Reynolds numbers based on momentum thickness and free-stream velocity in excess of 14 000 and swirl numbers up to 0.4 with minimal blockage. Steady-state blade element momentum simulations of reference wind turbine designs indicated that wind turbines operate in the flow regimes studied, indicating the practical aspects of this work. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was used to acquire three components of velocity in the swirling wake at locations up to approximately ten diameters downstream. Quantitative measures of wake growth and decay were deduced using available equilibrium similarity scaling for the swirling wake. The results show an increase above 50% in growth and axial velocity decay rate constants over the range of swirl strength studied compared to those of the non-swirling wake. Tangential velocity decay constants were shown to decrease with swirl strength over the range of conditions studied. Notably, changes in wake strength have little influence on growth and decay rates when compared to changes in swirl strength for the flow regimes studied in this work.</p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Demonstration of a fault impact reduction control module for wind turbines","Anderson, Benjamin (ORCID:0000000336199042); Baring-Gould, Edward","17 WIND ENERGY; fault tolerant control; wind turbine controller; wind turbine fault; wind turbine reliability","<p>Abstract. Traditionally, wind turbines in distributed applications make control decisions as isolated systems. They generally provide maximum power output during operation and manage internal faults with little consideration of the rest of the power system. Although fault detection and tolerance schemes are widely researched and implemented, controls to ameliorate such faults are uncommon in research and industry. The rapid shutdown of a wind turbine in a large transmission-connected wind plant will have a minimal impact on a large power system, but in a microgrid or isolated grid context the abrupt loss of a single wind turbine may cause grid instability and high stress on the system. This paper demonstrates a fault impact reduction control (FIRC) module for a wind turbine, which implements wider warning thresholds around fault thresholds. When the turbine crosses a warning threshold, the controller sends its predicted action to the grid controller, which facilitates the grid operator’s response to a potential wind turbine fault and then takes appropriate action to ameliorate the fault. Various test cases demonstrate the controller action under a variety of faults, and various scenarios demonstrate the grid benefit of an FIRC in both microgrid- and grid-connected contexts. The FIRC maximizes wind turbine generation and eases generation transition under a variety of fault scenarios. The FIRC module is easy to integrate with most existing controllers, just requiring derate capability, and can be easily modified to include the various warnings and thresholds that the user desires. This analysis is mainly performed in a MATLAB-Simulink-based research wind turbine model and is also implemented in the existing LabVIEW-based controller of the same research turbine at NREL.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Behavior and mechanisms of Doppler wind lidar error in varying stability regimes","Robey, Rachel; Lundquist, Julie K. (ORCID:0000000154902702)","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric boundary layer; large-eddy simulation; lidar; remote sensing; wind energy","Wind lidars are widespread and important tools in atmospheric observations. An intrinsic part of lidar measurement error is due to atmospheric variability in the remote-sensing scan volume. This study describes and quantifies the distribution of measurement error due to turbulence in varying atmospheric stability. While the lidar error model is general, we demonstrate the approach using large ensembles of virtual WindCube V2 lidar performing a profiling Doppler-beam-swinging scan in quasi-stationary large-eddy simulations (LESs) of convective and stable boundary layers. Error trends vary with the stability regime, time averaging of results, and observation height. A systematic analysis of the observation error explains dominant mechanisms and supports the findings of the empirical results. Treating the error under a random variable framework allows for informed predictions about the effect of different configurations or conditions on lidar performance. Convective conditions are most prone to large errors (up to 1.5 m s<sup>–1</sup> in 1 Hz wind speed in strong convection), driven by the large vertical velocity variances in convective conditions and the high elevation angle of the scanning beams (62°). Range-gate weighting induces a negative bias into the horizontal wind speeds near the surface shear layer (–0.2 m s<sup>–1</sup> in the stable test case). Errors in the horizontal wind speed and direction computed from the wind components are sensitive to the background wind speed but have negligible dependence on the relative orientation of the instrument. Especially during low winds and in the presence of large errors in the horizontal velocity estimates, the reported wind speed is subject to a systematic positive bias (up to 0.4 m s<sup>–1</sup> in 1 Hz measurements in strong convection). Vector time-averaged measurements can improve the behavior of the error distributions (reducing the 10 min wind speed error standard deviation to <0.3 m s<sup>–1</sup> and the bias to <0.1 m s<sup>–1</sup> in strong convection) with a predictable effectiveness related to the number of decorrelated samples in the time window. Hybrid schemes weighting the 10 min scalar- and vector-averaged lidar measurements are shown to be effective at reducing the wind speed biases compared to cup measurements in most of the simulated conditions, with time averages longer than 10 min recommended for best use in some unstable conditions. The approach in decomposing the error mechanisms with the help of the LES flow field could be extended to more complex measurement scenarios and scans.","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Characterization and repair of core gap manufacturing defects for wind turbine blades","Murdy, Paul; Hughes, Scott; Barnes, David","42 ENGINEERING; 17 WIND ENERGY; composite materials; manufacturing defects; mechanical characterization; repair; wind turbine blades","Various wind turbine blade components, such as shear webs and skins, commonly use fiber-reinforced composite sandwich structures with a core material like balsa or foam. During manufacturing, core gap defects may result from the misalignment of adjacent foam or balsa core sheets in the blade mold. It is important to understand the influence that core gaps have on the structural integrity of wind turbine blades and how to mitigate their influence. This research characterized the effects of core gap defects at the manufacturing and mechanical levels for both epoxy and next-generation thermoplastic composites. Common repair methods were assessed and compared. Multiple defect sizes were compared using temperature data gathered with thermocouples embedded during manufacturing to core gap defect characteristics obtained using image-mapping techniques, optical microscopy, and mechanical characterization by long beam flexure. Results showed that peak exothermic temperatures during curing were closely related to core gap size. The long beam flexure tests determined that transverse core gaps under pure bending loads can have a substantial effect on the ultimate facesheet strength of both epoxy and thermoplastic composite sandwich structures (up to 25% strength reduction), although the size of the defect itself had less of an influence on the magnitude of the strength reduction. The supporting image-mapping techniques indicated that the distortion of the composite facesheets by the core gaps contributed to the premature failures. The repair methods used in this study did very little to improve the ultimate strength of the sandwich panels that previously had core gap defects. The repair of the thermoplastic panel resulted in a further loss in ultimate facesheet strength. In closing, this research demonstrated that there is a vital need for the development of a compatible thermoplastic polymer repair resin system and appropriate resin specific repair procedures for the next generation of recyclable thermoplastic wind blades.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

J.; Yu, Kai","17 WIND ENERGY; CFD; irregular wave; offshore wind; semisubmersible; uncertainty; validation","This article examines the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to predict the response of a floating wind platform to irregular-wave excitation. This work was conducted as part of the Reproducible CFD Joint Industry Project for Floating Offshore Wind Applications and involved verification across several participants and modeling tools and validation against experiments. The authors pay special attention to the uncertainties in both CFD results and experimental measurements. In this work, we perform detailed comparisons of the incident waves and the motion of a moored structure. The nonlinear, low-frequency resonance motion is of particular interest because it potentially drives the mooring and tower-base loads. The verification and validation study is partially successful in that the CFD simulations capture the low-frequency slow-drift motion well but underpredict the low-frequency pitch resonance. This underprediction can be attributed in part to the CFD incident waves, which showed some discrepancies with the experimental waves, especially around extreme events. The effects of the wave discrepancies are also estimated and investigated using a mid-fidelity OpenFAST model. Overall, the present study increases our confidence in using CFD simulations to predict the global performance of offshore wind platforms in irregular waves and to produce data for the calibration of lower-fidelity models.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Loads assessment of a fixed-bottom offshore wind farm with wake steering","Shaler, Kelsey; Jonkman, Jason; Barter, Garrett E.; Kreeft, Jasper J.; Muller, Jelle P.","17 WIND ENERGY; FAST.Farm; turbine structural loads; turbine wakes; wake steering; wind farm","Wake steering via deliberate yaw offset is an emerging wind farm control technique that has the potential to mitigate wake losses and further increase wind farm energy yield. The loads impact of this technique has been studied, but there is limited insight into wind-farm-wide impacts of wake steering. Understanding such impacts is crucial to determining the feasibility of using wake steering in commercial wind farms. To that end, this work investigates the impacts of wake steering on the loads of all turbine components across all turbines in a wind farm operating under a broad set of inflow conditions, including inflow velocity, shear exponent, turbulence class, and inflow angle. This was done by performing FAST.Farm simulations of a 12-turbine wind farm array, excerpted from a larger hypothetical wind farm. The International Energy Agency Wind 15-MW reference wind turbine was modeled atop a monopile substructure, an open-source model that closely approximates the properties of similar commercial options. Wake steering was included via yaw offsets that were computed using an offline optimization with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory tool FLORIS. For each inflow case, the 12-turbine array was simulated with and without wake steering. Results were compared in terms of time-averaged means, standard deviations, ultimate loads, and damage-equivalent loads. The findings show that because wake steering is generally applied at rated wind speeds and below, it is unlikely to drive ultimate loads. For fatigue loads, wake steering does increase the overall fatigue accumulation for some load channels, such as blade-root and shaft bending. This is to be expected when overall power yield increases but may cause the damage accumulation to be more uniform throughout the array. The significance of the added fatigue loading is dependent on how frequent wake steering is utilized in the overall set of inflow conditions across the wind rose.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Y.; Simley, Eric; Hammond, Robert","17 WIND ENERGY; annual energy production; benchmark; energy yield assessment; open-source code; operational analysis; P50 bias; pre-construction estimates; pre-post-construction reconciliation; wind energy","The wind resource assessment community has long had the goal of reducing the bias between wind plant pre-construction energy yield assessment (EYA) and the observed annual energy production (AEP). This comparison is typically made between the 50% probability of exceedance (P50) value of the EYA and the long-term corrected operational AEP (hereafter OA AEP) and is known as the P50 bias. The industry has critically lacked an independent analysis of bias investigated across multiple consultants to identify the greatest sources of uncertainty and variance in the EYA process and the best opportunities for uncertainty reduction. The present study addresses this gap by benchmarking consultant methodologies against each other and against operational data at a scale not seen before in industry collaborations. We consider data from 10 wind plants in North America and evaluate discrepancies between eight consultancies in the steps taken from estimates of gross to net energy. Consultants tend to overestimate the gross energy produced at the turbines and then compensate by further overestimating downstream losses, leading to a mean P50 bias near zero, still with significant variability among the individual wind plants. Within our data sample, we find that consultant estimates of all loss categories, except environmental losses, tend to reduce the project-to-project variability of the P50 bias. The disagreement between consultants, however, remains flat throughout the addition of losses. Finally, we find that differences in consultants' estimates of project performance can lead to differences up to $10/MWh in the levelized cost of energy for a wind plant.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, with limited deployment to date, the current distributed wind market must be better understood; these efforts will support the range of stakeholders who will drive successful deployment. This article first distinguishes three categories of distributed wind from existing literature: (1) behind the meter, (2) intended for explicit local load, and (3) physically distributed. A novel methodology to classify individual wind installations into each of these categories is then presented and applied to two data sets of wind installations in the United States to categorize and illuminate distinct segments in the distributed wind market. Results: Physically distributed installations, constituted by small to moderately sized projects serving local loads on distribution systems solely because of their proximity to them, account for the highest amount of capacity but the lowest number of installations out of the three categories. The inverse is true for behind-the-meter installations, which are used to serve on-site loads. Installations intended for explicit local load, which are interconnected on the utility side of the distribution system and intentionally built to provide energy to loads on the same distribution system, rank in the middle for both installed capacity and number of installations. Conclusions: Distributed wind energy deployment in the United States is geographically widespread, but the extent to which a single category is developed in each state varies. Policies, wind resources, and broad energy technology trends contribute to these deployment patterns. By identifying the extent to which each category of installations exists, decision-makers are empowered with data necessary to tailor research and development programs and address stakeholder priorities through policy and other means, ultimately supporting future deployment.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

While wind power enables decarbonizing the electricity grid, the rising amount of end-of-life (EOL) wind blades - which are arduous to recycle - present a challenge for landfills if disposed of whole and a missed opportunity to recover valuable composite materials. The circular economy (CE) concept proposes strategies to rethink, reuse and recover products, components, and materials. However, transitioning to a CE implies changing how business models, supply chains, and behaviors deal with products and waste; changes arduously captured with traditional methods used to assess circularity such as life cycle assessment or material flow analysis (MFA). Here we present an agent-based model (ABM) that captures behavioral aspects impacting wind blade circularity in the US. The ABM also accounts for wind plant projects and landfills heterogeneity - a characteristic not easily included in top-down approaches such as MFA, input-output analysis, or system dynamics. Results show that recycling is divided as most recycling facilities are on the eastern side of the country, a challenge that could be alleviated by shredding blades before transportation. Recycling programs from the wind industry could also seed recycling behaviors within wind plant owners. Better yet, new blade designs could increase circularity if original equipment manufacturers accept the risks involved with the investments needed to adapt the production lines.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Limitations of reanalysis data for wind power applications","Davidson, Michael R.; Millstein, Dev","17 WIND ENERGY; boundary layer; reanalysis; wind power; wind resource assessment","Wind energy resource estimates commonly depend on simulated wind speed profiles generated by reanalysis or weather models due to the lack of long time series measurements with sufficient coverage at relevant heights (roughly 90 m above ground). However, modeled data, including reanalyses, can be noisy and display a wide range of biases and errors, variously attributed to terrain effects, poor coverage of assimilated inputs, and model resolution. Wind generation records, if available at high temporal and geographical resolution, can provide a proxy for wind measurements and allow for evaluation of reanalyses and weather model wind time series. We use a 7-year-long data set of hourly, plant-level generation records from over 100 wind plants across Texas to evaluate two commonly used reanalysis data sets (MERRA2 and ERA5). Additionally, we use 1-year of records (2019) to evaluate an operational, high-resolution regional weather modeling product (HRRR v3). We find that across the region, and across all modeling products, the modeled representation of wind generation (i.e., wind speeds at hub heights passed through a power curve) has relatively small mean errors when aggregated daily, but that accuracy and hourly correlation have a strong diurnal sensitivity. Accuracy and correlation systematically decline through the evening and markedly improve after sunrise. These diurnal patterns persist even in the highest resolution model tested (HRRR v3). We hypothesize the nighttime decline in accuracy is mostly due to poorly represented boundary layer conditions, perhaps related to model representation of stability, while other uncertainties (such as wake effects) play a secondary role.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

While some progress in high-fidelity complex fluid dynamics (CFD) models has increased the potential accuracy for modelling the impacts of obstacles on turbulent wind flow, these models are too computationally expensive for practical siting and resource assessment applications. To understand the efficacy of available models in situ, this study evaluates classic and commonly used methods alongside new state-of-the-art lower-order models derived from CFD simulations and machine learning approaches. This evaluation is conducted using a subset of an extensive original dataset of measurements from more than 300 operational wind turbines in the northern Netherlands. The results show that data-driven methods (e.g. machine learning and statistical modelling) are most effective at predicting production at real sites with an average error in annual energy production of 2.5 %. When sufficient data may not be available de novo to support these data-driven approaches, models derived from high-fidelity simulations show promise and reliably outperform classic methods. On average these models have 6.3 %–11.5 % error compared with 26 % for classic methods and 27 % baseline error for reanalysis data without obstacle correction. While more performant on average, these methods are also sensitive to the quality of obstacle descriptions and reanalysis inputs.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Do ambient shear and thermal stratification impact wind turbine tip-vortex breakdown?","Hodgkin, Amy; Laizet, Sylvain; Deskos, Georgios","17 WIND ENERGY; large-eddy simulation; tip-vortex stability; wind turbine wakes","Modern wind turbines experience uneven inflow conditions across the rotor, due to the ambient flow’s shear and thermal stratification. Such conditions alter the shape and length of turbine wakes and thus impact the loads and power generation of downstream turbines. To this end, understanding the spatial evolution of the individual wakes under different atmospheric conditions is key to controlling and optimising turbine arrays. With this numerical study we aim to obtain a better understanding of the fundamental physics governing the near-wake dynamics of wind turbines under shear and thermal stability, by examining their tip-vortex breakup mechanisms. Our approach considers scale-resolving simulations of a single turbine wake under a linear shear profile as well as the application of harmonic tip perturbations to trigger flow instabilities. For the subsequent analysis we use the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method to extract coherent structures from the flow, and we also calculate mean kinetic energy fluxes to quantify each coherent structure’s contribution to wake recovery. The wake’s helical spiral is found to hinder wake recovery for all studied ambient flow conditions, whereas the mutual inductance instability has positive MKE flux leading to an enhanced wake recovery. Finally, the ambient shear has the largest impact on the local MKE flux with respect to downstream location by changing the shape of the curve and location of extrema, whereas thermal stratification has only a minimal impact on the magnitude of the near-wake local MKE flux distribution.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Initially developed as a proof-of-concept model and applied to a single data set in complex terrain, the model is now improved and generalized and applied to two other unique lidar data sets, one located near an escarpment and one located offshore. The model, initially developed using lidar scans collected in predominantly westerly flow, exhibits sensitivity to wind flow direction. The model is thus successfully generalized through implementing a standard rotation process to scan images before input into the convolutional neural network to ensure the flow is westerly. The sample size of lidar scans used to train the model is increased, and along with the generalization process, these changes to the model are shown to enhance accuracy and robustness when characterizing dissipating and asymmetric wakes. Applied to the offshore data set in which nearly 20 wind turbine wakes are included per scan, the improved model exhibits a 95% success rate in characterizing wakes and a 74% success rate in characterizing dissipating wake fragments. The improved model is shown to generalize well to the two new data sets, although an increase in wake characterization accuracy is offset by an increase in model sensitivity and false positive wake identifications.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind turbine blade design with airfoil shape control using invertible neural networks","Jasa, John; Glaws, Andrew; Bortolotti, Pietro; Vijayakumar, Ganesh; Barter, Garrett","17 WIND ENERGY; airfoil shape design; blade design; neural network; optimization","Wind turbine blade design is a highly multidisciplinary process that involves aerodynamics, structures, controls, manufacturing, costs, and other considerations. More efficient blade designs can be found by controlling the airfoil cross-sectional shapes simultaneously with the bulk blade twist and chord distributions. Prior work has focused on incorporating panel-based aerodynamic solvers with a blade design framework to allow for airfoil shape control within the design loop in a tractable manner. Including higher fidelity aerodynamic solvers, such as computational fluid dynamics, makes the design problem computationally intractable. In this work, we couple an invertible neural network trained on high-fidelity airfoil aerodynamic data to a turbine design framework to enable the design of airfoil cross sections within a larger blade design problem. We detail the methodology of this coupled framework and showcase its efficacy by aerostructurally redesigning the IEA 15-MW reference wind turbine blade. The coupled approach reduces the cost of energy by 0.9% compared to a more conventional design approach. This work enables the inclusion of high-fidelity aerodynamic data earlier in the design process, reducing cycle time and increasing certainty in the performance of the optimal design.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Investigating the impact of atmospheric conditions on wake-steering performance at a commercial wind plant","Simley, Eric; Debnath, Mithu; Fleming, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric stability; turbulence; wake steering; wind farm control","Wake steering is a wind farm control strategy in which upstream wind turbines are misaligned with the wind to deflect their wakes away from downstream turbines, thereby increasing net energy production. But research suggests that the effectiveness of wake steering strongly depends on atmospheric conditions such as stability. In this paper, we investigate results from a two-turbine wake-steering experiment at a commercial wind plant to assess the impact of stability and five other atmospheric variables on wake-steering performance. Specifically, for different atmospheric condition bins we compare the ability of the controller to achieve the intended yaw offsets, the power gain from wake steering, and the reduction in wake losses. Further, we analyze wake-steering performance as a function of wind speed to eliminate the confounding impact of different wind speed distributions in different atmospheric conditions. Overall, we find that wind direction standard deviation is the best predictor of wake-steering performance, followed by turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy. The results suggest the importance of adapting wake-steering control strategies to different atmospheric conditions.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Anticipating failures in wind turbines enables early warnings and timely intervention, so that the costly corrective maintenance can be prevented to the largest extent possible. It also avoids production loss owing to prolonged unavailability. One critical element allowing early warning is the ability to accumulate small-magnitude symptoms resulting from the gradual degradation of wind turbine systems. Inspired by the cumulative sum control chart method, this study reports the development of a wind turbine failure detection method with such early warning capability. Specifically, the following key questions are addressed: what fault signals to accumulate, how long to accumulate, what offset to use, and how to set the alarm-triggering control limit. We apply the proposed approach to 2 years’ worth of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data recorded from five wind turbines. We focus our analysis on gearbox failure detection, in which the proposed approach demonstrates its ability to anticipate failure events with a good lead time.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficient Loads Surrogates for Waked Turbines in an Array","Shaler, Kelsey; Jasa, John; Barter, Garrett E.","17 WIND ENERGY; fatigue loads; loads; surrogate modeling; ultimate loads; wind farm","Accurately and efficiently predicting wind turbine structural loading is a crucial step in wind farm design. Without considering structural loading, wind farm optimization could negatively impact turbine fatigue and ultimate loads, especially for waked and partially waked turbines, which could result in higher maintenance costs and reduced turbine lifetime. However, predicting turbine loads throughout an array is a costly step, as these quantities require time-accurate results across long time histories, which is often intractable for large array optimization. Therefore, surrogate models that link array spacing to load outputs are often used, but the surrogates are then unique to the inflow conditions and array configurations in the training library. This work develops surrogate models for many wind turbine load outputs based solely on rotor plane velocity measurements, with no required input about array configuration or freestream inflow parameters. Surrogate models were constructed for many turbine quantities of interest (QoI), considering mean, standard deviation, ultimate, and fatigue loads. In general, most QoI statistics were accurately captured, as measured by predicted vs. actual correlation coefficient, confirming the suitability of the approach. Temporal mean values of the QoI required only temporal mean measurements of the rotor plane inflow velocity. However, accurate prediction of temporal standard deviation, ultimate, and fatigue values of QoI also required temporal standard deviations of the rotor plane velocity field. Poor surrogate performance was observed when too many correlated inputs were used, such as multiple velocity components. If the fewest inflow parameters are used to construct the surrogates, the average correlation coefficient value for all output QoI statistics is 0.89. Surrogates for standard deviations and damage equivalent loads (DELs) of turbine QoIs generally had lower accuracy and tower-base and shaft load channels posed the most difficult to capture accurately. The results suggest that these surrogates could be easily paired with analytic wake models, which are frequently used for pre-construction wind farm array optimization, to account for turbine loading in addition to power production. By including the optimal inflow conditions, the surrogate accuracy can improve to an average correlation coefficient value for all output QoI statistics of 0.92. This work has established the ability to build accurate surrogates for mean, standard deviation, ultimate load, and DEL turbine QoI values based on the rotor plane inflow velocity, and identified which inflow conditions lead to greater surrogate accuracy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, three 25-MW rotors were developed, and the final version is a fully redesigned model of the original rotor. Despite their radically large sizes, it was found that these 25-MW turbine rotors satisfy this limited set of structural design drivers at the rated condition and that larger blade lengths are possible with conewise load-alignment. In addition, flapwise morphing (varying the cone angle with a wind-speed schedule) was investigated to minimize mean and fluctuating blade root bending loads using steady inflow proxies for the maximum and lifetime damage equivalent load moments. Compared to the fixed coned rotor case, morphing can provide an Annual Energy Production (AEP) increase of 6%, and the maximum blade root flapwise bending moment increases 21% (still under the constraint, i.e., 10% of the ultimate moments) as a trade-off. The resulting series of 25-MW rotors can be a valuable baseline for further development and assessment of ultra-large-scale wind turbines.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"National-scale impacts on wind energy production under curtailment scenarios to reduce bat fatalities","Maclaurin, Galen; Hein, Cris; Williams, Travis; Roberts, Owen; Lantz, Eric; Buster, Grant; Lopez, Anthony","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; annual energy production; bat fatalities; curtailment; wind energy","Wind energy often plays a major role in meeting renewable energy policy objectives; however, increased deployment can raise concerns regarding the impacts of wind plants on certain wildlife. Particularly, estimates suggest hundreds of thousands of bat fatalities occur annually at wind plants across North America, with potential implications for the viability of several bat species. One approach to reducing bat fatalities is shutting down (or curtailing) turbines when bats are most at risk, such as at night during relatively low wind speed periods throughout summer and early autumn. While curtailment has consistently been shown to reduce bat fatalities, the lost power production reduces revenues for wind plants. This study conducted simulations with a range of curtailment scenarios across the contiguous United States to examine sensitivities of annual energy production (AEP) loss and potential impacts on economic metrics for future wind energy deployment. We found that AEP reduction can vary across the country from less than 1% to more than 10% for different curtailment scenarios. From an estimated 2891 gigawatts (GW) of simulated economically viable wind capacity (measured by a positive net present value), we found the mid curtailment scenario (6.0 m/s wind speed cut-in from July 1 through October 31) reduced the quantity of economic wind capacity by 274 GW or 9.5%. Our results indicate that high levels of curtailment could substantially reduce the future footprint of financially viable wind energy. In this context, future work that illuminates cost-effective strategies to minimize curtailment while reducing bat fatalities would be of value.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Development of an open-source segmented blade design tool","Anderson, Benjamin; Bortolotti, Pietro; Johnson, Nick","17 WIND ENERGY; OpenFAST; segmented blade; structural modeling; wind turbine blade; WISDEM","As wind turbines continue to grow ever larger to reduce the cost of energy, their blades follow suit, with the largest commercial offshore blades extending past 100 m. Massive blades such as these raise key transportation and manufacturing challenges, especially for land-based turbines. Segmented blades are one solution and are garnering increased industry and research interest. In this work, a detailed mechanical joint model is integrated into the Wind-Plant Integrated System Design and Engineering Model (WISDEM<sup>®</sup>), which will facilitate future segmented blade research and optimization. WISDEM is used to design a wind turbine with 100-m segmented blades. This wind turbine design is compared to other machines with 100-m monolithic blades designed for rail-transportability. The designs are compared in terms of blade mass and cost, turbine capital cost, annual energy production, and levelized cost of energy, with monolithic designs being the lightest and most economical. However, this result may vary by wind plant location. A variety of segmentation joint types exist, and they will inevitably vary in parameters such as cost, spanwise location, and physical characteristics. This work examines the sensitivity of wind turbine design drivers and annual energy production to a variety of the aforementioned parameters, using the open-source wind turbine design codes OpenFAST and WISDEM, finding that joint mass, stiffness, and location can have significant effects on design drivers.</jats:p>","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Including aerodynamic effects in stability analyses is important to capture aerodynamic inertia, stiffness, and damping. The two models consist of a dynamic inflow model based on Øye’s model and an unsteady aerodynamics model based on a simplified Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model. Both models are written in a continuous-time state-space form, which is the form needed to perform linearizations within OpenFAST. In this article, we present the new models, perform some simple verifications against HAWC2 results, and then perform stability analyses. We investigate the contribution of the aerodynamic effects on the turbine modes, particularly the flapwise modes, which are the most affected. Because of the development presented in this work, Campbell diagrams accounting for dynamic stall and dynamic wake effects were generated for the first time using OpenFAST.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Comparing wind turbine aeroelastic response predictions for turbines with increasingly flexible blades","Cao, Kathy; Shaler, Kelsey; Johnson, Nick","17 WIND ENERGY; aeroelastic; flexible blades; free vortex wake","Highly flexible blades are becoming more prevalent designs as a potential solution to the transportation challenges associated with large-scale wind turbine rotors. However, there is currently no quantitative definition of “highly flexible” blades. To further develop turbines with highly flexible blades, a precise definition of the term and accurate simulations of turbines with such blades are required. Assumptions made in the traditional aerodynamic model, Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, are violated in turbines with flexible blades. However, Free Vortex Wake (FVW) methods can more accurately model these turbine designs. Though more computationally expensive than BEM, FVW methods are still computationally tractable for use in iterative turbine design. The purpose of this work was to determine the blade flexibility at which BEM and FVW methods begin to produce diverging aeroelastic response results. This was accomplished by simulating the BAR-DRC reference turbine with increasingly flexible blades in a range of steady, uniform inflow conditions using OpenFAST, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s physics-based turbine engineering tool. Blade-tip deflections confirmed that BEM and FVW results diverge as blade flexibility increases. For the 212 m rotor diameter turbine used in this study, the two methods largely agreed for smaller blade deflections. But their results differed by an average of 5% when the out-of-plane blade-tip deflections exceeded 5% of the blade length and in-plane blade-tip deflections exceeded 1.25% of the blade length, with percent differences approaching 25% at the largest deflections.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The DC-link current minimization can significantly reduce power loss and improve efficiency. The challenge of this problem is on improving both steady-state and dynamic performance. PI control methods and large DC-link inductors are conventionally used in the CSC but have limited dynamic performance. A model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed to achieve switching-cycle-level settling time, and the DC-link inductor is sized for 40% ripple to enable fast current change. Importantly, this article also proposes to minimize the DC-link current by varying the current even within a line cycle under single-phase load to improve the steady-state performance, in contrast with the reduction to a constant value in the literature. The proposed MPC features a constant switching frequency without weighting factors. The MPC does not have a high computational burden and is implemented in a regular digital controller for a prototype of soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been experimentally verified on the SiC S4T prototype during steady-state and dynamics under different multiport power flow conditions up to 2 kV peak. Here, the DC-link current in the experiments is close to the minimum current with a short zero-vector duration, which further verifies the performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11865-11875","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3178433","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892472","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"

Leading edge microspoilers (LEMS) have been shown to effectively reduce forces on airfoils by inducing stall at lower angles of attack. This paper investigates how LEMS can be used to reduce blade loading on large, flexible, downwind rotors during design-limiting design load cases. During shutdown in turbulent flows near cutout speed, LEMS could reduce the tip deflection spikes toward the tower by over 50% and keep flapwise root bending moments below normal operating conditions, thus eliminating these as design-driving load cases. In power producing load cases, deploying LEMS for a short period of time during a load spike can be effective to reduce toward-tower tip deflections without significantly impacting power produced, assuming these load spikes can be identified by a controller. Leveraging this technology could allow for lower specific power machines to be designed.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab. (NREL), Golden, CO (United States); Sandia National Lab.

We provide a detailed quantified overview of utilised auction schemes, including geographical spread, volumes, results, and design specifications. Our comprehensive global dataset reveals heterogeneous designs. Although most auction designs provide some form of revenue stabilisation, their specific instrument choices vary and include feed-in tariffs, one-sided and two-sided contracts for difference, mandated power purchase agreements, and mandated renewable energy certificates. We review the schemes used in all eight major offshore wind jurisdictions across Europe, Asia, and North America and evaluate bids in their jurisdictional context. We analyse cost competitiveness, likelihood of timely construction, occurrence of strategic bidding, and identify jurisdictional aspects that might have influenced auction results. We find that auctions are embedded within their respective regulatory and market design context, and are remarkably diverse, though with regional similarities. Auctions in each jurisdiction have evolved and tend to become more exposed to market price risks over time. Less mature markets are more prone to make use of lower-risk designs. Still, some form of revenue stabilisation is employed for all auctioned offshore wind energy farms analysed here, regardless of the specific policy choices. Our data confirm a coincidence of declining costs and growing diffusion of auction regimes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The locational value of distributed energy resources: A parcel-level evaluation of solar and wind potential in New York state","Bowen, Thomas; Koebrich, Sam; McCabe, Kevin; Sigrin, Ben","17 WIND ENERGY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; value of distributed energy resources; distributed generation; New York state; parcels; net energy metering; front-of-the-meter","We report distributed energy resources (DERs) are poised to play a significant role in evolving power systems because of their flexibility to be sited in areas of high value to the grid. Traditional DER compensation frameworks, specifically net energy metering (NEM), inadequately communicate differences in the locational and temporal value of DER generation to the grid. As a transition from NEM, New York State's (NYS's) Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) framework provides a methodology for calculating different value components that DERs offer the grid. To study the impacts of VDER frameworks on DER deployment, we developed a model to assess the value of distributed solar and wind systems configured as either a behind-the-meter system or a front-of-the-meter system for each parcel of land in NYS. Using parcel-level granularity, we can closely evaluate DER locational value and siting availability, particularly in urban and suburban settings. Our analysis finds while most DER generators would be modestly compensated for deferred transmission and distribution infrastructure upgrades (~0.01 $\$$/kWh for solar PV), a subset of projects receive significant value from this component (0.035 to 0.089 $\$$/kWh for top 5% of parcels for solar PV). Finally, our analysis finds VDER provides less overall compensation than NEM to the average DER generator, however, it increases access to compensation for front-of-the-meter DERs - a large and emerging market.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind turbines are complex multidisciplinary systems that are challenging to design because of the tightly coupled interactions between different subsystems. Computational modeling attempts to resolve these couplings so we can efficiently explore new wind turbine systems early in the design process. Low-fidelity models are computationally efficient but make assumptions and simplifications that limit the accuracy of design studies, whereas high-fidelity models capture more of the actual physics but with increased computational cost. This paper details the use of multifidelity methods for optimizing wind turbine designs by using information from both low- and high-fidelity models to find an optimal solution at reduced cost. Specifically, a trust-region approach is used with a novel corrective function built from a nonlinear surrogate model. We find that for a diverse set of design problems – with examples given in rotor blade geometry design, wind turbine controller design, and wind power plant layout optimization – the multifidelity method finds the optimal design using 38 %–58 % of the computational cost of the high-fidelity-only optimization. The success of the multifidelity method in disparate applications suggests that it could be more broadly applied to other wind energy or otherwise generic applications.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Technology innovation, evolving power markets, and competing land and ocean uses continue to influence the design and operation of wind turbines and plants. Anticipating these trends and their impact on future facilities can inform commercial strategies and research priorities. Drawing from a recent survey of 140 of the world's foremost wind experts, we identify expectations of future wind plant design in 2035, both for onshore and offshore wind. Experts anticipate continued growth in turbine size, to 5.5 (onshore) and 17 MW (offshore), with plants located in increasingly less favorable wind and siting regimes. They expect plant sizes of 1,100 MW for fixed-bottom and 600 MW for floating offshore wind. Experts forecast enhanced grid-system value from wind through significant to widespread use of larger rotors, hybrid projects with batteries and hydrogen production, and more. To explain experts' perspectives on future plant design and operation, we identify five mechanisms: economies of unit, plant, and resource scale; grid-system value economies; and production efficiencies. We characterize learning effects as a moderating influence on the strength of these mechanisms. In combination, experts predict that these design choices support levelized cost of energy reductions of 27% (onshore) and 17%-35% (floating and fixed-bottom offshore) by 2035 compared to today, while enhancing wind energy's grid service offerings. Our findings provide a much-needed benchmark for representing future wind technologies in power sector models and address a critical research gap by explaining the economics behind wind energy design choices.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As the market penetration increases, these power sources will need to provide grid services, such as dispatchability, in addition to providing energy. One way to reduce variability, provide higher quality power to the grid, and address local grid stability issues is through colocating wind and solar power plants. In addition to operating reliably during normal operating conditions, in scenarios with high penetrations of renewable generation, it is important that these hybrid plants can withstand production disruptions and continue to supply power despite prolonged resource reduction, extreme weather events, or other disruptions. In this paper, we present a methodology to optimize a wind-solar-battery hybrid power plant down to the component level that is resilient against production disruptions and that can continually produce some minimum required power. We introduce the models and assumptions we used to simulate a hybrid power plant as well as the design variable parameterization and specific methods we used to optimize the plant. We demonstrate the performance of our method by comparing a plant optimized for different objectives, generation outage durations, minimum power requirements, and power purchase agreements. Although the plant design is sensitive to model parameters and various other assumptions, our results demonstrate some of the optimal designs that occur in different scenarios and what one should expect when designing a hybrid wind-solar-storage power plant.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Arvada, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The proposed SST has some unique features. First, compared to the voltage-source or matrix converter-based SSTs, the current-source SST has a unique advantage of single-stage isolated AC/DC or AC/AC conversion with an inductive DC link, but no medium-voltage (MV) AC experiments have been reported. This article for the first time demonstrates MV AC current-source SST up to 7.5 kV peak. Second, the multiport SST has a buffer port for active power decoupling (APD) or energy storage integration. The double-line-frequency power ripple from single-phase AC grid normally results in a large capacitor size in MV SSTs. The APD scheme is proposed in MV applications for the first time to enable a reduced DC link and the electrolytic capacitor-less SST with high reliability. Third, as a direct grid-connected converter without line-frequency transformer, insulation and protection are critical. A medium-frequency transformer design passes 55 kV basic-insulation level (BIL) and 60 kV high potential dielectrics withstand test with only 0.09% leakage inductance. Importantly, a lightning protection scheme is presented to protect the SST itself from 90 kV BIL impulse. Fourth, the proposed current-source SST topology is a modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) with full-range zero-voltage switching and controlled dv/dt for low electromagnetic interference. Furthermore, these concepts are verified in a three-port M-S4T prototype with forced oil cooling under single-module, stacked-module, steady-state, and dynamic operations.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 12080-12094","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172946","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892474","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"
"Predictive Direct DC-Link Control for 7.2 kV Three-Port Low-Inertia Solid-State Transformer With Active Power Decoupling","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; cascaded multilevel power electronic transformer (PET); current-source converter (CSC); current-source inverter (CSI); input-series output-parallel (ISOP); medium-frequency transformer (MFT); multivariable digital control; model predictive control (MPC)","Promising for applications including renewable energy and electric vehicle fast charging, a medium-voltage (MV) solid-state transformer (SST) typically has multiple modules series stacked, which requires the modules to be single phase. One critical issue of the single-phase SST is the double-line-frequency power ripple. Traditionally, large passives are used to buffer the ripple, resulting in significantly increased volume and cost. This article for the first time proposes active power decoupling (APD) for the SST and a predictive direct DC-link control method, using a current-source single-stage SST as an example. An electrolytic capacitor-less buffer port is used to absorb the ripple, which tolerates up to a 30% voltage ripple for small capacitance. The APD SST control is challenging. First, the current-source SST realizes isolation, DC link, and multiport in a single stage. Second, different from conventional SSTs or APD converters, the low-inertia DC link in this SST has a 40% switching ripple, which is difficult to stabilize. To address the control challenge, a direct DC-link control architecture and a predictive control method are proposed. Simulation and experimental results verify the proposed control method on an MV SiC modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) prototype. Here, the proposed APD reduces the SST volume by 53.8%. Importantly, the proposed concept is not limited to the M-S4T but is generic to other SSTs or APD converters.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11673-11685","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2022.3172957","","2022-10-20T00:00:00Z","1892473","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892473","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","37"
"How Generalizable is a Machine-Learning Approach for Modeling Hub-Height Turbulence Intensity?","Bodini, Nicola; Lundquist, Julie K.; Livingston, Hannah; Moriarty, Pat","17 WIND ENERGY; awaken; machine learning; turbulence intensity","Hub-height turbulence intensity is essential for a variety of wind energy applications. However, simulating it is a challenging task. Simple analytical models have been proposed in the literature, but they all come with significant limitations. Even state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting model, currently struggle to predict hub-height turbulence intensity. Here, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to predict hub-height turbulence intensity from other hub-height and ground-level atmospheric measurements, using observations from the Perdigao field campaign and the Southern Great Plains atmospheric observatory. We consider a random forest regression model, which we validate first at the site used for training and then under a more robust round-robin approach, and compare its performance to a multivariate linear regression. The random forest successfully outperforms the linear regression in modeling hub-height turbulence intensity, with a normalized root-mean-square error as low as 0.014 when using 30-minute average data. In order to achieve such low root-mean-square error values, the knowledge of hub-height turbulence kinetic energy (which can instead be modeled in the Weather Research and Forecasting model) is needed. Interestingly, we find that the performance of the random forest generalizes well when considering a round-robin validation (i.e., when the algorithm is trained at one site such as Perdigao or Southern Great Plains) and then applied to model hub-height turbulence intensity at the other location.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"In the shadow of wind energy: Predicting community exposure and annoyance to wind turbine shadow flicker in the United States","Haac, Ryan; Darlow, Ryan; Kaliski, Ken; Rand, Joseph; Hoen, Ben","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine; shadow flicker; acceptance; social impacts","The moving shadows caused by wind turbines, referred to as “shadow flicker” (“SF”), are known to generate annoyance in a subset of the exposed population. However, the relationship between the level of modeled SF exposure and the population's perceived SF and SF annoyance is poorly understood. Improved understanding of SF exposure impacts could provide a basis for exposure thresholds and, in turn, potentially improve community acceptance of and experience with wind power projects. This study modeled SF exposure at nearly 35,000 residences across 61 wind projects in the United States, 747 of which were also survey respondents. Using these results, we analyzed the factors that led to perceived SF and self-reported SF annoyance. We found that perceived SF is primarily an objective response to SF exposure, distance to the closest turbine, and whether the respondent moved in after the wind project was built. Conversely, SF annoyance was not significantly correlated with SF exposure. Rather, SF annoyance is primarily a subjective response to wind turbine aesthetics, annoyance to other anthropogenic sounds, level of education, and age of the respondent. We also examined regulations governing SF in the sample project areas and compared them to SF exposure in the surrounding population. Additionally, we found that noise limits could serve as a proxy for SF exposure, as 90% of those exposed to wind turbine sound of no more than 45 dBA L1h had SF exposure of less than 8 h per year (a prototypical EU regulatory threshold).","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

New approaches are continuously being developed to improve the condition monitoring for wind turbines. Development of normal behaviour models is a popular approach in studies using SCADA data. This paper first presents a data-driven framework to apply normal behaviour models using an artificial neural network approach for wind turbine gearbox prognostics. A one-class support vector machine classifier, combining different error parameters, is used to analyse the normal behaviour model error to develop a robust threshold to distinguish anomalous wind turbine operation. A detailed sensitivity study is then conducted to evaluate the potential of using high-frequency SCADA data for wind turbine gearbox prognostics. The results based on operational data from one wind turbine show that, compared to the conventionally used 10-min averaged SCADA data, the use of high-frequency data is valuable as it leads to improved prognostic predictions. High-frequency data provides more insights into the dynamics of the condition of the wind turbine components and can aid in earlier detection of faults.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Aeroservoelastic Stability of a Floating Wind Turbine","Vanelli, Thea; Rinker, Jennifer; Zalkind, Daniel S.","17 WIND ENERGY; controls; floating wind; stability","The problem of negative damping undermines the aeroservoelastic stability of floating offshore wind turbines. The negative damping problem is most prevalent around rated wind speed, where the sensitivity of thrust to wind speed is the largest. This paper investigates the implementation of peak shaving, a controller feature that limits the rated thrust by pitching the blades before rated wind speed is reached. Two controller designs are investigated: a de-tuned controller and a nacelle-feedback controller. A time-domain metric is defined, inspired by Lyapunov theory, in order to compute and assess the stability of floating offshore wind turbines. The model of the International Energy Agency 15-MW reference wind turbine mounted on the University of Maine VolturnUS-S floater is simulated in HAWC2 with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reference open-source controller. Peak shaving is applied to the two controller designs and stability is assessed. According to the chosen metric, peak shaving does not improve the stability of the system. This is due to the trade-off between loads and error tracking: although the loads and displacements in the fore-aft direction of the turbine are reduced, the rotor-speed tracking is poorer, which increases the shaft torsion fatigue load.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Despite these advantages, the use of AM in the distributed wind technology (DWT) sector is limited. This article represents a short summary of an in-depth assessment by the authors of the status of AM and its role within the distributed wind technology design standards. The research gathered input and feedback from a large number of U.S. and international stakeholders, reviewed technical strengths and weaknesses of the current edition of the design standards, analyzed the minutes from recent industry workshops and meetings, collected publicly available AM templates, and provided an evaluation of the existing AM codes. Several goals were achieved including providing strategies for the load assessment categorization of turbines based on rotor swept area and archetype, and guidance for AM verification and validation. Recommendations within this study will advance the value and the ease-of-use of AM, thereby allowing the industry to better capitalize this underutilized tool, resulting in a more efficient design process, an easier path to certification, and overall better and more reliable distributed wind technology products.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, two major components of the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics have been isolated, namely, the mean velocity profile shear and the thermal stratification, to examine their impact on the near-wake development by undertaking a series of highly resolved large-eddy simulations. Subsequently, instantaneous flow fields are extracted from the simulations and used to conduct Fourier analysis and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and compute the mean kinetic energy fluxes by different POD modes to better understand the tip-vortex instability mechanisms. Our findings indicate that shear can significantly affect the breakup of the wind turbine tip-vortices and the shape and stable length of the wake, whereas thermal stratification seems to only have limited contribution to the spatial development of the near-wake field. Finally, our analysis shows that the applied perturbation frequency determines the tip-vortex breakup location as it controls the onset of the mutual inductance instability.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It requires the accurate modelling of the atmospheric flow conditions, wakes of upstream turbines and the response of the turbine of interest. Rigorous validations of model frameworks against measurements of utility-scale wind turbines in such scenarios remain limited to date. In this study, six models of different fidelity are compared against measurements from the DanAero experiment. The two benchmark cases feature a full-wake and partial-wake scenario, respectively. The simulations are compared against local pressure forces and inflow velocities measured on several blade sections of the downstream turbine, as well as met mast measurements and standard SCADA data. Regardless of the model fidelity, reasonable agreements are found in terms of the wake characteristics and turbine response. For instance, the azimuth variation of the mean aerodynamic forces acting on the blade was captured with a mean relative error of 15-20%. Additionally, while various model-specific deficiencies could be identified, the study highlights the need for further full-scale measurement campaigns with even more extensive instrumentation. Furthermore, it is concluded that validations should not be limited to integrated and/or time-averaged quantities that conceal characteristic spatial or temporal variations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, current knowledge of its land use impacts and synergies is limited by reliance on static characterizations that overlook the role of turbine technology and plant design in mediating interactions with the environment. Here, we investigate how wind technology development and innovation have shaped landscape interactions with social and ecological systems within the United States and contribute to evolving land area requirements. This work assesses trends in key land use facets of wind power using a holistic set of metrics to establish an evidence base that researchers, technology designers, land use managers, and policymakers can use in envisioning how future wind-intensive energy systems may be jointly optimized for clean energy, social, and environmental objectives. Since 2000, we find dynamic land occupancy patterns and regional trends that are driven by advancing technology and geographic factors.

Land use intensity, defined as the ratio of direct land usage to lifetime power generation of wind facilities, has also trended downwards. Although continued deployment on disturbed lands, and in close proximity to existing wind facilities and other infrastructure, could minimize the extent of impacts, ambitious decarbonization trajectories may predispose particular biomes to cumulative effects and risks from regional wind power saturation. Increased land-use and sustainability feedback in technology and plant design will be critical to sustainable management of wind power. </p>","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

HilFlowS, designed as an adjunct field campaign to the Department of Energy’s Second Wind Forecasting Improvement Project (WFIP2), provides wind profile observations at a second location in complex terrain for validating numerical atmospheric model simulations and for better understanding flow behavior over hills for wind power generation. One unique feature of HilFlowS was the inclusion of an undergraduate university student who helped plan and execute the experiment as well as analyze wind data from two remote sensing laser detection and ranging (lidar) instruments deployed along parallel ridgelines. HilFlowS examines the trend of building higher into the atmosphere for the purpose of increasing wind turbine power production and evaluates the wind resource in the Altamont Pass Region of Northern California for a set of wind turbines of differing hub-heights and rotor-disk diameters found in the area. The wind profiles show strongly channeled onshore flow above both hills, enhanced by strong subsidence aloft, which produces a wind maximum (Umax) around z = 10 m and strong negative shear throughout all of the evaluated rotor-disks for much of the summer wind season. Under these conditions, shear becomes more negative with increasing hub-height and increasing rotor-disk size. Rotor-disk equivalent wind speed (Uequiv), a measure of the average wind speed across the entire rotor-disk, is compared to hub-height, rotor length, and rated capacity factor for the set of turbines. Uequiv is most closely related to turbine hub-height and is negatively correlated given the low altitude of Umax. Based on these results, building the largest capacity, large rotor-disk wind turbine at the lowest possible hub-height appears to provide turbines in the Altamont with a fast, near-surface, onshore wind resource during the peak power season.</p>","MDPI AG","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In wind plants, turbines can be yawed into the wind to steer their wakes away from downstream turbines and achieve an overall increase in plant power. Mathematical optimization is typically used to determine the best yaw angles at which to operate the turbines in a plant. In this paper, we present a new heuristic to rapidly determine the yaw angles in a wind plant. In this method, we define the turbine yaw angles as Boolean – either yawed at a predefined angle or nonyawed – as opposed to the typical methods of defining yaw angles as continuous or with fine discretizations. We then optimize which turbines should be yawed with an algorithm that sweeps through the turbines from the most upstream to the most downstream. We demonstrate that our new Boolean optimization method can find turbine yaw angles that perform well compared to a traditionally used gradient-based optimizer for which the yaw angles are defined as continuous. There is less than 0.6 % difference in the optimized power between the two optimization methods for randomly placed turbine layouts and less than a 0.6 % difference in the optimal annual energy production between the two optimization methods for a real wind farm. Additionally, we show that our new method is much more computationally efficient than the traditional method. For plants with nonzero optimal yaw angles, our new method is generally able to solve for the turbine yaw angles 50–150 times faster, and in some extreme cases up to 500 times faster, than the traditional method.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A simplified, efficient approach to hybrid wind and solar plant site optimization","Tripp, Charles (ORCID:0000000258673561); Guittet, Darice; King, Jennifer; Barker, Aaron","17 WIND ENERGY; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; design optimization; gradient-free methods; hybrid energy systems","<p>Abstract. Wind plant layout optimization is a difficult, complex problem with a large number of variables and many local minima. Layout optimization only becomes more difficult with the addition of solar generation. In this paper, we propose a parameterized approach to wind and solar hybrid power plant layout optimization that greatly reduces problem dimensionality while guaranteeing that the generated layouts have a desirable regular structure. Thus far, hybrid power plant optimization research has focused on system sizing. We go beyond sizing and present a practical approach to optimizing the physical layout of a wind–solar hybrid power plant. We argue that the evolution strategy class of derivative-free optimization methods is well-suited to the parameterized hybrid layout problem, and we demonstrate how hard layout constraints (e.g., placement restrictions) can be transformed into soft constraints that are amenable to optimization using evolution strategies. Next, we present experimental results on four test sites, demonstrating the viability, reliability, and effectiveness of the parameterized evolution strategy approach for generating optimized hybrid plant layouts. Completing the tool kit for parameterized layout generation, we include a brief tutorial describing how the parameterized evolutionary approach can be inspected, understood, and debugged when applied to hybrid plant layouts.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

(ORCID:0000000233629492); Tinnesand, Heidi; Rai, Raj K.; Zisman, Sagi; Duplyakin, Dmitry; Flaherty, Julia E.","17 WIND ENERGY","Due to financial and temporal limitations, the small wind community relies upon simplified wind speed models and energy production simulation tools to assess site suitability and produce energy generation expectations. While efficient and user-friendly, these models and tools are subject to errors that have been insufficiently quantified at small wind turbine heights. This study leverages observations from meteorological towers and sodars across the United States to validate wind speed estimates from the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), revealing average biases within ±0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> at small wind hub heights. Observations from small wind turbines across the United States provide references for validating energy production estimates from the System Advisor Model (SAM), Wind Report, MyWindTurbine.com, and Global Wind Atlas 3 (GWA3), which are seen to overestimate actual annual capacity factors by 2.5, 4.2, 11.5, and 7.3 percentage points, respectively. In addition to quantifying the error metrics, this paper identifies sources of model and tool discrepancies, noting that interannual fluctuation in the wind resource, wind speed class, and loss assumptions produces more variability in estimates than different horizontal and vertical interpolation techniques. The results of this study provide small wind installers and owners with information about these challenges to consider when making performance estimates and thus possible adjustments accordingly. Looking to the future, recognizing these error metrics and sources of discrepancies provides model and tool researchers and developers with opportunities for product improvement that could positively impact small wind customer confidence and the ability to finance small wind projects.","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Many probabilistic power flow approaches have been developed in the literature but their validations using realistic systems and data are lacking. This paper proposes a data-driven probabilistic analysis approach for system risk assessment of the miniWECC system using actual data. The sparse Gaussian process (SGP) is advocated to quantify the impacts of uncertain inputs on voltage security. SGP does not need the probability distribution function of uncertain inputs, can handle correlations and is highly computationally efficient. Results on the miniWECC system using realistic data show that SGP outperforms existing approaches and is able to quantify the voltage violation risks.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Geographical variability of summer- and winter-dominant onshore wind","Mahmud, Zabir; Shiraishi, Kenji; Abido, Mahmoud Y.; Millstein, Dev; Sánchez-Pérez, Pedro A.; Kurtz, Sarah","17 WIND ENERGY; geographic location; solar wind; renewable electricity; wind energy; electricity generation; wind turbines; capacity factor","For each geographical region, one of the biggest challenges in reaching a zero-carbon grid is identifying sources of electricity that match the seasonal profile of the load. Summer-dominant solar electricity generation can often be balanced by winter-dominant wind electricity generation. Together with long-duration storage, balanced solar and wind generation are well positioned to provide reliable renewable electricity. However, in some locations the wind may not complement solar energy so well. For example, currently California's wind turbines produce more electricity during summer than winter, raising the question of whether all future wind plants in California will exhibit the same seasonality. As a response to this question, in this paper, we analyzed the generation from existing California wind plants and simulated potential onshore wind resource for the whole state using a metric that reflects the relative wind resource in winter. Our results indicate that the seasonality of the wind can vary for very small spatial difference with more than half of California showing stronger wind resource in the winter compared with the summer despite the current observation of the opposite trend. This study differentiates the seasonality of potential wind resources to inform the creation of a reliable, 100%-renewable-driven grid.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Local correlation-based transition models for high-Reynolds-number wind-turbine airfoils","Jung, Yong Su; Vijayakumar, Ganesh; Ananthan, Shreyas (ORCID:0000000339664595); Baeder, James","17 WIND ENERGY; airfoil; high Reynolds number; RANS; transition; wind energy","<p>Abstract. Modern wind-turbine airfoil design requires robust performance predictions for varying thicknesses, shapes, and appropriate Reynolds numbers. The airfoils of current large offshore wind turbines operate with chord-based Reynolds numbers in the range of 3–15 million. Turbulence transition in the airfoil boundary layer is known to play an important role in the aerodynamics of these airfoils near the design operating point. While the lack of prediction of lift stall through Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is well known, airfoil design using CFD requires the accurate prediction of the glide ratio (L/D) in the linear portion of the lift polar. The prediction of the drag bucket and the glide ratio is greatly affected by the choice of the transition model in RANS CFD of airfoils. We present the performance of two existing local correlation-based transition models – one-equation model (γ− SA) and two-equation model (γ-Reθt‾- SA) coupled with the Spalart–Allmaras (SA) RANS turbulence model – for offshore wind-turbine airfoils operating at a high Reynolds number. We compare the predictions of the two transition models with available experimental and CFD data in the literature in the Reynolds number range of 3–15 million including the AVATAR project measurements of the DU00-W-212 airfoil. Both transition models predict a larger L/D compared to fully turbulent results at all Reynolds numbers. The two models exhibit similar behavior at Reynolds numbers around 3 million. However, at higher Reynolds numbers, the one-equation model fails to predict the natural transition behavior due to early transition onset. The two-equation transition model predicts the aerodynamic coefficients for airfoils of various thickness at higher Reynolds numbers up to 15 million more accurately compared to the one-equation model. As a result, the two-equation model predictions are more comparable to the predictions from eN transition model. However, a limitation of this model is observed at very high Reynolds numbers of around 12–15 million where the predictions are very sensitive to the inflow turbulent intensity. The combination of the two-equation transition model coupled with the Spalart–Allmaras (SA) RANS turbulence model is a good method for performance prediction of modern wind-turbine airfoils using CFD.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The Gaussian-shaped wake deficit model has grown in popularity in wind farm field experiments, yet its validation for larger farms and throughout annual operation remains limited. This article addresses this scientific gap, providing a model comparison of the Gaussian wind farm model with historical data of three offshore wind farms. The energy ratio is used to quantify the model’s accuracy. We assume a fixed turbulence intensity of $I_∞$ = 6% and a standard deviation on the inflow wind direction of $σ_{wd}$ = 3° in our Gaussian model. First, we demonstrate the non-uniqueness issue of $I_∞$ and $σ_{wd}$, which display a waterbed effect when considering the energy ratios. Second, we show excellent agreement between the Gaussian model and historical data for most wind directions in the Offshore Windpark Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ) and Westermost Rough wind farms (36 and 35 wind turbines, respectively) and wind turbines on the outer edges of the Anholt wind farm (110 turbines). Turbines centrally positioned in the Anholt wind farm show larger model discrepancies, likely due to deep-array effects that are not captured in the model. A second source of discrepancy is hypothesized to be inflow heterogeneity. In future work, the Gaussian wind farm model will be adapted to address those weaknesses.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Can reanalysis products outperform mesoscale numerical weather prediction models in modeling the wind resource in simple terrain?","Pronk, Vincent; Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Mike; Lundquist, Julie K.; Moriarty, Patrick; Draxl, Caroline; Purkayastha, Avi; Young, Ethan","17 WIND ENERGY; ERA-5; offshore wind; SGP; validation; WRF","Mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are generally considered more accurate than reanalysis products in characterizing the wind resource at heights of interest for wind energy, given their finer spatial resolution and more comprehensive physics. However, advancements in the latest ERA-5 reanalysis product motivate an assessment on whether ERA-5 can model wind speeds as well as a state-of-the-art NWP model – the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. We consider this research question for both simple terrain and offshore applications. Specifically, we compare wind profiles from ERA-5 and the preliminary WRF runs of the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit Long-term Ensemble Dataset (WTK-LED) to those observed by lidars at a site in Oklahoma, United States, and in a United States Atlantic offshore wind energy area. We find that ERA-5 shows a significant negative bias (~-1ms-1) at both locations, with a larger bias at the land-based site. WTK-LED-predicted wind speed profiles show a limited negative bias (~-0.5ms-1) offshore and a slight positive bias (~+0.5ms-1) at the land-based site. On the other hand, we find that ERA-5 outperforms WTK-LED in terms of the centered root-mean-square error (cRMSE) and correlation coefficient, for both the land-based and offshore cases, in all atmospheric stability conditions. We find that WTK-LED's higher cRMSE is caused by its tendency to overpredict the amplitude of the wind speed diurnal cycle. At the land-based site, this is partially caused by wind plant wake effects not being accurately captured by WTK-LED.","Copernicus Publications","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Rapid approach for structural design of the tower and monopile for a series of 25 MW offshore turbines","Escalera Mendoza, Alejandra S.; Griffith, D. Todd; Qin, Chris; Loth, Eric; Johnson, Nick","17 WIND ENERGY; large-scale wind turbines; levelized cost of energy; monopile; structural design; tower","The goal of further reducing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) has driven the investigation of large-scale wind turbines. This work presents a simple, rapid and detailed approach for the structural design of the tower and monopile without a controller, but with frequency and high fidelity structural verification. The approach uses an optimization to reduce the mass of the structures while meeting strength, buckling and geometric constraints by using analytical equations. A verification of frequency constraints is performed with BModes, and ANSYS Mechanical APDL is used for high fidelity verification of stress and buckling. The approach is applied to study the design space of three 25 MW offshore wind turbines with different rotor diameters and cone angles, and to evaluate the nacelle center of mass fore-aft location effect. Results obtained show that the tower and monopile are more susceptible to changes in the rotor thrust than the overturning moment even for designs with high pre-cone angle and large distance of the nacelle center of mass from the tower axis. But it is possible to obtain structurally feasible tower and monopile designs for the three 25 MW turbines studied while not exceeding diameter and wall thickness limits. However, mass penalties can be decreased by 0.8-14%, to further reduce the cost of energy, by increasing the diameter limit which may require manufacturing technology development. The approach applied and studies serve to understand the design space of the tower and monopile for a 25 MW turbine, and provide baseline designs that can be used in the development of a controller and evaluation of a full suite of design load cases.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurate prediction of CAP dynamics presents a challenge for mesoscale forecast models, in part because CAPs occur in regions of complex terrain, where traditional turbulence parameterizations may not be appropriate. This study examines the effects of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme and horizontal diffusion treatment on CAP prediction in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Model runs with a one-dimensional (1D) PBL scheme and Smagorinsky-like horizontal diffusion are compared to runs that use a new three-dimensional (3D) PBL scheme to calculate turbulent fluxes. Simulations are completed in a nested configuration with 3 km/750 m horizontal grid spacing over a 10-day case study in the Columbia River basin, and results are compared to observations from the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project. Using event-averaged error metrics, potential temperature and wind speed errors are shown to decrease both with increased horizontal grid resolution, and with improved treatment of horizontal diffusion over steep terrain. The 3D PBL scheme further reduces errors relative to a standard 1D PBL approach. Error reduction is accentuated during CAP erosion, when turbulent mixing plays a more dominant role in the dynamics. Lastly, the 3D PBL scheme is shown to reduce near-surface overestimates of turbulence kinetic energy during the CAP event. The sensitivity of turbulence predictions to the master length scale formulation in the 3D PBL parameterization is also explored.","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Turbine scale and siting considerations in wind plant layout optimization and implications for capacity density","Stanley, Andrew P.J.; Roberts, Owen; Lopez, Anthony; Williams, Travis; Barker, Aaron","17 WIND ENERGY; capacity density; setback constraints; siting considerations; turbine scale; wind farm layout optimization","Improvements in wind energy technology, reduced costs, and ambitious clean energy goals have led to projections of high wind contribution in coming years. Developing methodologies to design wind plants with a variety of siting constraints and turbine sizes helps enable high wind penetration, and gain a better understanding of how wind plants are sensitive to setback constraints and turbine design. In this paper, we present a two-step optimization method to simultaneously determine the optimal number of turbines and their locations in a wind plant domain divided into many small, discrete parcels. We present the optimized performance metrics of a wind plant optimized with different turbine sizes and ratings, and with different siting restrictions within the wind plant. Our results indicate that taller and larger turbines are more sensitive to increasing siting constraints. We also compare the optimal wind plant layouts and performance for wind plants optimized for minimum COE and maximum profit. Wind plants optimized for profit had 130%-190% of the capacity of plants optimized for COE, which demonstrates that the optimal results are greatly affected by the objective function, which should be carefully considered. Finally, in this paper we demonstrate the effect of increasing siting constraints on wind plant capacity density, and how the results change when different land areas are used to calculate capacity density. When using the entire wind plant boundary area to determine capacity density, increasing siting constraints decreases the capacity density. However, when we only use the available area (the area left after removing the siting constraints) to calculate the capacity density, increasing the siting constraints increases capacity density. This is a critical insight because of how capacity density is typically defined and used in research, and has important implications for assessment of technical potential and capacity expansion modeling, as well as future wind deployment potential.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind turbines in wind farms often operate in waked or partially waked conditions, which can greatly increase the fatigue damage. Some fatigue considerations may be included, but currently a full fidelity analysis of the increased damage a turbine experiences in a wind farm is not considered in wind farm layout optimization because existing models are too computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a model to calculate fatigue damage caused by partial waking on a wind turbine that is computationally efficient and can be included in wind farm layout optimization. The model relies on analytic velocity, turbulence, and load models commonly used in farm research and design, and it captures some of the effects of turbulence on the fatigue loading. Compared to high-fidelity simulation data, our model accurately predicts the damage trends of various waking conditions. We also perform example wind farm layout optimizations with our presented model in which we maximize the annual energy production (AEP) of a wind farm while constraining the damage of the turbines in the farm. The results of our optimization show that the turbine damage can be significantly reduced, more than 10 %, with only a small sacrifice of around 0.07 % to the AEP, or the damage can be reduced by 20 % with an AEP sacrifice of 0.6 %.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Design workflows traditionally rely on iterative optimization methods using low-fidelity integral boundary-layer methods as higher-fidelity adjoint-based computational fluid dynamics methods are computationally expensive. Surrogate-based approaches can accelerate the design process but still rely on some iterative inverse design procedure. In this work, we leverage emerging invertible neural network (INN) tools to enable the rapid inverse design of airfoil shapes for wind turbines. INNs are specialized deep-learning models with well-defined inverse mappings. When trained appropriately, INN surrogate models are capable of forward prediction of aerodynamic and structural quantities for a given airfoil shape as well as inverse recovery of airfoil shapes with specified aerodynamic and structural characteristics. The INN approach offers a roughly 100 times speed-up compared to adjoint-based methods for inverse design. We demonstrate the INN tool for inverse design on three test cases of 100 airfoils each that satisfy the performance characteristics close to those of airfoils used in wind-turbine blades. All generated shapes satisfy the desired aerodynamic characteristics, demonstrating the success of the INN approach for inverse design of airfoils.","AIAA","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To compare a wind turbine's performance, a direct comparison on power outputs is always confounded by the stochastic effect of weather inputs. It is therefore crucial to control for the weather and environmental influence. Toward that objective, our study proposes an energy decomposition approach. We start with comparing the change in the total energy production and refer to the change in total energy as delta energy. On this delta energy, we apply our decomposition method, which is to separate the portion of energy change due to weather effects from that due to the turbine itself. We derive a set of mathematical relationships allowing us to perform this decomposition and examine the credibility and robustness of the proposed decomposition approach through extensive cross-validation and case studies. We then apply the decomposition approach to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data associated with several wind turbines to which leading-edge protection was carried out. Our study shows that the leading-edge protection applied on blades may cause a small decline to the power production efficiency in the short term, although we expect the leading-edge protection to benefit the blade's reliability in the long term.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, we simulate flow over two parallel ridges with a wind turbine on one of the ridges, focusing on conditions observed during the Perdigão field campaign in 2017. Two case studies are selected to be representative of typical flow conditions at the site, including the effects of atmospheric stability: a stable case where a mountain wave occurs (as in ~50% of the nights observed) and a convective case where a recirculation zone forms in the lee of the ridge with the turbine (as occurred over 50% of the time with upstream winds normal to the ridgeline). We use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), dynamically downscaled from the mesoscale (6.75 km resolution) to microscale large-eddy simulation (LES) at 10 m resolution, where a generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine parameterization is used to simulate turbine wakes. We compare the WRF–LES–GAD model results to data from meteorological towers, lidars, and a tethered lifting system, showing good qualitative and quantitative agreement for both case studies. Significantly, the wind turbine wake shows different amounts of vertical deflection from the terrain and persistence downstream in the two stability regimes. In the stable case, the wake follows the terrain along with the mountain wave and deflects downwards by nearly 100 m below hub height at four rotor diameters downstream. In the convective case, the wake deflects above the recirculation zone over 40 m above hub height at the same downstream distance. Overall, the WRF–LES–GAD model is able to capture the observed behavior of the wind turbine wakes, demonstrating the model's ability to represent wakes over complex terrain for two distinct and representative atmospheric stability classes, and, potentially, to improve wind turbine siting and operation in hilly landscapes.","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Accelerated Wind-Turbine Wake Recovery Through Actuation of the Tip-Vortex Instability","Brown, Kenneth; Houck, Daniel; Maniaci, David; Westergaard, Carsten; Kelley, Christopher","17 WIND ENERGY","Advances in wind-plant control have often focused on more effectively balancing power between neighboring turbines. Wake steering is one such method that provides control-based improvements in a quasi-static way, but this does little to fundamentally change the wake recovery process, and thus, it has limited potential. This study investigates use of another control paradigm known as dynamic wake control (DWC) to excite the mutual inductance instability between adjacent tip-vortex structures, thereby accelerating the breakdown of the structures. The current work carries this approach beyond the hypothetical by applying the excitation via turbine control vectors that already exist on all modern wind turbines: blade pitch and rotor speed control. The investigation leverages a free-vortex wake method (FVWM) that allows a thorough exploration of relevant frequencies and amplitudes of harmonic forcing for each control vector (as well as the phase difference between the vectors for a tandem configuration) while still capturing the essential tip-vortex dynamics. The FVWM output feeds into a Fourier stability analysis working to pinpoint candidate DWC strategies suggesting fastest wake recovery. Near-wake length reductions of >80% are demonstrated, although without considering inflow turbulence. Analysis is provided to interpret these predictions considering the presence of turbulence in a real atmospheric inflow.","AIAA","","Sandia National Lab.

To this end, we engineer two-axis anti-windup proportional-integral regulators that serve to ride through restoration disturbances. We also design an active protection system to prevent wind turbines from stalling during recovery from blackouts.

Combining LES with a family of lower-fidelity models, called actuator line models (ALMs), has grown in popularity in the past decade. ALM replaces full blade resolution with an array of actuator points or lines parameterized by aerodynamic lift/drag polar plots along the blades. Body forces computed based on these actuator points are then projected onto the LES flow mesh, mimicking the effect of rotating blades on the flow. However, the optimal projection radius and the associated LES grid size is often too restrictive for multirotor simulations. Recently, a new tip-correction-based filtered ALM (F-ALM) was proposed by Martinez-Tossas and Meneveau (2019), which allows coarser-than-optimal grids by avoiding the associated overprediction of thrust. In this work, F-ALM is implemented into a high-order, in-house LES code to simulate National Renewable Energy Laboratory Phase VI wind turbine. It is then followed by a comparison between the baseline ALM and the newly implemented F-ALM in terms of instantaneous and time-averaged flow fields and blade loads, revealing the advantages of F-ALM in preventing the overprediction of power on coarse grids. Finally, this encourages accurate and affordable simulations of multirotor devices in the future.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"What can surface wind observations tell us about interannual variation in wind energy output?","Millstein, Dev; Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan","17 WIND ENERGY; capacity factor; surface wind observations","The past decade of wind power growth was supported by capacity factor improvements and associated cost reductions. But are higher capacity factors a technology success story or, as suggested by recent research, has the influence of technology been overstated by ignoring positive surface wind speed trends? The answer could influence estimates of wind energy's cost and even future deployment rates. We find that US surface wind speed observations imply a 2.6% improvement in capacity factors from 2010 to 2019. Yet newer vintages of wind plants have recorded capacity factors that are ~25% larger than plants built close to 2010. It follows that technological factors and improved site quality, not higher wind speeds, drove most of the improvement in capacity factors. Additionally, we match hundreds of meteorological stations to nearby (< 25 km) wind plants and compare annual estimated generation, based on a function of surface wind speed observations, to annual recorded generation. Researchers rely on this publicly available surface data because measurements co-located with wind plants are generally considered proprietary. Our analysis addresses a research gap: interannual variation in observed surface wind speeds is rarely compared to observed data at wind plant locations and turbine heights. We find that despite its common use for this purpose, generation estimates based on publicly available surface observational data provide a poor proxy for interannual variability in recorded wind generation. These findings suggest that caution is generally needed when researchers use surface wind speed measurements to investigate long-term wind energy trends.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Stochastic agent-based model for predicting turbine-scale raptor movements during updraft-subsidized directional flights","Sandhu, Rimple; Tripp, Charles; Quon, Eliot; Thedin, Regis; Lawson, Michael; Brandes, David; Farmer, Christopher J.; Miller, Tricia A.; Draxl, Caroline; Doubrawa, Paula; Williams, Lindy; Duerr, Adam E.; Braham, Melissa A.; Katzner, Todd","17 WIND ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; agent-based movement model; behavior modeling; golden eagles; raptor conservation; stochastic modeling; wind-wildlife interactions","Rapid expansion of wind energy development across the world has highlighted the need to better understand turbine-caused avian mortality. The risk to golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) is of particular concern due to their small population size and conservation status. Golden eagles subsidize their flight in part by soaring in orographic updrafts, which can place them in conflict with wind turbines utilizing the same low-altitude wind resource. Understanding the behavior of soaring raptors in varying atmospheric conditions can therefore be relevant to predicting and mitigating their risk of collision. We present a predictive movement model that simulates individual paths of golden eagles during directional flight (such as migration) that is subsidized by orographic updraft. We modeled eagles in a 50 km by 50 km study area in Wyoming containing three wind power plants with documented golden eagle collisions with turbines. The movement model is applicable to any region where ground elevation is known at turbine scale (50 m) and wind conditions are known at facility scale (3 km). For a given set of atmospheric conditions, the model simulates movements of thousands of orographic soaring eagles to produce a density map quantifying the relative probability of eagle presence. We validated the simulated tracks with GPS telemetry data showing four directional tracks made by golden eagles transiting through the area in 2019 and 2020. For each eagle track, validation was performed using the ratio of the model-simulated eagle presence likelihood with uniform eagle presence and the presence computed using directed random-walk movements. We found that the predictive performance of the model was significantly better (likelihood ratio 1) for low-altitude movements than high-altitude movements that can involve thermal-soaring. We employed the model to produce seasonal presence maps for migrating golden eagles. We found significant turbine-level variations in eagle presence between northerly and southerly migration routes through the study area. Overall, the proposed model offers a generalizable, probabilistic, and predictive tool to assist wind energy developers, ecologists, wildlife managers, and industry consultants in estimating the potential for conflict between soaring birds and wind turbines, thereby reducing the need for site-specific data on golden eagle movements.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Efforts were made to provide physical justifications to the changes and to limit the number of additional parameters requiring tuning, so that the modified model can be applied to other floating wind systems. With the proposed modifications, the predictions of the low-frequency surge and pitch wave loads on a fixed floater and the resonance responses of a floating structure are both significantly improved with a single set of model coefficients, which leads to good agreement with the measurements from the OC6 wave-basin experimental campaign.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We investigate the sensitivity of turbine-height wind speed forecast to initial condition (IC) uncertainties over the Columbia River Gorge (CRG) and Columbia River Basin (CRB) for two typical weather phenomena, i.e., local-thermal-gradient-induced marine air intrusion and a cold frontal passage. Four types of turbine-height wind forecast anomalies and their associated IC uncertainties related to local thermal gradients and large-scale circulations are identified using the self-organizing map (SOM) technique. The four SOM types are categorized into two patterns, each accounting for half of the ensemble members. The first pattern corresponds to IC uncertainties that alter the wind forecast through a modulating weather system, which produces the strongest wind anomalies in the CRG and CRB. In the second pattern, the moderate uncertainties in local thermal gradient and large-scale circulation jointly contribute to wind forecast anomaly. We analyze the cross section of wind and temperature anomalies through the gorge to explore the evolution of vertical features of each SOM type. The turbine-height wind anomalies induced by large-scale IC uncertainties are more concentrated near the front. In contrast, turbine-height wind anomalies induced by the local IC thermal uncertainties are found above the surface thermal anomalies. Moreover, the wind forecast accuracy in the CRG and CRB is limited by IC uncertainties in a few specific regions, e.g., the 2 m temperature within the basin and large-scale circulation over the northeast Pacific around 140∘ W.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The SST features medium-frequency isolation, full controllability for voltage regulation, reactive power compensation, and the capability of battery energy storage system (BESS) integration with multiport configuration. The HT has a partially-rated converter for fractional controllability and can integrate a small BESS. Fast grid-edge voltage fluctuations from increased solar photovoltaic (PV) and electric vehicle (EV) penetration are difficult to manage for mechanical load tap changers. Hence, along with the trend towards more BESS in the grid, the controllability and the storage integration capability of the SST and HT are of strong interest. However, a review of literature shows existing SST and HT research is mostly at converter level, while system-level assessments are scarce. Assessing technical and economic impacts is critical to understanding the benefits and role of the SST and HT to guide future research, which is presented for the first time in this article. Experimental results from medium-voltage (MV) SST and MV HT prototypes are shown to confirm equipment-level feasibility, where the voltage controllability waveforms of a MV HT prototype are reported for the first time. Comparative simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 34-bus system. Here, a grid-model-less decentralized grid-edge voltage control method and a day-ahead BESS dispatch method are proposed for the SST and HT. The simulations show that the SST and HT with integrated storage can host more PV, achieve peak shaving, mitigate voltage fluctuation and reverse power flow, and support energy arbitrage for operational cost reduction, as compared to the LFT. Moreover, comprehensive analyses of net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) are performed under different installed PV capacities, HT’s partial converter ratings, and BESS capacities. Sensitivities to future cost reductions of the PV and BESS are studied. Although the NPV and IRR are currently negative, 60% capital cost reduction or 150% revenue increase will make the SST and HT economically viable in the use case studied.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2022-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3771-3787","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2022.3144361","","2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","1892475","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892475","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892475","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"
"A reference open-source controller for fixed and floating offshore wind turbines","Abbas, Nikhar J. (ORCID:0000000218383463); Zalkind, Daniel S.; Pao, Lucy; Wright, Alan","17 WIND ENERGY; control; ROSCO; wind turbine","<p>Abstract. This paper describes the development of a new reference controller framework for fixed and floating offshore wind turbines that greatly facilitates controller tuning and represents standard industry practices. The reference wind turbine controllers that are most commonly cited in the literature have been developed to work with specific reference wind turbines. Although these controllers have provided standard control functionalities, they are often not easy to modify for use on other turbines, so it has been challenging for researchers to run representative, fully dynamic simulations of other wind turbine designs. The Reference Open-Source Controller (ROSCO) has been developed to provide a modular reference wind turbine controller that represents industry standards and performs comparably to or better than existing reference controllers. The formulation of the ROSCO controller logic and tuning processes is presented in this paper. Control capabilities such as tip speed ratio tracking generator torque control, minimum pitch saturation, wind speed estimation, and a smoothing algorithm at near-rated operation are included to provide modern controller features. A floating offshore wind turbine feedback module is also included to facilitate growing research in the floating offshore arena. All of the standard controller implementations and control modules are automatically tuned such that a non-controls engineer or automated optimization routine can easily improve the controller performance. This article provides the framework and theoretical basis for the ROSCO controller modules and generic tuning processes. Simulations of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW reference wind turbine and International Energy Agency 15 MW reference turbine on the University of Maine semisubmersible platform are analyzed to demonstrate the controller's performance in both fixed and floating configurations, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate ROSCO's peak shaving routine to reduce maximum rotor thrusts by over 10 % compared to the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine controller on the land-based turbine and to reduce maximum platform pitch angles by nearly 30 % when using the platform feedback routine instead of a more traditional low-bandwidth controller.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Enabling further blade growth will require technology innovation. An emerging solution to overcome logistics constraints is to segment the blades spanwise and chordwise, which is effective, but the additional field-assembled joints result in added mass and loads, as well as increased reliability concerns in operation. An alternative to this methodology is to design slender flexible blades that can be shipped on rail lines by flexing during transport. However, the increased flexibility is challenging to accommodate with a typical glass-fiber, upwind design. In a two-part paper series, several design options are evaluated to enable slender flexible blades: downwind machines, optimized carbon fiber, and active aerodynamic controls. Part 1 presents the system-level optimization of the rotor variants as compared to conventional and segmented baselines, with a low-fidelity representation of the blades. The present work, Part 2, supplements the system-level optimization in Part 1 with high-fidelity blade structural optimization to ensure that the designs are at feasible optima with respect to material strength and fatigue limits, as well as global stability and structural dynamics constraints. To accommodate the requirements of the design process, a new version of the Numerical Manufacturing And Design (NuMAD) code has been developed and released. The code now supports laminate-level blade optimization and an interface to the International Energy Agency Wind Task 37 blade ontology. Transporting long, flexible blades via controlled flapwise bending is found to be a viable approach for blades of up to 100m. The results confirm that blade mass can be substantially reduced by going either to a downwind design or to a highly coned and tilted upwind design. A discussion of active and inactive constraints consisting of material rupture, fatigue damage, buckling, deflection, and resonant frequencies is presented. An analysis of driving load cases revealed that the downwind designs are dominated by loads from sudden, abrupt events like gusts rather than fatigue. Finally, an analysis of carbon fiber spar caps for downwind machines finds that, compared to typical carbon fibers, the use of a new heavy-tow carbon fiber in the spar caps is found to yield between 9 % and 13 % cost savings.","Copernicus GmbH","","Sandia National Lab.

"Data-driven wind turbine wake modeling via probabilistic machine learning","Ashwin Renganathan, S.; Maulik, Romit; Letizia, Stefano; Iungo, Giacomo Valerio","17 WIND ENERGY; deep neural networks; Gaussian process; machine Learning; wind energy","Wind farm design primarily depends on the variability of the wind turbine wake flows to the atmospheric wind conditions and the interaction between wakes. Physics-based models that capture the wake flow field with high-fidelity are computationally very expensive to perform layout optimization of wind farms, and, thus, data-driven reduced-order models can represent an efficient alternative for simulating wind farms. In this work, we use real-world light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of wind-turbine wakes to construct predictive surrogate models using machine learning. Specifically, we first demonstrate the use of deep autoencoders to find a low-dimensional latent space that gives a computationally tractable approximation of the wake LiDAR measurements. Then, we learn the mapping between the parameter space and the (latent space) wake flow fields using a deep neural network. Additionally, we also demonstrate the use of a probabilistic machine learning technique, namely, Gaussian process modeling, to learn the parameter-space-latent-space mapping in addition to the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the data. Finally, to cope with training large datasets, we demonstrate the use of variational Gaussian process models that provide a tractable alternative to the conventional Gaussian process models for large datasets. Furthermore, we introduce the use of active learning to adaptively build and improve a conventional Gaussian process model predictive capability. Overall, we find that our approach provides accurate approximations of the wind-turbine wake flow field that can be queried at an orders-of-magnitude cheaper cost than those generated with high-fidelity physics-based simulations.","Springer Nature","","Argonne National Lab.

These species are dispersed within their range, making it impractical to estimate census populations size using traditional survey methods. Nonetheless, understanding population size and trends is essential for evaluating and mitigating risk from wind turbine mortality. Using various sampling techniques, including systematic acoustic sampling and genetic analyses, we argue that building a weight of evidence regarding bat population status and trends is possible to (1) assess the sustainability of mortality associated with wind turbines; (2) determine the level of mitigation required; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures to ensure population viability for these species. Long-term, systematic data collection remains the most viable option for reducing uncertainty regarding population trends for migratory tree-roosting bats. We recommend collecting acoustic data using the statistically robust North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) protocols and that genetic diversity is monitored at repeated time intervals to show species trends. There are no short-term actions to resolve these population-level questions; however, we discuss opportunities for relatively short-term investments that will lead to long-term success in reducing uncertainty.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two common PTC policies are studied – in the first policy, a wind farm receives PTC by selling wind generation to the market and its storage can be used to store energy from the wind generation and energy purchased from the grid but the energy released from the storage cannot receive PTC; in the second policy, the energy released from the storage can also qualify for PTC but purchasing energy from the grid is not allowed. We then employ dynamic programming to study merchants' optimal decision-making while considering PTC and the physical characteristics of storage systems. We analytically show that the state of charge (SOC) range can be segmented into different regions by SOC reference points under two PTC policies. The merchant's optimal action can be conveniently and uniquely determined based on the region within which the current SOC falls. Moreover, this study illustrates that PTC could substantially alter the optimal scheduling policy structures by affecting reference points and their relationships. The results showed that the frequencies for charging and discharging storage decisions decreased with an increase in PTC subsidy. Last, we confirm that, although the first policy allows merchants to buy electricity from the market, the second policy can bring more profits when the PTC is large at the current PTC rates. Furthermore, the findings can provide multistage decision-making guidance to electricity merchants in the wholesale power market.","Elsevier","","Missouri Univ. of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

However, estimates of RE potentials are characterized by large uncertainties stemming from methodological assumptions that vary across studies, including factors such as the suitability of land and the performance and configuration of technology. Based on a synthesis of modeling approaches and parameter values used in prior studies, we explore the implications of these uncertain assumptions for onshore wind and solar photovoltaic electricity generation projections globally using the Global Change Analysis Model. We show that variability in parametric assumptions related to land use (e.g. land suitability) are responsible for the most substantial uncertainty in both wind and solar generation projections. Additionally, assumptions about the average turbine installation density and turbine technology are responsible for substantial uncertainty in wind generation projections. Under scenarios that account for climate impacts on wind and solar energy, we find that these parametric uncertainties are far more significant than those emerging from differences in climate models and scenarios in a global assessment, but uncertainty surrounding climate impacts (across models and scenarios) have significant effects regionally, especially for wind. Our analysis suggests the need for studies focusing on long-term energy system transitions to account for this uncertainty.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Acoustic Exposure to Turbine Operation Quantifies Risk to Bats at Commercial Wind Energy Facilities","Peterson, Trevor S.; Mcgill, Brian; Hein, Cris D.; Rusk, Adam","17 WIND ENERGY; 60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; acoustic monitoring; aerosphere; bat mortality; informed curtailment; West Virginia; wind energy; bat fatality; smart curtailment","Turbine-related bat mortality at commercial wind energy facilities may threaten populations of migratory tree-roosting bat species in North America. Industry stakeholders and regulatory agencies alike are investigating strategies to reduce risk of population-level consequences as the wind energy industry grows. Bats collide with turbines only when turbine rotors are spinning and curtailing turbine operation at low wind speeds can effectively reduce bat fatality rates. Nonetheless, few quantitative data exist to determine appropriate threshold wind speeds below which turbine operations should be curtailed. Carcass monitoring is labor-intensive and does not provide information on factors linked to bat fatality rates on any scale finer than nightly. We tested whether acoustic bat data recorded at turbine nacelles could provide a more precise and sensitive measure of fatality risk to bats by analyzing acoustics, weather, turbine operation, and carcass data collected at 2 commercial wind energy facilities in West Virginia over 7 years. Each wind facility implemented several distinct curtailment treatments during our study, allowing us to compare fatality rates and acoustic bat activity across multiple operational strategies. We found that bat passes exposed to turbine operation explained close to 80% of the variation in carcass-based estimates of bat fatality rates and accounted for significant variation in raw carcass counts per turbine and probability of finding bat carcasses during individual turbine searches. Conversely, bat activity occurring when turbines were not operating had little or no relationship to fatality rates. We also found that patterns in bat activity exposure could be predicted accurately among turbines and years. Our results demonstrate that measuring exposure of acoustic bat activity provides a quantitative basis for designing, evaluating, and adaptively managing curtailment strategies. Furthermore, this is an important advance towards using curtailment to reduce bat fatality rates strategically while allowing for increased generation of renewable energy.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Stantec Consulting Services Inc., Topsham, ME (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

The soil-structure interaction model comes from the REDWIN project and uses an elastoplastic, macroelement model with kinematic hardening, which captures the stiffness and damping characteristics of offshore wind foundations more accurately than more traditional and simplified soil-structure interaction modeling approaches. Participants in the OC6 project integrated this macroelement capability to coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic offshore wind turbine modeling tools and verified the implementation by comparing simulation results across the modeling tools for an example monopile design. The simulation results were also compared to more traditional soil-structure interaction modeling approaches like apparent fixity, coupled springs, and distributed springs models. The macroelement approach resulted in smaller overall loading in the system due to both shifts in the system frequencies and increased energy dissipation. No validation work was performed, but the macroelement approach has shown increased accuracy within the REDWIN project, resulting in decreased uncertainty in the design. For the monopile design investigated here, that implies a less conservative and thus more cost-effective offshore wind design.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A single fixed yaw offset, rather than an optimized offset schedule, is alternately applied to an upstream wind turbine, and the effect on downstream turbines is analyzed. This experimental design allows for comparison with engineering wake models independent of the controller's ability to track a varying offset and correctly measure wind direction. Additionally, by applying the same offset in beneficial and detrimental conditions, we are able to collect important data for assessing second-order wake model predictions. Results of the article from collected data show good agreement with the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS) engineering model and offer support for the asymmetry of wake steering predicted by newer models, such as the Gauss–curl hybrid model.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dynamic <em>P-Q</em> Capability and Abnormal Operation Analysis of a Wind Turbine with Doubly-Fed Induction Generator","Lu, Bing; Li, Shuhui; Das, Himadry Shekhar; Gao, Yixiang; Wang, Jing; Baggu, Murali","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; doubly-fed induction generator; P-Q capability charts; subsynchronous oscillation; vector control; wind power","After several accidents occurred in wind farms in the United States and around the world, the subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) issues in grid-connected wind farms have gained serious attention. Particularly, these issues have caused significant challenges to wind turbines with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) because it is connected to the grid via both its stator and rotor paths. Traditionally, a P-Q capability chart is utilized to assure the safe operation boundary for a synchronous generator. But the energy conversion characteristics of a DFIG wind turbine are completely different. A critical factor to affect the reliable operation of a DFIG wind turbine is the rated current and pulse-width modulation (PWM) saturation constraints of its power converters. These constraint conditions can be affected by the wind turbine rotating speed and grid conditions. However, a detailed study of DFIG P-Q capability from these perspectives has not been conducted, which has hindered adequate understanding of many abnormal wind turbine operations reported in the literature and the development of advanced control technologies to overcome the challenges. The proposed study in this paper considers vector control implementation to DFIG power electronic converters in the dq reference frame, and the models and algorithms developed for the P-Q capability study have addressed specific DFIG power converter constraints that are different from those of a traditional synchronous generator. The paper especially focuses on exploring the dynamic natures of DFIG P-Q capability under uncertain and variable conditions to explore the root causes of many abnormal operations of DFIG wind turbines reported in the literature. The proposed study is validated through an electromagnetic transient simulation model of a grid-connected DFIG wind turbine. The proposed study has the potential to lead to the development of new DFIG control technologies that can help overcome the challenges for many abnormal operations of DFIG wind turbines.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A review of modelling techniques for floating offshore wind turbines","Otter, Aldert; Murphy, Jimmy; Pakrashi, Vikram; Robertson, Amy; Desmond, Cian","17 WIND ENERGY; floating offshore wind; numerical modelling; physical testing; scale models","Modelling floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) is challenging due to the strong coupling between the aerodynamics of the turbine and the hydrodynamics of the floating platform. Physical testing at scale is faced with the additional challenge of the scaling mismatch between Froude number and Reynolds number due to working in the two fluid domains, air and water. In the drive for cost-reduction of floating wind energy, designers may be seeking to move towards high-fidelity numerical modelling as a substitute for physical testing. However, the numerical engineering tools typically used for FOWT modelling are considered as mid-fidelity to low-fidelity tools, and currently lack the level of accuracy required to do so. Furthermore, there is a lack of operational FOWT data available for further development and validation. High-fidelity tools, such as CFD, have greater accuracy but are cumbersome tools and still require validation. Physical scale model testing therefore continues to play an essential role in the development of FOWTs both as a source of validation data for numerical models and as an important development step along the path to commercialization of all platform concepts. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of both numerical modelling and physical FOWT scale model testing approaches and to provide guidance on the selection of the most appropriate approach (or combination of approaches). The current state-of-the-art will be discussed along with current research trends and areas for further investigation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To provide comprehensive information that will assist in making decisions regarding the adoption of lidar-assisted control (LAC) in wind turbine design, this paper investigates the impact of different turbulence models on the coherence between the rotor-effective wind speed and lidar measurement. First, the differences between the Kaimal and Mann models are discussed, including the power spectrum and spatial coherence. Next, two types of lidar systems are examined to analyze the lidar measurement coherence based on commercially available lidar scan patterns. Finally, numerical simulations have been performed to compare the lidar measurement coherence for different rotor sizes. This work confirms the association between the measurement coherence and the turbulence model. The results indicate that the lidar measurement coherence with the Mann turbulence model is lower than that with the Kaimal turbulence model. In other words, the potential value creation of LAC based on simulations during the wind turbine design phase, evaluated using the Kaimal turbulence model, will be diminished if the Mann turbulence model is used instead. In particular, the difference in coherence is more significant for larger rotors. As a result, this paper suggests that the impacts of different turbulence models should be considered uncertainties while evaluating the benefits of LAC.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, we explore how the costs incurred to install turbines at a wind power plant—the balance-of-system (BOS) costs—scale with turbine rating, hub height, and plant size. We also investigate how these changes in BOS costs influence the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). We show that increasing the plant size from 150 to 400 MW could reduce the BOS costs by 21%. We also show that if the foundation costs decreased by 50%, building a wind power plant with 5-MW turbines (having rotor diameters of 166 m and hub heights of 120 m) could decrease the LCOE by 5%. These results could help inform future BOS cost-reduction opportunities and thereby reduce future capital costs for land-based wind power.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When designing the floating platforms, both experimental and numerical tools are applied, with the latter often using time-domain solvers based on hydro-load estimation from a Morison approach or a boundary element method. Commercial software packages such as OrcaFlex, or open-source software such as OpenFAST, are often used where the floater is modeled as a rigid six degree-of-freedom body with loads applied at the center of gravity. However, for final structural design, it is necessary to have information on the distribution of loads over the entire body and to know local internal loads in each component. This paper uses the TetraSpar floating offshore wind turbine design as a case study to examine new modeling approaches in OrcaFlex and OpenFAST that provide this information. The study proves the possibility of applying the approach and the extraction of internal loads, while also presenting an initial code-to-code verification between OrcaFlex and OpenFAST. As can be expected, comparing the flexible model to a rigid-body model proves how motion and loads are affected by the flexibility of the structure. OrcaFlex and OpenFAST generally agree, but there are some differences in results due to different modeling approaches. Since no experimental data are available in the study, this paper only forms a baseline for future studies but still proves and describes the possibilities of the approach and codes.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Results from a wake-steering experiment at a commercial wind plant: investigating the wind speed dependence of wake-steering performance","Simley, Eric; Fleming, Paul; Girard, Nicolas; Alloin, Lucas; Godefroy, Emma; Duc, Thomas","17 WIND ENERGY; field experiment; nacelle lidar; wake steering; wind farm control","Wake steering is a wind farm control strategy in which upstream wind turbines are misaligned with the wind to redirect their wakes away from downstream turbines, thereby increasing the net wind plant power production and reducing fatigue loads generated by wake turbulence. In this paper, we present results from a wake-steering experiment at a commercial wind plant involving two wind turbines spaced 3.7 rotor diameters apart. During the 3-month experiment period, we estimate that wake steering reduced wake losses by 5.6% for the wind direction sector investigated. After applying a long-term correction based on the site wind rose, the reduction in wake losses increases to 9.3%. As a function of wind speed, we find large energy improvements near cut-in wind speed, where wake steering can prevent the downstream wind turbine from shutting down. Yet for wind speeds between 6–8 m/s, we observe little change in performance with wake steering. However, wake steering was found to improve energy production significantly for below-rated wind speeds from 8–12 m/s. By measuring the relationship between yaw misalignment and power production using a nacelle lidar, we attribute much of the improvement in wake-steering performance at higher wind speeds to a significant reduction in the power loss of the upstream turbine as wind speed increases. Additionally, we find higher wind direction variability at lower wind speeds, which contributes to poor performance in the 6–8 m/s wind speed bin because of slow yaw controller dynamics. Further, we compare the measured performance of wake steering to predictions using the FLORIS (FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State) wind farm control tool coupled with a wind direction variability model. Although the achieved yaw offsets at the upstream wind turbine fall short of the intended yaw offsets, we find that they are predicted well by the wind direction variability model. When incorporating the expected yaw offsets, estimates of the energy improvement from wake steering using FLORIS closely match the experimental results.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this article, two challenges in existing insulation coordination designs for grid-connected SSTs are identified. One challenge is the mismatch between metal-oxide varistor (MOV) protective levels and SST insulation strength, the other challenge is the incompatibility of standard impulse test on SST protective structures. To address the MOV selection challenge, a novel lightning protection scheme is designed to protect a single-stage SST where the semiconductor modules are directly exposed to external lightning impulses. Here, the in-lab lightning impulse tests are performed to verify the overvoltage attenuation performance of the prototyped lightning protection scheme. To address the impulse test challenge, the surge withstand capability of the protected SST is comprehensively evaluated with a complete set of insulation coordination design procedures beyond the basic insulation level (BIL) test. After these two challenges are addressed, a discussion is presented on substituting conventional transformers with the protected SSTs into insulation-coordinated distribution systems to facilitate the field deployment of SSTs.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3746-3758","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-6777","10.1109/jestpe.2021.3125708","","2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","1892478","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892478","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892478","IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","4","10"

"Assessing boundary condition and parametric uncertainty in numerical-weather-prediction-modeled, long-term offshore wind speed through machine learning and analog ensemble","Bodini, Nicola; Hu, Weiming; Optis, Mike; Cervone, Guido; Alessandrini, Stefano","17 WIND ENERGY; analog ensemble; machine learning; NWP; uncertainty; wind resource assessment","To accurately plan and manage wind power plants, not only does the time-varying wind resource at the site of interest need to be assessed but also the uncertainty connected to this estimate. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the mesoscale represent a valuable way to characterize the wind resource offshore, given the challenges connected with measuring hub-height wind speed. The boundary condition and parametric uncertainty associated with modeled wind speed is often estimated by running a model ensemble. However, creating an NWP ensemble of long-term wind resource data over a large region represents a computational challenge. Here, we propose two approaches to temporally extrapolate wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty using a more convenient setup in which a mesoscale ensemble is run over a short-term period (1 year), and only a single model covers the desired long-term period (20 year). We quantify hub-height wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty from the short-term model ensemble as its normalized across-ensemble standard deviation. Then, we develop and apply a gradient-boosting model and an analog ensemble approach to temporally extrapolate such uncertainty to the full 20-year period, for which only a single model run is available. As a test case, we consider offshore wind resource characterization in the California Outer Continental Shelf. Both of the proposed approaches provide accurate estimates of the long-term wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty across the region (R<sup>2</sup>>0.75), with the gradient-boosting model slightly outperforming the analog ensemble in terms of bias and centered root-mean-square error. At the three offshore wind energy lease areas in the region, we find a long-term median hourly uncertainty between 10 % and 14 % of the mean hub-height wind speed values. Finally, we assess the physical variability in the uncertainty estimates. In general, we find that the wind speed uncertainty increases closer to land. Also, neutral conditions have smaller uncertainty than the stable and unstable cases, and the modeled wind speed in winter has less boundary condition and parametric sensitivity than summer.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Machine learning enables national assessment of wind plant controls with implications for land use","Harrison‐Atlas, Dylan; King, Ryan N.; Glaws, Andrew","17 WIND ENERGY; machine learning; neural network; surrogate; wind power","As deployment of wind energy continues to expand, computationally efficient tools for predicting wind plant performance over a wide range of layout designs, technology innovations, and spatial locations are increasingly important for policy and investment decisions. We demonstrate two approaches to training a surrogate model to predict annual energy production (AEP) of parameterized wind plant layouts: one using a Gaussian process (GP) and the other using a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN). We leverage the powerful FCNN architecture by encoding wind plant design parameters and output response surface as an image. The FCNN produces more accurate results than the GP with mean absolute errors equivalent to 1% and 1.9% of plant rated power, respectively, although the GP performs well under limited training data and provides useful uncertainty information. We also evaluate a surrogate model for wake steering, enabling a nationwide assessment of the impact of plant control strategies and plant layout decisions. Across two million locations, we find that wake steering strategies boost AEP with relative gains upwards of 3%. Gains are most pronounced at sites without a dominant wind direction and where layout optimization is less fruitful. Additionally, we perform a nationwide sensitivity analysis showing that wake steering can mitigate wake losses from higher density plant layouts. Our results suggest that regions which have not been previously viable for wind deployment due to moderate wind resources are especially well enhanced by wake steering strategies that could help overcome land constraints and inflexible layout options, potentially identifying new deployment opportunities.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

T.","17 WIND ENERGY; lidar; weather; weather model; weather prediction; wind","Complex-terrain locations often have repeatable near-surface wind patterns, such as synoptic gap flows and local thermally forced flows. An example is the Columbia River Valley in east-central Oregon-Washington, a significant wind-energy-generation region and the site of the Second Wind-Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2). Data from three Doppler lidars deployed during WFIP2 define and characterize summertime wind regimes and their large-scale contexts, and provide insight into NWP model errors by examining differences in the ability of a model [NOAA’s High-Resolution Rapid-Refresh (HRRR-version1)] to forecast wind-speed profiles for different regimes. Seven regimes were identified based on daily time series of the lidar-measured rotor-layer winds, which then suggested two broad categories. First, in three regimes the primary dynamic forcing was the large-scale pressure gradient. Second, in two regimes the dominant forcing was the diurnal heating-cooling cycle (regional sea-breeze-type dynamics), including the <em>marine intrusion</em> previously described, which generates strong nocturnal winds over the region. The other two included a hybrid regime and a non-conforming regime. For the large-scale pressure-gradient regimes, HRRR had wind-speed biases of ~1 m s<sup>-1</sup> and RMSEs of 2-3 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Errors were much larger for the thermally forced regimes, owing to the premature demise of the strong nocturnal flow in HRRR. Thus, the more dominant the role of surface heating in generating the flow, the larger the errors. Major errors could result from surface heating of the atmosphere, boundary-layer responses to that heating, and associated terrain interactions. Finally, measurement/modeling research programs should be aimed at determining which modeled processes produce the largest errors, so those processes can be improved and errors reduced.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

For example, current monitoring efforts suggest that bat activity increases post-wind turbine construction, with bats making multiple passes near wind turbines. We separated the attraction hypothesis into five previously proposed explanations of bat interactions at or near wind turbines, including attraction based on noise, roost sites, foraging and water, mating behavior, and lights, and one new hypothesis regarding olfaction, and provide a state of the knowledge in 2022. Our review indicates that future research should prioritize attraction based on social behaviors, such as mating and scent-marking, as this aspect of the attraction hypothesis has many postulates and remains the most unclear. Relatively more data regarding attraction to wind turbines based on lighting and noise emission exist, and these data indicate that these are unlikely attractants. Analyzing attraction at the species-level should be prioritized because of differences in foraging, flight, and social behavior among bat species. Lastly, research assessing bat attraction at various scales, such as the turbine or facility scale, is lacking, which could provide important insights for both wind turbine siting decisions and bat mortality minimization strategies. Identifying the causes of bat interactions with wind turbines is critical for developing effective impact minimization strategies.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents and demonstrates a first-order approach to modeling and designing shared mooring systems that simplifies these challenges. We formulate a general, linearized model for the force-displacement response of shared mooring systems, including inter-platform couplings. Using this linearization, we realize significant simplifications to the shared mooring system design problem and propose a corresponding design optimization approach. Finally, we demonstrate the complete approach on a variety of shared-mooring floating wind farm layouts with generic design assumptions and constraints. Some fundamental observations about shared mooring systems can be made from the results. Polygonal array layouts with perpendicular anchor positions appear to maximize shared mooring system efficiency. Also, arrays with greater levels of sharing tend to exhibit larger deviations in offsets between platforms. Overall, the results show how the linearized approach can be applied to efficiently evaluate and systematically optimize preliminary shared mooring system designs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To reduce fetch, it is common to add perturbations near the boundaries to speed up turbulence development. However, when simulating domains over complex terrain, it is possible that the terrain itself can quickly generate turbulence within the boundary layer. It is shown here that rugged terrain is able to generate turbulence without the assistance of a perturbation strategy; however, the levels of turbulence generated are improved when adding perturbations at the inlet. Flow over smoothed, but not flat, terrain fails to generate adequate turbulence throughout the boundary layer in all tests conducted herein. Sensitivities to the strength of the mean wind speed and boundary layer height are investigated and show that higher wind speeds produce turbulence over terrain features that slower wind speeds do not. Further, by increasing the height of the capping inversion, the effectiveness of topography alone to generate turbulence throughout the depth of the boundary is diminished. In all cases, the inclusion of a perturbation strategy improved simulation performance with respect to turbulence development.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify these impacts, and the objective of this study is to demonstrate field sensitivity analysis with respect to ten parameters in the 2003 Menter shear-stress-transport (SST) turbulence model. Here, the analysis is demonstrated for an application relevant to wind energy, namely, flow over a NACA 0015 wing at 12 degree angle of attack and a Reynolds number of 1.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>. We quantify sensitivity using Sobol indices and the mean-squared gradient, which are estimated using polynomial chaos and active subspace models, respectively. Our results indicate that there are substantial spatial variations in parameter sensitivities, with different sets of most-sensitive parameters near the wing, as well as in the downstream wake, consistent with the physical interpretations of the turbulence model inputs. We show that, for this particular turbulence model and flow, simultaneous dimension reduction is possible across all quantities of interest, enabling efficient exploration of model outcomes. Ultimately, this analysis provides new insights into turbulence model parameter sensitivities in incompressible flows, and also demonstrates the implementation of field sensitivity analysis for applications relevant to aerodynamics simulations.","Begell House","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Land-based wind turbines with flexible rail-transportable blades – Part 1: Conceptual design and aeroservoelastic performance","Bortolotti, Pietro; Johnson, Nick; Abbas, Nikhar J.; Anderson, Evan; Camarena, Ernesto; Paquette, Joshua","17 WIND ENERGY; controlled flexing; land-based wind; mdao; openmdao; rail transport logistics; WEIS; wind turbine design; WISDEM","This work investigates the conceptual design and the aeroservoelastic performance of land-based wind turbines whose blades can be transported on rail via controlled bending. The turbines have a nameplate power of 5 MW and a rotor diameter of 206 m, and they aim to represent the next generation of land-based machines. Three upwind designs and two downwind designs are presented, combining different design goals together with conventional glass and pultruded carbon fiber laminates in the spar caps. One of the five blade designs is segmented and serves as a benchmark to the state of the art in industry. The results show that controlled flexing requires a reduction in the flapwise stiffness of the blades, but it represents a promising pathway for increasing the size of land-based wind turbine rotors. Given the required stiffness, the rotor can be designed either downwind with standard rotor preconing and nacelle uptilt angles or upwind with higher-than-usual angles. A downwind-specific controller is also presented, featuring a cut-out wind speed reduced to 19 m s<sup>–1</sup> and a pitch-to-stall shutdown strategy to minimize blade tip deflections toward the tower. The flexible upwind and downwind rotor designs equipped with pultruded carbon fiber spar caps are found to generate the lowest levelized cost of energy, 2.9 % and 1.3 %, respectively, less than the segmented design. The paper concludes with several recommendations for future work in the area of large flexible wind turbine rotors.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization comparison studies between upwind and downwind configurations on a modern 10-MW offshore wind turbine are presented to support the discussion. On one hand, the downwind rotor is found to consistently have a smaller swept area under loading. As a result, the downwind design produces less annual energy production (-1.2%). On the other hand, lighter blades for the downwind configuration lead to lower capital costs (-1.7%), so there is little difference in the levelized cost of energy between the two. Key ultimate and fatigue loads are compared, with some values increasing in the downwind configuration, while others decrease. The impact of a downwind configuration on the tower and the impacts of cone and tilt angles and free-yaw system on the levelized cost of energy are also investigated. The results show a mix of some advantages and disadvantages. Given these results, four areas of research in advanced controls, highly tilted rotors, higher fidelity aerodynamic models, and floating wind are proposed for downwind wind turbines.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper focuses on the value of wind energy as a distributed energy resource (i.e., “distributed wind”). Because of a lack of distributed wind-specific valuation studies, in this review we document the current state of distributed energy resource valuation, analyze a wide array of distributed energy resource valuation metastudies, and identify several value elements for which we recommend developing more robust and standardized calculation methodologies for their potential inclusion in distributed wind valuation. These value elements are ancillary services and locational, resilience, reliability, and resource diversity benefits. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for a future comprehensive framework for distributed wind valuation studies.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Based on the speculation that bats approach turbines after visually mistaking them for trees, we tested a potential light-based deterrence method. It is likely that the affected bats see ultraviolet (UV) light at low intensities. Here, we present the results of a multi-month experiment to cast dim, flickering UV light across wind turbine surfaces at night. Our objectives were to refine and test a practical system for dimly UV-illuminating turbines while testing whether the experimental UV treatment influenced the activity of bats, birds, and insects. We mounted upward-facing UV light arrays on turbines and used thermal-imaging cameras to quantify the presence and activity of night-flying animals. The results demonstrated that the turbines can be lit to the highest reaches of the blades with “invisible” UV light, and the animal responses to such experimental treatment can be concurrently monitored. The UV treatment did not significantly change nighttime bat, insect, or bird activity at the wind turbine. Our findings show how observing flying animals with thermal cameras at night can help test emerging technologies intended to variably affect their behaviors around wind turbines.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Learning the structure of wind: A data-driven nonlocal turbulence model for the atmospheric boundary layer","Keith, B.; Khristenko, U.; Wohlmuth, B.","17 WIND ENERGY; Turbulence simulations; Turbulent flows; Artificial neural networks; Navier Stokes equations; Turbulence theory and modelling","In this work, we develop a novel data-driven approach to modeling the atmospheric boundary layer. This approach leads to a nonlocal, anisotropic synthetic turbulence model which we refer to as the deep rapid distortion (DRD) model. Our approach relies on an operator regression problem that characterizes the best fitting candidate in a general family of nonlocal covariance kernels parameterized in part by a neural network. This family of covariance kernels is expressed in Fourier space and is obtained from approximate solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations at very high Reynolds numbers. Each member of the family incorporates important physical properties such as mass conservation and a realistic energy cascade. The DRD model can be calibrated with noisy data from field experiments. After calibration, the model can be used to generate synthetic turbulent velocity fields. To this end, we provide a new numerical method based on domain decomposition which delivers scalable, memory-efficient turbulence generation with the DRD model as well as others. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach with both filtered and noisy data coming from the 1968 Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory Kansas experiments. Using these data, we witness exceptional accuracy with the DRD model, especially when compared to the International Electrotechnical Commission standard.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, optimizing the number of turbines within a given boundary has not been studied as extensively and is a difficult problem because it introduces discrete design variables and a discontinuous design space. An essential step in performing wind power plant layout optimization is to define the objective function, or value, that is used to express what is valuable to a wind power plant developer, such as annual energy production, cost of energy, or profit. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of selecting the appropriate objective function when optimizing a wind power plant in a land-constrained site. We optimized several different wind power plants with different wind resources and boundary sizes. Results show that the optimal number of turbines varies drastically depending on the objective function. For a simple, one-dimensional, land-based scenario, we found that a wind power plant optimized for minimal cost of energy produced just 72% of the profit compared to the wind power plant optimized for maximum profit, which corresponded to a loss of about USD 2 million each year. This paper also compares the performance of several different optimization algorithms, including a novel repeated-sweep algorithm that we developed. We found that the performance of each algorithm depended on the number of design variables in the problem as well as the objective function. </jats:p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

When placed together in arrays to make wind farms, however, they are subject to wake interference that greatly reduces downstream turbines' power production, increases structural loading and maintenance, reduces their lifetimes, and ultimately increases the levelized cost of energy. Development of techniques to manage wakes and operate larger and larger arrays of turbines more efficiently is now a crucial field of research. Herein, four wake management techniques in various states of development are reviewed. These include axial induction control, wake steering, the latter two combined, and active wake control.

Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of about 14% during the last two decades and wind turbines now provide ~6–7% of the global electricity supply. This renewable electricity generation source is thus already playing a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector. Here we document trends within the industry, examine projections of future installed capacity increases and compute the associated climate change mitigation potential at the global and regional levels. Key countries (the USA, UK and China) and regions (e.g., EU27) have developed ambitious plans to expand wind energy penetration as core aspects of their net-zero emissions strategies. The projected climate change mitigation from wind energy by 2100 ranges from 0.3–0.8 °C depending on the precise socio-economic pathway and wind energy expansion scenario followed. The rapid expansion of annual increments to wind energy installed capacity by approximately two times current rates can greatly delay the passing of the 2 °C warming threshold relative to pre-industrial levels.

"Vertical-Axis Wind Turbine Steady and Unsteady Aerodynamics for Curved Deforming Blades","Moore, Kevin R.; Ennis, Brandon L.","17 WIND ENERGY","Vertical-axis wind turbines’ simpler design and low center of gravity make them ideal for floating wind applications. However, efficient design optimization of floating systems requires fast and accurate models. Low-fidelity vertical-axis turbine aerodynamic models, including double multiple streamtube and actuator cylinder theory, were created during the 1980s. Commercial development of vertical-axis turbines all but ceased in the 1990s until around 2010 when interest resurged for floating applications. Despite the age of these models, the original assumptions (2-D, rigid, steady, straight bladed) have not been revisited in full. When the current low-fidelity formulations are applied to modern turbines in the unsteady domain, aerodynamic load errors nearing 50% are found, consistent with prior literature. However, a set of steady and unsteady modifications that remove the majority of error is identified, limiting it near 5%. This paper shows how to reformulate the steady models to allow for unsteady inputs including turbulence, deforming blades, and variable rotational speed. A new unsteady approximation that increases numerical speed by 5–10× is also presented. Combined, these modifications enable full-turbine unsteady simulations with accuracy comparable to higher-fidelity vortex methods, but over 5000× faster.","AIAA","","Sandia National Lab.

In this study, we leverage a year of these lidar data to quantify and characterize the frequent occurrence of high-wind-shear and low-level-jet events, both of which will have a considerable impact on turbine operation. In designing a detection algorithm for these events, we find that the typical, non-dimensional power-law-based wind shear exponent is insufficient to identify many of these extreme, high-wind-speed events. Rather, we find that the simple vertical gradient of wind speed better captures the events. Based on this detection method, we find that almost 100 independent events occur throughout the year with mean wind speed at 100 m height and wind speed gradient of 16 m s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.05 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The events have strong seasonal variability, with the highest number of events in summer and the lowest in winter. A detailed analysis reveals that these events are enabled by an induced stable stratification when warmer air from the south flows over the colder mid-Atlantic waters, leading to a positive air–sea temperature difference.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper proposes current-source DC solid-state transformer (SST) for MVDC collection system in WT, PV, and ES farms or as an interface between the MVDC grid and the LVDC microgrid. Compared to conventional current-source converter (CSC) based SSTs, a switch reduction scheme on reverse-blocking device bridges is proposed to reduce device count and the number of devices on the DC-link current path. Importantly, the proposed switch reduction scheme is generic and can be applied to the DC ports of DC-AC, AC-DC, or DC-DC hard-switching or soft-switching CSC-based SSTs. Based on this scheme, the proposed current-source DC SSTs are derived, which have reduced electrolytic-capacitor-less DC-link. The proposed DC SSTs also achieve single-stage isolated DC-DC or DC-AC conversion, full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for main switches, zero-current switching (ZCS) for resonant switches, and controlled dv/dt.

"New Modulation and Impact of Transformer Leakage Inductance on Current-Source Solid-State Transformer","Zheng, Liran; Kandula, Rajendra Prasad; Kandasamy, Karthik; Divan, Deepak","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 42 ENGINEERING; single-stage solid-state transformer (SST); medium-voltage power electronic transformer (PET); current-source converter (CSC); current-source inverter (CSI); medium-frequency transformer (MFT); high-frequency link (HFL) isolated; leakage inductance; modulation.","This article presents a novel modulation scheme for device voltage stress mitigation and comprehensive analysis of the impact of transformer leakage inductance in a current-source solid-state transformer (SST). Different from dual active bridge (DAB) SST, the operation of the current-source SST is similar to that of a flyback converter. The device bridge on only one side of the transformer is active to store energy into or release energy from the magnetizing inductance which acts as a current-source dc link. Such flyback operation with reverse-blocking switches can lead to additional device voltage stress and incomplete zero-voltage switching (ZVS) on the current-source soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) under conventional modulation. A new modulation scheme is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, different from the DAB, the leakage inductance of the medium-frequency transformer (MFT) in the S4T is a parasitic element similar to that in a matrix SST and can cause additional device voltage stress. Though the resonant capacitors, originally added to achieve ZVS, can absorb and recycle the leakage energy in the S4T, these capacitors need to be increased with larger leakage inductances to limit the voltage stress. However, large resonant capacitors can result in more lost duty cycles and reduced efficiency. The impact of such leakage inductance on device voltage stress is analyzed comprehensively, which is critical to guide future research and design of the S4T. Experimental results from S4T prototypes for DC-DC, multiport AC-DC, and AC-AC conversion with 1:1 and 4:1 MFT comprehensively verify the proposed concepts. Lastly, a case study of a three-phase AC-AC S4T over a power range from 1 kVA to 100 kVA each module reveals that the MFT leakage inductance should be less than 1% of the magnetizing inductance for safe operation.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-08-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 562-576","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3101811","","2022-10-19T00:00:00Z","1892477","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892477","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892477","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","1","37"

Output from 6 months of high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are analyzed to characterize local low-level jets (LLJs) over Iowa for winter and spring in the contemporary climate. Low-level jets affect rotor plane aerodynamic loading, turbine structural loading and turbine performance, and thus accurate characterization and identification are pertinent. Analyses using a detection algorithm wherein the wind speed above and below the jet maximum must be below 80 % of the jet wind speed within a vertical window of approximately 20–530 m a.g.l. (above ground level) indicate the presence of an LLJ in at least one of the 14 700 4 km×4 km grid cells over Iowa on 98 % of nights. Nocturnal LLJs are most frequently associated with stable stratification and low turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and hence are more frequent during the winter months. The spatiotemporal mean LLJ maximum (jet core) wind speed is 9.55 m s−1, and the mean height is 182 m. Locations of high LLJ frequency and duration across the state are seasonally varying, with a mean duration of 3.5 h. The highest frequency occurs in the topographically complex northwest of the state in winter and in the flatter northeast of the state in spring. Sensitivity of LLJ characteristics to the (i) LLJ definition and (ii) vertical resolution at which the WRF output is sampled is examined. LLJ definitions commonly used in the literature are considered in the first sensitivity analysis. These sensitivity analyses indicate that LLJ characteristics are highly variable with definition. Use of different definitions identifies both different frequencies of LLJs and different LLJ events. Further, when the model output is down-sampled to lower vertical resolution, the mean jet core wind speed height decreases, but spatial distributions of regions of high frequency and duration are conserved. Implementation of a polynomial interpolation to extrapolate down-sampled output to full-resolution results in reduced sensitivity of LLJ characteristics to down-sampling.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE; USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

The capacity implications of the interactions between offshore wind and the historical east-to-west power flows of the region are discussed. The existing system is shown to accommodate more than two gigawatts of offshore wind interconnections with minimal curtailment.

"Reliability‐based layout optimization in offshore wind energy systems","Clark, Caitlyn E.; Barter, Garrett; Shaler, Kelsey; DuPont, Bryony","17 WIND ENERGY; drivetrain; layout optimization; power production; reliability; wind energy systems","Existing methods for optimizing wind array layouts typically use power or cost objectives and rarely consider reliability-based objectives. Component and system failure rates, however, are dependent on location-specific wind conditions, are influenced by array layout and wake interactions, and have a direct and significant impact on capital costs, operational costs, and power production. Although wind power plant models exist that calculate wind loads with sufficient resolution to capture component loading dynamics from wind conditions, they are computationally expensive and thus not suitable for research applications requiring many evaluations, particularly optimization. This study describes the development of computationally efficient, reliability-based layout optimization methods, enabling us to explore the relationship between component reliability and layout optimization. These methods include the surrogate modeling of the planet bearing life based on varying wind conditions simulated in FAST.Farm and the formulation of reliability-based objectives based on failure cost and power production models. Through demonstration of this method, we explore how wind conditions, objective functions, and capacity density influence reliability-based layout optimization. Results indicate that considering reliability alongside power production can reduce failure costs associated with replacement costs and downtime whilemaintaining or improving power production. Our conclusions highlight the opportunity for wind power plant developers to integrate reliability and operational expenditures alongside performance and capital expenditure objectives in plant design and development to improve plant performance and costs.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This decline in value has varied over time and across regions, indicating that strategies to mitigate value decline will need to be carefully targeted. To help guide development of these strategies, we empirically determine wind and solar value at ~2,100 plants within United States wholesale markets by using local prices and plant-specific generation profiles. We determine how each plant loses (or gains) value because of its output profile, transmission congestion, and curtailment. In regions where wind or solar account for roughly 20% of electricity generation, its value is 30% to 40% below the regional average value of a flat output profile at all plants. Solar value reductions are most sensitive to output profile and wind value reductions are sensitive to both profile and congestion, region dependent. Curtailment was not a major source of value reduction.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Various modeling methods, including economic input-output modeling, life cycle assessment, agent-based modeling, and system dynamics, have been used to examine circular supply chains and analyze their impacts. This work describes the newly developed Circular Economy Lifecycle Assessment and Visualization (CELAVI) framework, which is designed to model how the impacts of supply chains might change as circularity increases. We first establish the framework with a discussion of modeling capabilities that are needed to capture circularity transitions; these capabilities are based on the fact that supply chains moving toward circularity are dynamic and therefore not at steady state, may encompass multiple industrial sectors or other interdependent supply chains and occupy a large spatial area. To demonstrate the capabilities of CELAVI, we present a case study on end-of-life wind turbine blades in the U.S. state of Texas. Our findings show that depending on exact process costs and transportation distances, mechanical recycling could lead to 69% or more of end-of-life turbine blade mass being kept in circulation rather than being landfilled, with only a 7.1% increase in global warming potential over the linear supply chain.

Conventional approaches to evaluating wind power technical potential at the national scale rely on coarse geographic representations of land area requirements for wind power.

Here, we propose a data-driven approach to overcome persistent challenges in characterizing localized deployment potentials over broad extents. We use machine learning to develop predictive relationships between observed capacity densities and geospatial variables. The model is validated against a comprehensive data set of United States (U.S.) wind facilities and subjected to interrogation techniques to reveal that key explanatory features behind geographic variation of capacity density are related to wind resource as well as urban accessibility and forest cover. We demonstrate application of the model by producing a high-resolution (2 km × 2 km) national map of capacity density for use in technical potential assessments for the United States.

Resistance welding uses an electrically conductive material, such as carbon fiber, embedded in the bond line to heat the joining surfaces and fuse them together under pressure. One main challenge with fusion joining for large wind blades is the ability to use this conductive heating element in the bond line while still protecting the blade from the catastrophic effects of a lightning strike. This paper outlines the design and manufacturing of a lightning protection system for a 5-m-long thermally welded blade tip. The outcomes of high voltage and high current lightning testing applied to the 5 m blade tip show that the proposed design was able to protect the fusion welded bond lines from significant lightning damage.","SAGE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although public availability of floating lidar data is increasing, most offshore wind speed observations continue to come from buoy-based and satellite-based near-surface measurements. The aim of this study is to develop and validate novel vertical extrapolation methods that can accurately estimate wind speed time series across rotor-swept heights using these near-surface measurements. We contrast the conventional logarithmic profile against three novel approaches: a logarithmic profile with a long-term stability correction, a single-column model, and a machine-learning model. These models are developed and validated using 1 year of observations from two floating lidars deployed in US Atlantic offshore wind energy areas. We find that the machine-learning model significantly outperforms all other models across all stability regimes, seasons, and times of day. Machine-learning model performance is considerably improved by including the air–sea temperature difference, which provides some accounting for offshore atmospheric stability. Finally, we find no degradation in machine-learning model performance when tested 83 km from its training location, suggesting promising future applications in extrapolating 10 m wind speeds from spatially resolved satellite-based wind atlases.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Further reductions in LCOE by up-scaling turbine size can be challenged by practical limitations such as the square-cube law: where the power scales with the square of the blade length and the added mass scales with the volume (the cube). Active blade load control can disrupt this trend, allowing longer blades with less mass. This paper presents the details of the development of a robust load control system to reduce blade fatigue loads. The control system, which we coined sectional lift control or SLC, uses a lift actuator model to emulate an active flow control device. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) Methodology for SLC design to reduce dynamic blade root moments in a neighborhood of the rotor angular frequency (1P).

"Impacts of turbine and plant upsizing on the levelized cost of energy for offshore wind","Shields, Matt; Beiter, Philipp; Nunemaker, Jake; Cooperman, Aubryn; Duffy, Patrick","17 WIND ENERGY; levelized cost of energy; turbine and plant upsizing; annual energy production; techno-economic analysis; balance-of-system costs; operations and maintenance costs; offshore wind","Turbine and plant upsizing are major trends in offshore wind deployment, although the quantitative impact on project costs has not been well-characterized. The uncertain value of continued wind turbine and project growth limits the ability of the supply chain to prepare for future technology trends, leading to challenges in the realization of larger projects. This analysis explores the levelized cost of energy impacts of turbine ratings between 6 and 20 MW and plant capacities between 250 and 2,500 MW for fixed-bottom offshore wind using techno-economic cost models for foundation, electrical, installation, and operation and maintenance costs, along with annual energy production. We consider a nominal set of technology assumptions for all scenarios to isolate economies of size and scale without additional benefits from decreasing turbine capital costs, quantity discounts for larger projects, or optimized technology solutions. These results indicate that using a 20-MW wind turbine in a 2,500-MW power plant array can reduce the levelized cost of energy by over 23% relative to the global average turbine and plant size installed in 2019; primarily because of reductions in the balance-of-system and operation and maintenance costs. We also identify improved installation vessels, optimized export systems, and novel operation and maintenance strategies as additional cost reduction opportunities. These results suggest that upsizing represents a significant cost reduction opportunity for offshore wind energy and will continue to be a main factor in shaping the future of the sector.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Methods of turbine wake modeling are being developed to more accurately account for spatially variant atmospheric conditions within wind farms. Most current wake modeling utilities are designed to apply a uniform flow field to the entire domain of a wind farm. When this method is used, the accuracy of power prediction and wind farm controls can be compromised depending on the flow-field characteristics of a particular area. In an effort to improve strategies of wind farm wake modeling and power prediction, FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS) was developed to implement sophisticated methods of atmospheric characterization and power output calculation. In this paper, we describe an adapted FLORIS model that features spatial heterogeneity in flow-field characterization. This model approximates an observed flow field by interpolating from a set of atmospheric measurements that represent local weather conditions. The objective of this method is to capture heterogeneous atmospheric effects caused by site-specific terrain features, without explicitly modeling the geometry of the wind farm terrain. The implemented adaptations were validated by comparing the simulated power predictions generated from FLORIS to the actual recorded wind farm output from the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) recordings and large eddy simulations (LESs). When comparing the performance of the proposed heterogeneous model to homogeneous FLORIS simulations, the results show a 14.6 % decrease for mean absolute error (MAE) in wind farm power output predictions for cases using wind farm SCADA data and a 18.9 % decrease in LES case studies. The results of these studies also indicate that the efficacy of the proposed modeling techniques may vary with differing site-specific operational conditions. This work quantifies the accuracy of wind plant power predictions under heterogeneous flow conditions and establishes best practices for atmospheric surveying for wake modeling.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Passive components like bulky dc links limit the power density of power converters, especially medium-voltage (MV) SST. Reduced dc-link or low-inertia converters can dramatically reduce the size, cost, and weight by tolerating larger dc-link ripples and improve the reliability with electrolytic capacitor-less dc link. However, a small dc link leads to tight coupling between the input and the output stages, which is a challenge for control design. In stacked low-inertia converters (SLIC), the low-inertia converter modules are stacked for MV applications, resulting in coupling between the modules and making the control more challenging. A new model predictive control method which can achieve deadbeat regulation on the dc link without weighting factors has been proposed to address this novel problem. This paper focuses on analyzing the condition of the low-inertia dc link up to 80% ripple, the robustness of the control under parameter mismatches, high-order terms, and important implementation issues such as model-based sampling and computation delay compensation. Significantly, the high-order terms are introduced because of the large dc-link ripple. These high-order terms are unique to the SLIC and negligible in conventional high-inertia converters. A discrete-time large-signal model is built to capture the dc-link’s nonlinear dynamics, and the eigenvalues of a small-signal Jacobian matrix are analyzed with Floquet theory to evaluate stability, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. Simulation and experimental results of an MVDC M-S4T verify the analysis and the predictive control method. Finally, the general application of the predictive control to low-inertia converters is compared against a conventional PI controller using a reduced dc-link active-front-end (AFE) rectifier as an example.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 14295-14311","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3085679","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894262","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894262","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","12","36"

Previous models have focused on the aerodynamic interaction of wake steering between two turbines. The model proposed in this paper builds on these models to include yaw-induced wake recovery and secondary steering seen in large arrays of turbines when wake steering is performed. Turbines operating in yaw-misaligned conditions generate counter-rotating vortices that entrain momentum and contribute to the deformation and deflection of the wake at downstream turbines. Rows of turbines can compound the effects of wake steering that benefit turbines far downstream. This model quantifies these effects and demonstrates that wake steering has greater potential to increase the performance of a wind farm due to these counter-rotating vortices especially for large rows of turbines. This is validated using numerous large-eddy simulations for three-turbine, five-turbine, and wind farm scenarios.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we evaluate the potential of wake steering for U.S. land-based wind power plants. First, we outline a method for simulating and optimizing wake steering control for existing wind plants by combining the flow redirection and induction in steady state wake steering engineering model with the U.S. Wind Turbine Database and Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit wind resource dataset. Next, to better understand the potential benefits of wake steering beyond those for existing wind plants, we evaluate the relative impacts of turbine specific power, turbine spacing, and mean wind speed on energy gain and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) using a model land-based wind power plant. For a subset of 60 existing wind plants, assuming a constant turbulence intensity of 8%, wake steering was found to yield an average annual energy production (AEP) gain of 0.80%, equivalent to recovering 13.85% of baseline wake losses. Further, we present a linear approximation between baseline wake losses and AEP gains that can be used to estimate wake steering gains for other wind power plants. Highlighting additional benefits of wake steering, for the model wind power plant we found that energy gains from wake steering enabled an approximate 30% reduction in turbine spacing while keeping LCOE constant.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Therefore, there has been an increasing interest to provide remote health monitoring for wind turbine pitch system. While most of the research articles are discussing pitch actuation system (hydraulic or electric actuator) faults only, there is very limited research on pitch-bearing-defect detection. This article provides a remote and hardware-free solution to monitor multiaxis pitch-bearing health condition called pitch symmetrical-component analysis. It leverages readily available low-resolution (100 Hz) electrical measurements, mechanical measurements, and control signals from the existing pitch control platform, and innovatively applies symmetrical-component analysis in multiphase ac system to multiaxis pitch control system and introduces multiaxis pitch-bearing degradation trending curves. This hardware-free solution can be directly applied to the existing wind turbines and successfully give the wind farm operator an early warning before multiaxis pitch bearing fails. It has been proved to be accurate, low cost, and has minimum impacts on turbine normal operation, and has been validated by field data from several North America MW-scale wind farms. This approach turns out to be the first hardware-free (no additional hardware needed) method to remotely monitor and diagnose multiaxis wind turbine pitch-bearing condition.","IEEE","","Univ. of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-05-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications; Journal Volume: 57; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 3252-3261","","","EE0006802","Journal ID: ISSN 0093-9994","10.1109/tia.2021.3079221","","2023-04-06T00:00:00Z","1848453","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848453","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848453","IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","4","57"
"Lowering post‐construction yield assessment uncertainty through better wind plant power curves","Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Mike; Perr‐Sauer, Jordan; Simley, Eric; Fields, M. Jason","17 WIND ENERGY; AEP assessment; machine learning; OpenOA; operational analysis; uncertainty","Many operational analyses of wind power plants require a statistical relationship, which can be called the wind plant power curve, to be developed between wind plant energy production and concurrent atmospheric variables. Currently, a univariate linear regression at monthly resolution is the industry standard for post-construction yield assessments. Here, we evaluate the benefits in augmenting this conventional approach by testing alternative regressions performed with multiple inputs, at a finer time resolution, and using nonlinear machine-learning algorithms. We utilize the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's open-source software package OpenOA to assess wind plant power curves for 10 wind plants. When a univariate generalized additive model at daily or hourly resolution is used, regression uncertainty is reduced, in absolute terms, by up to 1.0% and 1.2% (corresponding to a -59% and -80% relative change), respectively, compared to a univariate linear regression at monthly resolution; also, a more accurate assessment of the mean long-term wind plant production is achieved. Additional input variables also reduce the regression uncertainty: when temperature is added as an input to the conventional monthly linear regression, the operational analysis uncertainty connected to regression is reduced, in absolute terms, by up to 0.5% (-43% relative change) for wind power plants with strong seasonal variability. Adding input variables to the machine-learning model at daily resolution can further reduce regression uncertainty, with up to a -10% relative change. Based on these results, we conclude that a multivariate nonlinear regression at daily or hourly resolution should be recommended for assessing wind plant power curves.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We investigate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model to perform large-eddy simulation of canonical flows. This is achieved through comparison of the simulation outputs with measurements from sonic anemometers on a 250 m meteorological mast located at Østerild, in northern Denmark. Østerild is on a flat and rough area, and for the predominant wind directions, the atmospheric flow can be considered to be close to homogeneous. The idealized simulated flows aim at representing atmospheric boundary layer turbulence under unstable, neutral, and stable stability conditions at the surface, which are statistically significant conditions observed at Østerild. We found that the resolved fields from the simulations appear to have the characteristics of the three stability regimes. Vertical profiles of observed mean wind speeds and direction are well reproduced by the simulations, with the largest differences under near-neutral conditions, where the effect of the subgrid-scale model is evident on the vertical wind shear close to the surface. Vertical profiles of observed eddy fluxes are also well reproduced by the simulations, with the largest differences for the three velocity component variances under stable stability conditions, although nearly always within the observed variability. With regards to turbulent kinetic energy, we find good agreement between observations and simulations at all vertical levels. Simulated and observed velocity spectra match very well and show very similar behavior with height and with atmospheric stability within the low-frequency interval; at the effective resolution, the simulated spectra show the typical drop-off of finite differences. Our findings demonstrate that these idealized simulations reproduce the characteristics of atmospheric stability regimes often observed at a high turbulent and flat site within a direction sector, where the air flows over nearly homogeneous land.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Valuation of Wind Energy Turbines Using Volatility of Wind and Price","Greenberg, Doron; Byalsky, Michael; Yahalom, Asher","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; renewable resources; Black–Scholes model","The limitedness of the nonrenewable local energy resources in Israel, even in the background of the later gas fields’ findings, continues to force the state to devote various efforts towards ‘green’ energy development. These efforts include installations, both for the solar and for wind energy, thus improving the diversity of energy sources. While the standard discounted cash flow (DCF) method using the net present value (NPV) criterion is extensively adopted to evaluate investments, the standard DCF method is inappropriate for the rapidly changing investment climate and for the managerial flexibility in investment decisions. In recent years, the real options analysis (ROA) technique has been widely applied in many studies for the valuation of renewable energy investment projects. Taking into account the above background, we apply, in this study, the real options analysis approach for the valuation of wind energy turbines and apply it to the analysis of wind energy economic potential in Israel, which is the context of our work. We hypothesize that due to nature of wind energy production uncertainties, the ROA method is better than the alternative. The novelty of this paper includes the following: real world wind statistics of the Merom Golan site in Israel (velocity 3.73 m/s, with a standard deviation of 2.03 m/s), a realistic power generation estimation (power generation of 1205.84 kW with a standard deviation of about 0.5% in annual value which is worth about 1.3 M$ per annum), and an economic model to evaluate the profitability of such a project. We thus discuss the existing challenges of diversifying renewable energy sources in Israel by adding wind installations. Our motivation is to introduce a method which will allow investors and officials to take into account uncertainties when deciding in investing in such wind installations. The outcomes of the paper, which are obtained using the method of Weibull statistics and the Black–Scholes ROA technique, include the result that market price volatility adds to the uncertainties much more than any wind fluctuations, provided that the analysis is integrated over a long enough time.","MDPI","","Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

"On the scaling of wind turbine rotors","Canet, Helena; Bortolotti, Pietro; Bottasso, Carlo L.","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; scaling; wind tunnel; field testing; rotor design; design optimization","This paper formulates laws for scaling wind turbine rotors. Although the analysis is general, the article primarily focuses on the subscaling problem, i.e., on the design of a smaller-sized model that mimics a full-scale machine. The present study considers both the steady-state and transient response cases, including the effects of aerodynamic, elastic, inertial, and gravitational forces. The analysis reveals the changes to physical characteristics induced by a generic change of scale, indicates which characteristics can be matched faithfully by a subscaled model, and states the conditions that must be fulfilled for desired matchings to hold. Based on the scaling laws formulated here, the article continues by considering the problem of designing scaled rotors that match desired indicators of a full-scale reference. To better illustrate the challenges implicit in scaling and the necessary tradeoffs and approximations, two different approaches are contrasted. The first consists in a straightforward geometric zooming. An analysis of the consequences of zooming reveals that, although apparently simple, this method is often not applicable in practice, because of physical and manufacturing limitations. This motivates the formulation of scaling as a constrained optimal aerodynamic and structural matching problem of wide applicability. Practical illustrations are given considering the scaling of a large reference 10 MW wind turbine of about 180 m in diameter down to three different sizes of 54, 27, and 2.8 m. Results indicate that, with the proper choices, even models characterized by very significant scaling factors can accurately match several key performance indicators. Additionally, when an exact match is not possible, relevant trends can at least be captured.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind turbine wake models typically require approximations, such as wake superposition and deflection models, to accurately describe wake physics. However, capturing the phenomena of interest, such as the curled wake and interaction of multiple wakes, in wind power plant flows comes with an increased computational cost. To address this, we propose a new hybrid method that uses analytical solutions with an approximate form of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations to solve the time-averaged flow over a wind plant. We compare results from the solver to supervisory control and data acquisition data from the Lillgrund wind plant obtaining wake model predictions which are generally within 1 standard deviation of the mean power data. We perform simulations of flow over the Columbia River Gorge to demonstrate the capabilities of the model in complex terrain. We also apply the solver to a case with wake steering, which agreed well with large-eddy simulations. This new solver reduces the time – and therefore the related cost – it takes to simulate a steady-state wind plant flow (on the order of seconds using one core). Because the model is computationally efficient, it can also be used for different applications including wake steering for wind power plants and layout optimization.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Resource Occurrence and Productivity in Existing and Proposed Wind Energy Lease Areas on the Northeast US Shelf","Friedland, Kevin D.; Methratta, Elizabeth T.; Gill, Andrew B.; Gaichas, Sarah K.; Curtis, Tobey H.; Adams, Evan M.; Morano, Janelle L.; Crear, Daniel P.; McManus, M. Conor; Brady, Damian C.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; fisheries; habitat; monitoring; temperature; zooplankton","States in the Northeast United States have the ambitious goal of producing more than 22 GW of offshore wind energy in the coming decades. The infrastructure associated with offshore wind energy development is expected to modify marine habitats and potentially alter the ecosystem services. Species distribution models were constructed for a group of fish and macroinvertebrate taxa resident in the Northeast US Continental Shelf marine ecosystem. These models were analyzed to provide baseline context for impact assessment of lease areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight designated for renewable wind energy installations. Using random forest machine learning, models based on occurrence and biomass were constructed for 93 species providing seasonal depictions of their habitat distributions. We developed a scoring index to characterize lease area habitat use for each species. Subsequently, groups of species were identified that reflect varying levels of lease area habitat use ranging across high, moderate, low, and no reliance on the lease area habitats. Among the species with high to moderate reliance were black sea bass (<em>Centropristis striata</em>), summer flounder (<em>Paralichthys dentatus</em>), and Atlantic menhaden (<em>Brevoortia tyrannus</em>), which are important fisheries species in the region. Potential for impact was characterized by the number of species with habitat dependencies associated with lease areas and these varied with a number of continuous gradients. Habitats that support high biomass were distributed more to the northeast, while high occupancy habitats appeared to be further from the coast. There was no obvious effect of the size of the lease area on the importance of associated habitats. Model results indicated that physical drivers and lower trophic level indicators might strongly control the habitat distribution of ecologically and commercially important species in the wind lease areas. Therefore, physical and biological oceanography on the continental shelf proximate to wind energy infrastructure development should be monitored for changes in water column structure and the productivity of phytoplankton and zooplankton and the effects of these changes on the trophic system.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Univ. of Maine, Orono, ME (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Frontiers in Marine Science; Journal Volume: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 629230","","","EE0006713","Journal ID: ISSN 2296-7745","10.3389/fmars.2021.629230","","2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","1843407","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843407","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1843407","Frontiers in Marine Science","","8"
"Verification of induction zone models for wind farm annual energy production estimation","Meyer Forsting, Alexander; Rathmann, Ole Steen; van der Laan, M. P.; Troldborg, Niel; Gribben, Brian; Hawkes, Graham; Branlard, Emmanuel","17 WIND ENERGY; blockage effect; induction zone; wind farm","Fast engineering wake models are the backbone of wind farm annual energy production (AEP) estimators, whereas the addition of induction zone models in existing tools is a more recent response to rising concerns over wind farm blockage associated losses. Here, ""blockage"" describes the combined induction fields of all wind turbines inside a farm. Unlike the term might suggest, blockage not only reduces flow speeds, but also increases them; for instance along the outer edges of wind farms. Evaluating the overall impact on AEP of these gains and losses necessitates accurate wind farm induction models. Whilst engineering wake models are tuned to predict wind farm performance, existing induction zone models are all derived for accurately predicting the near field induction not the far field value—important for wind farm simulations. This paper presents the induction models implemented in the wind farm simulation tool PyWake, as well as results from novel analytical models and compares their far field predictions to RANS-AD simulations of different turbines. We demonstrate that when including blockage in AEP simulations, the downstream speed-ups need to be included to avoid an unrealistic bias toward AEP loss and that wake expansion significantly impacts induction at rated thrust levels.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Power increases using wind direction spatial filtering for wind farm control: Evaluation using FLORIS, modified for dynamic settings","Sinner, Michael; Simley, Eric; King, Jennifer; Fleming, Paul; Pao, Lucy Y.","17 WIND ENERGY; wake steering; wind farm control; estimation","As wind energy plays a growing role in the energy sector, new methods for controlling wind turbines and wind farms to maximize performance are garnering industry interest. A developing body of research treats the entire wind farm as a control system, with individual turbines acting as agents in a network, allowing farm-level objectives to be considered. Two promising developments in this research are wake steering control, which seeks to increase the power generated at a wind farm by directing the wakes of upstream turbines away from downstream ones, and communication-based spatial filtering, which seeks to improve the quality of information used by turbine- and farm-level controllers by combining measurements of the wind field collected at the individual turbines. The latter method has been shown to improve the estimates of wind direction at the turbines; however, the resulting potential for increased power capture warrants further investigation. With this paper, we begin to address this gap by combining wake steering with wind direction spatial filtering. To do so, we present a preliminary method for assessing the power capture of dynamic controllers using wind farm codes designed for time-averaged simulation. This allows us to generate results much more rapidly than would be possible using high-fidelity wind farm simulators and may be useful in many wind farm control design applications.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This is due to cost reductions witnessed over the past five years and expected continued advancements. If realized, these costs might allow wind to play a larger role in energy supply than previously anticipated. Considering both surveys, we also conclude that there is considerable uncertainty about future costs. Our results illustrate the importance of considering cost uncertainty, highlight the value and limits of using experts to reveal those uncertainties, and yield possible lessons for energy modellers and expert elicitation.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Effects of upstream rotor tilt on a downstream floating wind turbine","Doubrawa, Paula; Sirnivas, Senu; Godvik, Marte","17 WIND ENERGY; floating; loads; offshore wind; tilt; wake","This work quantifies the relationship between the design tilt of an upstream rotor and the structural response of a spar floating offshore wind turbine located in its wake. Three wind speed scenarios are considered: below, at, and above rated operation. The inflow is generated with the Mann model and the wake and loads are simulated with FAST.Farm. As the upstream rotor tilt goes from 0° to 6°, we find that the mean wake is displaced upward by more than 0.2 rotor diameters (D) by a downstream distance of 7 D. The vertical velocities increase by up to 35 cm/s in the center of the wake. As a result, the downstream rotor is partially waked and experiences a rotated velocity vector. With a higher upstream rotor tilt, the velocities and moments on the downstream turbine increase their mean axial value and their lateral and vertical standard deviation. These changes affect the blade and tower loading and the floater motion primarily in the out-of-plane direction: the damage-equivalent loads for the tower pitch moment and blade-root moment increase by up to 10% because of higher variability at the first mode for the tower and at one blade passing frequency for the blade root. Lesser effects are observed for the roll moments and for floater sway and heave. When the joint effect of rotor tilt and platform motion is considered, the load response on the downstream system is amplified primarily for tower pitch and blade out-of-plane moment.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind power has become one of the fastest-growing sources of new electricity generation. We take stock of wind power cost evolution over the past 20 years, review methodologies commonly used for cost assessment, discuss the potential for continued cost reduction, and identify anticipated cost and value drivers. Our scope includes both onshore and offshore wind technologies. We draw from a vast body of literature on these topics to highlight key trends, approaches, and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for wind power assets to enhance their marginal economic value to the broader power system and consumers. We identify a myriad of factors that are expected to influence the future cost and value of wind power, including siting, project scale, turbine size, operational synergies, commodity prices, advancements in turbine technologies, enhanced management of the wind resource, and novel control technologies that provide value for the electricity grid. Because the common methods for forecasting future costs each have their own strengths and weaknesses, we find the best insights are elicited from a combination of methods. Overall, researchers and analysts anticipate further sizable cost reductions for onshore and offshore wind. Midrange forecasts for levelized cost of energy in 2050 are generally between $20 and $30/MWh for onshore wind and $40 and $60/MWh for offshore wind, a reduction to approximately half of today's levels. Optimistic forecasts anticipate these levels as early as 2030.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A proposed criteria to identify wind turbine drivetrain bearing loads that induce roller slip based white-etching cracks","Natarajan, Anand; Remigius, W. Dheelibun; Guo, Yi; Keller, Jonathan","17 WIND ENERGY; white-etching crack; bearing roller slip; contact load; normal operation","In this article, the type of roller slip behavior that may result in the formation of white-etching cracks (WECs) in wind turbine gearbox bearings is identified. A new hypothesis based on the inner raceway normal contact load magnitude at the time of roller slip is proposed as the probable cause of WECs. For this purpose, the maximum normal contact loads are identified when roller slip occurs in high-speed shaft bearings at different mean wind speeds. Subsequently, the annual probability of occurrence of the maximum normal loads are obtained. The probability of maximum load under slip exceeding a limit probability is hypothesized as a probable cause for WEC. In order to apply the proposed hypothesis, two different wind turbines high-speed shaft bearings are used: the cylindrical roller bearing of the General Electric 1.5 SLE turbine and the tapered roller bearing of Vestas V52 turbine. Both the chosen bearings are on the generator side of the high-speed shaft. For both turbines, measurement data together with analytical models are used for identifying the slip and the maximum normal contact loads. We propose forecasting the probability of exceedance of a threshold maximum normal contact load level during slip to identify the possibility for inducing WECs.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Parans; Keller, Jonathan; King, Ryan","17 WIND ENERGY; additive manufacturing; cost model; direct drive generators; lightweighting; machine learning; topology optimization","Direct-drive wind turbine generators are increasing in popularity, thanks to recent project developments—especially offshore, where reliability and efficiency are major cost drivers. Yet, high capital costs are forcing many original equipment manufacturers to consider lightweight, high-torque density generators for next-generation multi-megawatt turbines that may be difficult to realize by traditional design or manufacturing methods. In this study, we present a new design framework enabled by advanced machine learning and multimaterial additive manufacturing to perform a magnetic topology optimization that maximizes the torque per rotor active mass for a 15-megawatt direct-drive permanent magnet wind generator. A comparison of the proposed approach against conventional topology optimization demonstrated a significant increase in computational efficiency and accuracy in performance predictions. Results using single and multimaterial compositions for rotor core and magnets identify a wider choice of 3D printable designs for a given specification. A hybrid combination of sintered and dysprosium-free polymer-bonded magnets shows good potential for torque performance by saving material costs up to 8.75%. More than 30% improvement in rotor torque densities is identified which can marginally improve the overall generator torque density. With the rapid evolution of multipowder deposition technolgies, this study can greatly inspire a new paradigm for design-driven manufacturing with novel material compositions and lightweight, low-cost, high-strength multimaterial geometries that were previously unexplored for direct-drive generators.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Investigation of main bearing operating conditions in a three-Point mount wind turbine drivetrain","Guo, Yi; Bankestrom, Olle; Bergua, Roger; Keller, Jonathan; Dunn, Mark","17 WIND ENERGY; main bearing; spherical roller bearing; axial motion; wear","Wear-related failures of spherical roller bearings in the main bearing position of three-point mount wind turbines have been higher than expected and can contribute to higher than anticipated operation-and-maintenance costs. In this paper, the operational conditions of such a main bearing—including measured axial displacement and velocity subject to the estimated axial loads—are described for an instrumented, commercial wind turbine. The field measurements suggest a maximum axial speed between the bearing rings that is less than 2 millimeters per second. It is estimated that the axial speed between the ring and rollers is approximately 25% of this value. When compared to a speed of rolling from approximately 200–352 millimeters per second, the measured axial sliding is therefore significantly less than 1% of the speed of rolling. Previous numerical studies of lubricant film formation in rolling contacts have shown that the effect of axial sliding starts to be noticeable only when this ratio exceeds 10%; therefore, the axial velocity represents only a small disturbance to the nominal pure rolling case, and the influence on oil film building can be neglected. A simple analytic model of the main bearing motion was also developed and demonstrated similar displacement and velocity characteristics.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper examines the electricity and carbon mitigation costs to reliably operate India’s grid in 2030 for a variety of wind and solar targets (200 GW to 600 GW) and the most promising options for reducing these costs. We find that systems where solar photovoltaic comprises only 25 to 50% of the total renewable target have the lowest carbon mitigation costs in most scenarios. This result invites a reexamination of India’s proposed solar-majority targets. We also find that, compared to other regions and contrary to prevailing assumptions, meeting high renewable targets will avoid building very few new fossil fuel (coal and natural gas) power plants because of India’s specific weather patterns and need to meet peak electricity demand. However, building 600 GW of renewable capacity, with the majority being wind plants, reduces how often fossil fuel power plants run, and this amount of capacity can hold India’s 2030 emissions below 2018 levels for less than the social cost of carbon. With likely wind and solar cost declines and increases in coal energy costs, balanced or wind-majority high renewable energy systems (600 GW or ≈ 45% share by energy) could result in electricity costs similar to a fossil fuel-dominated system. As an alternative strategy for meeting peak electricity demand, battery storage can avert the need for new fossil fuel capacity but is cost effective only at low capital costs (≈ USD 150 per kWh).","National Academy of Sciences","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Spatial impacts of technological innovations on the levelized cost of energy for offshore wind power plants in the United States","Shields, Matt; Beiter, Philipp; Kleiber, William","17 WIND ENERGY; Morris factor screening; spatial cost modeling; offshore wind energy; levelized cost of energy","Recent studies predict significant decreases in the future levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of offshore wind energy, much of which is attributed to anticipated cost reductions from technological innovation. This study evaluates the spatial variability of LCOE caused by technology-induced decreases in a range of capital, operational, and financial cost categories. A spatial cost model of fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind plants is used to model the impact across thousands of potential United States sites. A specified change in an individual turbine subsystem cost produces a range of LCOE outcomes due to the varying geospatial characteristics of the considered sites and the nonlinear, interactive dependency on these input parameters; for example, a 10.8% improvement in net capacity factor can reduce LCOE by between 6% and 20% at different sites. This work expands upon the existing offshore wind literature, which typically evaluates cost sensitivities at a single site and does not consider the spatial variance in LCOE. The results suggest that the impact of technological innovations can be considerable and should be considered on a spatial as well as temporal basis when prioritizing technology innovation research or funding decisions to advance offshore wind technologies in the United States.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Behavioral patterns of bats at a wind turbine confirm seasonality of fatality risk","Goldenberg, Shifra Z.; Cryan, Paul M.; Gorresen, Paulo Marcos; Fingersh, Lee Jay","17 WIND ENERGY; 60 APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES; chiroptera; conservation behavior; ecological trap; human threats; migration; perception; renewable energy; thermal infrared; video; bats","Bat fatalities at wind energy facilities in North America are predominantly comprised of migratory, tree-dependent species, but it is unclear why these bats are at higher risk. Factors influencing bat susceptibility to wind turbines might be revealed by temporal patterns in their behaviors around these dynamic landscape structures. In northern temperate zones, fatalities occur mostly from July through October, but whether this reflects seasonally variable behaviors, passage of migrants, or some combination of factors remains unknown. In this study, we examined video imagery spanning one year in the state of Colorado in the United States, to characterize patterns of seasonal and nightly variability in bat behavior at a wind turbine. We detected bats on 177 of 306 nights representing approximately 3,800 hr of video and > 2,000 discrete bat events. We observed bats approaching the turbine throughout the night across all months during which bats were observed. Two distinct seasonal peaks of bat activity occurred in July and September, representing 30% and 42% increases in discrete bat events from the preceding months June and August, respectively. Bats exhibited behaviors around the turbine that increased in both diversity and duration in July and September. The peaks in bat events were reflected in chasing and turbine approach behaviors. Many of the bat events involved multiple approaches to the turbine, including when bats were displaced through the air by moving blades. The seasonal and nightly patterns we observed were consistent with the possibility that wind turbines invoke investigative behaviors in bats in late summer and autumn coincident with migration and that bats may return and fly close to wind turbines even after experiencing potentially disruptive stimuli like moving blades. Our results point to the need for a deeper understanding of the seasonality, drivers, and characteristics of bat movement across spatial scales.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wake steering of multirotor wind turbines","Speakman, Gustav A.; Abkar, Mahdi; Martínez‐Tossas, Luis A.; Bastankhah, Majid","17 WIND ENERGY; multirotor turbine; turbine wakes; velocity deficit; wake steering","In this paper, wake steering is applied to multirotor turbines to determine whether it has the potential to reduce wind plant wake losses. Through application of rotor yaw to multirotor turbines, a new degree of freedom is introduced to wind farm control such that wakes can be expanded, channelled or redirected to improve inflow conditions for downstream turbines. Five different yaw configurations are investigated (including a baseline case) by employing large-eddy simulations (LES) to generate a detailed representation of the velocity field downwind of a multirotor wind turbine. Two lower-fidelity models from single-rotor yaw studies (curled-wake model and analytical Gaussian wake model) are extended to the multirotor case, and their results are compared with the LES data. For each model, the wake is analysed primarily by examining wake cross-sections at different downwind distances. Further quantitative analysis is carried out through characterisations of wake centroids and widths over a range of streamwise locations and through a brief analysis of power production. Most significantly, it is shown that rotor yaw can have a considerable impact on both the distribution and magnitude of the wake velocity deficit, leading to power gains for downstream turbines. The lower-fidelity models show small deviation from the LES results for specific configurations; however, both are able to reasonably capture the wake trends over a large streamwise range.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the existing Si-based solutions cannot fulfill the requirements of a high-efficiency and robust converter for MVDC grids. This paper presents a 5 kV SiC-based universal modular solid-state transformer (SST). This universal current-source SST can interface either a LVAC or LVDC grid with a MVDC grid in single-stage power conversion, while the conventional dual active bridge (DAB) converter needs an additional inverter. The proposed SST module using 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs and diodes is bidirectional and can serve as a building block in series or parallel for higher-voltage higher-power systems. The topology of each module is based on the soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T) with reduced conduction loss, which features reduced EMI through controlled dv/dt, and high efficiency with full-range ZVS for main devices and ZCS for auxiliary devices. Operation principle of the modular S4T (M-S4T), capacitor voltage balancing control between the cascaded modules, design of components including a medium-voltage (MV) medium-frequency transformer (MFT) to realize a 50 kVA 5 kV DC to 600 V DC or 480 V AC M-S4T are presented. Importantly, the MV MFT prototype achieves very low leakage inductance (0.13%) and 15 kV insulation with coaxial cables and nanocrystalline cores. Here, the proposed universal modular SST is compared against the DAB solution and verified with DC-DC and DC-AC simulation and 4 kV experimental results. Significantly, the MV experimental results of a modular DC transformer with each module at MVDC are rarely covered in the literature and reported for the first time.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-03-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 10","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11326-11343","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3066908","","2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","1894263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894263","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894263","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","10","36"

"An overview of wind-energy-production prediction bias, losses, and uncertainties","Lee, Joseph C. Y.; Fields, M. Jason","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; production; prediction bias; literature review","<p>Abstract. The financing of a wind farm directly relates to the preconstruction energy yield assessments which estimate the annual energy production for the farm. The accuracy and the precision of the preconstruction energy estimates can dictate the profitability of the wind project. Historically, the wind industry tended to overpredict the annual energy production of wind farms. Experts have been dedicated to eliminating such prediction errors in the past decade, and recently the reported average energy prediction bias is declining. Herein, we present a literature review of the energy yield assessment errors across the global wind energy industry. We identify a long-term trend of reduction in the overprediction bias, whereas the uncertainty associated with the prediction error is prominent. We also summarize the recent advancements of the wind resource assessment process that justify the bias reduction, including improvements in modeling and measurement techniques. Additionally, because the energy losses and uncertainties substantially influence the prediction error, we document and examine the estimated and observed loss and uncertainty values from the literature, according to the proposed framework in the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-15 wind resource assessment standard. From our findings, we highlight opportunities for the industry to move forward, such as the validation and reduction of prediction uncertainty and the prevention of energy losses caused by wake effect and environmental events. Overall, this study provides a summary of how the wind energy industry has been quantifying and reducing prediction errors, energy losses, and production uncertainties. Finally, for this work to be as reproducible as possible, we include all of the data used in the analysis in appendices to the article.</p>","Copernicus GmbH","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Utilizing physics-based input features within a machine learning model to predict wind speed forecasting error","Vassallo, Daniel; Krishnamurthy, Raghavendra; Fernando, Harindra S.","17 WIND ENERGY; Machine learning; wind forecast error; ARIMA; boundary layer","Machine learning is quickly becoming a commonly used technique for wind speed and power forecasting. Many machine learning methods utilize exogenous variables as input features, but there remains the question of which atmospheric variables are most beneficial for forecasting, especially in handling non-linearities that lead to forecasting error. This question is addressed via creation of a hybrid model that utilizes an autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) model to make an initial wind speed forecast followed by a random forest model that attempts to predict the ARIMA forecasting error using knowledge of exogenous atmospheric variables. Variables conveying information about atmospheric stability and turbulence as well as inertial forcing are found to be useful in dealing with non-linear error prediction. Streamwise wind speed, time of day, turbulence intensity, turbulent heat flux, vertical velocity, and wind direction are found to be particularly useful when used in unison for hourly and 3 h timescales. The prediction accuracy of the developed ARIMA–random forest hybrid model is compared to that of the persistence and bias-corrected ARIMA models. The ARIMA–random forest model is shown to improve upon the latter commonly employed modeling methods, reducing hourly forecasting error by up to 5 % below that of the bias-corrected ARIMA model and achieving an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.84 with true wind speed.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"NREL’s Wind Turbine Drivetrain Condition Monitoring and Wind Plant Operation and Maintenance Research During the 2010s: A US Land-Based Perspective","Sheng, Shawn","17 WIND ENERGY; compact filter analysis; condition monitoring; data analytics; drivetrain; operation and maintenance; wind turbine","The wind industry has seen tremendous growth during the past two decades, with the global cumulative installation capacity reaching more than 650 gigawatts by the end of 2019. Despite performance and reliability improvements of utility-scale wind turbines over the years, the industry still experiences premature component failures, leading to increased operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Among various turbine components, gearboxes—and, more broadly, drivetrains—have shown to be costly to maintain throughout the design life of a wind turbine. The problem of premature component failure is industry wide. As early as 2007, the US Department of Energy (DOE) started to address this challenge through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) reliability initiative that first focused on gearboxes and more recently expanded to entire drivetrains. The wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring and wind plant O&M research that is the subject of this paper is part of the NREL initiative and includes a few research and development (R&D) activities conducted during the 2010s. These activities included technology evaluation during the first few years; novel monitoring technique investigation (specifically, compact filter analysis) during the middle years; and data and physics domain modeling for fault detection and prediction in recent years. A high-level summary of these activities is provided in this paper along with some key observations from each activity. Most of the work discussed has been published and can be referred to for more information. They reflect the expected evolution of wind turbine condition monitoring and O&M in the US market—primarily, a land-based perspective. In addition, we have identified several R&D opportunities that can be picked up by the research community to help industry advance in related areas, making wind power more cost competitive in the future.","Springer Nature","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, ammonia is also associated with two major environmental concerns: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the conventional production process and nitrogen pollution from the excessive use of ammonia-based fertilizers. To mitigate these environmental impacts, we develop an optimization framework for the design of a sustainable ammonia-based agricultural system that synergistically integrates the production of ammonia from renewable resources and effective measures for nitrogen management. The proposed model captures the effect of intermittency by incorporating both design and detailed operational decisions. Here, by applying a multiscale time representation that reduces the problem size and a tailored surrogate model that accurately approximates model nonlinearity, we are able to achieve optimal solutions within reasonable computation times. A computational case study is conducted using real-world data from a local farm in Morris, Minnesota, and the results indicate the trade-off between cost and nitrogen loss. Importantly, we show that practicing effective nitrogen management can significantly reduce the nitrogen loss with only a small increase in net present cost.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2021-02-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 7; Related Information: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08643?goto=supporting-info","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2816-2834","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-0485","10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08643","","2022-02-09T00:00:00Z","1779774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1779774","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1779774","ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering","7","9"
"A systematic evaluation of wind's capacity credit in the Western United States","Jorgenson, Jennie; Awara, Sarah; Stephen, Gord; Mai, Trieu","17 WIND ENERGY; capacity credit; offshore wind; resource adequacy; wind","The degree to which wind energy can contribute to the capacity needed to meet resource adequacy requirements, also known as capacity credit (CC), can be impacted by many factors. The CC varies regionally with wind resource and correlation to net load and may also vary with wind technology (land-based versus offshore) and turbine specifications. We use a probabilistic resource adequacy tool to systematically assess the CC of multiple technologies for near-term wind deployment across the Western US power system to help inform planning decisions. We find that wind CC varies by weather year and location but averages 16% for land-based turbines and 41% for offshore turbines, with large regional variations. The average wind CC increases to 20% for land-based and 53% for offshore when considering only the sites in the top 25th percentile of capacity factor. The CC of land-based wind is generally lower than its capacity factor, which indicates a low correlation of generation to system needs. However, offshore wind shows a substantially higher CC, which is driven by not only a higher capacity factor but also a greater correlation with system needs.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Analytical solution for the cumulative wake of wind turbines in wind farms","Bastankhah, Majid; Welch, Bridget L.; Martinez-Tossas, Luis A.; King, Jennifer; Fleming, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; wind farm control; wakes; wake model; wind farm model","This paper solves an approximate form of conservation of mass and momentum for a turbine in a wind farm array. The solution is a fairly simple explicit relationship that predicts the streamwise velocity distribution within a wind farm with an arbitrary layout. As this model is obtained by solving flow-governing equations directly for a turbine that is subject to upwind turbine wakes, no ad hoc superposition technique is needed to predict wind farm flows. A suite of large-eddy simulations (LES) of wind farm arrays is used to examine self-similarity as well as validity of the so-called conservation of momentum deficit for turbine wakes in wind farms. The simulations are performed with and without the presence of some specific turbines in the wind farm. This allows us to systematically study some of the assumptions made to develop the analytical model. A modified version of the conservation of momentum deficit is also proposed to provide slightly better results at short downwind distances, as well as in the far wake of turbines deep inside a wind farm. Model predictions are validated against the LES data for turbines in both full-wake and partial-wake conditions. While our results highlight the limitation in capturing the flow speed-up between adjacent turbine columns, the model is overall able to acceptably predict flow distributions for a moderately sized wind farm. Finally, the paper employs the new model to provide insights on the accuracy of common wake superposition methods.","Cambridge University Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Interactions of Wind Energy Project Siting, Wind Resource Potential, and the Evolution of the U.S. Power System","Mai, Trieu; Lopez, Anthony; Mowers, Matthew; Lantz, Eric","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; land use; power sector modeling; technical potential; wind energy","The interactions of wind energy project siting, resource potential, and power system evolution are critical to understand given interest in high renewable energy systems, particularly as wind costs have fallen and grid operators implement solutions to manage variable generation. This study applies an integrative approach that combines spatially-explicit resource potential analysis with high spatial resolution U.S. electricity system modeling. Multiple wind supply curves, representing variations in siting regimes that account for interactions with built infrastructure, regulatory, physical, and social land use factors, are evaluated to determine how siting could influence prospective wind development. Different siting regimes lead to variations in future wind capacity, with the greatest impacts observed under scenarios with high demand for clean energy. With the tightest emissions limit modeled, 2050 onshore wind capacity varied by +7% (49 GW) in the least-restrictive siting regime to a decrease of 37% (270 GW) under the most-constrained case. More-stringent siting restrictions lead to higher electricity prices and emissions that should be weighed with local impacts. Under restrictive siting regimes, wind deployment is also sensitive to transmission availability and wind plant design. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of local land use considerations in regional and national power system planning.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Quantifying sensitivity in numerical weather prediction-modeled offshore wind speeds through an ensemble modeling approach","Optis, Mike; Kumler, Andrew; Brodie, Joseph; Miles, Travis","17 WIND ENERGY; model sensitivity; numerical weather prediction; offshore wind; uncertainty quantification","A decade of research has shown that numerical weather prediction (NWP)-modeled wind speeds can be highly sensitive to the inputs and setups within the NWP model. For wind resource characterization applications, this sensitivity is often addressed by constructing a range of setups and selecting the one that best validates against observations. However, this approach is not possible in areas that lack high-quality hub height observations, especially offshore wind areas. In such cases, techniques to quantify and disseminate confidence in NWP-modeled wind speeds in the absence of observations are needed. We address this need in the present study and propose best practices for quantifying the spread in NWP-modeled wind speeds. We implement an ensemble approach in which we consider 24 different setups to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We construct the ensemble by considering variations in WRF version, WRF namelist, atmospheric forcing, and sea surface temperature (SST) forcing. Our analysis finds that the standard deviation produces more consistent estimates compared to the interquartile range and tends to be the more conservative estimator for ensemble variability. We further find that model spread increases closer to the surface and on shorter time scales. In conclusion, we explore methods to attribute total ensemble variability to the different ensemble components (e.g., atmospheric forcing and SST product) and find that contributions by components also vary depending on time scale. We anticipate that the methods and results presented in this paper will provide a reasonable foundation for further research into ensemble-based wind resource data sets.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind turbine blade material in the United States: Quantities, costs, and end-of-life options","Cooperman, Aubryn; Eberle, Annika; Lantz, Eric","17 WIND ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; wind turbine blades; circular economy; composites; recycling; wind turbine waste","Wind energy has experienced enormous growth in the past few decades; as a result, there are thousands of wind turbines around the world that will reach the end of their design lifetimes in the coming years. Much of the material in those turbines can be recycled using conventional processes, but the composite material that is the main component of the blades is more challenging to recycle. In the United States, turbine blades may be disposed of in landfills, adding a new solid waste stream to the material already being landfilled. This paper presents a spatially resolved estimate of the mass and volume of wind turbine blade waste in each state by 2050 and compares these amounts to estimates of the remaining landfill capacity by state. In this work, we estimate costs for each stage of the disposal process to indicate cost levels for alternatives. Assuming a 20-year turbine lifetime, the cumulative blade waste in 2050 is approximately 2.2 million tons. This value represents approximately 1% of remaining landfill capacity by volume, or 0.2% by mass. We also find that the current cost of disposing of blades in large segments or through grinding is relatively low in comparison to the overall life-cycle cost of energy. Based on these findings, landfill space constraints and disposal costs appear unlikely to motivate a change in waste handling strategies under current policy conditions. Instead, more profound shifts in recycling technologies, blade materials, or policy may be needed to move towards a circular economy for wind turbine blades.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Floating platform effects on power generation in spar and semisubmersible wind turbines","Johlas, Hannah M.; Martínez‐Tossas, Luis A.; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Lackner, Matthew A.; Schmidt, David P.","17 WIND ENERGY; curled wake; floris; solver; wakes; wind farm","The design and financing of commercial-scale floating offshore wind projects require a better understanding of how power generation differs between newer floating turbines and well-established fixed-bottom turbines. In floating turbines, platform mobility causes additional rotor motion that can change the time-averaged power generation. In this work, OpenFAST simulations examine the power generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's 5-MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar and OC4-DeepCWind semisubmersible floating platforms, subjected to extreme irregular waves and below-rated turbulent inflow wind from large-eddy simulations of a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. For these below-rated conditions, average power generation in floating turbines is most affected by two types of turbine displacements: an average rotor pitch angle that reduces power, caused by platform pitch; and rotor motion upwind-downwind that increases power, caused by platform surge and pitch. The relative balance between these two effects determines whether a floating platform causes power gains or losses compared to a fixed-bottom turbine; for example, the spar creates modest (3.1%–4.5%) power gains, whereas the semisubmersible creates insignificant (0.1%–0.2%) power gains for the simulated conditions. Furthermore, platform surge and pitch motions must be analyzed concurrently to fully capture power generation in floating turbines, which is not yet universal practice. Finally, a simple analytical model for predicting average power in floating turbines under below-rated wind speeds is proposed, incorporating effects from both the time-averaged pitch displacement and the dynamic upwind-downwind displacements.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Automated blade–impacts on potential wildlife monitoring can support the development and operations of wind farms. A substantial challenge is represented by the typical case of impacts vibrations signature embedded in the operational vibrations of the wind turbine. A heterogeneous multisensor system for automatic eagle detection and deterrent, including an automatic blade–event detection module, was developed providing the necessary field data. An automated blade event detection system, based on support vector machine, a form of machine learning, was developed and tested. Training of the algorithm was performed using features extracted from vibration signals and energy distribution graphs obtained from numerical simulations of blade impacts. Performance of the method, evaluated using numerical simulations at different levels of signal–to–noise ratios, relative to artificial impacts, showed the best results when trained using combined raw vibration signal and time marginal integration graphs, exhibiting an overall accuracy of 93% at SNR=6. The proposed model was tailored for improving specificity (i.e., false negative error), a critical aspect for endangered species events. Performance of the trained algorithm evaluating field data exhibited an improvement in impact detection from a visually identifiable rate of 42% to true positive prediction rate of 75%. The system could perform, with appropriate training, diverse functions as components health monitoring or lighting strike automatic monitoring.","Wiley","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United Kingdom","2021-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Wind Energy","","Medium: X; Size: p. 672-685","","","EE0007885","Journal ID: ISSN 1095-4244","10.1002/we.2596","","2021-07-05T00:00:00Z","1760081","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1760081","","Wind Energy","",""
"Coupling Mesoscale Budget Components to Large-Eddy Simulations for Wind-Energy Applications","Draxl, Caroline; Allaerts, Dries; Quon, Eliot; Churchfield, Matt","17 WIND ENERGY; OpenFOAM; WRF; mesoscale-to-microscale coupling; momentum budget components","To simulate the airflow through a wind farm across a wide range of atmospheric conditions, microscale models (e.g., large-eddy simulation, LES, models) have to be coupled with mesoscale models, because microscale models lack the atmospheric physical processes to represent time-varying local forcing. Here we couple mesoscale model outputs to a LES solver by applying mesoscale momentum- and temperature-budget components from the Weather Research and Forecasting model to the governing equations of the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications model. We test whether averaging the budget components affects the LES results with regard to quantities of interest to wind energy. Our study focuses on flat terrain during a quiescent diurnal cycle. The simulation results are compared with observations from a 200-m tall meteorological tower and a wind-profiling radar, by analyzing time series, profiles, rotor-averaged quantities, and spectra. However, while results show that averaging reduces the spatio-temporal variability of the mesoscale momentum-budget components, when coupled with the LES model, the mesoscale bias (in comparison with observations of wind speed and direction, and potential temperature) is not reduced. In contrast, the LES technique can correct for shear and veer. In both cases, however, averaging the budget components shows no significant impact on the mean flow quantities in the microscale and is not necessary when coupling mesocale budget components to the LES model.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In particular, when stably stratified air ascends a mountain barrier, buoyancy perturbations develop. These perturbations can trigger mountain waves downstream of the mountains that can reach deep into the atmospheric boundary layer where wind turbines operate. Several such cases of mountain waves occurred during the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2) in the Columbia River basin in the lee of the Cascade Range bounding the states of Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Signals from the mountain waves appear in boundary layer sodar and lidar observations as well as in nacelle wind speeds and power observations from wind plants. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations also produce mountain waves and are compared to satellite, lidar, and sodar observations. Simulated mountain wave wavelengths and wave propagation speeds (group velocities) are analyzed using the fast Fourier transform. We found that not all mountain waves exhibit the same speed and conclude that the speed of propagation, magnitudes of wind speeds, or wavelengths are important parameters for forecasters to recognize the risk for mountain waves and associated large drops or surges in power. When analyzing wind farm power output and nacelle wind speeds, we found that even small oscillations in wind speed caused by mountain waves can induce oscillations between full-rated power of a wind farm and half of the power output, depending on the position of the mountain wave's crests and troughs. For the wind plant analyzed in this paper, mountain-wave-induced fluctuations translate to approximately 11?% of the total wind farm output being influenced by mountain waves. Oscillations in measured wind speeds agree well with WRF simulations in timing and magnitude. We conclude that mountain waves can impact wind turbine and wind farm power output and, therefore, should be considered in complex terrain when designing, building, and forecasting for wind farms.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

On 18 June 2019, National Weather Service (NWS) radar reflectivity data indicated the presence of thunderstorm-generated outflow propagating east-southeastward near Lubbock, Texas. A section of the outflow boundary encountered a wind farm and then experienced a notable reduction in ground-relative velocity, suggesting that interactions with the wind farm impacted the outflow boundary progression. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting model and its wind farm parameterization to address the extent to which wind farms can modify the near-surface environment of thunderstorm outflow boundaries. We conduct two simulations of the June 2019 outflow event: one containing the wind farm and one without. We specifically investigate the outflow speed of the section of the boundary that encounters the wind farm and the associated impacts on near-surface wind speed, moisture, temperature, and changes to precipitation features as the storm and associated outflow pass over the wind farm domain. The NWS radar and nearby West Texas Mesonet surface stations provide observations for validation of the simulations. The presence of the wind farm in the simulation clearly slows the progress of the outflow boundary by over 20 km h<sup>-1</sup>, similar to what was observed. Simulated perturbations of surface wind speed, temperature, and moisture associated with outflow passage were delayed by up to 6 min when the wind farm was present in the simulation compared to the simulation without the wind farm.

Large-eddy simulation (LES) has complemented measurement campaigns by serving as a controlled environment in which to study plume dynamics and sampling strategies. However, with few comparisons with controlled-release experiments, the accuracy of LES for modeling natural gas emissions is poorly characterized. In this paper, we evaluate LES from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model against Project Prairie Grass campaign measurements and surface layer similarity theory. Using WRF-LES, we simulate continuous emissions from 30 near-surface trace gas sources in two stability regimes: strong convection and weak convection. We examine the impact of grid resolutions ranging from 6.25 to 52 m in the horizontal dimension on model results. We evaluate performance in a statistical framework, calculating fractional bias and conducting Welch’s t tests. WRF-LES accurately simulates observed surface concentrations at 100 m and beyond under strong convection; simulated concentrations pass t tests in this region irrespective of grid resolution. However, in weakly convective conditions with strong winds, WRF-LES substantially overpredicts concentrations—the magnitude of fractional bias often exceeds 30%, and all but one t test fails. The good performance of WRF-LES under strong convection correlates with agreement with local free convection theory and a minimal amount of parameterized turbulent kinetic energy. The poor performance under weak convection corresponds to misalignment with Monin–Obukhov similarity theory and a significant amount of parameterized turbulent kinetic energy.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Low-inertia converters, featuring small electrolytic capacitor-less dc links, dramatically reduce cost, size, and weight compared to conventional solutions. However, without a large dc-link buffer, the input and output are tightly coupled, leading to significant control challenges. The control becomes even more challenging with these converters stacked input-series output-parallel (ISOP) for medium-voltage (MV) grid, which causes coupling between the modules besides the coupling within each module. This paper analyzes the multi-objective, multi-degree of freedom control problem, using the modular soft-switching solid-state transformer (M-S4T) as an example of the SLIC. First, distribution of control efforts under controller saturation is critical because multiple control objectives can be conflicting, especially when the module voltages are unbalanced and are being restored. The MPPS can shift the priorities to address this issue. Second, due to the low inertia and high dc-link ripple, classic space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM), average model with small-ripple assumption, and control design based on small-signal model cannot accurately modulate, model, and control the nonlinear reduced dc link. Therefore, a discrete-time large-signal model of the M-S4T is established to derive the predictive control in the MPPS. The MPPS and the PI control are compared in MV simulations to show the issue of applying the PI to the SLIC and the effectiveness of the MPPS for voltage balancing and dc-link regulation in a deadbeat manner. Finally, the proposed control is tested on a 5 kV ISOP SiC SST prototype to verify priority shifting to address controller saturation issue and fast and robust voltage balancing.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 8","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 8934-8952","","","EE0006521","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2021.3050115","","2022-10-27T00:00:00Z","1894261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1894261","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1894261","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","8","36"

One theory that explains the mortality is that bats are not only killed by impact trauma, but also by barotrauma that results from exposure to the pressure variations caused by rotating turbine blades. To date, no published research has calculated the pressure changes that bats may be exposed to when flying near wind turbines and then used these data to estimate the likelihood that turbines cause barotrauma in bats. To address this shortcoming, we performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of a wind turbine and analytical calculations of blade-tip vortices to estimate the characteristics of the sudden pressure changes bats may experience when flying near a utility-scale wind turbine. Because there are no data available that characterize the pressure changes that cause barotrauma in bats, we compared our results to changes in pressure levels that cause barotrauma and mortality in other mammals of similar size. This comparison shows that the magnitude of the low-pressures bats experience when flying near wind turbines is approximately 8 times smaller than the pressure that causes mortality in rats, the smallest mammal for which data are available. The magnitude of the high-pressures that bats may experience are approximately 80 times smaller than the exposure level that causes 50% mortality in mice, which have a body mass similar to several bat species that are killed by wind turbines. Further, our results show that for a bat to experience the largest possible magnitude of low- and high-pressures, they must take very specific and improbable flight paths that skim the surface of the blades. Even a small change in the flight path results in the bat being hit by the blade or experiencing a much smaller pressure change. Accordingly, if bats have a physiological response to rapid low- and high-pressure exposure that is similar to other mammals, we conclude that it is unlikely that barotrauma is responsible for a significant number of turbine-related bat fatalities, and that impact trauma is the likely cause of the majority of wind-turbine-related bat fatalities.","Public Library of Science","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Efficacy of the Cell Perturbation Method in Large-Eddy Simulations of Boundary Layer Flow over Complex Terrain","Connolly, Alex; van Veen, Leendert; Neher, James; Geurts, Bernard J.; Mirocha, Jeff D.; Chow, Fotini Katopodes","17 WIND ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; large-eddy simulation; complex terrain; weather research and forecasting model; turbulence generation; cell perturbation method; the Perdigão","A challenge to simulating turbulent flow in multiscale atmospheric applications is the efficient generation of resolved turbulence motions over an area of interest. One approach is to apply small perturbations to flow variables near the inflow planes of turbulence-resolving simulation domains nested within larger mesoscale domains. While this approach has been examined in numerous idealized and simple terrain cases, its efficacy in complex terrain environments has not yet been fully explored. Here, we examine the benefits of the stochastic cell perturbation method (CPM) over real complex terrain using data from the 2017 Perdigão field campaign, conducted in an approximately 2-km wide valley situated between two nearly parallel ridges. Following a typical configuration for multiscale simulation using nested domains within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to downscale from the mesoscale to a large-eddy simulation (LES), we apply the CPM on a domain with horizontal grid spacing of 150 m. At this resolution, spurious coherent structures are often observed under unstable atmospheric conditions with moderate mean wind speeds. Results from such an intermediate resolution grid are often nested down for finer, more detailed LES, where these spurious structures adversely affect the development of turbulence on the subsequent finer grid nest. We therefore examine the impacts of the CPM on the representation of turbulence within the nested LES domain under moderate mean flow conditions in three different stability regimes: weakly convective, strongly convective, and weakly stable. In addition, two different resolutions of the underlying terrain are used to explore the role of the complex topography itself in generating turbulent structures. We demonstrate that the CPM improves the representation of turbulence within the LES domain, relative to the use of high-resolution complex terrain alone. During the convective conditions, the CPM improves the rate at which smaller-scales of turbulence form, while also accelerating the attenuation of the spurious numerically generated roll structures near the inflow boundary. During stable conditions, the coarse mesh spacing of the intermediate LES domain used herein was insufficient to maintain resolved turbulence using CPM as the flow develops downstream, highlighting the need for yet higher resolution under even weakly stable conditions, and the importance of accurate representation of flow on intermediate LES grids.","MDPI","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

To examine the cause of this underprediction, the OC6 project is using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to investigate the wave loads on the OC5-DeepCwind semisubmersible, with a focus on the nonlinear difference-frequency excitation. This paper focuses on assessing the uncertainty of the CFD predictions from simulations of the semisubmersible in a fixed condition under bichromatic wave loading and on establishing confidence in the results for use in improving mid-fidelity models. The uncertainty for the nonlinear wave excitation is found to be acceptable but larger than that for the wave-frequency excitation, with the spatial discretization error being the dominant contributor. Further, unwanted free waves at the difference frequency have been identified in the CFD solution. A wave-splitting and wave load-correction procedure are presented to remove the contamination from the free waves in the results. A preliminary comparison to second-order potential-flow theory shows that the CFD model predicted significantly higher difference-frequency wave excitations, especially in surge, suggesting that the CFD results can be used to better calibrate the mid-fidelity tools.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Most wind turbines and other renewables connected to the grid through converters result in a reduction in the natural inertial response to grid frequency changes. The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) can be controlled to compensate for this reduction and, in fact, provide faster response than traditional synchronous machines. This paper proposes to design observer based output feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and H-infinity control laws to realize the inertia emulation function and deliver fast frequency support. The aim is to track the reference speed by a diesel synchronous generator (DSG) in order to reach the desired inertia. The control signal is computed based on a reduced order model using the balanced truncation technique. A comparison with selective modal analysis (SMA) and balanced truncation model reduction techniques is presented. Comprehensive results show the effective emulation of synthetic inertia by implementing the control laws on a nonlinear three-phase diesel-wind system. The proposed technique is analyzed for different short circuit ratio (SCR) scenarios.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Argonne National Lab.

The choice of the rotational direction impacts the wake if the wind profile changes direction with height. Here, we investigate the respective wakes for veering and backing winds in both hemispheres by means of large-eddy simulations. We quantify the sensitivity of the wake to the strength of the wind veer, the wind speed, and the rotational frequency of the rotor in the Northern Hemisphere. A veering wind in combination with counterclockwise-rotating blades results in a larger streamwise velocity output, a larger spanwise wake width, and a larger wake deflection angle at the same downwind distance in comparison to a clockwise-rotating turbine in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the same wake characteristics occur if the turbine rotates counterclockwise. These downwind differences in the wake result from the amplification or weakening or reversion of the spanwise wind component due to the effect of the superimposed vortex of the rotor rotation on the inflow's shear. An increase in the directional shear or the rotational frequency of the rotor under veering wind conditions increases the difference in the spanwise wake width and the wake deflection angle between clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating actuators, whereas the wind speed lacks a significant impact.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We employ mid-twenty-first century climate projections and a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model to generate weather variables in the future and produce wind and solar generation time series. We find that mid-twenty-first century projections based on five global climate models agree on the multiyear average increases across Texas in direct normal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance, surface air temperature, and 100-m wind speed of up to 5%, 4%, 10%, and 1%, respectively. These changes lead to multiyear average relative changes across Texas of -0.6 to +2.5% and of +1.3 to +3.5% in solar and wind capacity factors, respectively, with significant regional, seasonal, and diurnal differences. Areas with low solar resource show an increase in solar capacity factors but reductions in wind capacity factors. Areas with high solar resource show reductions in solar capacity factors.

Communities near wind energy developments are also concerned with social and economic impacts, as well as impacts on aesthetics, historical sites, and recreation and tourism. Lack of a systematic, widely accepted, and balanced approach for measuring the potential damage to wildlife, habitats, and communities continues to leave wind developers, regulators, and other stakeholders in an uncertain position. This paper explores ecological risk-based management (RBM) in wind energy development for land-based and offshore wind installations. This paper provides a framework for the adaptation of ecosystem-based management to wind energy development and examines that framework through a series of case studies and best management practices for applying risk-based principles to wind energy. Ten case studies indicate that wind farm monitoring is often driven by regulatory requirements that may not be underpinned by scientific questions. While each case applies principles of adaptive management, there is room for improvement in applying scientific principles to the data collection and analysis. Challenges and constraints for wind farm development to meet RBM framework criteria include collecting sufficient baseline and monitoring data year-round, engaging stakeholder facilitators, and bringing together large and diverse scientific teams. The RBM framework approach may provide insights for improved siting and consenting/permitting processes for regulators and their advisors, particularly in those nations where wind energy is still in the early development stages on land or at sea.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The main goal of the project is to understand and improve the forecast skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in complex terrain, particularly beneficial for the wind energy industry. This region is well known for its excellent wind resource. One of the biggest challenges for wind power production is the accurate forecasting of wind ramp events (large changes of generated power over short periods of time). Poor forecasting of the ramps requires large and sudden adjustments in conventional power generation, ultimately increasing the costs of power. A Ramp Tool and Metric (RT&M) was developed during the first WFIP experiment, held in the U.S. Great Plains (September 2011–August 2012). The RT&M was designed to explicitly measure the skill of NWP models at forecasting wind ramp events. In this work we apply the RT&M to 80-m (turbine hub-height) wind speeds measured by 19 sodars and three lidars, and to forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), 3-km, and from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Nest (HRRRNEST), 750-m horizontal grid spacing, models. The diurnal and seasonal distribution of ramp events are analyzed, finding a noticeable diurnal variability for spring and summer but less for fall and especially winter. Also, winter has fewer ramps compared to the other seasons. The model skill at forecasting ramp events, including the impact of the modification to the model physical parameterizations, was finally investigated.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High unit costs can be attributed to design conservatism when calculating fatigue loads of key structural components such as the blades. In this study, we use the aeroelastic software FAST to highlight limitations of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-2:2013 small wind turbine design standard for calculating fatigue life using the simplified load model. We present a modified method for calculating the fatigue spectra of small wind turbine blades. An advantage of this method is that it does not require complex aeroelastic simulations or field measurements. This modified method is intended to be implemented early in the blade design stage, such as during rotor optimization simulations, allowing for multiple rotor configurations to be rapidly compared.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Ageing wind turbine fleets, increasing land-use constraints and rising relevance of societal factors make the deployment of land-based (onshore) wind energy ever more complicated. Consequently, repowering is expected to become a rapidly growing point of focus for the wind industry. Here we propose a more holistic and socially informed project-level approach to analyse repowering activity that enables a more robust understanding of the process and potentials. We demonstrate that for wind pioneer in Denmark, only 67% of the capacity removed in repowering projects was related to the physical space needed for a new turbine. Other factors that drive repowering include regulation (for example, noise-related, 8–17%), development principles (for example, aesthetics, 7–20%) and political bargaining (4–13%). The recognition of repowering as a negotiated process between host communities and wind developers will probably be critical to unlock the full potential of wind energy in the future.","Nature Publishing Group","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Our results suggest that the WRF model has moderate skill in simulating observed mountain wave. Further, given WRF predictions of wavelength range and wave period, the Fast Fourier Transform can calculate the simulated mountain wave impact on hub-height wind speed. The resulting wind speeds agree well with SoDAR observations in terms of both magnitude and pattern. Finally, for the simulated cases, WRF consistently predicts impacts of significant mountain wave events about an hour earlier than the actual observations. Overall, in this work, the sensitivities as well as uncertainties associated with our methodology are discussed in detail.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Comparison of modular analytical wake models to the Lillgrund wind plant","Hamilton, Nicholas; Bay, Christopher J.; Fleming, Paul; King, Jennifer; Martinez-Tossas, Luis A.","17 WIND ENERGY; FLORIS; wake model; deep array; validation","Efficient and accurate wake models are required for wind plant performance modeling and the suite of engineering processes that support wind plant layout, control, and monitoring. Although many analytical and engineering wake models with low computational costs have been proposed, their ability to represent the power production of large wind plants in a wide range of atmospheric conditions is not completely understood. The following validation study reviews the underlying theory for analytical wake models, outlines quality control procedures for observational data, and compares model results with observational data from the Lillgrund Wind Plant. Lillgrund makes a valuable case study for wake modeling because of its regular arrangement and the relatively close spacing of constituent wind turbines, which lead to regular and significant wake interactions within the wind plant and the development of deep array flow conditions. Formulations for the velocity deficit, wake-added turbulence, and wake superposition methods are considered in a modular sense, yielding many possible configurations to represent wind turbine wakes, of which seven are examined in detail. Velocity deficit models that account for flow conditions in the near wake are better able to reproduce power production for wind turbines in the transitional region of the wind plant, where wind turbines experience as many as five wakes from upstream turbines. Finally, in the deep array, where power production reaches asymptotic values and wake statistics become quasi-periodic, wake superposition schemes become the largest driver in error reduction; using the linear or maximum wake superposition methods can reduce the relative root mean square error by as much as 40% in the deep array.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Humboldt County offers access to this enormous resource, but local electric load and transmission are limited. The potential impacts of offshore wind generators at three different scales were studied using a regional grid model of Humboldt County. Offshore wind generation was calculated using modeled wind speed data and 12-MW turbine specifications and integrated with projected load and historical generation. Offshore wind farms deployed in the Humboldt Call Area achieve annual capacity factors between 45% and 54% after losses and maintenance. Power output is variable between and within seasons, with full power output 30% of the time and no output approximately 20% of the time. Electricity from a 48-MW wind farm provides 22% of regional load with limited exports. A 144-MW wind farm serves 38% of local load, exporting 40% of its electricity with the extant 70-MW transmission capacity. A full build-out of 1836 MW would result in 88% curtailment with existing transmission. Across scenarios, offshore wind variability necessitates reliance on existing power plants to meet local demand in periods of low wind.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Operational-based annual energy production uncertainty: are its components actually uncorrelated?","Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Mike","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind farm; uncertainty categories; annual energy production; uncorrelated","Calculations of annual energy production (AEP) from a wind power plant – whether based on preconstruction or operational data – are critical for wind plant financial transactions. The uncertainty in the AEP calculation is especially important in quantifying risk and is a key factor in determining financing terms. A popular industry practice is to assume that different uncertainty components within an AEP calculation are uncorrelated and can therefore be combined as the sum of their squares. We assess the practical validity of this assumption for operational-based uncertainty by performing operational AEP estimates for more than 470 wind plants in the United States, mostly in simple terrain. We apply a Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainty in five categories: revenue meter data, wind speed data, regression relationship between density-corrected wind speed (from reanalysis data) and measured wind power, length of long-term-correction data set, and future interannual variability. We identify correlations between categories by comparing the results across all 470 wind plants. We observe a positive correlation between interannual variability and the linearized long-term correction; a negative correlation between wind resource interannual variability and linear regression; and a positive correlation between reference wind speed uncertainty and linear regression. Then, we contrast total operational AEP uncertainty values calculated by omitting and considering correlations between the uncertainty components. We quantify that ignoring these correlations leads to an underestimation of total AEP uncertainty of, on average, 0.1% and as large as 0.5% for specific sites. Although these are not large increases, these would still impact wind plant financing rates; further, we expect these values to increase for wind plants in complex terrain. Based on these results, we conclude that correlations between the identified uncertainty components should be considered when computing the total AEP uncertainty.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Does the rotational direction of a wind turbine impact the wake in a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer?","Englberger, Antonia; Dörnbrack, Andreas; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wake; atmospheric boundary layer; wind turbine","Stably stratified atmospheric boundary layers are often characterized by a veering wind profile, in which the wind direction changes clockwise with height in the Northern Hemisphere. Wind-turbine wakes respond to this veer in the incoming wind by stretching from a circular shape into an ellipsoid. We investigate the relationship between this stretching and the direction of the turbine rotation by means of large-eddy simulations. Clockwise rotating, counterclockwise rotating, and non-rotating actuator disc turbines are embedded in wind fields of a precursor simulation with no wind veer and in wind fields with a Northern Hemispheric Ekman spiral, resulting in six combinations of rotor rotation and inflow wind condition. The wake strength, extension, width, and deflection depend on the interaction of the meridional component of Ekman spiral with the rotational direction of the actuator disc, whereas the direction of the disc rotation only marginally modifies the wake if no veer is present. The differences result from the amplification or weakening/reversion of the spanwise and the vertical wind components due to the effect of the superposed disc rotation. They are also present in the streamwise wind component of the wake and in the total turbulence intensity. In the case of an counterclockwise rotating actuator disc, the spanwise and vertical wind components increase directly behind the rotor, resulting in the same rotational direction in the whole wake while its strength decreases downwind. In the case of a clockwise rotating actuator disc, however, the spanwise and vertical wind components of the near wake are weakened or even reversed in comparison to the inflow. This weakening/reversion results in a downwind increase in the strength of the flow rotation in the wake or even a different rotational direction in the near wake in comparison to the far wake. The physical mechanism responsible for this difference can be explained by a simple linear superposition of a veering inflow with a Rankine vortex.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Ruby; Sakaguchi, Koichi","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind resources; climate change; operating conditions; climate change mitigation","Wind energy is a virtually carbon-free and pollution-free electricity source, with global wind resources greatly exceeding electricity demand. Accordingly, the installed capacity of wind turbines grew at an annualized rate of >20% from 2000 to 2019 and is projected to increase by a further 50% by the end of 2023. In this Review, we describe the factors that dictate the wind resource magnitude and variability and illustrate the tools and techniques that are being used to make projections of wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions. Natural variability due to the action of internal climate modes appears to dominate over global-warming-induced non-stationarity over most areas with large wind energy installations or potential. However, there is evidence for increased wind energy resources by the end of the current century in northern Europe and the US Southern Great Plains. New technology trends are changing the sensitivity of wind energy to global climate non-stationarity and, thus, present new challenges and opportunities for innovative research. The evolution of climate modelling to increasingly address mesoscale processes is providing improved projections of both wind resources and wind turbine operating conditions, and will contribute to continued reductions in the levelized cost of energy from wind power generation.","Springer Nature","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

The traditional SSTs are typically three-stage, i.e., hard-switching cascaded multilevel rectifiers and inverters with dual active bridge (DAB) converters, which leads to bulky passives, low efficiency, and high electromagnetic interference (EMI). This article proposes a new soft-switching solid-state transformer (S4T). The S4T has full-range zero-voltage switching (ZVS), electrolytic capacitor-less dc link, and controlled dv/dt, which reduces EMI. The S4T comprises two reverse-blocking current-source inverter (CSI) bridges, auxiliary branches for ZVS, and transformer magnetizing inductor as a reduced dc link with 60% ripple. Compared with the prior S4T, an effective change on the leakage inductance diode is made to reduce the number of the devices on the main power path by 20% for significant conduction loss saving and retain the same functionality of damping the resonance between the leakage and resonant capacitors and recycling trapped leakage energy. The conduction loss saving is crucial, being the dominating loss mechanism in SSTs. Importantly, the proposed single-stage SST not only holds the potential for high power density and high efficiency but also has full functionality, e.g., multiport dc loads integration, voltage regulation, and reactive power compensation, unlike the traditional single-stage matrix SST. The S4T can achieve single-stage isolated bidirectional dc–dc, ac–dc, dc–ac, or ac–ac conversion. It can also be configured input-series output-parallel (ISOP) in a modular way for medium-voltage (MV) grids. Hence, the S4T is a promising candidate for the SST. The full functionality, e.g., voltage buck–boost, multiport, etc., and the universality of the S4T for the dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac conversion are verified through the simulations and experiments of two-port and three-port MV prototypes based on 3.3 kV SiC MOSFETs in dc–dc, dc–ac, and ac–ac modes at 2 kV.","IEEE","","Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-10-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 5236-5249","","","AR0000899","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8993","10.1109/tpel.2020.3030795","","2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","1892476","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1892476","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1892476","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","5","36"

Wake measurements of a scanning Doppler lidar mounted on the nacelle of a full-scale wind turbine during a wake-steering experiment were used for the characterization of the wake flow, the evaluation of the wake-steering set-up, and the validation of analytical wake models. Inflow-scanning Doppler lidars, a meteorological mast, and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of the wind turbine complemented the set-up. Results from the wake-scanning Doppler lidar showed an increase in the wake deflection with the yaw angle and that the wake deflection was not in all cases beneficial for the power output of a downstream turbine due to a bias of the inflow wind direction perceived by the yawed wind turbine and the wake-steering design implemented. Both observations could be reproduced with an analytical model that was initialized with the inflow measurements. Error propagation from the inflow measurements that were used as model input and the power coefficient of a waked wind turbine contributed significantly to the model uncertainty. Lastly, the span-wise cross section of the wake was strongly affected by wind veer, masking the effects of the yawed wind turbine on the wake cross sections.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Even assuming perfect transmission of wind and solar generation aggregated over CONUS, energy storage costs would need to decrease several hundred-fold from current costs (to ~$1/kWh) in fully VRE electricity systems to yield highly reliable electricity without extensive curtailment of VRE generation. The role of energy storage changes from high-cost storage competing with curtailment to fill short-term gaps between VRE generation and hourly demand to near-free storage serving as seasonal storage for VRE resources. Energy storage faces ""double penalties"" in VRE/storage systems: with increasing capacity, (1) the additional storage is used less frequently and (2) hourly electricity costs would become less volatile, thus reducing price arbitrage opportunities for the additional storage.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The subscale model was achieved through geometric scaling and by aeroelastic scaling principles based on operational flapwise deflections combined with rotational and structural frequencies while retaining the turbine tip-speed ratio. In particular, the subscale demonstrator was designed to replicate, as closely as possible, the nondimensional geometry, the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational moments, the tip-speed ratio, and the nondimensional rotation rate. The intent for this demonstrator was to achieve the same nondimensional flapwise blade deflections and dynamics of the full-scale 13-MW rotor. The manufactured SUMR-D blade resulted in less than half of the mass of the conventional two-bladed Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART2) rotor blade based on scaling and a lower power rating, though with some differences in mass and stiffness from the ideal scaled-down design to meet safety requirements at the test site. To achieve proper scaling, operational pitch control set points were altered to account for the differences by evaluating simulated operation of both the SUMR-13 and SUMR-D rotors. Structural testing of the SUMR-D blade investigated the response to well-defined flapwise loads and indicated that the subscale blade had the appropriate elastic properties needed for both scaling and for safe operational field testing.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Toward flow control: An assessment of the curled wake model in the FLORIS framework","Bay, Christopher J.; King, Jennifer; Martinez-Tossas, Luis A.; Mudafort, Rafael; Hulsman, Paul; Kühn, Martin; Fleming, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; FLORIS; wind energy; wind farm control; offshore wind energy; flow control","In this work, a new controls-oriented wake model is modified and compared to an analytical Gaussian wake model, high-fidelity simulation data, and experimental wind tunnel campaign. This model, called the curled wake model, captures a wake phenomenon that occurs behind yawed turbines, modeled as a collection of vortices shed from the rotor plane. Through turbine simulations, these vortices are shown to have a significant impact on the prediction of the wake steering's performance. Overall, the results support the concept of secondary steering, or a yawed turbine's ability to deflect the wake of a downstream turbine, and suggest that future turbine wake studies and yaw optimizations should include the curled wake phenomenon.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-range Doppler lidar measurements of wind turbine wakes and their interaction with turbulent atmospheric boundary-layer flow at Perdigao 2017","Wildmann, Norman; Gerz, Thomas; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; Doppler wind lidars; flow velocities; turbulent kinetic energy; variance; wind direction; wind turbine","As part of the Perdigão 2017 campaign, vertical RHI (range-height indicator) scans with long-range pulsed Doppler wind lidars were performed aligned with the main wind direction and a wind turbine (WT) located on a mountain ridge. The measurements are used to not only retrieve flow velocities, but also their variance and - by using the turbulent broadening of the Doppler spectrum - also turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate. The study shows that turbulence in the WT wake is dependent on the turbulence of the inflow, but also on atmospheric stability. In stable atmospheric conditions, wakes could be analyzed up to five rotor diameters downstream (D) and showed the maximum turbulence in the wake at 2-3 D, whereas in unstable conditions, the maximum was found at 2 D and the wake could not be detected further than 3 D. A clear dependency of wake turbulence enhancement on inflow turbulence intensity is found, which levels out to no further enhancement at turbulence intensities of 30%.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The effect of dynamic near-wake modulation on utility-scale wind turbine wake development","Abraham, Aliza; Martínez-Tossas, Luis A.; Hong, Jiarong","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric conditions; dynamic turbine operation; flow visualization; large-eddy simulations; wake mixing; wind turbines","High-resolution field-scale experiments using flow visualization with natural snowfall and high-fidelity large eddy simulations are combined to investigate the effect of dynamic turbine operation and atmospheric conditions on wind turbine wake mixing and recovery in the wake of a 2.5 MW wind turbine. Instantaneous near-wake expansion and deflection in response to changes in blade pitch and wind direction, termed dynamic wake modulation, is quantified using both techniques, demonstrating excellent agreement. The simulations are used to extend these results by calculating the energy flux into the wake 7 rotor diameters downstream, showing that dynamic turbine-atmospheric interactions enhance mixing in the far-wake. This finding is exhibited under both uniform and turbulent inflow conditions. Under turbulent flow, a synergistic relationship is also observed between dynamic wake modulation and wake meandering, as wake recovery can be further accelerated when the two phenomena occur together. The results of this study have implications for the development of more realistic far-wake models that include the significant impact of dynamic wake modulation on wake mixing and development. Additionally, the findings from the current study can be used to develop advanced control algorithms to speed up wake breakdown and recovery, further improving wind farm efficiency.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Tool capabilities were extended to facilitate multiple aerodynamic polar tables. The airfoil aerodynamics characteristics were automatically determined, and blade-pitch, generator-torque, and trailing-edge-flap controllers were tuned in-the-loop according to a specific blade design. This automated workflow allows analysis and optimization of trailing-edge flaps, enabling codesign studies. Results targeted reductions of root-flap-bending moment derivatives. The applied trailing-edge-flap control reduced the standard deviation of root-flap-bending moments by more than 6% and benefit related parameters, e.g., reduce blade-tip deflections, by up to 8%. Because of varying thrust distributions along the blade span, different flap designs have nonlinear characteristics in terms of the control objective and show best performance when located at the radial position with maximum thrust. In general, larger flaps provide a greater influence to reduce the target control objective.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How accurate is a machine learning-based wind speed extrapolation under a round-robin approach?","Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Mike","17 WIND ENERGY; machine learning; wind energy; wind speed; extrapolation","As the size of commercial wind turbines keeps increasing, having accurate ways to vertically extrapolate wind speed is essential to obtain a precise characterization of the wind resource for wind energy production. Recently, machine learning has been proposed and applied to extrapolate wind speed to hub heights. However, previous studies trained and tested the machine learning methods at the same site, giving them an unfair advantage over the conventional extrapolation techniques, which are instead more universal. Here, we use data from four sites in Oklahoma to test a round-robin validation approach for machine learning, under which we train a random forest at a site, and test it at a different site, where the model has no prior knowledge of the wind resource. We quantify how the accuracy of this technique varies with distance from the training site, and we find that it outperforms conventional techniques for wind extrapolation at all the considered spatial separations. We then assess how the accuracy of the machine-learning based approach varies when it is used to predict wind speed in a wind farm far wake. Finally, we explore as case study the performance of the random forest in extrapolating winds during a low-level jet event.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"US East Coast synthetic aperture radar wind atlas for offshore wind energy","Ahsbahs, Tobias; Maclaurin, Galen; Draxl, Caroline; Jackson, Christopher R.; Monaldo, Frank; Badger, Merete","17 WIND ENERGY; offshore wind energy; synthetic aperture radar; wind atlas; WIND Toolkit","We present the first synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offshore wind atlas of the US East Coast from Georgia to the Canadian border. Images from RADARSAT-1, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B are processed to wind maps using the geophysical model function (GMF) CMOD5.N. Extensive comparisons with 6008 collocated buoy observations of the wind speed reveal that biases of the individual systems range from -0.8 to 0.6 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Unbiased wind retrievals are crucial for producing an accurate wind atlas, and intercalibration of the SAR observations is therefore applied. Wind retrievals from the intercalibrated SAR observations show biases in the range of to -0.2 to 0.0 m s<sup>-1</sup>, while at the same time improving the root-mean-squared error from 1.67 to 1.46 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The intercalibrated SAR observations are, for the first time, aggregated to create a wind atlas at the height 10 m a.s.l. (above sea level). The SAR wind atlas is used as a reference to study wind resources derived from the Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit (WTK), which is based on 7 years of modelling output from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Comparisons focus on the spatial variation in wind resources and show that model outputs lead to lower coastal wind speed gradients than those derived from SAR. Areas designated for offshore wind development by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management are investigated in more detail; the wind resources in terms of the mean wind speed show spatial variations within each designated area between 0.3 and 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> for SAR and less than 0.2m s<sup>-1</sup> for the WTK. Our findings indicate that wind speed gradients and variations might be underestimated in mesoscale model outputs along the US East Coast.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The primary objectives of wind farm control include increasing power production, reducing turbine loads, and providing electricity grid support services. Additional objectives include improving reliability or reducing external impacts to the environment and communities. In 2019, a European research project (FarmConners) was started with the main goal of providing an overview of the state-of-the-art in wind farm control, identifying consensus of research findings, data sets, and best practices, providing a summary of the main research challenges, and establishing a roadmap on how to address these challenges. Complementary to the FarmConners project, an IEA Wind Topical Expert Meeting (TEM) and two rounds of surveys among experts were performed. From these events we can clearly identify an interest in more public validation campaigns. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the mechanical loads and the uncertainties concerning the effectiveness of wind farm control are considered two major research gaps.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

An actuator line model was implemented within an unsteady adjoint solver that enables efficient execution of gradient-based optimization and sensitivity studies. After first confirming the feasibility of wake steering by controlling actuator line chord profiles and formulating a suitable objective function for wake position, a sensitivity study was conducted to determine the relative importance of chord length as a function of spanwise position on the resulting turbine wake deflection. The results presented here support the idea that blade design choices play a role in wake control. In a larger context, this study demonstrates a computational framework in which turbine and blade designs can be studied at the individual and farm-wide level to enhance wind plant controllability and manage power output.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A digital twin based on OpenFAST linearizations for real-time load and fatigue estimation of land-based turbines","Branlard, Emmanuel; Jonkman, Jason; Dana, Scott; Doubrawa Moreira, Paula","17 WIND ENERGY; digital twin; Kalman filter; fatigue; loads estimation","Monitoring a wind turbine requires intensive instrumentation, which would be too cost-prohibitive to deploy to an entire wind plant. This work presents a technique that uses readily available measurements to estimate signals that would otherwise require additional instrumentation. This study presents a digital twin concept with a focus on estimating wind speed, thrust, torque, tower-top position, and loads in the tower using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements. The model combines a linear state-space model obtained using OpenFAST linearizations, a wind speed estimator, and a Kalman filter algorithm that integrates measurements with the state model to perform state estimations. The measurements are: top acceleration, generator torque, pitch, and rotational speed. The article extends previous work that derived the linear state-space model using a different method. The new implementation, based on OpenFAST linearization capability, allows for a systematic extension of the method to more states, inputs, outputs, and to the offshore environment. Results from the two methods are compared, and the validation is made with additional measurements using the GE 1.5-MW turbine located at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory test site. Real-time damage equivalent loads of the tower bottom moment are estimated with an average accuracy of approximately 10%. Overall, the results from this proof of concept are encouraging, and further application of the model will be considered.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How wind speed shear and directional veer affect the power production of a megawatt-scale operational wind turbine","Murphy, Patrick; Lundquist, Julie K.; Fleming, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind speed shear; directional veer; turbine","Most megawatt-scale wind turbines align themselves into the wind as defined by the wind speed at or near the center of the rotor (hub height). However, both wind speed and wind direction can change with height across the area swept by the turbine blades. A turbine aligned to hub-height winds might experience suboptimal or superoptimal power production, depending on the changes in the vertical profile of wind, also known as shear. Using observed winds and power production over 6 months at a site in the high plains of North America, we quantify the sensitivity of a wind turbine's power production to wind speed shear and directional veer as well as atmospheric stability. We measure shear using metrics such as <span class=""inline-formula""><i>α</i></span> (the log-law wind shear exponent), <span class=""inline-formula""><i>β</i><sub>bulk</sub></span> (a measure of bulk rotor-disk-layer veer), <span class=""inline-formula""><i>β</i><sub>total</sub></span> (a measure of total rotor-disk-layer veer), and rotor-equivalent wind speed (REWS; a measure of actual momentum encountered by the turbine by accounting for shear). We also consider the REWS with the inclusion of directional veer, <span class=""inline-formula"">REWS<sub><i>θ</i></sub></span>, although statistically significant differences in power production do not occur between REWS and <span class=""inline-formula"">REWS<sub><i>θ</i></sub></span> at our site. When REWS differs from the hub-height wind speed (as measured by either the lidar or a transfer function-corrected nacelle anemometer), the turbine power generation also differs from the mean power curve in a statistically significant way. This change in power can be more than 70 <span class=""inline-formula"">kW</span> or up to 5 % of the rated power for a single 1.5 <span class=""inline-formula"">MW</span> utility-scale turbine. Over a theoretical 100-turbine wind farm, these changes could lead to instantaneous power prediction gains or losses equivalent to the addition or loss of multiple utility-scale turbines. At this site, REWS is the most useful metric for segregating the turbine's power curve into high and low cases of power production when compared to the other shear or stability metrics. Therefore, REWS enables improved forecasts of power production.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Longitudinal coherence and short-term wind speed prediction based on a nacelle-mounted Doppler lidar","Debnath, Mithu; Brugger, P.; Simley, Eric; Doubrawa, Paula; Hamilton, Nicholas; Scholbrock, Andrew; Jager, David; Murphy, Mark; Roadman, Jason; Lundquist, Julie K.; Fleming, Paul; Porté-Agel, F.; Moriarty, Patrick","17 WIND ENERGY; volume averaging; wind coherence; wind lidar","The spatial structure of turbulence in atmospheric boundary layer flows is highly relevant to wind energy. In particular, wind turbine control strategies based on inflow preview measurements require knowledge of the longitudinal evolution of turbulent flow as it approaches the rotor. These upstream measurements are usually obtained with nacelle-mounted wind lidars. In contrast to traditional in situ anemometry, lidars collect measurements within a probe volume which varies in size depending on the technology of the commercial system being used. Here, we address two issues related to the use of wind lidar to measure the incoming flow to a wind turbine: (i) whether existing longitudinal coherence models can be used to predict flow at the rotor, based on measurements performed at a distance away from the rotor; and (ii) what effect probe-volume averaging has on the inflow predictions. These two questions are critical to the design and implementation of robust wind turbine control strategies. To address these questions, we perform field measurements and large-eddy simulations to determine which incoming flow structures can be readily predicted with existing coherence models, and which require additional corrections to account for lidar volumetric averaging effects. Results reveal that the wind turbine induction zone has a negligible impact on the longitudinal coherence and first-order turbulence quantities, such as the standard deviation of velocity fluctuations. However, the phase of the signal, from which advection time periods of the turbulent structures are derived, is affected by the rotor blockage effect.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The results are compared to measurements from the DanAero experiments, to validate computed pressures and azimuthal trends. Despite different code methodologies and grid setups, the codes agree well in computed pressures and integrated forces along the blade for all blade azimuthal positions, however with some discrepancy in the very yawed case. Additionally, both codes capture well the azimuthal trends and force levels seen in measurements. Investigation into discrepancies shows that expanding grids before the rotor, lead to smearing of the wind profiles, which is likely the main cause of the differences in the results between the codes. Additionally, omission of the ground constraint cause discrepancies in relative velocity seen by the passing blade, due to an over speeding beneath the rotor.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper examines nacelle blockage effects under a variety of Reynolds numbers, turbulence intensities, and nacelle geometries and proposes a computationally inexpensive nacelle blockage engineering model. Results show minimal nacelle blockage impacts on rotor loading and performance, except for tall (low-aspect-ratio) nacelles, which can cause an increase in rotor <em>C<sub>p</sub></em> of up to 0.6%. In all cases, nacelle blockage increases rotor loading and performance metrics, however little. Finally, (more expensive) geometry-resolved and (less expensive) body-force computational fluid dynamics modeling techniques are compared, and body-force models are found to need improvement to adequately model nacelle blockage.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Augmented Kalman filter with a reduced mechanical model to estimate tower loads on a land-based wind turbine: a step towards digital-twin simulations","Branlard, Emmanuel; Giardina, Dylan; Brown, Cameron D.","17 WIND ENERGY; fatigue; Kalman filter; load estimation","This article presents an application of the Kalman filtering technique to estimate loads on a wind turbine. The approach combines a mechanical model and a set of measurements to estimate signals that are not available in the measurements, such as wind speed, thrust, tower position, and tower loads. The model is severalfold faster than real time and is intended to be run online, for instance, to evaluate real-time fatigue life consumption of a field turbine using a digital twin, perform condition monitoring, or assess loads for dedicated control strategies. The mechanical model is built using a Rayleigh–Ritz approach and a set of joint coordinates. We present a general method and illustrate it using a 2-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) model of a wind turbine and using rotor speed, generator torque, pitch, and tower-top acceleration as measurement signals. The different components of the model are tested individually. The overall method is evaluated by computing the errors in estimated tower-bottom-equivalent moment from a set of simulations. From this preliminary study, it appears that the tower-bottom-equivalent moment is obtained with about 10 % accuracy. The limitation of the model and the required steps forward are discussed.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A robust offering strategy for wind producers considering uncertainties of demand response and wind power","Dai, Xuemei; Li, Yaping; Zhang, Kaifeng; Feng, Wei","17 WIND ENERGY; Offering strategy; Wind power producer; Demand response; Information gap decision theory; Day-ahead market","This paper proposes a risk-constrained decision-making approach for a wind power producer participating in the day-ahead market. In the developed model, a flexible demand response trading scheme between the wind power producer and different customers is employed. Through the proposed demand response mechanism, the wind power producer is able to trade demand response resource internally with different customers, and then trade energy externally with the market to increase the expected profit and the wind energy utilization. The uncertainties in the wind power and demand response are modeled by using the information gap decision theory approach from risk averse (robust) and risk-seeking (opportunistic) perspectives. The objective of the robust model is to maximize the robust level while satisfying the desired profit, whereas the opportunistic model aims to evaluate the possibility of achieving windfall profits with favorable uncertainties. The overall offering strategy problem is modeled as a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is linearized by proper techniques and solved efficiently by using the normal boundary intersection technique. In this work, simulation results show that utilizing demand response resource to mitigate wind power deviations can increase a wind power producer's profit and reduce potential risks. In addition, the results demonstrate that the proposed bi-objective optimization approach enables the wind power producer to select appropriate offering decisions with respect to uncertainties.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"WRF Modelling of Deep Convection and Hail for Wind Power Applications","Letson, F.; Shepherd, T. J.; Barthelmie, R. J.; Pryor, S. C.","58 GEOSCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; WRF; deep convection; hail; wind energy","Deep convection and the related occurrence of hail, intense precipitation and wind gusts represent a hazard to a range of energy infrastructure including wind turbine blades. Wind turbine blade leading edge erosion (LEE) is caused by the impact of falling hydrometeors onto rotating wind turbine blades. It is a major source of wind turbine maintenance costs and energy losses from wind farms. In the United States Southern Great Plains (SGP), where there is widespread wind energy development, deep convection and hail events are common, increasing the potential for precipitation-driven LEE. A 25-day Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation conducted at convection-permitting resolution and using a detailed microphysics scheme is carried out for the SGP to evaluate the effectiveness in modelling the wind and precipitation conditions relevant to LEE potential. WRF output for these properties is evaluated using radar observations of precipitation (including hail) and reflectivity, in situ wind speed measurements and wind power generation. This research demonstrates some skill for the primary drivers of LEE. Wind speeds, rainfall rates and precipitation totals show good agreement with observations. Here, the occurrence of precipitation during power producing wind speeds is also shown to exhibit fidelity. Hail events frequently occur during periods when wind turbines are rotating and are especially important to LEE in the SGP. The presence of hail is modelled with a mean proportion correct of 0.77 and an odds ratio 4.55. Further research is needed to demonstrate sufficient model performance to be actionable for the wind energy industry and there is evidence for positive model bias in cloud reflectivity.","American Meteorological Society","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Biological and Environmental Research (BER).

High-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to generate statistics of wind speed profiles for scenarios of current and future wind turbines. The nine-month simulations, focused on the eastern Central Plains, show that the power scales broadly as expected with the increase in rotor diameter (D) and wind speeds at hub-height (H). Increasing wind turbine dimensions from current values (approximately H = 100 m, D = 100 m) to those of the new International Energy Agency reference wind turbine (H = 150 m, D = 240 m), the power across the rotor plane increases 7.1 times.

During the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2) in the Columbia River Basin of Oregon and Washington, a significant effort was made to improve NWP forecasts through focused model development, to include experimental refinements to the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model physics and horizontal grid spacing. In this study, the performance of an experimental version of HRRR that includes these refinements is tested against a control version, which corresponds to that of the operational HRRR run by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Centers for Environmental Protection at the outset of WFIP2. Furthermore, the effects of horizontal grid resolution were also tested by comparing wind forecasts from the HRRR (with 3-km grid spacing) with those from a finer-resolution HRRR nest with 750-m grid spacing. Model forecasts are validated against accurate wind-profile measurements by three scanning, pulsed Doppler lidars at sites separated by a total distance of 71 km. Model skill and improvements in model skill, attributable to physics refinements and improved horizontal grid resolution, varied by season, by site, and during periods of atmospheric phenomena relevant to WE. In general, model errors were the largest below 150 m above ground level (AGL). Experimental HRRR refinements tended to reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) and other error metrics for many conditions, but degradation in skill (increased MAE) was noted below 150 m AGL at the two lowest-elevation sites at night. Finer resolution was found to produce the most significant reductions in the error metrics.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Validation of FAST.Farm Against Full-Scale Turbine SCADA Data for a Small Wind Farm","Shaler, Kelsey; Debnath, Mithu; Jonkman, Jason","17 WIND ENERGY; FAST.Farm; SCADA; validation; lidar","FAST.Farm is a new midfidelity engineering tool developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory targeted at accurately and efficiently predicting wind turbine power production and structural loading in wind farm settings, including wake interactions between turbines. FAST.Farm is based on some of the principles of the Dynamic Wake Meandering model—including passive tracer modeling of wake meandering—but addresses many of the limitations of previous Dynamic Wake Meandering (DWM) implementations. Previous FAST.Farm verification studies show the similarities and differences between FAST.Farm and large-eddy simulations for rigid and flexible turbines. In this validation study, FAST.Farm turbine responses are compared to multiturbine measurements from a subset of a full-scale wind farm. FAST.Farm predictions of turbine generator power, rotor speed, and blade pitch for five-turbine simulations are compared to supervisory control and data acquisition results. Results reveal that FAST.Farm generator power mean and standard deviation results reasonably match measured data for upstream and downstream turbines, as well as the mean rotor speed and blade pitch above rated wind speeds. However, FAST.Farm generally underpredicts the mean rotor speed and overpredicts the mean blade pitch below rated operation. These errors are likely related to inaccuracies in the generic controller simulated. Despite controller differences, FAST.Farm predicts the same overall relative rotor power trends for all waked turbines at all wind speeds.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

New lower cost solutions are needed to enable further reductions in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and continued market expansion. In this paper, a novel method of using existing U.S. rail infrastructure to deploy 100-m, one-piece blades to U.S. land-based wind sites is numerically investigated. The study removes the constraint that blades must be kept rigid during transport, and it allows bending to keep blades within a clearance profile while navigating horizontal and vertical curvatures. Novel system optimization and blade design processes consider blade structural constraints and rail logistic constraints in parallel to develop a highly flexible, rail-transportable blade. Results indicate maximum deployment potential in the Interior region of the United States and limited deployment potential in other regions. The study concludes that innovative rail transportation solutions combined with advanced rotor technologies can provide a feasible alternative to segmentation and support continued LCOE reductions in the U.S. land-based wind energy market.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Because such low-frequency oscillations result from interactions among slower control loops of wind turbines regulating phasor quantities—active and reactive power output of the wind turbine and the magnitude of voltages at the point of interconnection (POI)—a new type of admittance is defined in terms of phasor quantities for their analysis. The so-called power-domain admittance of a wind turbine is defined as the transfer function from the frequency and magnitude of voltages at the POI to the active and reactive power output of the turbine. The power-domain admittance responses of the 4-MW wind turbine are measured using a 7-MVA grid simulator to identify the source of the reactive power oscillations. Power-domain impedance analysis and PHIL experiments are performed to explain how a resonant mode manifests as turbine-to-turbine and plant-to-grid reactive power oscillations. It is discovered that weaker grids exhibiting high inductive impedance mitigate oscillations in the reactive power output of wind power plants; however, a higher grid impedance does not help in damping turbine-to-turbine reactive power oscillations. This paper presents a simple droop-based solution to eliminate both turbine-to-turbine and plant-to-grid reactive power oscillations.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

S.","17 WIND ENERGY; Doppler lidar, Machince learning, Extrapolation Method","<p>Abstract. Model uncertainty is a significant challenge in the wind energy industry and can lead to mischaracterization of millions of dollars' worth of wind resources. Machine learning methods, notably deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), are capable of modeling turbulent and chaotic systems and offer a promising tool to produce high-accuracy wind speed forecasts and extrapolations. This paper uses data collected by profiling Doppler lidars over three field campaigns to investigate the efficacy of using ANNs for wind speed vertical extrapolation in a variety of terrains, and it quantifies the role of domain knowledge in ANN extrapolation accuracy. A series of 11 meteorological parameters (features) are used as ANN inputs, and the resulting output accuracy is compared with that of both standard log-law and power-law extrapolations. It is found that extracted nondimensional inputs, namely turbulence intensity, current wind speed, and previous wind speed, are the features that most reliably improve the ANN's accuracy, providing up to a 65 % and 52 % increase in extrapolation accuracy over log-law and power-law predictions, respectively. The volume of input data is also deemed important for achieving robust results. One test case is analyzed in depth using dimensional and nondimensional features, showing that the feature nondimensionalization drastically improves network accuracy and robustness for sparsely sampled atmospheric cases.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Technology Collaboration Platform (TCP) Task 37 has recently developed a new RWT geared towards offshore floating-foundation applications: the IEA Wind 15 MW. The model has been implemented in two aeroelastic codes, OpenFAST and HAWC2, based on an underlying common ontology. However, these toolchains result in slightly different structural parameters, and the two codes utilise different structural models. Thus, to increase the utility of the model, it is necessary to compare the aeroelastic responses. This paper compares aeroelastic loads calculated using different fidelities of the blade model in OpenFAST (ElastoDyn and BeamDyn) and HAWC2 (prismatic Timoshenko without torsion and Timoshenko with fully populated stiffness matrix), where both codes use the DTU Basic controller and the same turbulence boxes to reduce discrepancies. The aeroelastic responses to steady wind, step wind and turbulent wind (per IEC 61400-1 wind class IB) are considered. The results indicate a generally good agreement between the loads dominated by aerodynamic thrust and force, especially for the no-torsion blade models. Discrepancies were observed in other load channels, partially due to differences in the asymmetric loading of the rotor and partially due to differing closed-loop dynamics, and they will be the subject of future investigations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Gross capacity factors (CF) in seven independent system operators (ISOs) are estimated using the location and rated power of each wind turbine, a simplified power curve, and ERA5 output from 1979 to 2018. Excluding the California ISO, the marginal probability of a calm (zero power production) is less than 0.1 in any ERA5 grid cell. When a calm occurs, the mean co-occurrence across wind-turbine-containing grid cells ranges from 0.38 to 0.39 for ISOs in the Midwest and central plains [Midcontinent (or Midwest) ISO (MISO), Southwest Power Pool (SPP), and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region], increasing to 0.54–0.58 for ISOs in the eastern United States [Pennsylvania–New Jersey–Maryland interconnection (PJM), New York ISO (NYISO), and New England ISO (NEISO)]. Periods with low gross CF have a median duration of ≤6 h, except in California, and are most likely during summer. Additionally, gross CF exhibit highest variance at periods of 1 day in ERCOT and SPP; on synoptic scales in MISO, NEISO, and NYISO; and on interannual time scales in PJM. This implies differences in optimal strategies for ensuring resilience of supply. Theoretical scenarios show adding wind energy capacity near existing wind farms is advantageous even in areas with high existing installed capacity (IC), while expanding into areas with lower IC is more beneficial to reducing ramps and the probability of gross CF falling below 20%. These results emphasize the benefits of large balancing areas and aggregation in reducing wind power variability and the likelihood of wind droughts.","American Meteorological Society","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Univ. of California, Davis, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2021-2039","","","SC0016438; SC0016605","Journal ID: ISSN 1558-8424","10.1175/jamc-d-20-0162.1","","2022-07-27T00:00:00Z","1852241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1852241","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1852241","Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology","12","59"

In addition to guiding code choice and setup, rigorous model validation exercises are needed to identify weaknesses and strengths of specific models and guide future improvements. Here, we consider 13 approaches to simulating wakes observed with a nacelle-mounted lidar at the Scaled Wind Technology Facility (SWiFT) under varying atmospheric conditions. We find that some of the main challenges in wind turbine wake modeling are related to simulating the inflow. In the neutral benchmark, model performance tracked as expected with model fidelity, with large-eddy simulations performing the best. In the more challenging stable case, steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations were found to outperform other model alternatives because they provide the ability to more easily prescribe noncanonical inflows and their low cost allows for simulations to be repeated as needed. Dynamic measurements were only available for the unstable benchmark at a single downstream distance. These dynamic analyses revealed that differences in the performance of time-stepping models come largely from differences in wake meandering. This highlights the need for more validation exercises that take into account wake dynamics and are able to identify where these differences come from: mesh setup, inflow, turbulence models, or wake-meandering parameterizations. In addition to model validation findings, we summarize lessons learned and provide recommendations for future benchmark exercises.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessing the blockage effect of wind turbines and wind farms using an analytical vortex model","Branlard, Emmanuel; Meyer Forsting, Alexander R.","17 WIND ENERGY; induction zone; wind farm blockage; vortex models; actuator disk","Wind farm blockage effects are currently neglected in the prediction of wind farm energy yield, typically leading to an overestimation of the production. This work presents a novel method to assess wind farm production, while accounting for blockage effects. We apply a vortex model, based on a cylindrical wake, to assess induction effects. We present variations of the model to account for finite wake length, finite tip-speed ratios, and the proximity to the ground. The results are applied to single rotors in aligned and yawed conditions and to different wind farm layouts. We provide far-field approximations for faster estimates of the velocity field. Further, this article includes a new methodology to couple the induction model to engineering wake models, such as the ones present in the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS). We compare the results to actuator disk simulations for various operating conditions of a single turbine and different wind farm layouts. We found that the mean relative error of the model in the induction zone is typically around 0.2% compared with actuator disk simulations. The computational time of the velocity field using the analytical vortex model is three orders of magnitude less than the one obtained with the actuator disk simulation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In addition, EV can hardly represent a green option if its electricity primarily depends on fossil energy. Considering these two problems, this paper studies a battery swapping-charging system based on wind farms (hereinafter referred to as W-BSCS). In a W-BSCS, the wind farms not only supply electricity to the power grid but also cooperate with a centralized charge station (CCS), which can centrally charge EV batteries and then distribute them to multiple battery swapping stations (BSSs). The operational framework of the W-BSCS is analyzed, and some preprocessing technologies are developed to reduce complexity in modeling. Then, a joint optimal scheduling model involving a wind power generation plan, battery swapping demand, battery charging and discharging, and a vehicle routing problem (VRP) is established. Then a heuristic method based on the exhaustive search and the Genetic Algorithm is employed to solve the formulated NP-hard problem.

"The hidden value of large-rotor, tall-tower wind turbines in the United States","Wiser, Ryan; Millstein, Dev; Bolinger, Mark; Jeong, Seongeun; Mills, Andrew","17 WIND ENERGY; specific power; market value; wind turbine; capacity factor; LCOE","<p>The significant upscaling of wind turbine size (nameplate capacity, rotor diameter, and tower height) has, to date, been driven primarily by a goal of minimizing the levelized cost of energy. But with wind’s levelized cost of energy now comparable with that of other generating resources, other design considerations besides cost-minimization have grown in importance—particularly as wind’s increasing market penetration begins to impose challenges on the electric grid. We find that taller towers and larger rotors (relative to nameplate capacity) can enhance the value of wind energy to the electricity system and provide other “hidden” benefits. Specifically, in regions where wind penetration has reached around 20%, we find a boost in wholesale market value of US$2–US$3/MWh. This is augmented by transmission, balancing, and financing benefits that sum to roughly US$2/MWh. The aggregate potential value enhancement of US$4–US$5/MWh is comparable with a 10%–15% reduction in levelized costs.</p>","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It is an evolution of the flow solver Incompact3D which was initially designed in France in the mid-90’s for serial processors to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Incompact3D was then ported to parallel High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in the early 2010’s. Very recently the capabilities of Incompact3D have been extended so that it can now tackle more flow regimes (from incompressible flows to compressible flows at low Mach numbers), resulting in the design of a new user-friendly framework called Xcompact3D. The present manuscript presents an overview of Xcompact3D with a particular focus on its functionalities, its ready-to-run simulations and a few case studies to demonstrate its impact.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Results indicate that there is a general trend towards larger, taller machines with lower specific powers resulting in higher capacity factors, despite small falls in new site wind resources in most countries, while wind project capital costs and project finance costs also fell. This resulted in an average levelized cost of energy (LCOE) fall of 33% for new projects to 48€/MWh at the end of the study period. Analysis of the components of levelized cost change indicated that changes in specific power, financing cost and capital cost accounted for 45%, 25% and 17% respectively of the estimated reduction. It is therefore important that trends in technological factors such as specific power are considered when assessing wind energy learning rates, rather than just capital costs, which has been the primary focus heretofore. Furthermore, while LCOEs have fallen, the value of wind energy has fallen proportionately more, meaning grid parity appears no closer than at the beginning of the study. Policymakers must therefore consider both the cost and value of wind energy, and understand the volatility of this gap when designing land-based wind energy policy measures.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Simulated wind farm wake sensitivity to configuration choices in the Weather Research and Forecasting model version 3.8.1","Tomaszewski, Jessica M.; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; simulated wind farm wake sensitivity; configuration choices; weather research and forecasting","Wakes from wind farms can extend over 50 km downwind in stably stratified conditions. These wakes can undermine power production at downwind turbines, adversely impacting revenue. As such, wind farm wake impacts must be considered in wind resource assessments, especially in regions of dense wind farm development. The open-source Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction model includes a wind farm parameterization to estimate wind farm wake effects, but model configuration choices can influence the resulting predictions of wind farm wakes. These choices include vertical resolution, horizontal resolution, and whether or not to include the addition of turbulent kinetic energy generated by the rotating wind turbines. Despite the sensitivity to model configuration, no clear guidance currently exists for these options. Here we compare simulated wind farm wakes produced by varying model configurations with meteorological observations near a land-based wind farm in flat terrain over several diurnal cycles. A WRF configuration comprised of horizontal resolutions of 3 km or 1 km paired with a vertical resolution of 10 m provides the most accurate representation of wind farm wake effects, such as the correct surface warming and elevated wind speed deficit. The inclusion of turbine-generated turbulence is also critical to produce accurate surface warming and should not be omitted.","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

While unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are black-box decision models that could fail to satisfy grid operational constraints, our proposed method considers AC power flow equations and other operational limits. Accordingly, the training process employs the gradient information of operational constraints to ensure that the optimal control policy functions generate safe and feasible decisions. Furthermore, we have developed a distributed consensus-based optimization approach to train the agents’ policy functions while maintaining MGs’ privacy and data ownership boundaries. After training, the learned optimal policy functions can be safely used by the MGs to dispatch their local resources, without the need to solve a complex optimization problem from scratch. Lastly, numerical experiments have been devised to verify the performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

The blade aerodynamics of the two turbines are the same. In the simulations, the two turbines also face the same turbulent boundary inflows. The computed results show differences between the two turbines for both velocity deficits and turbine-added turbulence kinetic energy.

Phase III of the OC5 project validates OWT models against the measurements recorded on a Senvion 5M wind turbine supported by the OWEC Quattropod from the alpha ventus offshore wind farm. The following operating conditions of the wind turbine were chosen for the validation: (1) idling below the cut-in wind speed, (2) rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) rotation maneuver below the cut-in wind speed, (3) power production below and above the rated wind speed, and (4) shutdown. A number of validation load cases were defined based on these operating conditions. The following measurements were used for validation: (1) strains and accelerations recorded on the support structure and (2) pitch, yaw, and azimuth angles, generator speed, and electrical power recorded from the RNA. Strains were not directly available from the majority of the OWT simulation tools; therefore, strains were calculated based on out-of-plane bending moments, axial forces, and cross-sectional properties of the structural members. The simulation results and measurements were compared in terms of time series, discrete Fourier transforms, power spectral densities, and probability density functions of strains and accelerometers.

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard for wind turbine design recommends two turbulence models for simulations of the incident wind field, the Mann spectral tensor model, and the Kaimal spectral and exponential coherence model. In particular, for floating wind turbines, these standard models are challenged by more sophisticated ones. The characteristics of the wind field depend on the stability conditions of the atmosphere, which neither of the standard turbulence models account for. The spatial and temporal distribution of the turbulence, represented by coherence, is not modeled consistently by the two standard models. In this study, the Mann spectral tensor model and the Kaimal spectral and exponential coherence model are compared with wind fields constructed from offshore measurements and obtained from large-eddy simulations. Cross sections and durations relevant for offshore wind turbine design are considered. Coherent structures from the different simulators are studied across various stability conditions and wind speeds through coherence and proper orthogonal decomposition mode plots. As expected, the standard models represent neutral stratification better than they do stable and unstable. Depending upon the method used for generating the wind field, significant differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of coherence are found. Consequently, the computed structural design loads on a wind turbine are expected to vary significantly depending upon the employed turbulence model. The knowledge gained in this study will be used in future studies to quantify the effect of various turbulence models on the dynamic response of large offshore wind turbines.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Inertial control is designed by using generator torque limit considering the security of WTG system, while ESS releases its energy to compensate the sudden active power deficit during the recovery process of turbine rotor. WTG is modeled using the fatigue, aerodynamic, structure, turbulence (FAST) code, which identifies the mechanical loadings of the turbine and addresses electro-mechanical interactions in the wind energy system. A damping controller is augmented to the inertial control to suppress severe mechanical oscillations in the shaft and tower of the turbine during frequency supports. Furthermore, the result of small-signal stability analysis shows that the WTG-ESS tends to improve the stability of the whole multi-energy power grid. The major contributions of this paper will be validated by utilizing the proposed control method that combines the grid support capability and maintaining the integrity of structural design of the turbine for normal operations.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A measurement unit was attached to the kite for data acquisition. To predict the generated tether force, we collected input–output samples from a set of well-designed experimental runs to act as our labeled training data in a supervised machine learning setting.

Our results indicate deterrents significantly reduced bat fatalities for Lasiurus cinereus and Tadarida brasiliensis by 78% and 54%, respectively. We observed no significant reduction in fatalities for other species in the genus Lasiurius. Thus, deterrents represent a potential impact reduction strategy for some bat species, but research is still warranted to improve species-specific effectiveness.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Generic characterization of electrical test benches for AC- and HVDC-connected wind power plants","Nouri, Behnam; Göksu, Ömer; Gevorgian, Vahan; Sørensen, Poul Ejnar","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electrical test benches; grid emulator; grid interface; network connection; wind turbines","The electrical test and assessment of wind turbines go hand in hand with standards and network connection requirements. In this paper, the generic structure of advanced electrical test benches, including grid emulator or controllable grid interface, wind torque emulator, and device under test, is proposed to harmonize state-of-the-art test sites. On the other hand, modern wind turbines are under development towards new features, concerning grid-forming, black-start, and frequency support capabilities as well as harmonic stability and control interaction considerations, to secure the robustness and stability of renewable-energy-based power systems. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new and revised test standards and methodologies to address the new features of wind turbines. This paper proposes a generic test structure within two main groups, including open-loop and closed-loop tests. The open-loop tests include the IEC 61400-21-1 standard tests as well as the additional proposed test options for the new capabilities of wind turbines, which replicate grid connection compliance tests using open-loop references for the grid emulator. In addition, the closed-loop tests evaluate the device under test as part of a virtual wind power plant and perform real-time simulations considering the grid dynamics. The closed-loop tests concern grid connection topologies consisting of AC and HVDC, as well as different electrical characteristics, including impedance, short-circuit ratio, inertia, and background harmonics. The proposed tests can be implemented using available advanced test benches by adjusting their control systems. The characteristics of a real power system can be emulated by a grid emulator coupled with real-time digital simulator systems through a high-bandwidth power-hardware-in-the-loop interface.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How Does Wind Project Performance Change with Age in the United States?","Hamilton, Sofia D.; Millstein, Dev; Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan; Jeong, Seongeun","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; reliability; performance","Wind-plant performance declines with age, and the rate of decline varies between regions. The rate of performance decline is important when determining wind-plant financial viability and expected lifetime generation. We determine the rate of age-related performance decline in the United States wind fleet by evaluating generation records from 917 plants. We find the rate of performance decline to be 0.53%/year for older vintages of plants and 0.17%/year for newer vintages of plants on an energy basis for the first 10 years of operation, which is on the lower end of prior estimates in Europe. Unique to the United States, we find a significant drop in performance by 3.6% after 10 years, as plants lose eligibility for the production tax credit. Certain plant characteristics, such as the ratio of blade length to nameplate capacity, influence the rate of performance decline. These results indicate that the performance decline rate can be partially managed and influenced by policy.","Elsevier - Cell Press","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The importance of round-robin validation when assessing machine-learning-based vertical extrapolation of wind speeds","Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Mike","17 WIND ENERGY; machine learning; round-robin validation; wind energy; wind speeds","The extrapolation of wind speeds measured at a meteorological mast to wind turbine rotor heights is a key component in a bankable wind farm energy assessment and a significant source of uncertainty. Industry-standard methods for extrapolation include the power-law and logarithmic profiles. The emergence of machine-learning applications in wind energy has led to several studies demonstrating substantial improvements in vertical extrapolation accuracy in machine-learning methods over these conventional power-law and logarithmic profile methods. In all cases, these studies assess relative model performance at a measurement site where, critically, the machine-learning algorithm requires knowledge of the rotor-height wind speeds in order to train the model. This prior knowledge provides fundamental advantages to the site-specific machine-learning model over the power-law and log profiles, which, by contrast, are not highly tuned to rotor-height measurements but rather can generalize to any site. Furthermore, there is no practical benefit in applying a machine-learning model at a site where winds at the heights relevant for wind energy production are known; rather, its performance at nearby locations (i.e., across a wind farm site) without rotor-height measurements is of most practical interest. To more fairly and practically compare machine-learning-based extrapolation to standard approaches, we implemented a round-robin extrapolation model comparison, in which a random-forest machine-learning model is trained and evaluated at different sites and then compared against the power-law and logarithmic profiles. We consider 20 months of lidar and sonic anemometer data collected at four sites between 50 and 100 km apart in the central United States. We find that the random forest outperforms the standard extrapolation approaches, especially when incorporating surface measurements as inputs to include the influence of atmospheric stability. When compared at a single site (the traditional comparison approach), the machine-learning improvement in mean absolute error was 28 % and 23 % over the power-law and logarithmic profiles, respectively. Using the round-robin approach proposed here, this improvement drops to 20 % and 14 %, respectively. These latter values better represent practical model performance, and we conclude that round-robin validation should be the standard for machine-learning-based wind speed extrapolation methods.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Design and analysis of a wake steering controller with wind direction variability","Simley, Eric; Fleming, Paul; King, Jennifer","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind farm control; wake steering; robust control; wind direction uncertainty","Wind farm control strategies are being developed to mitigate wake losses in wind farms, increasing energy production. Wake steering is a type of wind farm control in which a wind turbine's yaw position is misaligned from the wind direction, causing its wake to deflect away from downstream turbines. Current modeling tools used to optimize and estimate energy gains from wake steering are designed to represent wakes for fixed wind directions. However, wake steering controllers must operate in dynamic wind conditions and a turbine's yaw position cannot perfectly track changing wind directions. Research has been conducted on robust wake steering control optimized for variable wind directions. In this paper, the design and analysis of a wake steering controller with wind direction variability is presented for a two-turbine array using the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS) control-oriented wake model. First, the authors propose a method for modeling the turbulent and low-frequency components of the wind direction, where the slowly varying wind direction serves as the relevant input to the wake model. Next, we explain a procedure for finding optimal yaw offsets for dynamic wind conditions considering both wind direction and yaw position uncertainty. We then performed simulations with the optimal yaw offsets applied using a realistic yaw offset controller in conjunction with a baseline yaw controller, showing good agreement with the predicted energy gain using the probabilistic model. Using the Gaussian wake model in FLORIS as an example, we compared the performance of yaw offset controllers optimized for static and dynamic wind conditions for different turbine spacings and turbulence intensity values, assuming uniformly distributed wind directions. For a spacing of five rotor diameters and a turbulence intensity of 10 %, robust yaw offsets optimized for variable wind directions yielded an energy gain equivalent to 3.24 % of wake losses recovered, compared to 1.42 % of wake losses recovered with yaw offsets optimized for static wind directions. In general, accounting for wind direction variability in the yaw offset optimization process was found to improve energy production more as the separation distance increased, whereas the relative improvement remained roughly the same for the range of turbulence intensity values considered.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Todd; Selig, Michael S.; Damiani, Rick","17 WIND ENERGY; Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Offshore wind energy; 25 MW design; Downwind turbine model; Upscaling","The size of offshore wind turbines over the next decade is expected to continually increase due to reduced balance of station costs per MW and also the higher wind energy at increased altitudes that can lead to higher capacity factors. However, there are challenges that may limit the degree of upscaling which is possible. In this paper, a two-bladed downwind turbine system is upscaled from 13.2 MW to 25 MW, by redesigning aerodynamics, structures, and controls. In particular, three 25 MW rotors have been developed: V1 is the upscaled model, V2 is a partial redesigned model, and V3 is a fully redesigned model. Despite their radically large sizes, it is found that these 25 MW turbine rotors satisfy this limited set of design drivers at the rated condition and that larger blade lengths are possible with cone-wise load-alignment. In addition, flapwise morphing (varying the cone angle with a wind-speed schedule) is investigated in terms of minimizing mean and fluctuating root bending loads using steady inflow proxies for the maximum and damage equivalent load moments. The resulting series of 25 MW rotors, which are the largest ever designed, can be a useful baseline for additional development and assessment.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable Energy; Journal Volume: 156; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 314-327","","","AR0000667","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-1481; PII: S0960148120305711","10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.039","","2022-03-02T00:00:00Z","1799055","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799055","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799055","Renewable Energy","C","156"
"An LES-based airborne Doppler lidar simulator and its application to wind profiling in inhomogeneous flow conditions","Gasch, Philipp; Wieser, Andreas; Lundquist, Julie K.; Kalthoff, Norbert","17 WIND ENERGY; Doppler lidar simulator; inhomogenous flow conditions; wind; wind profiling","Wind profiling by Doppler lidar is common practice and highly useful in a wide range of applications. Airborne Doppler lidar can provide additional insights relative to ground-based systems by allowing for spatially distributed and targeted measurements. Providing a link between theory and measurement, a first large eddy simulation (LES)-based airborne Doppler lidar simulator (ADLS) has been developed. Simulated measurements are conducted based on LES wind fields, considering the coordinate and geometric transformations applicable to real-world measurements. The ADLS provides added value as the input truth used to create the measurements is known exactly, which is nearly impossible in real-world situations. Thus, valuable insight can be gained into measurement system characteristics as well as retrieval strategies. As an example application, airborne Doppler lidar wind profiling is investigated using the ADLS. For commonly used airborne velocity azimuth display (AVAD) techniques, flow homogeneity is assumed throughout the retrieval volume, a condition which is violated in turbulent boundary layer flow. Assuming an ideal measurement system, the ADLS allows to isolate and evaluate the error in wind profiling which occurs due to the violation of the flow homogeneity assumption. Overall, the ADLS demonstrates that wind profiling is possible in turbulent wind field conditions with reasonable errors (root mean squared error of 0.36 m s<sup>–1</sup> for wind speed when using a commonly used system setup and retrieval strategy for the conditions investigated). Nevertheless, flow inhomogeneity, e.g., due to boundary layer turbulence, can cause an important contribution to wind profiling error and is non-negligible. Results suggest that airborne Doppler lidar wind profiling at low wind speeds (<5 m s<sup>–1</sup>) can be biased, if conducted in regions of inhomogeneous flow conditions.","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wake steering optimization under uncertainty","Quick, Julian; King, Jennifer; King, Ryan N.; Hamlington, Peter E.; Dykes, Katherine","17 WIND ENERGY; optimization under uncertainty; wake steering","Turbines in wind power plants experience significant power losses when wakes from upstream turbines affect the energy production of downstream turbines. A promising plant-level control strategy to reduce these losses is wake steering, where upstream turbines are yawed to direct wakes away from downstream turbines. However, there are significant uncertainties in many aspects of the wake steering problem. For example, infield sensors do not give perfect information, and inflow to the plant is complex and difficult to forecast with available information, even over short time periods. Here, we formulate and solve an optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problem for determining optimal plant-level wake steering strategies in the presence of independent uncertainties in the direction, speed, turbulence intensity, and shear of the incoming wind, as well as in turbine yaw positions. The OUU wake steering strategy is first examined for a two-turbine test case to explore the impacts of different types of inflow uncertainties, and it is then demonstrated for a more realistic 11-turbine wind power plant. Of the sources of uncertainty considered, we find that wake steering strategies are most sensitive to uncertainties in the wind speed and direction. When maximizing expected power production, the OUU strategy also tends to favor smaller yaw angles, which have been shown in previous work to reduce turbine loading. Ultimately, the plant-level wake steering strategy formulated using an OUU approach yields 0.48?% more expected annual energy production for the 11-turbine wind plant than a strategy that neglects uncertainty when considering stochastic inputs. Thus, not only does the present OUU strategy produce more power in realistic conditions, but it also reduces risk by prescribing strategies that call for less extreme yaw angles.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Prior work in sub-scale wind turbine testing has focused on matching aerodynamic/aero-elastic characteristics of full-scale rotors at wind tunnel scale. However, large-scale rotor designs must expand beyond this limited set of scaling parameters for cost-effective prototyping and meet strict requirements for structural safety for field testing. Here, the challenge lies in producing a structural design meeting two competing objectives: novel scaling objectives that prescribe the sub-scale blade to have low mass and stiffness; and traditional structural safety objectives that drive the design to have higher stiffness and mass. A 20% gravo-aeroelastically scaled wind turbine blade is developed successfully that satisfies these competing objectives. First, it achieved close agreement for non-dimensional tip deflection and flap-wise blade frequency (both within 2.1%) with a blade mass distribution constrained to produce target gravitational and centrifugal loads. Second, the entire blade structure was optimized to ensure a safe, manufacturable solution meeting strict strength requirements for a testing site that can experience up to 45 m/s wind gusts. The prototype-scale blade was fabricated and successfully proof-load tested.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To estimate the uncertainty in this stochastic economic dispatch problem for forecasting purposes, the conventional Monte-Carlo method is prohibitively time-consuming for practical applications. To overcome this problem, here we propose a novel Gaussian-process-emulator-based approach to quantify the uncertainty in the stochastic economic dispatch considering wind power penetration. Facing high-dimensional real-world data representing the correlated uncertainties from wind generation, a manifold-learning-based Isomap algorithm is proposed to efficiently represent the low-dimensional hidden probabilistic structure of the data. In this low-dimensional latent space, with Latin hypercube sampling as the computer experimental design, a Gaussian-process emulator is used, for the first time, to serve as a nonparametric, surrogate model for the original complicated stochastic economic dispatch model. This reduced-order representative allows us to evaluate the economic dispatch solver at sampled values with a negligible computational cost while maintaining a desirable accuracy. Simulation results conducted on the IEEE 118-bus test system reveal the impressive performance of the proposed method.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Using observations from the 2013 CWEX campaign, we found the daily atmospheric boundary layer transitions (morning and evening) match periods of high electricity demand for a wind farm in central Iowa. Power production during these periods was undermined for large direction shear and low speed shear scenarios. The morning transition displayed larger direction shear over the rotor layer for most wind speeds compared to the evening period. This resulted in lower turbine performance for the morning compared to the evening and whole day. This study shows that the combined effect of direction and speed shear is affecting turbine operation during high electricity demand times of day, predominantly during the morning at this wind farm.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Highlighting the impact of yaw control by parsing atmospheric conditions based on total variation","Hamilton, Nicholas","17 WIND ENERGY; wake steering; wind plant controls; transient atmospheric event; covariance","Identification of atmospheric conditions within a multivariate atmospheric dataset is a necessary step in the validation of wind plant control strategies. Most often, operating conditions are characterized in terms of aggregated observations and assume that the atmosphere is 'quasi-steady'. Aggregation of observations without regard to covariance between time series discounts the dynamical nature of the atmosphere and is not sufficiently representative of wind plant operating conditions. Identification and characterization of continuous time periods with atmospheric conditions that have a high value for analysis or simulation sets the stage for more advanced model validation and the development of real-time control and operation strategies. Controlling observational data for statistical stationarity highlights significant enhancements to the power production of waked turbines under wake steering wind plant control. Results in the current study emphasize the scope and intended range of wake models used for wind plant control and suggest that either models be defined to account for the transient nature of the atmosphere, or that their validation and application be geared to stationary atmospheric conditions.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How Does Inow Veer Affect the Veer of a Wind-Turbine Wake?","Englberger, Antonia; Lundquist, Julie","17 WIND ENERGY; large-eddy simulation; magnitudes; veer shapes; wake structure; wind turbines; wind veer","Stably stratified flow conditions often exhibit wind veer, or a change of wind direction with height. When wind turbines experience this veered flow, the resulting wake structure tends to exhibit a stretching into an ellipsoid, rather than a symmetric shape or a curled shape. Observational studies suggest that the magnitude of wake veer is less than the veer of the inflow, whereas large-eddy simulations with actuator disk models and actuator line models suggest a range of relationships between inflow veer and wake veer. Here we present a series of large-eddy simulations with a range of veer shapes, a range of magnitudes of veer, a range of wind speeds, and both rotational directions of the wind-turbine rotor investigating the effect on the wake deflection angle. These results can guide the application of wake steering in stably stratified flow.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind Farm Simulation and Layout Optimization in Complex Terrain","Allen, Jeff; King, Ryan; Barter, Garrett","17 WIND ENERGY; CFD; complex terrain; optimization; wind farms","This work reports on incorporating complex terrain into wind farm simulations for the purpose of layout optimization. Adding complex terrain boundary conditions to NREL's medium fidelity Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes flow model, WindSE, produces significant separation, flow curvature, and speedup effects that would otherwise be difficult to capture with lower-fidelity models or a flat-terrain assumption. These flow features, in turn, can significantly impact the optimal turbine array layout. We demonstrate the addition of complex terrain improves agreement with SCADA data by 34.8% in mean average error. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the code that enable gradient-based layout optimization using terrainaware adjoints with arbitrary topography. Through several optimization case studies, we show that the layout optimization process takes advantage of speedup effects on terrain high points, and leverages flow curvature effects that modify wake trajectories. This yields substantial power improvements over gridded layouts, and hints at future research directions in simulation and optimization for wake trajectories in complex terrain.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Multi-Scale Simulation of Wind Farm Performance during a Frontal Passage","Arthur, Robert S.; Mirocha, Jeffrey D.; Marjanovic, Nikola; Hirth, Brian D.; Schroeder, John L.; Wharton, Sonia; Chow, Fotini K.","17 WIND ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Wind turbine wakes; large-eddy simulation; generalized actuator disk model; Weather Research and Forecasting model","Predicting the response of wind farms to changing flow conditions is necessary for optimal design and operation. Here in this work, simulation and analysis of a frontal passage through a utility scale wind farm is achieved for the first time using a seamless multi-scale modeling approach. A generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine model is used to represent turbine–flow interaction, and results are compared to novel radar observations during the frontal passage. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is employed with a nested grid setup that allows for coupling between multi-scale atmospheric conditions and turbine response. Starting with mesoscale forcing, the atmosphere is dynamically downscaled to the region of interest, where the interaction between turbulent flows and individual wind turbines is simulated with 10 m grid spacing. Several improvements are made to the GAD model to mimic realistic turbine operation, including a yawing capability and a power output calculation. Ultimately, the model is able to capture both the dynamics of the frontal passage and the turbine response; predictions show good agreement with observed background velocity, turbine wake structure, and power output after accounting for a phase shift in the mesoscale forcing. This study demonstrates the utility of the WRF-GAD model framework for simulating wind farm performance under complex atmospheric conditions.","MDPI","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"ExaWind: A multifidelity modeling and simulation environment for wind energy","Sprague, M. A.; Ananthan, S.; Vijayakumar, G.; Robinson, M.","17 WIND ENERGY; ExaWind; modeling; simulation","We introduce the open-source ExaWind modeling and simulation environment for wind energy. The primary physics codes of ExaWind are Nalu-Wind and OpenFAST. Nalu-Wind is a wind-focused computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that is coupled to the whole-turbine simulation code OpenFAST. The ExaWind environment was created under U.S. Department of Energy funding to achieve the highest-fidelity simulations of wind turbines and wind farms to date, with the goal of enabling disruptive changes to turbine and plant design and operation. Innovation will be gleaned through better understanding of the complex flow dynamics in wind farms, including wake evolution and the impact of wakes on downstream turbines and turbulent flow from complex terrain. High-fidelity predictive simulations employ hybrid turbulence models, geometry/boundary-layer-resolving CFD meshes, atmospheric turbulence, nonlinear structural dynamics, and fluid-structure interaction. While there is an emphasis on very high-fidelity simulations (e.g., blade resolved with full fluid-structure coupling), the ExaWind environment supports lower-fidelity modeling capabilities including actuator-line and -disk methods. Important in the development of ExaWind codes is that the codes scale well on today's largest petascale supercomputers and on the next-generation platforms that will enable exascale computing.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Large eddy simulations of offshore wind turbine wakes for two floating platform types","Johlas, H. M.; Martínez-Tossas, Luis A.; Lackner, M. A.; Schmidt, D. P.; Churchfield, Matthew J.","17 WIND ENERGY; floating platform; large eddy simulations; offshore wind turbine wakes","The growing prospect for large farms of floating offshore wind turbines requires a better understanding of wake effects for floating turbines. In this work, large eddy simulations with an actuator line model are used to study the wake of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar and OC4-DeepCwind semi-submersible platforms. The simulations are carried out in the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) coupled with OpenFAST for the platform and turbine motion. The wake location, deficit, and turbulence levels are compared for the two floating platforms and equivalent fixed-turbine cases. The effects of neutral versus stable atmospheric conditions are also compared. Most notably, floating-turbine wakes are deflected upwards compared to fixed-turbine wakes, because of mean platform pitch. The spar wake deflects upwards more than the semi-submersible, while the stable atmosphere increases this vertical deflection compared to the neutral. The time-varying rotor motions do not significantly affect the mid-to-far wake, though the stable atmosphere shows larger fixed-floating differences in horizontal wake fluctuations.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Field Validation of Wake Steering Control with Wind Direction Variability","Simley, Eric; Fleming, Paul; King, Jennifer","17 WIND ENERGY; wake steering; wind plant control; wind direction variability; uncertainty","Wake steering is a wind farm control strategy wherein upstream turbines are misaligned with the wind direction to redirect their wakes away from downstream turbines, increasing overall wind plant power. Wake steering is often analyzed assuming steady mean wind directions across the wind farm. However, in practice, the wind direction varies considerably over time because of large-scale weather phenomena. Wind direction variability causes the increase in power production from wake-steering to be less than predicted by steady-state models, but more robust wake-steering strategies can be designed that account for variable wind conditions. This paper compares the achieved yaw offsets and power gains from two different 2-turbine wake-steering experiments at a commercial wind farm with model predictions using the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS) control-oriented model, assuming both fixed and variable wind directions. The impact of wind direction variability is modeled by including wind direction and yaw uncertainty in the FLORIS calculations. The field results match the trends predicted, assuming wind direction variability. Specifically, the yaw offsets achieved in the intended control regions are lower than desired, resulting in less power gain, while a slight loss in power occurs for wind directions outside of the intended control region because of unintentional yaw misalignment. The agreement between the model and field results suggests that the wind direction variability model can be used to design wake-steering controllers that are more robust to variable wind conditions present in the field.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Process-based balance of system cost modeling for offshore wind power plants in the United States","Shields, Matthew; Nunemaker, Jacob","17 WIND ENERGY; balance of system cost model; offshore wind technologies","This paper describes the development of a process-based and open-source balance of system cost model that provides the capability to evaluate both existing and novel offshore wind technologies. Individual design and installation steps are represented with bottom-up engineering models that compute times and costs associated with the process; furthermore, operational constraints are assigned to each process so that delays caused by weather and presence of marine mammals may be accounted for in the overall project timeline. The model structure, assumptions, inputs, and results are vetted with industry partners and compared against actual projects for validation. Installation times show reasonable agreement with real data. Project cost sensitivities are investigated to compute the system-level impact of different design choices. First, individual vessel efficiencies are computed for varying numbers of installation vessels and weather time series to show the diminishing returns of more than two feeder barges. Then, array cable capital costs and installation times are determined for a representative project with different turbine sizes. These values quantify the cost-benefit tradeoffs and show a net-cost savings of decreasing numbers of turbines, increased turbine spacing, and fewer turbine terminations. These results demonstrate that the balance of system model features the accuracy, functionality, and accessibility to serve as the foundation for a wide range of analyses to identify cost reduction potentials for offshore wind energy in the United States.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Free vortex wake (FVW) methods are capable of modeling this type of complex physics while remaining computationally tractable to perform the many simulations necessary for turbine design. In this work, a FVW model is added to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory engineering tool OpenFAST to allow for the aerodynamic modeling of highly flexible turbines along with the aero-hydro-servo-elastic response capabilities of OpenFAST. Code implementation is not complete and thus no results are presented. However, areas of potential modeling improvement are discussed, such as modifications to the circulation calculation and the need for different FVW input model specifications when high-thrust cases are being modeled.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the curled wake model, these motions are induced by a collection of vortices shed from the rotor plane. The direction of the vorticity generated by yaw is aligned with the main flow (streamwise) direction. The streamwise vorticity induces velocities in the spanwise directions. These are the motions responsible for creating the curled wake mechanism. In this work, we explore a more accurate formulation for this mechanism, using a vortex cylinder. Under certain assumptions, the new and original curled wake models yield the same mathematical formulation.

"Enhancement of Unsteady and 3D Aerodynamics Models using Machine Learning","Vijayakumar, Ganesh; Yellapantula, Shashank; Branlard, Emmanuel; Ananthan, Shreyas","17 WIND ENERGY; unsteady aerodynamics; machine learning; dynamic stall","Unsteady aerodynamics will be an important part of the floating wind turbines of the future operating under high shear across the rotor disk coupled with platform motion and atmospheric turbulence. We develop an unsteady aerodynamics and dynamic stall model using a long short-term memory variant of recurrent neural networks. The neural network model is trained using the oscillating airfoil data set from Ohio State University. The predictions from our machine learning (ML)-based model show good agreement with the experimental data and other state-of-the-art dynamic stall models for a wide range of airfoils, Reynolds numbers and reduced frequencies. In some cases the predictions are better than the Beddoes-Leishman model implementation in OpenFAST, when using the default coefficients. The ML-based model is also able to capture the key physics associated with dynamic stall, such as the precedence of moment stall before lift stall and cycle-to-cycle variations in the aerodynamic response. The new unsteady aerodynamics model is expected to improve prediction of fatigue loads for yaw-based wake-steering control scenarios in actuator-line and actuator-disc simulations of wind farms. Our methodology for training the ML-model provides a pathway for improving design level tools using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in the future.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An Update to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Baseline Wind Turbine Controller","Abbas, Nikhar; Wright, Alan; Pao, Lucy","17 WIND ENERGY; controller; reference; wind turbine","The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's 5-MW wind turbine model is well established as an industry standard and is often used as a comparison model, or a model on which to build upon. Though effective, the legacy controller for the 5-MW wind turbine uses a simple algorithm that is not up to date with many industry standards. Additionally, as the research community has advanced into fast-paced development cycles, as systems engineering tools such as Wind-Plant Integrated System Design & Engineering Model (WISDEM ®) [1] are employed, and as a greater focus on controls co-design practices is encouraged, demand for a generic wind turbine controller has arisen. This work presents updates for the NREL 5-MW controller to a more modern control architecture, and establishes a generic tuning framework that can be easily adapted to various wind turbines. Based on initial results, the updated generic controller eases the automatic tuning process while maintaining or improving the performance of the legacy NREL 5-MW controller.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

L.","10 SYNTHETIC FUELS; 17 WIND ENERGY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 42 ENGINEERING; ammonia; magnesium chloride; energy storage; sorbent cycling; sustainable","Metal halide salts such as magnesium chloride have been shown to be promising candidates for ammonia storage materials for energy storage and agriculture applications due to their ability to incorporate several moles of ammonia per mole of salt. Ammonia exiting a synthesis reactor can be separated from nitrogen and hydrogen by absorption into magnesium chloride. Such an absorption can be more complete and hotter than separation via ammonia condensation, the current standard in the Haber–Bosch process. Here, we discuss the optimal conditions for the cyclic uptake and release of ammonia from the supported magnesium chloride absorbents. An automated system was designed for measuring the nonequilibrium working capacity of the absorbent, as well as the impact of important operating conditions such as absorption and desorption temperature, pressure, and desorption time. Measurements of absorption and desorption kinetics provide insight into the mechanisms involved. The temperatures and pressures during absorption and desorption were designed to use minimal energy input to maximize the uptake and release of ammonia within a reasonable amount of time. In a laboratory-scale bed, absorption has a small unused bed length, so it is largely independent of mass transfer; it is dominated by how fast ammonia is fed to the bed. Yet, desorption is restricted both by the speed of heating the bed and by diffusion out of the absorbent. These measurements provide guidelines for ammonia separations and cycling sorbent materials on a larger scale.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Applied Energy Materials; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3; Related Information: Supplementary figures; calibration curve of bed temperature; cycling stability of the absorbent; cycling breakthrough curves; and simplified apparatus of conventional and prototype ammonia synthesis systems.","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 2576-2584","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2574-0962","10.1021/acsaem.9b02278","","2023-01-23T00:00:00Z","1616472","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1616472","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1616472","ACS Applied Energy Materials","3","3"
"The Power Curve Working Group's assessment of wind turbine power performance prediction methods","Lee, Cheuk Yi Joseph; Stuart, Peter; Clifton, Andrew; Fields, Michael J; Perr-Sauer, Jordan; Williams, Lindy; Cameron, Lee; Geer, Taylor; Housley, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; power curve; wind turbine power performance prediction methods","Wind turbine power production deviates from the reference power curve in real-world atmospheric conditions. Correctly predicting turbine power performance requires models to be validated for a wide range of wind turbines using inflow in different locations. The Share-3 exercise is the most recent intelligence-sharing exercise of the Power Curve Working Group, which aims to advance the modeling of turbine performance. The goal of the exercise is to search for modeling methods that reduce error and uncertainty in power prediction when wind shear and turbulence digress from design conditions. Herein, we analyze data from 55 wind turbine power performance tests from nine contributing organizations with statistical tests to quantify the skills of the prediction-correction methods. We assess the accuracy and precision of four proposed trial methods against the baseline method, which uses the conventional definition of a power curve with wind speed and air density at hub height. The trial methods reduce power-production prediction errors compared to the baseline method at high wind speeds, which contribute heavily to power production; however, the trial methods fail to significantly reduce prediction uncertainty in most meteorological conditions. For the meteorological conditions when a wind turbine produces less than the power its reference power curve suggests, using power deviation matrices leads to more accurate power prediction. We also determine that for more than half of the submissions, the data set has a large influence on the effectiveness of a trial method. Overall, this work affirms the value of data-sharing efforts in advancing power curve modeling and establishes the groundwork for future collaborations.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind farms affect local weather and microclimates;hence, parameterizations of their effects have been developed for numerical weather prediction models.While most wind farm parameterizations (WFPs) include drag effects of wind farms, models differ on whether or not an additionalturbulent kinetic energy (TKE) source should be included in theseparameterizations to simulate the impact of wind farms on the boundary layer.Therefore, we use aircraft measurements above large offshore wind farms in stable conditions to evaluateWFP choices. Of the three case studies we examine, we find the simulated ambient backgroundflow to agree with observations of temperature stratification and winds. This agreement allows us toexplore the sensitivity of simulated wind farm effects with respect to modeling choicessuch as whether or not to include a TKE source, horizontal resolution, vertical resolutionand advection of TKE. For a stably stratified marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL), a TKE source and a horizontal resolutionon the order of 5 km or finer are necessary to represent the impact of offshore wind farms on the MABL.Additionally, TKE advection results in excessively reduced TKE over the wind farms, which in turn causesan underestimation of the wind speed deficit above the wind farm. Furthermore, using fine verticalresolution increases the agreement of the simulated wind speed with satellite observations of surface wind speed.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The class of tools ranges from the simple mass conservation model to the coupled Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model, all initiated by the WIND Toolkit data set. The resource estimation at the site is evaluated against measured data at the mast location. Taking a sample 100-kW wind turbine and constant losses, we evaluate Openwind, Continuum, and WindNinja tools and document annual energy production (AEP) and time-series statistics associated with the performance estimation of the wind turbine. Using a methodology that is consistent and unbiased across the three options currently available in the industry, we elaborate results at the two sample locations and discuss the probable sources of discrepancy in the AEP estimates. Two main sources of the discrepancy come from the input WIND Toolkit data and the spatial modeling techniques of the tools to capture atmospheric physics. The discussion includes additional values that these tools may bring into the energy assessment process to enhance the owners' confidence over the distributed wind power systems.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Opportunities for and challenges to further reductions in the “specific power” rating of wind turbines installed in the United States","Bolinger, Mark; Lantz, Eric; Wiser, Ryan; Hoen, Ben; Rand, Joseph; Hammond, Robert","17 WIND ENERGY; specific power; levelized cost of energy; capacity factor; turbine design; long blades; large rotors; economics; geospatial modeling; LCOE","<p>A wind turbine’s “specific power” rating relates its capacity to the swept area of its rotor in terms of Watt per square meter. For a given generator capacity, specific power declines as rotor size increases. In land-rich but capacity-constrained wind power markets, such as the United States, developers have an economic incentive to maximize megawatt-hours per constrained megawatt, and so have favored turbines with ever-lower specific power. To date, this trend toward lower specific power has pushed capacity factors higher while reducing the levelized cost of energy. We employ geospatial levelized cost of energy analysis across the United States to explore whether this trend is likely to continue. We find that under reasonable cost scenarios (i.e. presuming that logistical challenges from very large blades are surmountable), low-specific-power turbines could continue to be in demand going forward. Beyond levelized cost of energy, the boost in market value that low-specific-power turbines provide could become increasingly important as wind penetration grows.</p>","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The effect of wind direction shear on turbine performance in a wind farm in central Iowa","Sanchez Gomez, Miguel; Lundquist, Julie K. (ORCID:0000000154902702)","17 WIND ENERGY; wind direction; wind shear; wind turbines","<p>Abstract. Numerous studies have shown that atmospheric conditions affect wind turbine performance; however, some findings have exposed conflicting results for different locations and diverse analysis methodologies. In this study, we explore how the change in wind direction with height (direction wind shear), a site-differing factor between conflicting studies, and speed shear affect wind turbine performance. We utilized lidar and turbine data collected from the 2013 Crop Wind Energy eXperiment (CWEX) project between June and September in a wind farm in north-central Iowa. Wind direction and speed shear were found to follow a diurnal cycle; however, they evolved differently with increasing wind speeds. Using a combination of speed and direction shear values, we found large direction and small speed shear to result in underperformance. We further analyzed the effects of wind veering on turbine performance for specific values of speed shear and found detrimental conditions on the order of 10 % for wind speed regimes predominantly located in the middle of the power curve. Focusing on a time period of ramping electricity demand (06:00–09:00 LT – local time) exposed the fact that large direction shear occurred during this time and undermined turbine performance by more than 10 %. A predominance of clockwise direction shear (wind veering) cases compared to counterclockwise (wind backing) was also observed throughout the campaign. Moreover, large veering was found to have greater detrimental effects on turbine performance compared to small backing values. This study shows that changes in wind direction with height should be considered when analyzing turbine performance.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Theoretical scenarios for future deployments are based on repowering (i.e. replacing with higher capacity WTs) thus avoiding competition for land. Simulations for the contemporary climate and current WT deployments exhibit good agreement with observed electricity generation efficiency (gross capacity factors (CF) from simulations = 45–48%, while net CF for WT installed in 2016 = 42.5%). Under the scenario of quadrupled installed capacity there is a small decrease in system-wide efficiency as indicated by annual mean CF. This difference is approximately equal to that from the two simulation years and may reflect saturation of the wind resource in some areas. WT modify the local near-surface climate in the grid cells where they are deployed. The simulated impact on near-surface climate properties at both the regional and local scales does not increase with increasing WT installed capacity. Climate impacts from WT are modest compared to regional changes induced by historical changes in land cover and to the global temperature perturbation induced by use of coal to generate an equivalent amount of electricity.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United Kingdom","2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Scientific Reports Journal Volume: 10 Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: X","","","SC0016438","Journal ID: ISSN 2045-2322; 541; PII: 57371","10.1038/s41598-019-57371-1","","2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","1619903","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1619903","","Scientific Reports","1","10"
"A systems engineering vision for floating offshore wind cost optimization","Barter, Garrett E.; Robertson, Amy; Musial, Walter","17 WIND ENERGY; floating offshore wind turbine; multidisciplinary optimization (MDO); offshore wind; systems engineering; wind cost","The U.S. offshore wind resource potential is immense, and often in close proximity to densely-populated coastal load centers. In many U.S. coastal areas, water depths favor the deployment of floating over fixed-bottom offshore wind technology. Floating offshore wind plants have the potential to be cost-competitive with fixed-bottom installations, but because the technology has not yet been deployed at commercial scale, it is not clear when and with what configurations this potential cost parity can be achieved. This article first reviews the state of floating offshore wind technology and deployments to identify key gaps that must be addressed to bring down the overall cost of energy produced. The article then puts forth a long-term vision for a research program and design methodology that may be able to push floating wind plants toward a lower levelized cost of energy than fixed-bottom offshore wind. The method involves a fully integrated systems-engineering and techno-economic design approach to capture the complex interactions between the physics, manufacturing, installation, and operation of floating wind turbines to achieve transformational cost reductions. The approach also envisions multifidelity and uncertainty management strategies to examine the most robust and viable concepts in the design trade-space. To better focus the computational resources, engineering lessons learned from existing offshore wind systems and concept studies are used to develop a set of criteria that can be applied to prefilter candidate technology building blocks that have the greatest cost reduction potential.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The hurricane wind fields, which result from a large eddy simulation of a hurricane, exhibit features such as very high gust factors (>1.7), rapid direction changes (30° in 30 s), and substantial veer. Wind fields including these features have not previously been used in an analysis of a wind turbine, and their effect on structural loads may be an important driver of enhanced design considerations. With a focus on blade root loads and tower base loads, the simulations show that these features of hurricane wind fields can lead to loads that are substantially in excess of those that would be predicted if wind fields with equally high mean wind speeds but without the associated direction change and veer were used in the analysis. This result, if further verified for a range of hurricane and tropical storm simulations, should provide an impetus for revisiting design standards.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Offshore Wind Turbines Will Encounter Very Low Atmospheric Turbulence","Bodini, Nicola; Lundquist, Julie; Kirincich, A.","17 WIND ENERGY; turbulence; wind farm wakes; offshore wind","Turbulence governs the development and erosion of wind farm wakes, which can deplete the offshore wind resource. Therefore, an accurate understanding of atmospheric turbulence is required to support the rapid growth of offshore wind energy. Using 13 months of lidar observations off the coast of Massachusetts, we find that offshore wind plants at the site will experience very low turbulence, quantified as lidar turbulence intensity, especially in summer, when the wind flows from the open ocean. Moreover, the lowest turbulence regimes are often associated with large wind veer conditions, which can impact the effectiveness of wake steering solutions.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Short-term wind forecasting using statistical models with a fully observable wind flow","Perr-Sauer, Jordan; Tripp, Charles; Optis, Michael; King, Jennifer R","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; wind forecasting; wind speed; simulations; power grid","The utility of model output data from the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model is explored for very short-term forecasting (5-30 minutes horizon) of wind speed to be used in large scale simulations of an autonomous electric power grid. Using this synthetic data for the development and evaluation of short-term forecasting algorithms offer many unique advantages over observational data, such as the ability to observe the full wind flow field in the surrounding region. Several short-term forecasting algorithms are implemented and evaluated using the synthetic data at several different time horizons and for three different geographic locations. Comparison is made with observational data from one location. We find that short-term forecasts of the synthetic data considering wind flow from the surrounding region perform 26% better than persistence in terms of root mean square error at the 5-minute time horizon. This improvement is comparable to studies of observational data in the literature. These results provide motivation to use synthetic data for short term forecasting in grid simulations, and open the door to future algorithmic improvements.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"RANS simulations of neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow over complex terrain with comparisons to field measurements","Han, Yi; Stoellinger, Michael Karl","17 WIND ENERGY; Energy & Fuels; Engineering","Micro-scale Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over complex terrain and a comparison of the results with conditionally averaged met-tower data are presented. A robust conditional sampling procedure for the meteorological tower (met-tower) data to identify near-neutral conditions based on a criterion for the turbulence intensity is developed. The conditionally averaged wind data on 14 met-towers are used for the model validation. The ABL flow simulations are conducted over complex terrain which includes a prominent hill using the OpenFOAM-based simulator for on/offshore wind farm applications (SOWFA) with the k-ϵ and the SST k-ω turbulence models. The discretization of the production term in the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is modified to greatly reduce the commonly observed nonphysical near surface TKE peak. The driving inflow is generated through an iterative approach using a precursor method to reproduce the measured wind statistics at the reference tower. Both of the RANS models are able to capture the flow behavior windward of the hill. The SST k-ω model predicts more intense flow separation than the k-ϵ model downstream of the steepest sections of the hill. The wind statistics predicted at the location of the met-towers by both of the RANS models are fairly consistent. Overall, the comparisons of the direction, mean, and standard deviation of the wind between the simulations and the tower data show reasonable agreement except for the differences of the mean wind speeds at four met-towers located closer to the main ridge of the hill in a region of strong terrain variations.","Wiley","","Univ. of Wyoming, Laramie, WY (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Wind Energy; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 91-119","","","SC0012671","Journal ID: ISSN 1095-4244","10.1002/we.2412","","2022-04-04T00:00:00Z","1802457","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1802457","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1802457","Wind Energy","2","23"

"A Methodology for Reliability Assessment and Prognosis of Bearing Axial Cracking in Wind Turbine Gearboxes","Guo, Yi; Sheng, Shawn; Phillips, Caleb; Keller, Jon; Veers, Paul; Williams, Lindy","17 WIND ENERGY; axial cracking; gearbox; probability of failure; prognosis; reliability assessment; wind turbine","This article describes an interdisciplinary methodology to calculate the probability of failure for bearing axial cracking, the dominant failure mode in the intermediate and high-speed stages of many wind turbine gearboxes. This approach is mainly a physics-domain method with needed inputs from the data domain. The gearbox and bearing design along with operations data and component failure records from a wind power plant provide the input to physics-based models and define axial cracking damage metrics. Furthermore, the physics-domain models predict the bearing loads and sliding velocities, which are the essential elements for quantifying the accumulated frictional energy. Both accumulated frictional energy and electrical energy generation are proposed as damage metrics for bearing axial cracking. A first-order reliability method is then used to compare the proposed damage metrics to failure threshold functions and calculate the probability of failure of each individual bearing. Although the probability of failure for the failed turbines is not separated from the population, a feature engineering analysis shows the potential of frictional energy as a damage metric when combined with roller loads, bearing sliding speed, lubricant type, and terrain features. Through statistical analysis of historical data, the proposed methodology enables reliability assessment of axial cracking in individual wind turbine bearings and connects the reliability forecast with turbine design and operations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Probabilistic Zonal Reserve Requirements for Improved Energy Deliverability with Wind Power","Park, Byungkwon; Zhou, Zhi; Botterud, Audun; Thimmapuram, Prakash","17 WIND ENERGY; deliverability; generation margin; security-constrained unit commitment; wind power; zonal reserve","In power systems with high penetration of renewable energy resources, uncertainty and variability of these stochastic resources introduce additional challenges for the operation of power systems. To improve the power systems reliability in the face of uncertainty, reserves are required as additional generation capacity to rebalance the power system following random disturbances. However, reserve deliverability is not guaranteed, because it may encounter potential transmission line congestion. Zonal reserve requirements can address this issue, but operators lack efficient ways to allocate reserves to zones while accounting for wind power forecast uncertainty. We propose a methodology for probabilistic zonal reserve requirements to address wind power forecast uncertainties. This method estimates the probability distribution of line flows based on the system generation margin and injection shift factor. This estimate is then used to construct pre-defined and post-zonal reserve requirements. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently schedules energy and reserves to balance energy and manage deliverability with wind power forecast uncertainty. We also discuss operational implications of the proposed method.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States); Argonne National Lab.

In this study, we estimate turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate ε using multiple techniques, including in situ measurements of sonic anemometers on meteorological towers, a hot-wire anemometer on a tethered lifting system and remote-sensing retrievals from a vertically staring lidar and two lidars performing range–height indicator (RHI) scans. For the retrieval of ε from the lidar RHI scans, we introduce a modification of the Doppler spectral width method. This method uses spatiotemporal averages of the variance in the line-of-sight velocity and the turbulent broadening of the Doppler backscatter spectrum. We validate this method against the observations from the other instruments, also including uncertainty estimations for each method. The synthesis of the results from all instruments enables a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal variability in ε across a valley between two parallel ridges at the Perdigão 2017 campaign. We analyze in detail how ε varies in the night from 13 to 14 June 2017. We find that the shear zones above and below a nighttime low-level jet experience turbulence enhancements. We also show that turbulence in the valley, approximately 11 rotor diameters downstream of an operating wind turbine, is still significantly enhanced by the wind turbine wake.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Classification of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor in very large thermally stratified wind farms using colormap image segmentation","Ali, Naseem; Hamilton, Nicholas; Calaf, Marc; Cal, Raúl Bayoán","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; anisotrop; barycentric map; unsupervised learning; K-Means; clustering","A combinatorial technique merging image segmentation via K-means clustering and colormap of the barycentric triangle is used to investigate the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor. The clustering aids in extracting the identical features from the spatial distribution of the anisotropy colormap images by minimizing the sum of squared error between the cluster center and all data points. The dataset used to explore the applicability of the clustering technique consists of the flow in a large wind farm for different thermal stratification representatives of a characteristic diurnal cycle. Based on the attribute values defining the colormap of the Reynolds anisotropy stress tensor, the images are converted into color space and then the K-means algorithm assesses the similarities and dissimilarities via a distance metric. In unsupervised learning problems, the K-means algorithm runs independently for different numbers of clusters. The elbow criterion is used to determine the best trade-off between the cluster number and the total variance to select the optimal number of clusters. The clustering method improves pattern visualization and allows us to identify characteristic regions of the flow based on the structure of the Reynolds stress anisotropy. The dominant patterns reveal that there are major perturbations that control the operation of the wind farm during the diurnal cycle, including the formation and growth of the convective boundary layer and the strong stratification among the flow layers during the stably-stratified period. These parameters attempt to redistribute energy into the velocity deficit region and contribute to the energy balance in the flow domain through the distributions of the momentum flux. As a effect of the weak mixing and negligible buoyancy effect, the neutral wind farm displays gradual changes from a prolate turbulence state near the rotor to an oblate turbulence state at the top of the domain.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Observation-based estimates of land availability for wind power: a case study for Czechia","Nitsch, Felix; Turkovska, Olga; Schmidt, Johannes","17 WIND ENERGY; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Renewable energies, Wind Power; Expansion scenario; Spatial potential analysis; Land use","Background: The availability of land for the installation of wind power turbines is restricted by numerous factors. Besides climatic conditions, the deployment of wind energy is limited by technical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Typically, assessments of land availability for wind power use legal and technical criteria to estimate the potential for wind power expansion. In contrast, we use observed characteristics of wind power generation sites existing in Austria and Denmark to estimate its potential expansion in Czechia. We combined data on wind turbine locations with data on land use, wind speeds, human impact on land, and nature conservation areas. Results: Our analysis shows that the density of wind power in Austria is variable, but higher on average (4.79 MW km-2 ) than in Denmark (1.76 MW km-2 ). Austrian wind turbines have been installed in areas where the human impact on land is mostly higher than the Austrian average, while in Denmark, no difference is observed. Regarding the land use composite, the share of agricultural land on sites with wind turbines is on average much higher (86%), while the share of forest is much lower (7%) in both countries. We identified a maximum potential area in Czechia of 543 km2 with Austrian and 421 km2 with Danish characteristics. When conservatively assuming observed historical power densities, this area translates to 2295 MW and 741 MW of installed wind power capacity, respectively. These results are a magnitude of order lower than the potentials found in existing studies. In a sensitivity analysis, we have examined that the availability of potential sites depends mainly on the population density, the human impact on land, prevailing wind speeds, and the height above sea level. Conclusions: We estimated available land area for potential wind turbine installations in Czechia using our newly developed methodology based on observed site characteristics of today’s wind power infrastructure in Austria and Denmark. Available land area indicated possible overestimation of wind power capacities proposed in the recent studies on the renewable energy transition. Hence, more rigorous consideration of land availability is required for assessments of potential wind power expansion.","BioMed Central","","Univ. of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna (Austria)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy, Sustainability and Society (Online); Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 45","","","FG02-04ER63917","Journal ID: ISSN 2192-0567; PII: 234","10.1186/s13705-019-0234-z","","2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","1627039","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1627039","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1627039","Energy, Sustainability and Society (Online)","1","9"

To achieve this goal, a comprehensive 18-month field measurement campaign was conducted in the region of the Columbia River basin. The observations were used to diagnose and quantify systematic forecast errors in the operational High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model during weather events of particular concern to wind energy forecasting. Examples of such events are cold pools, gap flows, thermal troughs/marine pushes, mountain waves, and topographic wakes. WFIP2 model development has focused on the boundary layer and surface-layer schemes, cloud–radiation interaction, the representation of drag associated with subgrid-scale topography, and the representation of wind farms in the HRRR. Additionally, refinements to numerical methods have helped to improve some of the common forecast error modes, especially the high wind speed biases associated with early erosion of mountain–valley cold pools. This study describes the model development and testing undertaken during WFIP2 and demonstrates forecast improvements. Specifically, WFIP2 found that mean absolute errors in rotor-layer wind speed forecasts could be reduced by 5%–20% in winter by improving the turbulent mixing lengths, horizontal diffusion, and gravity wave drag. The model improvements made in WFIP2 are also shown to be applicable to regions outside of complex terrain.

These uncertainties must be quantified properly; otherwise, the system security may be threatened. Facing this challenge, here we propose a cost-effective, data-driven approach to assessing a power system's load margin probabilistically. Using actual wind data, a kernel density estimator is applied to infer the nonparametric wind speed distributions, which are further merged into the framework of a vine copula. The latter enables us to simulate complex multivariate and highly dependent model inputs with a variety of bivariate copulae that precisely represent the tail dependence in the correlated samples. Furthermore, to reduce the prohibitive computational time of traditional Monte-Carlo simulations that process a large amount of samples, we propose to use a nonparametric, Gaussian-process-emulator-based reduced-order model to replace the original complicated continuation power-flow model through a Bayesian-learning framework. To accelerate the convergence rate of this Bayesian algorithm, a truncated polynomial chaos surrogate, which serves as a highly efficient, parametric Bayesian prior, is developed. This emulator allows us to execute the time-consuming continuation power-flow solver at the sampled values with a negligible computational cost. Results of simulations that are performed on several test systems reveal the impressive performance of the proposed method in the probabilistic load-margin assessment.","IEEE","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

For these tests the models were run in control (CNT) and experimental (EXP) configurations, with the EXP configuration including all the improved parameterizations. The impacts of the experimental parameterizations on the forecast of 80 m wind speeds (wind turbine hub height) from the HRRR and HRRRNEST models are assessed, using observations collected by 19 sodars and three profiling lidars for comparison. Improvements due to the experimental physics (EXP vs. CNT runs) and those due to finer horizontal grid spacing (HRRRNEST vs. HRRR) and the combination of the two are compared, using standard bulk statistics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean bias error (bias). On average, the HRRR 80 m wind speed MAE is reduced by 3 %–4 % due to the experimental physics. The impact of the finer horizontal grid spacing in the CNT runs also shows a positive improvement of 5 % on MAE, which is particularly large at nighttime and during the morning transition. Lastly, the combined impact of the experimental physics and finer horizontal grid spacing produces larger improvements in the 80 m wind speed MAE, up to 7 %–8 %. The improvements are evaluated as a function of the model's initialization time, forecast horizon, time of the day, season of the year, site elevation, and meteorological phenomena. Causes of model weaknesses are identified.

"A Metric Space with LCOE Isolines for Research Guidance in wind and hydrokinetic energy systems","Garcia‐Sanz, Mario","17 WIND ENERGY; hydrokinetic energy systems; Levelized cost of energy; performance metrics; research strategy; tidal energy systems; wind energy systems; wind farms; wind turbines","This paper introduces a new Metric Space to guide the design of advanced wind energy systems and hydrokinetic energy converters such as tidal, ocean current and riverine turbines. The Metric Space can analyse farms that combine different or identical turbines and stand-alone turbines. The first metric (M1) of the space considers the efficiency of the turbines in the farm, which is also proportional to the specific power per swept area at a given wind/water velocity (W/m<sup>2</sup>). The second metric (M2) describes the specific rotor area per unit of mass of the turbines (m<sup>2</sup>/kg). Both metrics depend on the primary design characteristics of the turbines, such as swept area, system size and mass, materials and efficiency, and are independent at first from external characteristics, such as atmospheric and ocean site conditions, cost of materials and economic factors. Combining both metrics, and for a given set of external characteristics, the resulting Metric Space M2/M1 displays the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) standards as isolines. This graphical representation provides a quick understanding of the cost and state of the technology. It also offers a practical guidance to choose the research tasks and strategy to design advanced wind and hydrokinetic energy systems. The paper applies the new Metric Space to several case studies, including large and small onshore wind turbines, floating and bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines, downwind rotors, multi-rotor and hybrid systems, airborne wind energy systems, wind farms and tidal energy converters.","Wiley","","US Department of Energy (USDOE), Washington DC (United States).

We examine the effect of rotor design choices on the power capture and structural loading of each major wind turbine component. A harmonic model for structural loading is derived from simulations using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) aeroelastic code FAST to reduce computational expense while evaluating design trade-offs for rotors with radii greater than 100 m. Design studies are performed, which focus on blade aerodynamic and structural parameters as well as different hub configurations and nacelle placements atop the tower. The effects of tower design and closed-loop control are also analyzed. Design loads are calculated according to the IEC design standards and used to create a mapping from the harmonic model of the loads and quantify the uncertainty of the transformation. Our design studies highlight both industry trends and innovative designs: we progress from a conventional, upwind, three-bladed rotor to a rotor with longer, more slender blades that is downwind and two-bladed. For a 13 MW design, we show that increasing the blade length by 25 m, while decreasing the induction factor of the rotor, increases annual energy capture by 11 % while constraining peak blade loads. A downwind, two-bladed rotor design is analyzed, with a focus on its ability to reduce peak blade loads by 10 % per 5° of cone angle and also reduce total blade mass. However, when compared to conventional, three-bladed, upwind designs, the peak main-bearing load of the upscaled, downwind, two-bladed rotor is increased by 280 %. Optimized teeter configurations and individual pitch control can reduce non-rotating damage equivalent loads by 45 % and 22 %, respectively, compared with fixed-hub designs.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Policymakers can benefit from analyses of existing wind projects that enable them to better understand likely effects on residents around proposed projects. Our analysis of a randomly drawn, representative national survey of 1705 existing U.S. wind project neighbors provides previously unavailable detail about factors influencing the attitudes of these neighbors toward their local wind projects. Overall, we find positive-leaning attitudes, which improve over time as individuals self-select into communities near existing wind projects. Hearing wind turbines leads to less-positive attitudes, although living very near to turbines does not, nor does seeing wind turbines. In fact, our findings suggest complex relationships among nearby residents' attitudes, their perceptions about the particular fit of turbines within their landscape and community, and their perceptions of wind project impacts on property values. These findings - along with the positive correlation between perceived planning-process fairness and attitude - suggest areas of focus for wind project development that may influence social outcomes and acceptance of wind energy. The concluding discussion provides a number of policy and future research recommendations based on the research.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Recommended key performance indicators for operational management of wind turbines","Pfaffel, Sebastian; Faulstich, Stefan; Sheng, Shawn S","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbines; key performance indicators; performance; reliability; maintenance","Operational managers of wind turbines usually monitor a big fleet of turbines and thus need highly condensed information to identify underperforming turbines and to prioritize their work. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are a solid and frequently used tool for this purpose. However, the KPIs used in the wind industry are not unified to date, which makes comparison in the industry difficult. Further, comprehensive standards on a set of KPIs for the wind industry are missing. This article identifies and recommends KPIs and provides detailed definitions to make KPIs comparable and to enable benchmarking. The starting point of this work is an industry survey with 28 participants intended to identify commonly used KPIs, collect various possible definitions, and prioritize them. Out of a total of 50 KPIs, we discuss in a next step 33 selected KPIs on performance, maintenance, and reliability in detail and recommend definitions, most of which are based on international standards. As a result, operators can easily use these recommendations to base their system of KPIs. By using this unified set of KPIs, operators can be well-prepared to conduct industrywide comparisons and benchmarks. The survey and this article will also serve as a basis for committee work of the FGW e.V. to develop a corresponding technical guideline.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Building on a literature that has sought to develop and apply methods for retrospective benefit-to-cost evaluation for federal research programs, this study provides a quantitative analysis of the economic social return on these historical wind energy research investments. Importantly, the study applies multiple innovative methods and varies important input parameters to test the sensitivity of the results. The analysis considers public wind research expenditures and U.S. wind power deployment over the period 1976–2017, while also accounting for the full useful lifetime of wind projects built over this period. Assessed benefits include energy cost savings and health benefits due to reductions in air pollution. Overall, this analysis demonstrates sizable, positive economic returns on past wind energy research. Under the core analysis and with a 3% real discount rate, the net benefits from historical federal wind energy research investments are found to equal $31.4 billion, leading to an 18 to 1 benefit-to-cost ratio and an internal rate of return of 15.4%. Avoided carbon dioxide emissions are not valued in monetary terms, but are estimated at 1510 million metric tons. Alternative methods and input assumptions yield benefit-to-cost ratios that fall within a relatively narrow range from 7-to-1 to 21-to-1, reinforcing in broad terms the general finding of a sizable positive return on investment. Unsurprisingly, results are sensitive to the chosen discount rate, with higher discount rates leading to lower benefit-to-cost ratios, and lower discount rates yielding higher benefit-to-cost ratios.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In 2015 the U.S. Department of Energy initiated a four-year study, the second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2), to improve the representation of boundary-layer physics and related processes in mesoscale models for better treatment of scales applicable to wind and wind power forecasts. This goal challenges numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in complex terrain in large part due to inherent assumptions underlying their boundary-layer parameterizations. The WFIP2 effort involved the wind industry, universities, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) national laboratories in an integrated observational and modeling study. Observations spanned 18 months to assure a full annual cycle of continuously recorded observations from remote-sensing and in situ measurement systems. The study area comprised the Columbia Basin of eastern Washington and Oregon, containing more than 6 GW of installed wind capacity. Nests of observational systems captured important atmospheric scales from mesoscale to NWP subgrid scale. Model improvements targeted NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model to facilitate transfer of improvements to National Weather Service (NWS) operational forecast models, and these modifications have already yielded quantitative improvements for the short-term operational forecasts. This paper describes the general WFIP2 scope and objectives, the particular scientific challenges of improving wind forecasts in complex terrain, early successes of the project, and an integrated approach to archiving observations and model output. It provides an introduction for a set of more detailed BAMS papers addressing WFIP2 observational science, modeling challenges and solutions, incorporation of forecasting uncertainty into decision support tools for the wind industry, and advances in coupling improved mesoscale models to microscale models that can represent interactions between wind plants and the atmosphere.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The development of acoustic alerting technologies to deter eagles from entering hazardous air spaces is a potentially significant mitigation strategy to diminish associated morbidity and mortality risks. As a prelude to the engineering of deterrence technologies, auditory function was assessed in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), as well as in red tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis). Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to a comprehensive battery of clicks and tone bursts varying in level and frequency were acquired to evaluate response thresholds, as well as suprathreshold response characteristics of wave I of the ABR, which represents the compound potential of the VIII cranial nerve. Sensitivity curves exhibited an asymmetric convex shape similar to those of other avian species, response latencies decreased exponentially with increasing stimulus level and response amplitudes grew with level in an orderly manner. Both species were responsive to a frequency band at least 4 octaves wide, with a most sensitive frequency of 2 kHz, and a high frequency limit of approximately 5.7 kHz in bald eagles and 8 kHz in red tailed hawks.

The load analysis process requires precise knowledge of the expected wind-inflow conditions as well as turbine structural and aerodynamic properties. However, uncertainty in most parameters is inevitable. It is therefore important to understand the impact such uncertainties have on the resulting loads. The goal of this work is to assess which input parameters have the greatest influence on turbine power, fatigue loads, and ultimate loads during normal turbine operation. An elementary effects sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most sensitive parameters. Separate case studies are performed on (1) wind-inflow conditions and (2) turbine structural and aerodynamic properties, both cases using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5&amp;thinsp;MW baseline wind turbine. The Veers model was used to generate synthetic International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Kaimal turbulence spectrum inflow. The focus is on individual parameter sensitivity, though interactions between parameters are considered. The results of this work show that for wind-inflow conditions, turbulence in the primary wind direction and shear are the most sensitive parameters for turbine loads, which is expected. Secondary parameters of importance are identified as veer, <span class=""inline-formula""><em>u</em></span>-direction integral length, and <span class=""inline-formula""><em>u</em></span> components of the IEC coherence model, as well as the exponent. For the turbine properties, the most sensitive parameters are yaw misalignment and outboard lift coefficient distribution; secondary parameters of importance are inboard lift distribution, blade-twist distribution, and blade mass imbalance. This information can be used to help establish uncertainty bars around the predictions of engineering models during validation efforts, and provide insight to probabilistic design methods and site-suitability analyses.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Simulating wind power forecast error distributions for spatially aggregated wind power plants","Miettinen, Jari; Holttinen, Hannele; Hodge, Bri‐Mathias S.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind power forecasting; wind power; aggregated wind power production","Dispersion and aggregation of wind power plants lower the uncertainty of wind power by reducing wind power forecasting errors. Using quantitative methods, this paper studies the dispersion's impact on the uncertainty of the aggregated wind power production. A method to simulate day-ahead forecast error distributions at different dispersion and forecasting skill scenarios is presented. The proposed method models the uncertainty of wind power forecasting on an annual basis and at different levels of production. As a result, the uncertainty in the forecasting of spatially dispersed wind power plants is modelled using two continuous distributions: Laplace and beta distribution. The analysis shows that even the production level uncertainty can be modelled in various dispersion and forecasting skill scenarios. The model for aggregated forecast error distributions requires only four variables: capacity-weighted distance of the total wind power plant fleet, mean of the site-specific mean absolute errors (MAEs), number of aggregated wind power plants, and the mean variability of the elevations from the proximities of the aggregated wind power plants. Here, the results are especially promising when the number of aggregated wind power plants exceeds five, the terrain complexity is low or moderate, and the aggregation region is large. This is demonstrated through a case study for Texas, United States.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluating commercial feasibility of a new tall wind tower design concept using a stochastic levelized cost of energy model","Barutha, Phil; Nahvi, Ali; Cai, Bin; Jeong, H. David; Sritharan, Sri","17 WIND ENERGY; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","Wind power generation has seen a dramatic increase in the 21st century and the Department of Energy (DOE) envisions that wind energy will become a much larger part of overall power generation in the U.S. by 2050. Wind turbines have continued to grow in size during the last few decades with towers commonly built at a height of 80 m for typical utility-scale turbines in the Unites States, and this is accompanied by certain transportation and logistics challenges. The newly proposed tall tower technology has been designed to be cost-effective in assembling towers as high as 140 m from precast concrete module components that are capable of transport on the U.S. road system. This paper presents an alternative wind tower design with potential for reducing the overall levelized cost of energy (LCOE); it evaluates a hexagonal precast concrete wind tower solution that facilitates use of a taller wind turbine generator for harvesting stronger, steadier, and more frequent wind resources to increase wind energy production and lower the overall LCOE. An integrated team of industry experts was consulted to support development of a stochastic life cycle cost model using a parametric estimate of the cost and fabrication and assembly schedules of this new wind tower design concept as well as forecasting the projected revenue to be created by the new technology. The study concludes that this new design concept is a commercially viable solution, with an estimated LCOE savings ranging from 2% to 4% compared with the typical 80 m turbine deployed in the United States, and it also provides wind power potential to previously untapped regions in the country. This article helps to inform energy developers, manufacturers, and policy makers, both regionally and nationally, of a possible economically feasible wind tower design solution.","Elsevier","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Cleaner Production; Journal Volume: 240; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 118001","","","EE0006737","Journal ID: ISSN 0959-6526; PII: S0959652619328719","10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118001","","2022-02-28T00:00:00Z","1799236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799236","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799236","Journal of Cleaner Production","C","240"
"The Importance of Round-Robin Validation When Assessing Machine-Learning-Based Vertical Extrapolation of Wind Speeds.","Bodini, Nicola; Optis, Michael","17 WIND ENERGY; wind speeds; round-robin validation; machine learning; wind energy","The extrapolation of wind speeds measured at a meteorological mast to wind turbine hub heights is a key component in a bankable wind farm energy assessment and a significant source of uncertainty. Industry-standard methods for extrapolation include the power law and logarithmic profile. The emergence of machine-learning applications in wind energy has led to several studies demonstrating substantial improvements in vertical extrapolation accuracy in machine-learning methods over these conventional power law and logarithmic profile methods. In all cases, these studies assess relative model performance at a measurement site where, critically, the machine-learning algorithm requires knowledge of the hub-height wind speeds in order to train the model. This prior knowledge provides fundamental advantages to the site-specific machine-learning model over the power law and log profile, which, by contrast, are not highly tuned to hub-height measurements but rather can generalize to any site. Furthermore, there is no practical benefit in applying a machine-learning model at a site where hub-height winds are known; rather, its performance at nearby locations (i.e., across a wind farm site) without hub-height measurements is of most practical interest. To more fairly and practically compare machine-learning-based extrapolation to standard approaches, we implemented a round-robin extrapolation model comparison, in which a random forest machine-learning model is trained and evaluated at different sites and then compared against the power law and logarithmic profile. We consider 20 months of lidar and sonic anemometer data collected at four sites between 50-100 kilometers apart in the central United States. We find that the random forest outperforms the standard extrapolation approaches, especially when incorporating surface measurements as inputs to include the influence of atmospheric stability. When compared at a single site (the traditional comparison approach), the machine-learning improvement in mean absolute error was 28% and 23% over the power law and logarithmic profile, respectively. Using the round-robin approach proposed here, this improvement drops to 19% and 14%, respectively. These latter values better represent practical model performance, and we conclude that round-robin validation should be the standard for machine-learning-based, wind-speed extrapolation methods.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Therefore, there is a continuous need for advanced monitoring techniques which can exploit the opportunities of Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics. The heart of wind turbines is an epicyclic gearbox and rolling element bearings are often responsible for machinery stops. The vibration signatures of bearings are rather weak compared to other components. As a result a number of signal processing techniques have been proposed, focusing towards accurate and early fault detection with limited false alarms and missed detections. In Envelope Analysis an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated usually after filtering around a frequency band. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed to select the optimum filter parameters. Monitoring techniques have reached a mature level for steady speed and load operating conditions. On the other hand, under chaniging operating conditions, it is still unclear whether the change of the monitoring indicators is due to the change of the machinery's health or due to the change of operating parameters. Recently, the authors have proposed a new tool called IESFOgram, based on Cyclic Spectral Coherence for the automatic selection of the filtering band. In this paper, the performance of the tool is evaluated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking data set which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity as well as various speed and load operating conditions.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Alaska, with its vast coastline, presents ample potential territory in which to build offshore wind farms, but significant challenges have thus far limited Alaska’s deployment of utility-scale wind energy capacity to a modest 62 MW (or approximately 2.7% of the state’s electric generation) as of this writing, all in land-based wind farms. This study provides an assessment of Alaska’s offshore wind resource, the first such assessment for Alaska, using a 14-year, high-resolution simulation from a numerical weather prediction and regional climate model. This is the longest-known high-resolution model data set to be used in a wind resource assessment. Widespread areas with relatively shallow ocean depth and high long-term average 100-m wind speeds and estimated net capacity factors over 50% were found, including a small area near Alaska’s population centers and the largest transmission grid that, if even partially developed, could provide the bulk of the state’s energy needs. The regional climate simulations were validated against available radiosonde and surface wind observations to provide the confidence of the model-based assessment. The model-simulated wind speed was found to be skillful and with near-zero average bias (-0.4–0.2 m s<sup>-1</sup>) when averaged over the domain.

The profile data are used to quantify the spatial variability of wind flows in this area of complex terrain, to assess the HRRR-NCEP model's ability to capture spatial and temporal variability of wind profiles, and to evaluate model errors. Annually averaged measured wind speed differences over the 70-km extent of the lidar measurements reached 1 m s<sup>-1</sup> within the wind-turbine rotor layer, and 2 m s<sup>-1</sup> for 200-500 m AGL. Stronger wind speeds in the lowest 500 m occurred at sites higher in elevation, farther from the river, and farther west - closer to the Cascade Mountain barrier. Validating against the lidar data, the HRRR model underestimated strong wind speeds (>12 m s<sup>-1</sup>) and, consequently, their frequency of occurrence, especially at the two lowest-elevation sites, producing annual low biases in rotor-layer wind speed of 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The RMSE between measured and modeled winds at all sites was about 3 m s<sup>-1</sup> and did not degrade significantly with forecast lead time. The nature of the model errors was different for different seasons. Furthermore, although the three sites were located in the same basin terrain, the nature of the model errors was different at each site. Thus, if only one of the sites had been instrumented, different conclusions would have been drawn as to the major sources of model error, depending on where the measurements were made.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These projects require site wind and environmental data before and during operation. Conventional techniques such as fixed-bottom meteorological towers present economical and permitting challenges for the US. Floating Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) buoys offer significant advantages including reduced costs, less permitting, and reusability. This paper presents the validation of the first floating LiDAR buoy in Northeast US waters. The buoy, named DeepCLiDAR, includes a LiDAR, ecological monitoring sensors, and metocean sensors. A three-phase LiDAR validation plan was executed, and its results are presented. The objective of the validation plan was to verify the accuracy of measurements made by the LiDAR buoy in wave environments against an unmoving reference wind measurement. Due to a lack of reference met masts, the use of a LiDAR on land as a baseline reference was implemented for validation. Comparison to a reference LiDAR instead of a traditional meteorological tower was a unique approach required in the Northeast US waters due to the absence of a reference fixed-bottom meteorological tower in the region at the time of this study. The testing included a comparison of wind speed measurements made by the buoy deployed 15 km offshore from the mainland and a land-based reference LiDAR located on a nearby island. This paper presents the methodology and results of this program, which indicate favorable agreement. This was the first such validation program in the Northeast USA which is now seeing rapid development of offshore wind.","Wiley","","Univ. of Maine, Orono, ME (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2019-07-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Wind Energy; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1548-1562","","","EE0006713","Journal ID: ISSN 1095-4244; IIP‐0917974","10.1002/we.2387","","2022-02-08T00:00:00Z","1843389","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1843389","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1843389","Wind Energy","11","22"

It is therefore critical to ensure that the models being used for research and industry applications in wind energy be thoroughly validated against measurements. A full-system validation of wind plant simulations must consider the atmospheric inflow, the response of the wind turbines, and their wakes. This task is complicated by the lack of freely available, quality-controlled, high-quality measurements. Here, such measurements are used to offer a validation exercise that can be used to assess the accuracy of models of any fidelity level. When it comes to real-world measurements, the dataset considered herein is simple in terms of terrain but exhibits pronounced diurnal cycles. Instead of a full-scale wind plant, we consider an individual research-scale, utility wind turbine instrumented for power and loads measurements. Three benchmarks are defined, with increasing levels of complexity: near neutral, slightly unstable, and very stable atmospheric stratification. Through comparisons between observations and simulations, the benchmarks provide complementary information about the model performance and its ability to reproduce mean and dynamic wake characteristics. This article describes the measurements and methodology used to define these benchmarks and provides the information required to perform simulations and conduct the model-measurement comparison. The objective is to provide a robust wake model validation exercise open to anyone, which will serve to minimize uncertainty in model validation practices related to varying methodologies across simulation tools and users.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Here, previously assessed systematic uncertainty components in hydrodynamic tests of the OC5-DeepCwind semisubmersible are propagated to response metrics of interest using numerical simulation tools, and combined with the system's random uncertainty to obtain the total experimental uncertainty. The uncertainty in the low-frequency response metrics is found to be most sensitive to the system properties (e.g., mooring stiffness and center of gravity), and also the wave elevation.

Wind turbines in a wind farm typically operate individually to maximize their own performance and do not take into account information from nearby turbines. To enable cooperation to achieve farm-level objectives, turbines will need to use information from nearby turbines to optimize performance, ensure resiliency when other sensors fail, and adapt to changing local conditions. A key element of achieving a more efficient wind farm is to develop algorithms that ensure reliable, robust, real-time, and efficient operation of wind turbines in a wind farm using local sensor information that is already being collected, such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, local meteorological stations, and nearby radars/sodars/lidars. This article presents a framework for developing a cooperative wind farm that incorporates information from nearby turbines in real time to better align turbines in a wind farm. SCADA data from multiple turbines can be used to make better estimates of the local inflow conditions at each individual turbine. By incorporating measurements from multiple nearby turbines, a more reliable estimate of the wind direction can be obtained at an individual turbine. The consensus-based approach presented in this paper uses information from nearby turbines to estimate wind direction in an iterative way rather than aggregating all the data in a wind farm at once. Results indicate that this estimate of the wind direction can be used to improve the turbine's knowledge of the wind direction. This estimated wind direction signal has implications for potentially decreasing dynamic yaw misalignment, decreasing the amount of time a turbine spends yawing due to a more reliable input to the yaw controller, increasing resiliency to faulty wind-vane measurements, and increasing the potential for wind farm control strategies such as wake steering.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of Wind Speed Retrieval from Continuous-Wave Lidar Measurements of a Wind Turbine Wake Using Virtual Lidar Techniques","Debnath, M.; Doubrawa, P.; Herges, T.; Martínez-Tossas, L. A.; Maniaci, D. C.; Moriarty, P.","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; wind; lidar; wind speed retrieval; virtual lidar","Wind lidar technology is being extensively used in utility-scale wind turbine wake measurements because of its capabilities to capture the dominant structures of interest in the near-wake region. However, wind lidar devices provide only line-of-sight (LOS) measurements, and retrieval of horizontal wind speed from the LOS measurements of a single lidar in the wind turbine wake could introduce errors due to the assumptions used in the retrieval process. With that in mind, the goals of this paper are to estimate the errors associated with the retrieval processes and provide guidelines for best practices. To achieve these goals, virtual lidar samples are obtained with large-eddy simulations (LES) by sampling the flow field with a model of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) SpinnerLidar. LES is chosen to simulate the neutral and unstable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), a benchmark case of the International Energy Agency Wind Technology Collaboration Programme (IEA Wind TCP) Task 31. The precursor ABL simulation is validated with the reference data provided by the IEA Wind Task 31 benchmark case. The data from the precursor simulation is used to drive a simulation of a wind turbine submerged in the ABL. A weighting function is applied to the LES data to mimic the real DTU SpinnerLidar measurements. In the end, the virtual lidar data are processed and compared with the original LES data to estimate the errors. Results show that lidar captures mean ABL profile without any noticeable error, whereas turbulence intensity is underpredicted ~15% at hub height for the neutral case. Volume averaging by the lidar technology has a significant effect in the shear layer of a wind turbine wake.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessing wind power operating costs in the United States: Results from a survey of wind industry experts","Wiser, Ryan; Bolinger, Mark; Lantz, Eric J.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; wind power; operations; maintenance; levelized cost of energy; operational expenditures; learning curves","This paper draws on a survey of wind industry professionals to clarify trends in the operational expenditures (OpEx) of U.S. land-based wind power plants. We find that average all-in lifetime OpEx has declined from approximately $80/kW-yr (~$35/MWh) for projects built in the late 1990s to a level approaching $40/kW-yr (~$11/MWh) for projects built in 2018. Turbine operations and maintenance costs represent the single largest component of overall OpEx and the primary source of cost reductions. We observe wide ranges of OpEx over time; respondents cite a range in average expected costs for recently commissioned projects from $33/kW-yr to $59/kW-yr. We also use historical OpEx learning rates, showing a 9% OpEx reduction for each doubling of global wind capacity, to project a further $5-$8/kW-yr reduction from 2018 to 2040. These findings suggest that continued OpEx reductions may contribute 10% or more of the expected reductions in land-based wind's levelized cost of energy. Moreover, these estimates understate the importance of OpEx owing to the multiplicative effects through which operational advancements influence not only operations and maintenance costs but also component reliability, performance, and plant-level availability - thereby also affecting levelized costs by enhancing annual energy production and plant lifetimes. Given the limited quantity and comparability of previously available OpEx data, the trends reported here may inform OpEx assumptions used by electric planners, analysts, and modelers. The results may also provide useful benchmarks to the wind industry, helping developers and asset owners compare their expectations with historical experience and other industry projections.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind turbine audibility and noise annoyance in a national U.S. survey: individual perception and influencing factors","Haac, T. Ryan; Kaliski, Kenneth; Landis, Matthew; Hoen, Ben; Rand, Joseph; Firestone, Jeremy; Elliott, Debi","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind turbines; community noise; noise annoyance; audibility; community tolerance level","With results from a nationwide survey sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, factors that affect outdoor audibility and noise annoyance of wind turbines were evaluated. Wind turbine and summer daytime median background sound levels were estimated for 1043 respondents. Wind turbine sound level was the most robust predictor of audibility yet only a weak, albeit significant, predictor of noise annoyance. For each 1 dB increase in wind turbine sound level (L<sub>1h-max</sub>), the odds of hearing a wind turbine on one's property increased by 31% [odds ratio (OR): 1.31; 95% CI (confidence interval): 1.25-1.38] and the odds of moving to the next level of annoyance increased by 9% (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02-1.16). While audibility was overwhelmingly dependent on turbine sound level, noise annoyance was best explained by visual disapproval (OR: 11.0; 95% CI: 4.8-25.4). The final models correctly predict audibility and annoyance level for 80% and 62% of individuals, respectively. The results demonstrate that among community members not receiving personal benefits from wind projects, the Community Tolerance Level of wind turbine noise for the U.S. aligns with the international average, further supporting observations that communities are less tolerant of wind turbine noise than other common environmental noise sources at equivalent A-weighted sound levels.","Acoustical Society of America","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The Lithium-ion battery is currently the most widely used solution for energy storage system. However, its high cost is considered as one of the major barriers hampering the integration of renewable energy and the adoption of electric vehicles. Reusing electric vehicle batteries seems a promising solution to the aforementioned problem. Based on a dynamic degradation model of Lithium-ion batteries, this paper first compares the profits that second-life and fresh batteries can bring to the wind farm. Model predictive control is adopted to solve an hourly optimal wind scheduling problem and maximize the profit of wind farm owner. Here, the optimal size of battery is determined and then the comparison of second-life and fresh batteries is conducted taking the battery degradation, the profit of the wind farm owner, and various remaining capacities of battery into account. Two case studies in USA and Denmark are conducted and the analysis shows that given the current prices of wind energy and Lithium-ion batteries, reusing batteries is not worthwhile for the studied wind farms, but it may outperform fresh batteries in the future if the wind energy price decreases much faster than the battery price.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Co-optimized trading of hybrid wind power plant with retired EV batteries in energy and reserve markets under uncertainties","Zhan, Sen; Hou, Peng; Enevoldsen, Peter; Yang, Guangya; Zhu, Jiangsheng; Eichman, Joshua D.; Jacobson, Mark Z.","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; retired EV battery-storage system (RESS); FCR-N market; spot market; MILP","To be competitive in the electricity markets, various technologies have been reported to increase profits of wind farm owners. Combining battery storage system, wind farms can be operated as conventional power plants which promotes the integration of wind power into the power grid. However, high expenses on batteries keep investors away. Retired EV batteries, fortunately, still have enough capacity to be reused and could be obtained at a low price. In this work, a two-stage optimization of a wind energy retired EV battery-storage system is proposed. The economic performance of the proposed system is examined concerning its participation in the frequency containment normal operation reserve (FCR-N) market and the spot market simultaneously. To account uncertainties in the wind farm output, various electricity market prices, and up/down regulation status, a scenario-based stochastic programming method is used. The sizing of the equipment is optimized on top of daily operations of the hybrid system which formulates a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Scenarios are generated with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Roulette Wheel Mechanism (RWM), which are further reduced with the simultaneous backward method (SBM) to increase computational efficiency. A 21 MW wind farm is selected as a case study. Here, the optimization results show that by integrating with a retired EV battery-storage system (RESS) and a bi-directional inverter, the wind farm can increase its profits significantly when forwarding bids in both of the aforementioned electricity markets.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Machine learning applied to wind turbine blades impact detection","Hu, Congcong; Albertani, Roberto","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind turbine; birds; environment; vibration sensors; impact monitoring; machine learning; support vector machine","The significant development of wind power generation worldwide brings, together with environmental benefits, wildlife concerns, especially for volant species vulnerability to interactions with wind energy facilities. For surveying such events, an automatic system for continuous monitoring of blade collisions is critical. An onboard multi-senor system capable of providing real-time collision detection using integrated vibration sensors is developed and successfully tested. However, to detect low signal-to-noise ratio impact can be challenging; hence, an advanced impact detection method has been developed and presented in this article. A robust automated detection algorithm based on support vector machine is proposed. After a preliminary signal pre-processing, geometric features specifically selected for their sensitivity to impact signals are extracted from raw vibration signal and energy distribution graph. The predictive model is formulated by training conventional support vector machine using extracted features for impact identification. Finally, the performance of the predictive model is evaluated by accuracy, precision, and recall. Results indicate a linear regression relationship between signal-to-noise ratio and model overall performance. Here, the proposed method is much reliable on higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR≥6), but it shows to be ineffective at lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR<2).","SAGE","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"A Comparison of Classical and Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioners for High-Fidelity Simulation of Wind Turbine Incompressible Flows","Thomas, Stephen J.; Ananthan, Shreyas; Yellapantula, Shashank; Hu, J. J.; Lawson, Michael; Sprague, Michael A.","97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 17 WIND ENERGY; Navier-Stokes; iterative solvers; algebraic multigrid; wind turbines; exascale","This paper presents a comparison of parallel strong scaling performance of classical and aggregation algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners in the context of wind turbine simulations. Fluid motion is governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, discretized in space with control-volume finite elements and in time with an inexact projection scheme using an implicit integrator. A discontinuous-Galerkin sliding-mesh algorithm captures rotor motion. The momentum equations are solved with iterative Krylov methods, preconditioned by symmetric Gauss--Seidel (SGS) in Trilinos and $\ell_1$ SGS in hypre. The mass-continuity equation is solved with GMRES preconditioned by AMG and can account for the majority of simulation time. Reducing this continuity solve time is crucial. Wind turbine simulations present two unique challenges for AMG preconditioned solvers: the computational meshes include strongly anisotropic elements, and mesh motion requires matrix reinitialization and computation of preconditioners at each time step. Detailed timing profiles are presented and analyzed, and best practices are discussed for both classical and aggregation-based AMG. Results are presented for simulations of two different wind turbines with up to 6 billion grid points on two different computer architectures. For moving mesh problems that require linear-system reinitialization, the well-established strategy of amortizing preconditioner setup costs over a large number of time steps to reduce the solve time is no longer valid. Instead, results show that faster time to solution is achieved by reducing preconditioner setup costs at the expense of linear-system solve costs. Standard smoothed aggregation with Chebyshev relaxation was found to perform poorly when compared with classical AMG in terms of solve time and robustness. However, plain aggregation was comparable to classical AMG.","SIAM","","Sandia National Lab.

Although most physics involved in wind energy are nonlinear, linearization of the underlying nonlinear system equations is often advantageous to understand the system properties and exploit well-established methods and tools for analyzing linear systems. Previous work in this area has focused on the development of the new linearization functionality of the open-source engineering tool OpenFAST for floating offshore wind turbines, as well as the concepts and mathematical background needed to understand and apply it correctly. This paper focuses on the verification of this new linearization functionality, which is carried out by comparing results to previous stable versions of FAST. A nonlinear time-domain simulation for a floating offshore platform is also compared to the time-domain response of the linearized state-space model. The linearized results show good alignment between OpenFAST and previous versions of FAST, as well as with the time-domain simulations, thereby showing the accuracy of the new features in OpenFAST.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Turbulence dissipation rate (ϵ) governs the accuracy of model predictions of hub-height wind speed and the development and erosion of wakes. Here we assess the variability of turbulence kinetic energy and ϵ using 13 months of observations from a profiling lidar deployed on a platform off the Massachusetts coast. Offshore, ϵ is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than onshore, with a subtle diurnal cycle. Wind direction influences the annual cycle of turbulence, with larger values in winter when the wind flows from the land, and smaller values in summer, when the wind flows from open ocean. Because of the weak turbulence, wind plant wakes will be stronger and persist farther downwind in summer.","American Geophysical Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fleetwide data-enabled reliability improvement of wind turbines","Verstraeten, Timothy; Nowe, Ann; Keller, Jonathan A; Guo, Yi; Sheng, Shuangwen; Helsen, Jan","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine reliability; data-enabled load analysis; failure avoidance","Wind farms are an indispensable driver toward renewable and nonpolluting energy resources. However, as ideal sites are limited, placement in remote and challenging locations results in higher logistics costs and lower average wind speeds. Therefore, it is critical to increase the reliability of the turbines to reduce maintenance costs. Robust implementation requires a thorough understanding of the loads subject to the turbine's control. Yet, such dynamically changing multidimensional loads are uncommon with other machinery, and generally underresearched. Therefore, a multitiered approach is proposed to investigate the load spectrum occurring in wind farms. Our approach relies on both fundamental research using controllable test rigs, as well as analyses of real-world loading conditions in high-frequency supervisory control and data acquisition data. A method is introduced to detect operational zones in wind farm data and link them with load distributions. Additionally, while focused research further investigates the load spectrum, a method is proposed that continuously optimizes the farm's control protocols without the need to fully understand the loads that occur. A case of gearbox failure is investigated based on a vast body of past experiments and suspect loads are identified. Starting from this evidence on the cause and effects of dynamic loads, the potential of our methods is shown by analyzing real-world farm loading conditions on a steady-state case of wake and developing a preventive row-based control protocol for a case of cascading emergency brakes induced by a storm.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The proposed ADRCC-OPF model is distributionally robust because the uncertainties of the wind power forecasting are represented only by their first- and second-order moments instead of a specific distribution assumption. The proposed model is adjustable because it is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) model with an adjustable coefficient. This coefficient can control the robustness of the chance constraints, which may be set up for the Gaussian distribution, symmetrically distributional robustness, or distributionally robust cases considering wind forecasting uncertainty. The conservativeness of the ADRCC-OPF model is analyzed and compared with the actual distribution data of wind forecasting error. The system operators can choose an appropriate adjustable coefficient to tradeoff between the economics and system security.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, a deep architecture incorporated with multitask learning and multimodal learning for wind power prediction, termed predictive stacked autoencoder (PSAE), is presented. PSAE is a unified framework integrating multiple stacked autoencoders (SAEs), one feature fusion layer, and one prediction terminal layer, which expands the architecture from two spatial dimensions, including the depth and width, compared to conventional prediction models. Initially, the SAEs at the bottom of PSAE extracted features from multiple kinds of measurements respectively. Following, the feature fusion layer encodes the high-order features extracted by different SAEs into a unified feature that is more informative and representative for wind power prediction. Finally, the prediction terminal layer functions as a regression machine which generates the predicted targets based on the fusion features. Trained in an end-to-end (E2E) manner, PSAE is capable of learning heterogeneous features jointly and achieving the prediction task of sequence-to-sequence (S2S). Experiments for multi-step short-term predictions are conducted on real-world data, and the results demonstrate the superiority of PSAE to prior methods.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

To help gauge these challenges to the power system, we quantify IAV of wind and solar resource and electricity generation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power system, then assess the IAV of wind and solar electricity generation during peak-load hours (i.e., IAV of wind and solar capacity values) for the current ERCOT wind and solar generator fleet. To do so, we leverage the long timespan of four reanalysis datasets with the high resolution of grid integration datasets. We find the IAV (quantified as the coefficient of variation) of wind generation ranges from 2.3%-11% across ERCOT, while the IAV of solar generation ranges from 1.7%-5% across ERCOT. We also find significant seasonal and regional variability in the IAV of wind and solar generation, highlighting the importance of considering multiple temporal and spatial scales when planning and operating the power system. In addition, the IAV of the current wind and solar fleets' capacity values (defined as generation during peak load hours) are larger than the IAV of the same fleets' capacity factors. IAV of annual generation and capacity values of wind and solar could impact operations and planning in several ways, e.g. through annual emissions, meeting emission reduction targets, and investment needs to maintain capacity adequacy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Previous data denial studies found a significant improvement of up to 6% RMSE reduction for short-term wind power forecasts due to the assimilation of all of these observations into the NOAA Rapid Refresh (RAP) forecast model using a 3dvar GSI data assimilation scheme. As a follow-on study, we now investigate the impacts of assimilating into the RAP model either the additional remote sensing observations (sodars and wind profiling radars) alone, or assimilating the industry provided in situ observations (tall towers and nacelle anemometers) alone, in addition to the standard meteorological data sets that are routinely available. The more numerous tall tower/nacelle observations provide a relatively large improvement through the first 3-4 hours of the forecasts, which however decays to a negligible impact by forecast hour 6. In comparison the less numerous vertical profiling sodars/radars provide an initially smaller impact that decays at a much slower rate, with a positive impact present through the first 12 hours of the forecast. Large positive assimilation impacts for both sets of instruments are found during daytime hours, while small or even negative impacts are found during nighttime hours.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Optimizing wind farm siting to reduce power system impacts of wind variability","Musselman, Amelia; Thomas, Valerie M.; Boland, Natashia; Nazzal, Dima","17 WIND ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; multiobjective optimization; siting variability reduction","We introduce and solve two variants of a biobjective optimization model to reduce the negative impact of wind variability on the power system by strategically locating wind farms. The first model variant considers average changes in wind power over time; the second captures extreme fluctuations in wind power. A complementary set of wind sites is selected with the aim of minimizing both residual demand and the variability in residual demand. Because exact optimization is computationally intensive, we develop two heuristics—forward and backward greedy algorithms—to find approximate solutions. The results are compared with the exact optimization results for a well-selected subset of the data as well as to the results from selecting sites based on average wind alone. The two models are solved using demand data and potential wind sites for the Southwest Power Pool. Though both objectives can be improved by adding more sites, for a fixed number of sites, minimizing residual demand and variability in residual demand are competing objectives. Here, we find an approximate efficient frontier to compare trade-offs between the two objectives. We also vary the parameter in the heuristic that controls how the two objectives are prioritized. For the case study, the backward greedy algorithm is more effective at reducing the wind power variability than the forward greedy algorithm. Furthermore, using the backward algorithm for the full dataset is more effective than solving the exact optimization on a subset of the data when the results are evaluated using the full dataset.","Wiley","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A controller developed for a bottom-fixed wind turbine configuration was modified for use when the turbine is mounted on the WindFloat platform. This results in an efficient platform heel resonance mitigation scheme. In addition, several control modules, designed with a coupled linear model, were added to the fixed-bottom baseline controller.

Thermodynamic and transport properties are obtained through a table look-up procedure with specialized features for subcritical conditions. Phase change is triggered by the difference between the local values of pressure and saturation pressure, and both vaporization and condensation can be modeled. Rigorous validation of the framework is presented for condensation in high pressure CO<sub>2</sub> using test data in a De Laval nozzle. The comparisons between computations and test data include: condensation onset locations, Wilson line, and nozzle pressure profiles as a function of inlet pressures. The framework is applied to the Sandia compressor that has been modeled over broad range of conditions spanning the saturation dome including: near critical inlet conditions (305.4 K, and 7.843 MPa), pure liquid inlet conditions (at 295 K), pure vapor inlet conditions (at 302 K), and two-phase inlet conditions (at 290 K). Multiphase effects ranging from cavitation at the liquid line to condensation at the vapor line have been simulated. Here, the role of real fluid effects in enhancing multiphase effects at elevated temperatures closer to the critical point has been identified. The performance of the compressor has been compared with test data; the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results also show that the head-flow coefficient curve collapses with relatively minor scatter, similar to the test data, when the flow coefficient is defined on the impeller exit meridional velocity.","ASME","","Combustion Research and Flow Technology Inc., Huntsville, AL (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Engineering & Technology.

M.","17 WIND ENERGY; atmosphere; mesoscale forecasting; numerical weather prediction/forecasting; parameterization; renewable energy; wind effects","Wind power installations have been increasing in recent years. Because wind turbines can influence local wind speeds, temperatures, and surface fluxes, weather forecasting models should consider their effects. Wind farm parameterizations do currently exist for numerical weather prediction models. They generally consider two turbine impacts: elevated drag in the region of the wind turbine rotor disk and increased turbulent kinetic energy production. The wind farm parameterization available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model calculates this drag and TKE as a function of hub-height wind speed. However, recent work has suggested that integrating momentum over the entire rotor disk [via a rotor-equivalent wind speed (REWS)] is more appropriate, especially for cases with high wind shear. In this study, we implement the REWS in the WRF wind farm parameterization and evaluate its impacts in an idealized environment, with varying amounts of wind speed shear and wind directional veer. Specifically, we evaluate three separate cases: neutral stability with low wind shear, high stability with high wind shear, and high stability with nonlinear wind shear. For most situations, use of the REWS with the wind farm parameterization has marginal impacts on model forecasts. However, for scenarios with highly nonlinear wind shear, the REWS can significantly affect results.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The curled wake has drawn a lot of interest because of its aerodynamic complexity and applicability to wind farm controls. The main mechanism for the creation of the curled wake has been identified in the literature as a collection of vortices that are shed from the rotor plane when the turbine is yawed. This work extends that idea by using aerodynamic concepts to develop a control-oriented model for the curled wake based on approximations to the Navier–Stokes equations. The model is tested and compared to time-averaged results from large-eddy simulations using actuator disk and line models. The model is able to capture the curling mechanism fora turbine under uniform inflow and in the case of a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. As a result, the model is then incorporated to the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS)framework and provides good agreement with power predictions for cases with two and three turbines in a row.</p></p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Characterization of flow recirculation zones at the Perdigão site using multi-lidar measurements","Menke, Robert; Vasiljević, Nikola; Mann, Jakob; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Because flow recirculation can generate significant amounts of turbulence, it can impact the success of wind energy projects. This study uses unique Doppler lidar observations to quantify occurrences of flow recirculation on lee sides of ridges. An extensive dataset of observations of flow over complex terrain is available from the Perdigão 2017 field campaign over a period of 3 months. The campaign site was selected because of the unique terrain feature of two nearly parallel ridges with a valley-to-ridge-top height difference of about 200 m and a ridge-to-ridge distance of 1.4 km. Six scanning Doppler lidars probed the flow field in several vertical planes orthogonal to the ridges using range–height indicator scans. With this lidar setup, we achieved vertical scans of the recirculation zone at three positions along two parallel ridges. We construct a method to identify flow recirculation zones in the scans, as well as define characteristics of these zones. According to our data analysis, flow recirculation, with reverse flow wind speeds greater than 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup>, occurs over 50 % of the time when the wind direction is perpendicular to the direction of the ridges. Atmospheric conditions, such as atmospheric stability and wind speed, affect the occurrence of flow recirculation. Flow recirculation occurs more frequently during periods with wind speeds above 8 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Recirculation within the valley affects the mean wind and turbulence fields at turbine heights on the downwind ridge in magnitudes significant for wind resource assessment.","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As power systems increasingly shift towards wind and solar power, these resource changes will increasingly impact power system operations. We assess how power system operations will be affected by climate change impacts on wind and solar resources by generating wind and solar generation profiles for a reference period and five climate change projections. We then run a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to dispatch a high-renewable generator fleet with these profiles. For climate change projections, we use 2041–2050 output from five global climate models (GCMs) for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for Texas, our study system. All five GCMs indicate increased wind generation potential by 1%–4% under climate change in Texas, while three and two GCMs indicate increased and decreased solar generation potential, respectively, by up to 1%. Uneven generation potential changes across time result in greater changes in dispatched generation by fuel type. Notably, nuclear generation decreases across GCMs by up to 7%, largely in low-demand (winter) months when nuclear plants, which have a high minimum stable load, must reduce their generation to avoid overgeneration. Increased wind and/or solar generation result in reduced system CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and electricity production costs across four of the five GCMs by 8–16 million tons and $216–516 million, or by 2% and 1%, respectively.

"Design and Analysis of a Wake Steering Controller with Wind Direction Variability","Simley, Eric J; Fleming, Paul A; King, Jennifer R","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind farm control; wake steering; robust control; wind direction uncertainty","Wind farm control strategies are being developed to mitigate wake losses in wind farms, increasing energy production. Wake steering is a type of wind farm control in which a wind turbine's yaw position is misaligned from the wind direction, causing its wake to deflect away from downstream turbines. Current modeling tools used to optimize and estimate energy gains from wake steering are designed to represent wakes for fixed wind directions. However, wake steering controllers must operate in dynamic wind conditions and a turbine's yaw position cannot perfectly track changing wind directions. Research has been conducted on robust wake steering control optimized for variable wind directions. In this paper, the design and analysis of a wake steering controller with wind direction variability is presented for a two-turbine array using the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State (FLORIS) control-oriented wake model. First, the authors propose a method for modeling the turbulent and low-frequency components of the wind direction, where the slowly varying wind direction serves as the relevant input to the wake model. Next, we explain a procedure for finding optimal yaw offsets for dynamic wind conditions considering both wind direction and yaw position uncertainty. We then performed simulations with the optimal yaw offsets applied using a realistic yaw offset controller in conjunction with a baseline yaw controller, showing good agreement with the predicted energy gain using the probabilistic model. Using the Gaussian wake model in FLORIS as an example, we compared the performance of yaw offset controllers optimized for static and dynamic wind conditions for different turbine spacings and turbulence intensity values. For a spacing of 5 rotor diameters and a turbulence intensity of 10%, robust yaw offsets optimized for variable wind directions yielded an energy gain improvement of 128%. In general, accounting for wind direction variability in the yaw offset optimization process was found to improve energy production more as the separation distance increased, whereas the relative improvement remained roughly the same for the range of turbulence intensity values considered.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this work, simulation and analysis of a frontal passage through a utility scale wind farm is achieved for the first time using a seamless multi-scale modeling approach. A generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine model is used to represent turbine wakes, and results are compared to novel radar observations during the frontal passage. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is employed with a nested grid setup that allows for coupling between multi-scale atmospheric conditions and turbine response. Starting with mesoscale forcing, the atmosphere is dynamically downscaled to the region of interest, where the interaction between turbulent flows and individual wind turbines is simulated with the GAD at10 m resolution. Several improvements are made to the GAD model to mimic realistic turbine operation, including a yawing capability and a power output calculation. Ultimately, the model is able to capture both the dynamics of the frontal passage and the turbine response; predictions show good agreement with observed turbine wake structure, velocity deficit, and power output after accounting for a phase shift in the mesoscale forcing. This study demonstrates the utility of the WRF-GAD framework for simulating wind farm performance under complex atmospheric conditions.","IOP Publishing","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Optimization of turbine design in wind farms with multiple hub heights, using exact analytic gradients and structural constraints","Stanley, Andrew P. J.; Ning, Andrew; Dykes, Katherine","17 WIND ENERGY; analytic gradients; different hub heights; FLORIS wake model; gradient-based optimization; structural constraints; tower sizing","Wind farms are generally designed with turbines of all the same hub height. If wind farms were designed with turbines of different hub heights, wake interference between turbines could be reduced, lowering the cost of energy (COE). This paper demonstrates a method to optimize onshore wind farms with two different hub heights using exact, analytic gradients. Gradient-based optimization with exact gradients scales well with large problems and is preferable in this application over gradient-free methods. Our model consisted of the following: a version of the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-State wake model that accommodated three-dimensional wakes and calculated annual energy production, a wind farm cost model, and a tower structural model, which provided constraints during optimization. Structural constraints were important to keep tower heights realistic and account for additional mass required from taller towers and higher wind speeds. We optimized several wind farms with tower height, diameter, and shell thickness as coupled design variables. Our results indicate that wind farms with small rotors, low wind shear, and closely spaced turbines can benefit from having two different hub heights. A nine-by-nine grid wind farm with 70-meter rotor diameters and a wind shear exponent of 0.08 realized a 4.9% reduction in COE by using two different tower sizes. If the turbine spacing was reduced to 3 diameters, the reduction in COE decreased further to 11.2%. Allowing for more than two different turbine heights is only slightly more beneficial than two heights and is likely not worth the added complexity.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Filtered lifting line theory and application to the actuator line model","Martínez-Tossas, Luis A.; Meneveau, Charles","17 WIND ENERGY; actuator line model; wind energy; computational fluid dynamics; large-eddy simulation; drag","Lifting line theory describes the cumulative effect of shed vorticity from finite span lifting surfaces. In this work, the theory is reformulated to improve the accuracy of the actuator line model (ALM). This model is a computational tool used to represent lifting surfaces, such as wind-turbine blades in computational fluid dynamics. In ALM, blade segments are represented by means of a Gaussian body force distribution with a prescribed kernel size. Prior analysis has shown that a representation of the blade using an optimal kernel width<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic href='S0022112018009941_inline1' mime-subtype='gif' type='simple'/><tex-math>$\unicode[STIX]{x1D716}^{opt}$</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>of approximately one quarter of the chord size results in accurate predictions of the velocity field and loads along the blades. Also, simulations have shown that use of the optimal kernel size yields accurate representation of the tip-vortex size and the associated downwash resulting in accurate predictions of the tip losses. In this work, we address the issue of how to represent the effects of finite span wings and tip vortices when using Gaussian body forces with a kernel size larger than the optimal value. This question is relevant in the context of coarse-scale large-eddy simulations that cannot afford the fine resolutions required to resolve the optimal kernel size. For this purpose, we present a filtered lifting line theory for a Gaussian force distribution. Based on the streamwise component of the vorticity transport equation, we develop an analytical model for the induced velocity resulting from the spanwise changes in lift force for an arbitrary kernel scale. The results are used to derive a subfilter-scale velocity model that is used to correct the velocity along the blade when using kernel sizes larger than<inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic href='S0022112018009941_inline2' mime-subtype='gif' type='simple'/><tex-math>$\unicode[STIX]{x1D716}^{opt}$</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>. Tests are performed in large-eddy simulation of flow over fixed wings with constant and elliptic chord distributions using various kernel sizes. Results show that by using the proposed subfilter velocity model, kernel-size independent predictions of lift coefficient and total lift forces agree with those obtained with the optimal kernel size.","Cambridge University Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Turbulence kinetic energy budget and conditional sampling of momentum, scalar, and intermittency fluxes in thermally stratified wind farms","Ali, Naseem; Hamilton, Nicholas; Calaf, Marc; Cal, Raúl Bayoán","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric turbulence; wind energy; large eddy simulation; passive scalar turbulence","A description of the turbulence kinetic energy budget is investigated to understand the dynamics and turbulence energy transfer between the atmospheric boundary layer and large wind farms. The turbulence kinetic energy budget terms are a dominant factor in explaining the energy supply process in wind farms. Large eddy simulations are used to generate the thermally stratified wind turbine array boundary layer, where stable and unstable conditions are considered. The wakes represent a sink of mean kinetic energy, and turbulence transport redistributes energy in the wake region. The energy balance between the budget terms is dependent on the physical location in the wind farm. During the unstable scenario, turbulence is driven by the production, transport, and buoyancy terms. Further, the contribution of the turbulence kinetic energy budget terms is reduced with increasing atmospheric stability, especially above the shear layer, where the mechanical production is the dominant term. Pressure diffusion redistributes the turbulent energy from the streamwise direction into the other components of the normal Reynolds stresses. This distinctive feature of the changing thermal stratification is presented through the quadrant analysis. The momentum ejection and sweep frequencies are both comparable and dominant. The scalar flux shows an increase in the contribution of the negative correlation in the quadrants. The quadrant analysis is extended to account for intermittency based on the pointwise Holder exponents. As a result, positive correlations are dominant in the wake and in higher layers of the domain for both considered cases.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Effects of Inflow Spatiotemporal Discretization on Wake Meandering and Turbine Structural Response using FAST.Farm","Shaler, K.; Jonkman, J.; Hamilton, N.","17 WIND ENERGY; FAST; wind; wind power; wake meandering; dynamic wake meandering (DWM)","FAST.Farm is a newly developed multiphysics, midfidelity engineering tool that can be used to predict turbine power and structural loads of wind turbines in a wind farm with minimal computational expense. Previous studies have shown similarities and differences in wind turbine performance between FAST.Farm and high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) using both LES precursor-generated inflow and TurbSim-generated synthetic inflow. While conservative resolutions have been used to date, no formal spatial or temporal discretization study has been performed for the FAST.Farm model wind domains. This work aims to study the effects of varying the spatial and temporal discretization of the wind domains on wake meandering (low-resolution domain) and turbine structural response (high-resolution domains) and resulting wake and load calculations. The purpose of this study is to establish convergence criteria and recommendations for discretization values in terms of rotor diameter (D, expressed in meters) that will maximize computational efficiency. To ensure a percent error of ≤ 1% in standard deviation of wake center position relative to the finest included resolution, a low-resolution time step of 0.024D s, 0.016D s, and 0.0079D s and a low-resolution spatial discretization of 0.079D m, 0.16D m, and 0.24D m is recommended for 8 m/s, 12 m/s, and 18 m/s mean ambient wind speed at hub height, respectively. These guidelines are likely applicable to other implementations of the dynamic wake meandering model. To ensure a percent error of ≤ 1% in standard deviation of all considered structural response outputs, a high-resolution time step that captures the highest influential excitation and natural frequencies in the system and a high-resolution spatial discretization comparable to the maximum airfoil cord length is recommended. Lastly, these guidelines are likely applicable to any aeroelastic analysis.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A significant improvement in planetary bearing load sharing was demonstrated in the gearbox with preloaded tapered roller bearings with maximum loads 20<span class=""thinspace""></span>% lower than the gearbox with cylindrical roller bearings. Bearing life was calculated with a representative duty cycle measured from field tests. The predicted fatigue life of the eight combined planet and carrier bearings for the gearbox with preloaded tapered roller bearings is 3.5 times greater than for the gearbox with cylindrical roller bearings. The influence of other factors, such as carrier and planet bearing clearance, gravity, and tangential pin position error, is also investigated. The combined effect of gravity and carrier bearing clearance was primarily responsible for unequal load sharing. Reducing carrier bearing clearance significantly improved load sharing, while reducing planet clearance did not. Normal tangential pin position error did not impact load sharing due to the floating sun design of this three-planet gearbox.</p></p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, this close proximity can undermine power production in downwind wind farms due to wakes from upwind wind farms. Therefore, the wind energy industry has great interest in determining the spatial dimensions of offshore wind farm wakes to assess the economical potential of planned wind farms. In this work we use wake measurements conducted by a research aircraft to evaluate the performance of a wind farm parameterization (WFP) in a mesoscale model during stably-stratified atmospheric conditions, in which the wake is expected to be the strongest. The observations were conducted on the 10 September 2016 within the project WIPAFF (Wind PArk Far Field) at the North Sea. The observations allow evaluation of both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of the wake. The model simulates the length and most of the time the spatial dimensions of the wake. Further, we show that the largest potential for improving the performance of the WFP is rooted in an improvement of the background flow. This is due to the fact that the mesoscale model has problems representing the atmospheric boundary layer in the transition between land to open sea.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The occurrence of soil liquefaction during an earthquake can result in severe failures of the offshore wind turbine. The seismic response of the structure and the failure mechanism of the soil-structure interactions are necessary to investigate. In this study, the seismic response of an innovative hybrid monopile foundation is investigated through a series of centrifuge tests. The seismic performance of the combined system of the superstructure, foundation, and soil are demonstrated. Five hybrid foundation models are tested by considering the influence of the foundation thicknesses and diameters, and a monopile foundation is tested for comparison. Centrifuge test results reveal that the hybrid monopile foundation is effective in reducing the lateral displacement during the shaking. In the saturated condition, soil maintains its strength and stiffness beneath and adjacent to the foundation. The hybrid foundation system tends to settle more due to the larger shear stress caused by the soil structure interactions. Influences of the wheel specifications are illustrated. The foundations with larger thicknesses lead to smaller lateral displacements and lower tendencies of liquefaction, but the settlements are intensified. The larger diameter foundation provides a longer drainage path for the excess pore water pressure. With a similar weight, the structure settles less during the earthquake.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-11-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 235; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1335-1350","","","EE0006714; DE‐EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261918317641","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.057","","2022-04-25T00:00:00Z","1613382","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613382","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613382","Applied Energy","C","235"

Here we use a diverse set of analysis tools from the atmospheric science, economic and legal communities to assess costs and consequences of these wake effects, focusing on a West Texas case study. We show that although wake effects vary with atmospheric conditions, they are discernible in monthly power production. In stably stratified atmospheric conditions, wakes can extend 50+ km downwind, resulting in economic losses of several million dollars over six years for our case study.

In the field of wind power forecasting, in particular, there has been substantial research into finding the best-performing learning algorithms that improve model predictions. Overlooked in the literature, however, is the influence of atmospheric turbulence and stability measurements in improving model predictions. It has been well-established through observations and physical models that these effects can have considerable influence on wind farm power production; yet consideration of these effects in statistical models is almost entirely absent from the literature. In this work, we examine the impact of atmospheric turbulence and stability inputs on statistical model predictions of wind farm power output. Hourly observations from a wind farm in the Pacific Northwest United States located in very complex terrain are used. Five common learning algorithms and nine atmospheric variables are considered, five of which represent some measure of turbulence or stability. Here, we find a considerable improvement in hourly power predictions when some measure of turbulence or stability is included in the model. In particular, turbulent kinetic energy was found to be the most important variable apart from wind speed and more important than wind direction, pressure, and temperature. By contrast, the choice of learning algorithm is shown to be relatively less important in improving predictions. Based on this work, we recommend that turbulence and stability variables become standard inputs into statistical models of wind farm power production.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Energy production by wind power plants depends directly on the wind conditions in a particular location and is stochastic in character. Increasing the fraction of these installations in the overall balance of a system also requires an increase in the power reserve capacity. Here the time a power system remains in the power deficit zone is estimated as a function of the fraction of wind power plants in the system structure. Two approaches to the placement of wind power units within a power system are compared– individual components and a system of a set of components.

"The Effect of Wind Direction Shear on Turbine Performance in a Wind Farm in Central Iowa","Gomez, Miguel Sanchez; Lundquist, Julie","17 WIND ENERGY; wind direction; wind shear; wind turbines","Numerous studies have shown that atmospheric conditions affect wind turbine performance, however, some findings have exposed conflicting results for different locations and diverse analysis methodologies. In this study, we explore how the change in wind direction with height (direction wind shear), a site-differing factor between conflicting studies, affects wind turbine performance. We utilized lidar and turbine data collected from the 2013 Crop Wind Energy eXperiment (CWEX) project between June and September in a wind farm in north-central Iowa. Directional wind shear was found to follow a diurnal cycle and to monotonically decrease with increasing wind speeds. Using different thresholds to distinguish between high- and low-directional wind shear scenarios, we found that larger thresholds evidence statistically-significant effects on turbine power production for lower wind speeds. We further analyzed a threshold of 0.225 deg m-1 and found turbine underperformance in the order of 10% for wind speed regimes below 8 m s-1. Considering a time period of ramping electricity demand (05:30-09:00LT) exposed the fact that large direction shear occurs during this time and is undermining turbine performance by more than 10%. A predominance of clockwise direction shear (wind veering) cases compared to counterclockwise (wind backing) was also observed throughout the campaign. Moreover, large veering was found to have greater detrimental effects on turbine performance compared to small backing values. This study shows that changes in wind direction with height should be considered when analyzing turbine performance, however, future work on segregating speed and direction shear should be pursued to quantify the effects of only one factor on turbine power production.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, we estimate turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate using multiple techniques, including traditional in-situ measurements of sonic anemometers on meteorological towers, a hot-wire anemometer on a tethered lifting system (TLS), as well as remote-sensing retrievals from a vertically staring lidar and two lidars performing range-height indicator (RHI) scans. For the retrieval of e from the lidar RHI scans, we introduce a modification of the Doppler Spectral Width (DSW) method. This method uses spatio-temporal averages of the variance of the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity and the turbulent broadening of the Doppler backscatter spectrum. We validate this method against the observations from the other instruments, also including uncertainty estimations for each method. The synthesis of the results from all instruments enables a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of e across a valley between two parallel ridges at the Perdigao 2017 campaign. We find that the shear zones above and below nighttime low-level jets (LLJ) experience turbulence enhancements, as does the wake of a wind turbine (WT). We analyze in detail how e varies in the early morning of 14 June 2017, when the turbulence in the valley, approximately eleven rotor diameters downstream of the WT, is still significantly enhanced by the WT wake.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

(ORCID:0000000154902702)","17 WIND ENERGY; inter-annual variability; statistics; uncertainty quantification; variability; wind resource assessment","<p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Because wind resources vary from year to year, the intermonthly and interannual variability (IAV) of wind speed is a key component of the overall uncertainty in the wind resource assessment process, thereby creating challenges for wind farm operators and owners. We present a critical assessment of several common approaches for calculating variability by applying each of the methods to the same 37-year monthly wind-speed and energy-production time series to highlight the differences between these methods. We then assess the accuracy of the variability calculations by correlating the wind-speed variability estimates to the variabilities of actual wind farm energy production. We recommend the robust coefficient of variation (RCoV) for systematically estimating variability, and we underscore its advantages as well as the importance of using a statistically robust and resistant method. Using normalized spread metrics, including RCoV, high variability of monthly mean wind speeds at a location effectively denotes strong fluctuations of monthly total energy generation, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the wind-speed IAVs computed with annual-mean data fail to adequately represent energy-production IAVs of wind farms. Lastly, we find that estimates of energy-generation variability require 10 ± 3 years of monthly mean wind-speed records to achieve a 90<span class=""thinspace""></span>% statistical confidence.

"Recycling Glass Fiber Thermoplastic Composites from Wind Turbine Blades","Cousins, Dylan S.; Suzuki, Yasuhito; Murray, Robynne E.; Samaniuk, Joseph R.; Stebner, Aaron P.","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; thermoplastic; recycling; composite; wind turbine blade; dissolution","We report that thermoplastic resin systems have long been discussed for use in large-scale composite parts but have yet to be exploited by the energy industry. The use of these resins versus their thermosetting counterparts can potentially introduce cost savings due to non-heated tooling, shorter manufacturing cycle times, and recovery of raw materials from the retired part. Because composite parts have high embedded energy, recovery of their constituent materials can provide substantial economic benefit. This study determines the feasibility of recycling composite wind turbine blade components that are fabricated with glass fiber reinforced Elium (R) thermoplastic resin. Several experiments are conducted to tabulate important material properties that are relevant to recycling, including thermal degradation, grinding, and dissolution of the polymer matrix to recover the constituent materials. Dissolution, which is a process unique to thermoplastic matrices, allows recovery of both the polymer matrix and full-length glass fibers, which maintain their stiffness (190 N/(mm g)) and strength (160 N/g) through the recovery process. Injection molded regrind material is stiffer (12 GPa compared to 10 GPa) and stronger (150 MPa compared to 84 MPa) than virgin material that had shorter fibers. An economic analysis of the technical data shows that recycling thermoplastic-glass fiber composites via dissolution into their constituent parts is commercially feasible under certain conditions. This analysis concludes that 50% of the glass fiber must be recovered and resold for a price of $0.28/kg. Furthermore, 90% of the resin must be recovered and resold at a price of $2.50/kg.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The hurricane wind fields, which result from a Large Eddy Simulation of a hurricane, exhibit features such as very high gust factors (> 1.7), rapid direction changes (30 degrees in 30 sec) and substantial veer. Wind fields including these features have not previously been used in an analysis of a wind turbine and their effect on structural loads may be an important driver of enhanced design considerations. With a focus on blade root loads and tower base loads, the simulations show that these features of hurricane wind fields can lead to loads that are substantially in excess of those that would be predicted were wind fields with equally high mean wind speeds but without associated direction change and veer used in the analysis. This result, if further verified for a range of hurricane and tropical storm simulations, should provide an impetus for revisiting design standards.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This combined optical system concentrates sunlight and converts it into thermal energy. The design of a receiver assembly is critical to the performance of a linear Fresnel collector. A position deviation of a few centimeters for the receiver assembly can result in notably reduced performance, thus leading to a direct loss in revenue associated with thermal power production. Wind load is one of the most significant environmental factors that can alter the optical - and therefore thermal - performance of a solar power system due to displacements after installation. At the same time, an over-designed receiver assembly may add unnecessary construction cost to a typically high-cost-constrained system. Thus, wind load analysis is particularly important when considering optimal engineering design of a receiver assembly and its supporting structure to cost-effectively mitigate the impacts of wind. In this study, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is adopted to derive the wind load of a commercial linear Fresnel receiver assembly. This wind load is then used as a reference to optimize the detailed engineering design. The CFD model is first carefully developed and benchmarked within a critical regime toward turbulence. The drag force, lift force, and vortex-shedding frequencies are derived at both the operating and survival wind-speed limits for target project deployment locations. The wind load analysis results provide a valuable reference for future engineering design and prototyping.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Load response of a floating wind turbine to turbulent atmospheric flow","Doubrawa, Paula; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Godvik, Marte; Sirnivas, Senu","17 WIND ENERGY; turbulence; coherence; loads; offshore; wind; stability","The two turbulence-generation models [Kaimal Spectrum Exponential Coherence (KSEC) and Mann] specified in the international standard for wind turbine design assume neutral atmospheric conditions and are based on statistical and spectral methods. Mainly due to the lack of physics, the flow fields simulated with these models ultimately differ in their underlying structure, especially in terms of the spatial coherence of longitudinal velocity perturbations. While this may not be critical for smaller wind turbine rotors, it becomes important when rotor sizes increase. Furthermore, it might be especially important in the context of floating technologies as they are more sensitive to large turbulent coherent structures. Previous work found that these differences between KSEC and Mann can propagate to loads predictions and thereby affect the design space of the entire wind turbine system. It is therefore crucial to determine in which ways these two models are underperforming. Up until now, validation of these models had only been done in the vertical direction because it is extremely difficult to obtain atmospheric turbulence measurements separated laterally, and sampled at heights relevant to wind energy. In this work, we address the lack of measurements by using high-fidelity, high-resolution simulation data as a reference. We perform hour-long, large-eddy simulations of turbulent velocity fields that are stability-dependent and contain three-dimensional coherent structures. These flow fields are then used to investigate which stochastic model is a better predictor of loads on a realistic spar-system floating offshore wind turbine, and to quantify how the assumption of neutral stratification propagates to short-term load estimates. Both stochastic turbulence models are found to overpredict fatigue loading in high-wind scenarios (in some cases, by more than 25%) and underpredict it when the wind speed is low (by as much as 20%). The KSEC model matches the high-fidelity flow fields more closely than Mann at high wind speeds, and the opposite is true at low wind speeds. Finally, turbine loading is found to be sensitive to atmospheric stability even when the turbulence intensity remains fairly constant. This sensitivity is most pronounced at low wind speeds, when fatigue load estimates on the spar system can differ by 40%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Fusion joining of thermoplastic composite wind turbine blades: Lap-shear bond characterization","Murray, Robynne E.; Roadman, Jason; Beach, Ryan","17 WIND ENERGY; fusion joining; thermoplastic resin; lap-shear strength; composite; wind turbine blade","Wind turbine blades are typically manufactured from a small number of components which are bonded together with an adhesive. Over the life span of a wind turbine, the static and fatigue loads in varying environmental conditions can lead to cracking and/or debonding of the adhesive joints, ultimately leading to blade structural collapse. The objective of this work is to investigate fusion joining of wind turbine blades manufactured using thermoplastic resin. Thermoplastic resins for wind turbine blades can reduce cycle times and energy consumption during manufacturing and facilitate end-of-life recycling and on-site manufacturing. Additionally, fusion joining of these materials can replace adhesives, resulting in stronger and more robust blades. This work showed that, compared to typical adhesives used in wind turbine blades, fusion welding resulted in an increase in both the static and fatigue lap-shear strength as compared to bonded thermoplastic composite coupons. This initial coupon-scale research suggests that there is potential for developing fusion welding techniques for full-scale wind turbine blades.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind energy variability and links to regional and synoptic scale weather","Millstein, Dev; Solomon-Culp, Joshua; Wang, Meina; Ullrich, Paul; Collier, Craig","58 GEOSCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; Wind resource inter-annual variability; Regional climate","The accurate characterization of seasonal and inter-annual site-level wind energy variability is essential during wind project development. Understanding the features and probability of low-wind years is of particular interest to developers and financers. However, a dearth of long-term, hub-height wind observations makes these characterizations challenging, and thus techniques to improve these characterizations are of great value. To improve resource characterization, we explicitly link wind resource variability (at hub-height, and at specific sites) to regional and synoptic scale wind regimes. Our approach involves statistical clustering of high-resolution modeled wind data, and is applied to California for a period covering 1980–2015. With this approach, we investigate the unique meteorological patterns driving low and high wind years at five separate wind project sites. We also find wind regime changes over the 36-year period consistent with global warming: wind regimes associated with anomalously hot summer days increased at half a day per year and stagnant conditions increased at one-third days per year. Despite these changes, the average annual resource potential remained constant at all project sites. Additionally, we identify correlations between climate modes and wind regime frequency, a linkage valuable for resource characterization and forecasting. Our general approach can be applied in any location and may benefit many aspects of wind energy resource evaluation and forecasting.","Springer-Verlag","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Modelling wind power spatial-temporal correlation in multi-interval optimal power flow: A sparse correlation matrix approach","Fang, Xin; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Du, Ershun; Zhang, Ning; Li, Fangxing","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electricity market; economic dispatch; spatial-temporal correlation; adjustable and distributional robustness; chance constrained optimal power flow","The significantly increasing deployment of wind power necessitates that system operation considers the spatial-temporal correlation of power forecast from different wind power plants. How to model this spatial-temporal correlation in the actual system dispatch is challenging. In this paper, a sparse correlation matrix is utilized to efficiently model the spatial-temporal correlation of wind power forecast in the generation dispatch model. A novel, adjustable, and distributionally-robust chance-constrained multi-interval optimal power flow (ADRCC-MIOPF) model is proposed to obtain reliable economic dispatch (ED) solutions. The spatial-temporal correlation of wind power plants power forecasts is represented by the sparse correlation covariance matrix obtained from historical, time series wind power forecast error data. The chance constraints in the ADRCC-MIOPF model are transformed into a set of second-order-cone (SOC) constraints in which an adjustable coefficient in the chance constraints controls the robustness of the ADRCC-MIOPF model to the wind power forecast errors distribution. Case studies performed on the PJM 5-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the proposed method to improve the system security and reduce the cost especially under the high wind penetration levels. All the cases can be solved within several minutes for both the small and large cases which validates the efficiency of the proposed sparse matrix model. In addition, considering the spatial-temporal correlation of wind power forecast and the distributional robustness of wind power forecast error leads to a more reliable economic dispatch with lower system violations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We model DR in an Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) framework with high levels of wind penetration. Investment, exit and operational decisions are optimized simultaneously. We examine the potential for DR to participate in both energy and reserve markets. DR participation in the energy market reduces costs and prices and gives rise to lower equilibrium levels of investment in conventional generation. DR and wind generation are strongly complementary, due to the ability of DR to mitigate against the variability of wind generation, with the highest reduction of consumer costs seen at high levels of wind penetration. The total impact of DR is highly dependent on specific system characteristics.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The OC5 project revealed a general underprediction of loads and motions by the participating numerical models. This paper discusses several model calibration studies that were conducted to identify potential model parameter adjustments that help to improve the agreement between the numerical simulations and the experimental test data. These calibration studies cover wind-field-specific parameters (coherence, turbulence), and hydrodynamic and aerodynamic modeling approaches, as well as rotor model (blade-pitch and blade-mass imbalances) and tower model (structural tower damping coefficient) adjustments. These calibration studies were conducted based on relatively simple calibration load cases (wave only/wind only). The agreement between the final FAST model and experimental measurements is then assessed based on more complex combined wind and wave validation cases. The analysis presented in this paper does not claim to be an exhaustive parameter identification study but is aimed at describing the qualitative impact of different model parameters on the system response. This work should help to provide guidance for future systematic parameter identification and uncertainty quantification efforts.","SPE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An anomaly detection framework for dynamic systems using a Bayesian hierarchical framework","Moghaddass, Ramin; Sheng, Shuangwen","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; anomaly detection; wind turbine; dynamic systems; sensor-intensive energy; systems; Bayesian modeling","Complex systems are susceptible to many types of anomalies, faults, and abnormal behavior caused by a variety of off-nominal conditions that may ultimately result in major failures or catastrophic events. Early and accurate detection of these anomalies using system inputs and outputs collected from sensors and smart devices has become a challenging problem and an active area of research in many application domains. In this article, we present a new Bayesian hierarchical framework that is able to model the relationship between system inputs (sensor measurements) and outputs (response variables) without imposing strong distributional/parametric assumptions while using only a subset of training samples and sensor attributes. Then, an optimal cost-sensitive anomaly detection framework is proposed to determine whether a sample is an anomalous one taking into consideration the trade-off between misclassification errors and detection rates. The model can be used for both supervised and unsupervised settings depending on the availability of data regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. The unsupervised model is particularly useful when it is prohibitive to identify in advance the anomalies that a system may present and where no data are available regarding the behavior of the system under anomaly conditions. A Bayesian hierarchical setting is used to structure the proposed framework and help with accommodating uncertainty, imposing interpretability, and controlling the sparsity and complexity of the proposed anomaly detection framework. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is also developed for model training using past data. Furthermore, the numerical experiments conducted using a simulated data set and a wind turbine data set demonstrate the successful application of the proposed work for system response modeling and anomaly detection.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Decentralized wind uncertainty management: Alternating direction method of multipliers based distributionally-robust chance constrained optimal power flow","Fang, Xin; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Jiang, Huaiguang; Zhang, Yingchen","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; economic dispatch; correlation; wind power uncertainty; alternating direction method of multiplier; ADMM; distributionally robust chance constrained optimal power flow; DRCC-OPF","How to manage wind power uncertainty in system operation is an urgent and important issue, especially under substantially increasing penetration levels of wind generation in electric power systems. With increasing numbers of wind power plants (WPPs) integrated into power systems, their variability and uncertain power outputs become a challenge to maintaining system reliability. Traditional stochastic optimization-based models face the curse of dimensionality when the number of WPPs increases. This paper proposes a novel decentralized wind power uncertainty management model. In this model, conventional generators optimize their power capacity output and their participation to mitigate wind power uncertainty locally with only limited information exchange with the system operators. First, a distributionally-robust chance-constrained optimal power flow (DRCC-OPF) model is deployed to schedule the generation and reserve considering the wind power forecast uncertainty. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to reformulate the DRCC-OPF model into the distributed optimization model for each conventional generator and WPP. The tests on a small PJM 5-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that the proposed decentralized model can increase the operation reliability without sacrificing system operating cost, especially when the wind power penetration levels are high. Using the proposed model, the optimal solutions can be obtained within one minute, for all studied cases, which verifies the computation efficiency of the proposed decentralized model. Furthermore, considering a large number of WPPs integrated into the system, the proposed decentralized method obtains a lower operating cost within one minute which demonstrates its efficiency to deal with high dimension of uncertainties.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The curled wake has drawn a lot of interest because of its aerodynamic complexity and applicability to wind farm controls. The main mechanism for the creation of the curled wake has been identified in the literature as a collection of vortices that are shed from the rotor plane when the turbine is yawed. This work extends that idea by using aerodynamic concepts to develop a control-oriented model for the curled wake based on approximations to the Navier-Stokes equations. The model is tested and compared to large-eddy simulations using actuator disk and line models. The model is able to capture the curling mechanism for a turbine under uniform inflow and in the case of a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. Here, the model is then tested inside the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady State framework and provides excellent agreement with power predictions for cases with two and three turbines in a row.</p>","European Academy of Wind Energy - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is largely based on results from four projects carried out under auspices of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which are denoted as IEA Tasks 14, 18, 20, and 29. The aim of these projects was to collect and analyze aerodynamic measurements on five field facilities (IEA Tasks 14 and 18), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Phase VI turbine placed in the large NASA Ames wind tunnel (IEA Task 20), and the Mexico turbine placed in the Large Low Speed Facility of the German Dutch Wind tunnel DNW (IEA Task 29). Other experimental programs with an important aerodynamic content are touched upon as well. Research areas for which these measurements have led to important progress are identified. The progress is illustrated with analyses on these experiments. It is shown that detailed aerodynamic measurements are an absolute necessity for the validation and improvement of wind turbine design codes, where it is also concluded that the amount of measurement data which has been produced until now is still far too limited.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The kinetics of absorption are consistent with a first-order reaction after an initial period of a higher-order reaction, which may indicate a nucleation event. At 225 °C, both absorption and release show half-lives of around 10 min if the ammonia partial pressure is swung from 2 to 1 bar, which allows design of an absorber for the periodic separation of ammonia. Furthermore, when this absorber replaces the ammonia condenser in a conventional ammonia synthesis, the ammonia production at low pressure can have the same rate as the conventional process operating at higher pressure.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2018-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 9; Related Information: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02108/suppl_file/sc8b02108_si_001.pdf","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 11827-11835","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-0485","10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b02108","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1478643","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1478643","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1478643","ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering","9","6"

A steady-state, harmonic model derived from simulations using the NREL aeroelastic code FAST is developed to reduce computational expense while evaluating design trade-offs for rotors with radii greater than 100 m. Design studies are performed, which focus on blade aerodynamic and structural parameters as well as different hub configurations and nacelle placements atop the tower. The effects of tower design and closed-loop control are also analyzed. Design loads are calculated according to the IEC design standards and used to calibrate the harmonic model and quantify uncertainty. Our design studies highlight both industry trends and innovative designs: we progress from a conventional, upwind, 3-bladed rotor, to a rotor with longer, more slender blades that is downwind and 2-bladed. For a 13 MW design, we show that increasing the blade length by 25 m while decreasing the induction factor of the rotor increases annual energy capture by 11% while constraining peak blade loads. A downwind, 2-bladed rotor design is analyzed, with a focus on its ability to reduce peak blade loads by 10% per 5 deg. of cone angle, and also reduce total blade mass. However, when compared to conventional, 3-bladed, upwind designs, the peak main bearing load of the up-scaled, downwind, 2-bladed rotor is increased by 280%. Optimized teeter configurations and individual pitch control can reduce non-rotating damage equivalent loads by 45% and 22%, respectively, compared with fixed-hub designs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Among the many challenges to deployment is the need to understand the value that offshore wind provides within electricity markets. Here, this article develops a rigorous method to assess the economic value of offshore wind along the eastern coastline of the United States, seeking improved understanding of how the value of offshore wind varies both geographically and over time, and what has driven that variation. The article uses historical (2007–2016) weather data at thousands of potential offshore wind sites, combined with historical wholesale electricity market outcomes and renewable energy certificate (REC) prices at hundreds of possible transmission interconnection points. We find that the average historical market value of offshore wind from 2007 to 2016—considering energy, capacity, and RECs—varies significantly by project location, from $40/MWh to more than $110/MWh, and is highest for sites off of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. As energy and REC prices have fallen in recent years, so too has the market value of offshore wind. The historical value of offshore wind is found to exceed that of onshore wind, due to offshore wind sites being located more favorably in terms of constrained pricing points, and also due to a more-favorable temporal profile of electricity production. Cost reductions that approximate those witnessed recently in Europe may be needed for offshore wind to offer a credible economic value proposition on a widespread basis in the United States.","IOP Publishing","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

It was shown that a 61.5-m thermoplastic blade costs 4.7% less than an equivalent epoxy blade. Even though the thermoplastic resin is currently more expensive than epoxy, this cost reduction is primarily driven by the decreased capital costs, faster cycle times, and reduced energy requirements and labor costs. Although thermoplastic technology for resin infusion of wind turbine blades is relatively new, these results suggest that it is economically and technically feasible and warrants further research.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, a two-step probabilistic wind forecasting approach based on pinball loss optimization is developed. First, a multimodel machine learning-based ensemble deterministic forecasting framework is adopted to generate deterministic forecasts. The deterministic forecast is assumed to be the mean value of the predictive distribution at each forecasting time stamp. Then, the optimal unknown parameter (i.e., standard deviation) of the predictive distribution is estimated by a support vector regression surrogate model based on the deterministic forecasts.

"Estimation of turbulence dissipation rate and its variability from sonic anemometer and wind Doppler lidar during the XPIA field campaign","Bodini, Nicola; Lundquist, Julie K.; Newsom, Rob K.","47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; 17 WIND ENERGY; turbulence; atmospheric boundary layer; wind","<p><p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Despite turbulence being a fundamental transport process in the boundary layer, the capability of current numerical models to represent it is undermined by the limits of the adopted assumptions, notably that of local equilibrium. Here we leverage the potential of extensive observations in determining the variability in turbulence dissipation rate (<i>ϵ</i>). These observations can provide insights towards the understanding of the scales at which the major assumption of local equilibrium between generation and dissipation of turbulence is invalid. Typically, observations of <i>ϵ</i> require time- and labor-intensive measurements from sonic and/or hot-wire anemometers. We explore the capability of wind Doppler lidars to provide measurements of <i>ϵ</i>. We refine and extend an existing method to accommodate different atmospheric stability conditions. To validate our approach, we estimate <i>ϵ</i> from four wind Doppler lidars during the 3-month XPIA campaign at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (Colorado), and we assess the uncertainty of the proposed method by data intercomparison with sonic anemometer measurements of <i>ϵ</i>. Our analysis of this extensive dataset provides understanding of the climatology of turbulence dissipation over the course of the campaign. Further, the variability in <i>ϵ</i> with atmospheric stability, height, and wind speed is also assessed. Finally, we present how <i>ϵ</i> increases as nocturnal turbulence is generated during low-level jet events.</p></p>","European Geosciences Union","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, the emissions-intensive nature of the Haber–Bosch process, as well as a depleting supply of these fossil fuels have motivated the production of ammonia using renewable sources of energy. Small-scale, distributed processes may better enable the use of renewables, but also result in a loss of economies of scale, so the high capital cost of the Haber–Bosch process may inhibit this paradigm shift. A process that operates at lower pressure and uses absorption rather than condensation to remove ammonia from unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen has been proposed as an alternative. In this work, a dynamic model of this absorbent-enhanced process is proposed and implemented in gPROMS ModelBuilder. This dynamic model is used to determine optimal designs of this process that minimize the 20-year net present cost at small scales of 100 kg/h to 10,000 kg/h when powered by wind energy. The capital cost of this process scales with a 0.77 capacity exponent, and at production scales below 6075 kg/h, it is less expensive than the conventional Haber–Bosch process.</p>","MDPI AG","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","Switzerland","2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Processes Journal Volume: 6 Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 91","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2227-9717; PROCCO; PII: pr6070091","10.3390/pr6070091","","2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","1460897","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1460897","","Processes","7","6"

The turbines and the platforms were subjected to atmospheric boundary layer flows. Various sensitivity studies on fatigue loads with respect to the positions of the downstream turbine were performed and validated with a large-eddy simulation tool. In particular, the effect of various lateral positions of the downstream turbine relative to the upstream turbine were considered using time-series turbine wake data generated from the large-eddy simulation tool which served as an input to an aero-elastic wind turbine model to assess the loads. The load response from the rotor, tower, and the floating platform for the downstream turbine were sensitive to the lateral offset positions where turbines that were partially exposed to upstream turbine wakes yielded significant increases in the cyclic load range. For the given set of lateral positions for the downstream turbine, the largest damage equivalent load occurred when the turbine was one rotor diameter to the left of the centerline, when looking upstream, which is the position of the turbine fully exposed to upstream turbine wake. On the other hand, the fatigue load on the downstream turbine placed on the right side of the position fully exposed to the upstream turbine wake, yielded lower stress due to the non-symmetric shape of the turbine wake. The configuration associated with the largest damage equivalent loads was further investigated in a large-eddy simulation, modeling both the upstream and downstream turbines. It was found that the energy spectra at the blade rotational frequency were a magnitude order higher for the downstream turbine, especially for surge, heave, pitch, and yaw motion of the platform. In conclusion, the increase of the damage equivalent load for the flapwise blade root moment was 45% compared to the upstream turbine, which can potentially reduce the turbine service life time.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The gear mesh behaviour and the bearing roller slip during these events are characterized by strain measurements placed in the gear teeth roots and embedded in the outer rings of the tapered roller bearing locating pair. From our experiments, we conclude that the high-speed stage experiences a multidimensional loading consisting of bending and torsional deformation during the transient event. This loading propagates throughout the gearbox and results in unfavourable loading conditions at the bearing that have the potential to go beyond the preload during the torque reversals that occur during the grid-loss event. During the torque reversal, roller slip can occur in the bearings. It is observed that the slip behaviour is directly linked to the initial power level of the generator. Electrically induced excitation that typically leads to dynamic torque events can therefore cause mechanical gearbox degradation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Adaptive stratified importance sampling: hybridization of extrapolation and importance sampling Monte Carlo methods for estimation of wind turbine extreme loads","Graf, Peter; Dykes, Katherine; Damiani, Rick; Jonkman, Jason; Veers, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; wind turbines; load estimation; sampling; extreme loads","Wind turbine extreme load estimation is especially difficult because turbulent inflow drives nonlinear turbine physics and control strategies; thus there can be huge differences in turbine response to essentially equivalent environmental conditions. The two main current approaches, extrapolation and Monte Carlo sampling, are both unsatisfying: extrapolation-based methods are dangerous because by definition they make predictions outside the range of available data, but Monte Carlo methods converge too slowly to routinely reach the desired 50-year return period estimates. Thus a search for a better method is warranted. We introduce an adaptive stratified importance sampling approach that allows for treating the choice of environmental conditions at which to run simulations as a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the variance of unbiased estimates of extreme loads. Furthermore, the framework, built on the traditional bin-based approach used in extrapolation methods, provides a close connection between sampling and extrapolation, and thus allows the solution of the stochastic optimization (i.e., the optimal distribution of simulations in different wind speed bins) to guide and recalibrate the extrapolation. Results show that indeed this is a promising approach, as the variance of both the Monte Carlo and extrapolation estimates are reduced quickly by the adaptive procedure. We conclude, however, that due to the extreme response variability in turbine loads to the same environmental conditions, our method and any similar method quickly reaches its fundamental limits, and that therefore our efforts going forward are best spent elucidating the underlying causes of the response variability.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model includes two options that depend on the scale of surface roughness elements. A resolved canopy model, typically used to model flow through vegetation canopies, is employed when roughness elements are resolved by the vertical LES grid. In the case of unresolved roughness, a modified “pseudocanopy model” is developed to distribute drag over a shallow layer above the surface. Both canopy model options are validated against idealized test cases in neutral stability conditions and are shown to improve surface layer velocity profiles relative to simulations employing Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), which is commonly used as a surface boundary condition in ABL models. Use of the canopy model framework also leads to increased levels of resolved turbulence kinetic energy and turbulent stresses. Because LES of the ABL has a well-known difficulty recovering the expected logarithmic velocity profile (log law) in the surface layer, particular focus is placed on using the pseudocanopy model to alleviate this issue over a range of model configurations. Tests with varying surface roughness values, LES closures, and grid aspect ratios confirm that the pseudocanopy model generally improves log-law agreement relative to simulations that employ a standard MOST boundary condition. The canopy model framework thus represents a low-cost, easy-to-implement method for improving LES of the ABL.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Generating wind power scenarios for probabilistic ramp event prediction using multivariate statistical post-processing","Worsnop, Rochelle P.; Scheuerer, Michael; Hamill, Thomas M.; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind power forecasting; ramp events","Wind power forecasting is gaining international significance as more regions promote policies to increase the use of renewable energy. Wind ramps, large variations in wind power production during a period of minutes to hours, challenge utilities and electrical balancing authorities. A sudden decrease in wind-energy production must be balanced by other power generators to meet energy demands, while a sharp increase in unexpected production results in excess power that may not be used in the power grid, leading to a loss of potential profits. In this study, we compare different methods to generate probabilistic ramp forecasts from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction model with up to 12h of lead time at two tall-tower locations in the United States. We validate model performance using 21 months of 80m wind speed observations from towers in Boulder, Colorado, and near the Columbia River gorge in eastern Oregon. We employ four statistical post-processing methods, three of which are not currently used in the literature for wind forecasting. These procedures correct biases in the model and generate short-term wind speed scenarios which are then converted to power scenarios. This probabilistic enhancement of HRRR point forecasts provides valuable uncertainty information of ramp events and improves the skill of predicting ramp events over the raw forecasts. We compute Brier skill scores for each method with regard to predicting up- and down-ramps to determine which method provides the best prediction. We find that the Standard Schaake shuffle method yields the highest skill at predicting ramp events for these datasets, especially for up-ramp events at the Oregon site. Increased skill for ramp prediction is limited at the Boulder, CO, site using any of the multivariate methods because of the poor initial forecasts in this area of complex terrain. These statistical methods can be implemented by wind farm operators to generate a range of possible wind speed and power scenarios to aid and optimize decisions before ramp events occur.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The concept has wider adaptability and can be used as reinforcement method for existing monopiles. A series of centrifuge tests was performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacities of the hybrid foundation under monotonic loads. Five foundation models and two soil types were considered. According to the recorded responses, the hybrid foundation demonstrated better lateral behaviors that both lateral bearing capacity and stiffness are enhanced. Two analytical methods were proposed and compared with the centrifuge test results. The bearing capacity of the hybrid foundation is smaller than the sum of individual pile and friction wheel, and a reduction factor is suggested for both friction wheels. The friction wheel restrains rotations of monopile and provides extra restoring moments; their effects are idealized as equivalent moments acting on the pile head. The analytical results provide possible solutions in estimating the lateral bearing capacity of the innovative hybrid foundation system for offshore wind turbines by using traditional theories.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 182-192","","","EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-8018","10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.11.036","","2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","1605666","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605666","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605666","Ocean Engineering","C","148"

Yet, wind-speed variations differ across averaging temporal scales because hourly mean wind speeds fluctuate more than yearly averages. In this study, we quantify the influence of averaging timescale to the resultant variability. We assess three spread metrics (standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and robust coefficient of variation) and two distribution measures (skewness and kurtosis) based on 38 years of wind speeds from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's MERRA-2 reanalysis data set over the contiguous United States. The spatial distributions of wind-speed variability differ with metrics and timescales: wind speeds of fine temporal resolution generate strong variabilities that dilute spatial contrasts; small sample size becomes a constraint in calculating interannual variabilities via annual means and leads to inaccurate results. Overall, we find that metrics based on monthly data portray the largest spatial differences of wind-speed variability. Although standard deviation yields consistent geographical projections, none of the wind-speed data of any time frame are perfectly Gaussian. Furthermore, the robust coefficient of variation, a statistically robust and resistant approach, appears to be the ideal metric for quantifying wind-speed variabilities based on monthly mean data.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The advantages of using FAST are that it can provide convincing simulation results and address the interactions between turbine electrical and mechanical systems. The developed controller model is then rapidly prototyped for the real-time simulation with the hardware-in-the-loop scheme. CART3 will respond to a virtual frequency event triggered in the emulated electric grid modeled in a digital real-time simulator. The introduced simulation platform streamlines the procedure of designing turbine auxiliary controls, and these simulations results give insights on the turbine controls and their impacts on the interconnected power system, as well as the effects on turbine mechanical components.

Predictions from four LES research codes from the wind energy community are compared. The implementation of the ALM in all codes is similar and quantities along the blades are shown to match closely for all codes. The value of the Smagorinsky coefficient in the subgrid-scale turbulence model is shown to have a negligible effect on the time-averaged loads along the blades. Conversely, the breakdown location of the wake is strongly dependent on the Smagorinsky coefficient in uniform laminar inflow. Simulations are also performed using uniform mean velocity inflow with added homogeneous isotropic turbulence from a public database. The time-averaged loads along the blade do not depend on the inflow turbulence. Moreover, and in contrast to the uniform inflow cases, the Smagorinsky coefficient has a negligible effect on the wake profiles. It is concluded that for LES of wind turbines and wind farms using ALM, careful implementation and extensive cross-verification among codes can result in highly reproducible predictions. Moreover, the characteristics of the inflow turbulence appear to be more important than the details of the subgrid-scale modeling employed in the wake, at least for LES of wind energy applications at the resolutions tested in this work.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Uncertainty quantification in the analyses of operational wind power plant performance","Craig, Anna; Optis, Mike; Fields, Michael Jason; Moriarty, Patrick","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING","In the present work, we examine the variation introduced in the evaluation of an operating plant's wind power production as a result of the choices analysts make in the processing of the operational data. For this study, an idealized power production for individual turbines over an operational period was predicted by fitting power curves to the turbine production data collected during expected operation (that is, without curtailment or availability losses). A set of 240 possible methods were developed for (a) defining what data represented expected operation and (b) modeling the power curve. The spread in the idealized power production as predicted by the different methods was on average almost 3% for the 100 turbines considered. Such significant variation places a lower bound on the precision with which analysts may employ such data as benchmarks for calibration of their energy estimation processes and limits the potential for identification of refinements to the energy estimation models for improved accuracy.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Strategic Offering for Wind Power Producers Considering Energy and Flexible Ramping Products","Fang, Xin; Krishnan, Venkat; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind power; flexible ramping; strategic offers; electricity market; mathematical program with equilibrium constraints","The increasing deployments of renewable generation methods, such as wind, affects the flexibility of electric power system operating due to their inherent variability and uncertainty. To mitigate this, power systems need flexible resources. This paper investigates the potential for wind power to provide flexible ramping products in the real-time market, an additional value stream to the energy it provides. The proposed model for wind power’s strategic offering is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem with wind profit maximization at the upper level and the independent system operator’s economic dispatch—considering both the energy balance and the flexible ramping requirement to counter uncertainty—at the lower level. This bi-level model is converted to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) by recasting the lower level problem with its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions. Then, through strong duality theory and the big-M method, the MPEC model is converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model. The opportunity cost and the price for wind power-providing ramping products are analyzed. Numerical examples based on a 5-bus network are presented to verify the proposed model and concept.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Secondly, a cost model is proposed that goes beyond the simple and common mass-dependent approach. And thirdly, the issue of numerical efficiency is addressed by surrogate models both for fatigue and ultimate limit state code checks. In addition, this work shows an example utilizing all models.

This work presents a comparison between two approaches for developing the preliminary design of an offshore wind plant turbine layout, electrical collection system, and support structures. The first is a sequential approach, where components of the wind farm are optimised sequentially, each with its own objective function, thus neglecting potential interactions between them. The second approach uses Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimisation (MDAO), where all components are jointly optimised with the overall system levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as a global objective function. Studying the cases of regular and irregular layouts, the integrated approach always shows a greater improvement in the LCOE of the final design compared to the design resulting from the traditional sequential approach. The most significant trade-off exploited by the MDAO approach used in this study is between losses in energy production due to turbine wake effects and the costs of electrical cable infrastructure.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind Gust Characterization at Wind Turbine Relevant Heights in Moderately Complex Terrain","Hu, W.; Letson, F.; Barthelmie, R. J.; Pryor, S. C.","17 WIND ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences","<p>Improved understanding of wind gusts in complex terrain is critically important to wind engineering and specifically the wind energy industry. Observational data from 3D sonic anemometers deployed at 3 and 65 m at a site in moderately complex terrain within the northeastern United States are used to calculate 10 descriptors of wind gusts and to determine the parent distributions that best describe these parameters. It is shown that the parent distributions exhibit consistency across different descriptors of the gust climate. Specifically, the parameters that describe the gust intensity (gust amplitude, rise magnitude, and lapse magnitude; i.e., properties that have units of length per time) fit the two-parameter Weibull distribution, those that are unitless ratios (gust factor and peak factor) are described by log-logistic distributions, and all other properties (peak gust, rise and lapse times, gust asymmetric factor, and gust length scale) are lognormally distributed. It is also shown that gust factors scale with turbulence intensity, but gusts are distinguishable in power spectra of the longitudinal wind component (i.e., they have demonstrably different length scales than the average eddy length scale). Gust periods at the lower measurement height (3 m) are consistent with shear production, whereas at 65 m they are not. At this site, there is only a weak directional dependence of gust properties on site terrain and land cover variability along sectorial transects, but large gust length scales and gust factors are more likely to be observed in unstable atmospheric conditions.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United States","2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology Journal Volume: 57 Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: p. 1459-1476","","","SC001643; SC0016438","Journal ID: ISSN 1558-8424","10.1175/JAMC-D-18-0040.1","","2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","1459242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1459242","","Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology","7","57"

One of the advanced and effective control techniques is the feedforward or model predictive control approach, which requires the forecast of incoming environment conditions. For OFWTs, wave loading is one of the dominant sources to excite structural responses. This study is thus motivated to develop forecasting algorithms for wave elevations and wave excitation forces with the purpose of applying feedforward controllers on OFWTs. Two forecasting algorithms, the approximate Prony Method based on ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) regression, are developed and validated using wave records from tank tests. Utilizing the forecasted wave elevations and wave excitation forces, a feedforward LQR controller is designed to mitigate structural loads of an OFWT system.","Elsevier","","Alstom Renewable US LLC, Greenwood Village, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-05-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable Energy; Journal Volume: 128; Journal Issue: A","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 163-176","","","EE0005494; -EE0005494","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-1481; PII: S0960148118305809","10.1016/j.renene.2018.05.059","","2022-05-30T00:00:00Z","1613299","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1613299","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1613299","Renewable Energy","A","128"
"Capacity Optimization of a Centralized Charging Station in Joint Operation with a Wind Farm","Jiang, Zhe; Han, Xueshan; Li, Zhimin; Wang, Mingqiang; Liu, Guodong; Wang, Mengxia; Li, Wenbo; Ollis, Thomas","42 ENGINEERING; 17 WIND ENERGY; power system; wind farm; centralized charging station; dependent chance programming; capacity optimization","In the context of large-scale wind power integration and rapid development of electric vehicles (EVs), a joint operation pattern was proposed to use a centralized charging station (CCS) to address high uncertainties incurred by wind power integration. Additionally, this would directly remove the significant indeterminacy of wind power. Because the CCS is adjacent to a wind power gathering station, it could work jointly with wind farms to operate in power system as an independent enterprise. By combining the actual operational characteristics of the wind farm and the CCS, a multidimensional operating index evaluation system was created for the joint system. Based on the wind farm’s known capacity, a multi-target capacity planning model was established for CCS to maximize the probability of realizing diverse indices of the system based on dependent-chance goal programming. In this model, planning and dispatching are combined to improve the feasibility of results in the operational stage. This approach takes the effects of randomness into account for wind power and battery swapping. The model was solved through combining Monte Carlo simulation and a genetic algorithm (GA) based on segmented encoding. Finally, as shown in the simulation results, the proposed model could comprehensively include factors such as initial investment, wind power price, battery life, etc., to optimize CCS capacity and to ultimately improve the operating indices of the joint system.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Previous calibration of the tuneable model parameters of FAST.Farm has shown that its prediction of wake dynamics for a single wind turbine across different atmospheric stability conditions and nacelle-yaw errors matches well with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation at a small fraction of the computational expense. This paper presents a validation of FAST.Farm against large-eddy simulation for a series of cases - independent from those used to support the calibration - considering single-turbine and small wind-farm scenarios, which are both subject to variations in inflow and control. The validation has demonstrated that FAST.Farm reasonably accurately predicts: (1) thrust and power for individual turbines both in isolation and down the row of the small wind farm, (2) wake meandering behavior across different atmospheric conditions, and (3) averaged wake-deficit advection, evolution, and merging effects. As a result, the validation also highlights potential physics that could be improved in FAST.Farm in the future.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

As a result, research in wind farm aerodynamics is often based on smaller-scale measurements and on numerical experiments. It is therefore crucial for the scientific community to understand how results compare across scales. In this work, three actuator-line large-eddy simulations are performed to investigate the sensitivity of mean and dynamic wake characteristics to changes in hub height (for the same turbine model) and in rotor size and properties (for a research-scale and a land-based-scale rotor at the same hub height). Results reveal that ground proximity has a large effect on wake expansion via turbulent transport of axial momentum and on the magnitude of lateral and vertical meandering. The rotor-size experiment suggests that wakes from different-scale turbines expand similarly when not limited by the ground, but that the meandering magnitude is not easily translatable across scales. Lastly, the short-rotor wake recovers faster than the tall-rotor wake, but the far wakes of the different-sized rotors at the same absolute height are scalable.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We also find that our results depend on the assumptions we make during analysis, which we quantify with a sensitivity analysis. This method allows the estimation of uncertainty we have in our findings.

However, wind is notoriously difficult to predict, and significant uncertainty remains in our understanding of climate change impacts on existing wind generation capacity. Historical and future wind climatology and associated capacity factors at five wind turbine sites in California are examined. Historical (1980–2000) and mid-century (2030–2050) simulations were produced using the Variable-Resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) to understand how these wind generation sites are expected to be impacted by climate change. A high-resolution statistically downscaled WRF product provided by DNV GL, reanalysis datasets MERRA-2, CFSR, NARR, and observational data were used for model validation and comparison. These projections suggest that wind power generation capacity throughout the state is expected to increase during the summer, and decrease during fall and winter, based on significant changes at several wind farm sites. Finally, this study improves the characterization of uncertainty around the magnitude and variability in space and time of California's wind resources in the near future, and also enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms related to the trends in wind resource variability.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The Economic Impacts of High Wind Penetration Scenarios in the United States","Cohen, Stuart M.; Caron, Justin","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; electricity; wind; general equilibrium; capacity expansion; welfare; renewables; distributional effects","The U.S. electric sector is experiencing rapid increases in renewable generation with an expectation of continued growth. We examine the impacts of increased wind electricity on the U.S. economy using a hybrid model that links a detailed electric sector model (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Regional Energy Deployment System [ReEDS]) with a computable general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's U.S. Regional Energy Policy [USREP] model). Increasing wind capacity displaces fossil fuels for electricity generation, which depresses fossil fuel prices and reduces economy-wide CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Competitive wind deployment in the reference scenario achieves these outcomes with lower electricity prices than a scenario with wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. Lower fossil fuel and electricity prices benefit low-income households, but the dominant economic impacts are driven by increased electric sector investment and capital returns, which primarily benefit those with higher incomes. Overall, cost-competitive wind provides benefits to the U.S. economy that are initially low but rise beyond 2030 to achieve cumulative welfare and GDP improvements of $110 and $111 billion through 2050. Prescribing additional wind deployment (meeting 35% of demand by 2050) increases post-2030 electricity prices but not more so than keeping wind capacity fixed at 2016 levels. The negative effect of higher prices on welfare, however, is outweighed by higher returns from the additional wind investment. While these changes favor higher income classes, we find economy-wide benefits through 2040. These benefits diminish by 2050, but the cumulative additional gains through 2050, beyond the reference case, are $192 billion in welfare and $150 billion in GDP.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Results in terms of damage equivalent loads (DELs) and extreme loads under operating, misaligned conditions are compared to data collected from an instrumented, utility-scale wind turbine. The analysis shows that multiple factors are responsible for the DELs of the various components, and that airfoil aerodynamics, elastic characteristics of the rotor, and turbulence intensities are the primary drivers. Both fatigue and extreme loads are observed to have relatively complex trends with yaw offsets, which can change depending on the wind-speed regime.

"Wind Speed Prediction with Spatio–Temporal Correlation: A Deep Learning Approach","Zhu, Qiaomu; Chen, Jinfu; Zhu, Lin; Duan, Xianzhong; Liu, Yilu","17 WIND ENERGY","Wind speed prediction with spatio–temporal correlation is among the most challenging tasks in wind speed prediction. In this paper, the problem of predicting wind speed for multiple sites simultaneously is investigated by using spatio–temporal correlation. This paper proposes a model for wind speed prediction with spatio–temporal correlation, i.e., the predictive deep convolutional neural network (PDCNN). The model is a unified framework, integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Firstly, the spatial features are extracted by CNNs located at the bottom of the model. Then, the temporal dependencies among these extracted spatial features are captured by the MLP. In this way, the spatial and temporal correlations are captured by PDCNN intrinsically. Finally, PDCNN generates the predicted wind speed by using the learnt spatio–temporal correlations. In addition, three error indices are defined to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the model on the wind turbine array. Experiment results on real-world data show that PDCNN can capture the spatio–temporal correlation effectively, and it outperforms the conventional machine learning models, including multi-layer perceptron, support vector regressor, decision tree, etc.","MDPI AG","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A Copula-Based Conditional Probabilistic Forecast Model for Wind Power Ramps","Cui, Mingjian; Krishnan, Venkat; Hodge, Bri -Mathias; Zhang, Jie","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; conditional probabilistic forecast; copula theory; Gaussian mixture model; wind power ramps","Efficient management of wind ramping characteristics can significantly reduce wind integration costs for balancing authorities. By considering the stochastic dependence of wind power ramp (WPR) features, this paper develops a conditional probabilistic wind power ramp forecast (cp-WPRF) model based on Copula theory. The WPRs dataset is constructed by extracting ramps from a large dataset of historical wind power. Each WPR feature (e.g., rate, magnitude, duration, and start-time) is separately forecasted by considering the coupling effects among different ramp features. To accurately model the marginal distributions with a copula, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is adopted to characterize the WPR uncertainty and features. The Canonical Maximum Likelihood (CML) method is used to estimate parameters of the multivariable copula. The optimal copula model is chosen based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) from each copula family. Finally, the best conditions based cp-WPRF model is determined by predictive interval (PI) based evaluation metrics. Numerical simulations on publicly available wind power data show that the developed copula-based cp-WPRF model can predict WPRs with a high level of reliability and sharpness.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To achieve it, the impact mechanism of the WFs' post-fault active power and SGs' tripping on the stability margin of each swing is first presented by using extended equal area criterion (EEAC). Based on this, a principle of the coordinated control is put forward. The WFs' control period is designed as six stages, and the value of post-fault active power in each stage is suggested to improve the stability of the first five swings and maintain the post-fault steady state. To decrease the tripping amount of the SGs, the SGs are tripped only when WFs' control effect is not sufficient to avoid the instability. Then, by utilizing an “online pre-decision and real-time matching”scheme, an engineering application method for the control principle is proposed, where the control procedures and detailed parameters calculation are demonstrated. The numerical simulations show that the coordinated control has a better damping effect and a less control cost (less amount of tripped SGs) than the traditional DFIG control or traditional SG tripping.","IEEE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Assessing spacing impact on coherent features in a wind turbine array boundary layer","Ali, Naseem; Hamilton, Nicholas; DeLucia, Dominic; Bayoán Cal, Raúl","17 WIND ENERGY; wind farms; wind turbines; turbulence; wind turbine array boundary layer","As wind farms become larger, the spacing between turbines becomes a significant design consideration that can impose serious economic constraints. To investigate the turbulent flow structures in a 4 × 3 Cartesian wind turbine array boundary layer (WTABL), a wind tunnel experiment was carried out parameterizing the streamwise and spanwise wind turbine spacing. Four cases are chosen spacing turbines by 6 or 3D in the streamwise direction, and 3 or 1.5D in the spanwise direction, where D = 12cm is the rotor diameter. Data are obtained experimentally using stereo particle image velocimetry. Mean streamwise velocity showed maximum values upstream of the turbine with the spacing of 6 and 3D in the streamwise and spanwise direction, respectively. Fixing the spanwise turbine spacing to 3D, variations in the streamwise spacing influence the turbulent flow structure and the power available to following wind turbines. Quantitative comparisons are made through spatial averaging, shifting measurement data and interpolating to account for the full range between devices to obtain data independent of array spacing. The largest averaged Reynolds stress is seen in cases with spacing of 3D × 3D. Snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was employed to identify the flow structures based on the turbulence kinetic energy content. The maximum turbulence kinetic energy content in the first POD mode is seen for turbine spacing of 6D × 1.5D. The flow upstream of each wind turbine converges faster than the flow downstream according to accumulation of turbulence kinetic energy by POD modes, regardless of spacing. The streamwise-averaged profile of the Reynolds stress is reconstructed using a specific number of modes for each case; the case of 6D × 1.5D spacing shows the fastest reconstruction to compare the rate of reconstruction of statistical profiles. Intermediate modes are also used to reconstruct the averaged profile and show that the intermediate scales are responsible for features seen in the original profile. The variation in streamwise and spanwise spacing leads to changes in the background structure of the turbulence, where the color map based on barycentric map and Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor provides an alternate perspective on the nature of the perturbations within the wind turbine array. The impact of the streamwise and spanwise spacings on power produced is quantified, where the maximum production corresponds with the case of greatest turbine spacing.","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Assessment of bearing capacity of axially loaded monopiles based on centrifuge tests","Wang, Xuefei; Zeng, Xiangwu; Li, Jiale","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING","The monopile has been widely used to support offshore and coastal structures. A series of centrifuge tests has been performed to investigate the bearing capacity of large diameter monopiles in sandy soil. Both static tests and cyclic tests have been conducted for open-ended and close-ended model piles, and the effects of influence factors, such as loading rates, embedment depths, and loading histories are considered. The piles are then loaded by a sequence of compressive-tensile loadings to estimate the tension capacity, from which the shaft friction is derived. The cyclic load tests are performed with five varying load intensities, and the accumulated settlement is assessed. The centrifuge tests indicate that the pile bearing capacity tends to increase with the initial penetration depth, and the stress state of soil greatly influences the pile behavior. The tensile shaft friction is smaller compared to the compression test. The capacities of the piles reduce significantly under the axial cyclic load, and the maximum cyclic load intensity should be limited to 75% of the ultimate bearing capacity. The API design method is used to calibrate with the centrifuge test results. The method overestimates the bearing capacity at larger depths, and a conservative reduction factor is required.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-09-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Engineering; Journal Volume: 167; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 357-368","","","EE0006714; DE‐EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-8018","10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.08.063","","2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","1605667","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605667","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605667","Ocean Engineering","C","167"

One of the predominant renewable energy sources, wind energy, possess a significant challenge for grid operations, due to its intermittency, uncertainty and variability. In changing operating conditions with wind uncertainty, part of wind may need to be curtailed for the safe utilization of the transmission system. In order to minimize the wind power curtailment and to keep the power flow on a transmission line under limits, a cyber resilient Distributed Remedial Action Scheme (DRAS) is developed in this paper. The RAS is formulated as an optimization problem, considering the real power flow constraints of the transmission lines and given wind variability. In this paper, DRAS is developed to operate even with failures in the computing nodes to make it cyber-resilient. Distributed simplex algorithm is used for optimization in the distributed RAS. The DRAS is implemented in a decentralized platform called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid (RIAPS) to enable cyber resiliency of DRAS. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through offline simulations of the New England 39 bus system and online simulations of IEEE 14 bus test system.

Wind forecasting is one of the enablers to partially tackle challenges associated with wind power uncertainty. To improve the 'forecasting ability', defined as forecastability, different forecasting methods have been developed to assist grid integration of wind energy. However, forecasting performance not only relies on the power of forecasting models, but is also related to local weather conditions and (known as wind characteristics) wind farm properties. In this study, geospatial and instance spatial distributions of six wind characteristics and two forecasting error metrics are first analyzed based on 126,000 + wind sites in the United States. Forecasts in different look-ahead times are generated by using a machine learning based multi-model forecasting framework model and the Weather Research and Forecasting model. A forecastability quantification method is developed by characterizing the relationship between forecastability and wind series entropy using three regression methods, i.e., linear approximation, locally weighted scatterplot smoother nonlinear nonparametric regression, and quantile regression. It is found that the forecastability of a wind site can be successfully characterized by wind series characteristics, thereby providing valuable information at different stages of wind energy projects.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Fluctuating velocity fields are combined in the correlation tensor to form the kernel of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Proper orthogonal decomposition modes resulting from the decomposition represent the spatially coherent turbulence structures in the wind turbine wake; eigenvalues delineate the relative amount of turbulent kinetic energy associated with each mode. Back-projecting the POD modes onto the velocity snapshots produces dynamic coefficients that express the amplitude of each mode in time. A reduced-order model of the wind turbine wake (wakeROM) is defined through a series of polynomial parameters that quantify mode interaction and the evolution of each POD mode coefficients. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations models the wind turbine wake composed only of the large-scale turbulent dynamics identified by the POD. Tikhonov regularization is used to recalibrate the dynamical system by adding additional constraints to the minimization seeking polynomial parameters, reducing error in the modeled mode coefficients. The wakeROM is periodically reinitialized with new initial conditions found by relating the incoming turbulent velocity to the POD mode coefficients through a series of open-loop transfer functions. The wakeROM reproduces mode coefficients to within 25.2%, quantified through the normalized root-mean-square error. Furthermore, a high-level view of the modeling approach is provided as a platform to discuss promising research directions, alternate processes that could benefit stability and efficiency, and desired extensions of the wakeROM.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of variable types of offshore wind substructures associate with their corresponding example projects. The study is complemented with a special attention to a novel foundation, namely suction bucket foundation. Main technological issues related to this concept are integrated. In the paper, bearing behaviors of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) with the suction bucket foundation under lateral loads, vertical loads, combined loads, and extreme loading conditions are discussed. Two installation methods are introduced. The geometric and improved design is illustrated by considering capabilities in transportation and installation. Research methods, including field tests, laboratory tests, centrifuge tests, theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, are listed; these methods are employed in previous studies to investigate behaviors of the OWT. This review integrates most relevant aspects and recent advancements together, which aims to provide a reference frame for future studies and projects.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Conversion and Management; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 103-119","","","EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0196-8904","10.1016/j.enconman.2017.12.061","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1605663","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605663","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605663","Energy Conversion and Management","C","158"
"Structural Optimization of a Direct-Drive Wind Turbine Generator Inspired by Additive Manufacturing","Sethuraman, Latha; Fingersh, Lee J; Dykes, Katherine; Hayes, Austin","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; additive manufacturing; light-weighting; direct drive generator; stator; wind turbine; simulation/modeling","This study explores the structural freedom and design opportunities of additive manufacturing for a 5-MW direct-drive generator for a wind turbine and compares it to more traditional spoke-arm designs using NREL's GeneratorSE. The work focuses on light-weighting the stator within the generator, complementing previous rotor work. The light-weighting approach uses complex geometries and lattice structures made possible by additive manufacturing to realize increased strength with reduced mass. By reducing the mass at the top of the tower, wind turbines face lower loading along with decreased cost and improved structural stability. Furthermore, an altered bedplate support location facilitates lighter stator designs by better load transfer. Design optimization suggests additive manufacturing has the potential to transform generator designs to realize light-weighting. Since these machines are large, simulation and modeling are essential first steps before future experimental validation.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind turbine sensor array for monitoring avian and bat collisions","Hu, Congcong; Albertani, Roberto; Suryan, Robert M.","17 WIND ENERGY; birds; bats; environment; impact monitoring; vibration sensors; wind turbine","Assessment of avian and bat collisions with wind turbines is necessary to ensure that the benefits of renewable wind power generation are not outweighed by mortality of protected species. An onboard, integrated multisensor system capable of providing detection of turbine collision events, including taxonomic information, was developed. The conceptual design of a multisensor system including a vibration sensing node, an optics node, and an bioacoustic node with an event–driven trigger architecture was field–tested on utility–scale wind turbines. A pixel density computational model was built to estimate the spatial coverage and target resolution to the optimized configuration for camera placement. Field test results of the vibration node showed that nearly half of the recorded impact events were successfully identified by visual inspection and running short–time Fourier transform on recorded vibration signals. The remaining undetected impact events were masked under background noise due to low impact energy and high background noise of the operating turbine, which result in subsequent low signal–to–noise ratio. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of triggering the system through single impact event sensed by vibration sensors.","Wiley","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Measurements and predictions of wind turbine tower shadow and fairing effects","Noyes, Carlos; Qin, Chao; Loth, Eric; Schreck, Scott","17 WIND ENERGY; aerodynamic stalling; bending moments; forecasting; wakes; wind tunnels; wind turbines","Downwind two-bladed rotor configurations can have advantages in reducing rotor mass for wind turbines, compared with three-bladed upwind designs. However, the tower shadow adds an aerodynamic complication that can be difficult to quantify and predict. This study presents and analyzes a previously unpublished subset of data collected during an extensive wind tunnel campaign, the Unsteady Aerodynamic Experiment (UAE). At high tip speed ratios, the tower shadow is a dominating contributor to bending moment oscillations but can be mitigated by the use of a tower fairing when such a fairing is aligned with the flow. At lower tip speed ratios where the blades can undergo aerodynamic stall and hysteresis, tower shadow was only a secondary contributor to bending moments and the tower fairing did not significantly impact bending moments. The aeroelastic simulation code called FAST was used to predict the same experimental conditions. In general, simulations reasonably predicted most of the cycle-averaged aspects, but only qualitatively predicted the unsteady variations due to tower shadow. To improve simulation predictions inside the tower wake, it is suggested that future work model the unsteady wake component associated with cylinder shedding and to consider a wake model for tower fairings at various wind incidence angles.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A Nonparametric Bayesian Framework for Short-Term Wind Power Probabilistic Forecast","Xie, Wei; Zhang, Pu; Chen, Rong; Zhou, Zhi","17 WIND ENERGY; Bayesian nonparametric approach; prediction interval; predictive distribution; probabilistic forecast; wind power","To improve the energy system resilience and economic efficiency, the wind power as a renewable energy starts to be deeply integrated into smart power grids. However, the wind power forecast uncertainty brings operational challenges. In order to provide a reliable guidance on operational decisions, in this paper, we propose a short-term wind power probabilistic forecast. Specifically, to model the rich dynamic behaviors of underlying physical wind power stochastic process occurring in various meteorological conditions, we first introduce an infinite Markov switching autoregressive model. This nonparametric time series model can capture the important properties in the real world data to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, given finite historical data, the posterior distribution of flexible forecast model can correctly quantify the model estimation uncertainty. Built on it, we develop the posterior predictive distribution to rigorously quantify the overall forecasting uncertainty accounting for both inherent stochastic uncertainty and model estimation error. Furthermore, the proposed approach can provide accurate and reliable short-term wind power probabilistic forecast, which can be used to support smart power grids real-time risk management.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

However, energy storage technologies can help accommodate wind power uncertainty and variability due to their flexible characteristics. This paper focuses on the restoration phase, and provides a novel coordination strategy of wind and pumped-storage hydro (PSH) units for a faster and reliable self-healing process. The wind-PSH assisted power system restoration is formulated as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem. The first-stage problem determines the start-up sequence of generators and the energization times of transmission paths; and the second-stage problem decides load pickup sequences, wind power dispatch levels, and PSH units' operating modes. The column-and-constraint generation decomposition algorithm is applied to solve the two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem, which has a mixed-integer optimization in the inner-level problem. The developed coordination strategy is tested on the modified IEEE 39-bus system. Numerical results demonstrate that the coordinated wind and PSH units can increase the total energy served, enhance wind power dispatchability, and reduce wind power curtailment.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Rather, the flow fields on internal turbines are influenced by wakes generated by upwind unit and exhibit different dynamic characteristics relative to the free stream. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 61400-1 for the design of wind turbines only considers a deterministic wake model for the design of a wind plant. This study is focused on the development of a stochastic model for waked wind fields. First, high-fidelity physics-based waked wind velocity fields are generated using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). Stochastic characteristics of these LES waked wind velocity field, including mean and turbulence components, are analyzed. Wake-related mean and turbulence field-related parameters are then estimated for use with a stochastic model, using Multivariate Multiple Linear Regression (MMLR) with the LES data. To validate the simulated wind fields based on the stochastic model, wind turbine tower and blade loads are generated using aeroelastic simulation for utility-scale wind turbine models and compared with those based directly on the LES inflow. The study's overall objective is to offer efficient and validated stochastic approaches that are computationally tractable for assessing the performance and loads of turbines operating in wakes.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Coordinated Control of Wind Turbine and Energy Storage System for Reducing Wind Power Fluctuation","Kim, Chunghun; Muljadi, Eduard; Chung, Chung Choo","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind power fluctuation; energy storage system (ESS); state of charge (SoC) management; coordinated control","This paper proposes a method for the coordinated control of a wind turbine and an energy storage system (ESS). Because wind power (WP) is highly dependent on wind speed, which is variable, severe stability problems can be caused in power systems, especially when the WP has a high penetration level. To solve this problem, many power generation corporations or grid operators have begun using ESSs. An ESS has very quick response and good performance for reducing the impact of WP fluctuation; however, its installation cost is high. Therefore, it is important to design the control algorithm by considering both the ESS capacity and WP fluctuation. Thus, we propose a control algorithm to mitigate the WP fluctuation by using the coordinated control between the wind turbine and the ESS by considering the ESS capacity and the WP fluctuation. Using de-loaded control, according to the WP fluctuation and ESS capacity, we can expand the ESS lifespan and improve grid reliability by avoiding the extreme value of state of charge (SoC) (i.e., 0 or 1 pu). The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated via MATLAB/Simulink by considering a small power system that includes both a wind turbine generator and conventional generators that react to system frequency deviation. We found that the proposed method has better performance in SoC management, thereby improving the frequency regulation by mitigating the impact of the WP fluctuation on the small power system.","MDPI AG","","Hanyang Univ., Seoul (Korea, Republic of); National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that a developer being open and transparent, a community being able to influence the outcome, and having a say in the planning process are all statistically significant predictors of a process perceived as being ‘fair,’ with an open and transparent developer having the largest effect. We also find developer transparency and ability to influence outcomes to have statistically significant relationships to a more positive attitude, with those findings holding when aesthetics, landscape, and wind turbine sound considerations are controlled for.

We used GPS-loggers on Sandwich Terns to collect novel data on instantaneous flight speeds during foraging trips, separated for different behavioural stages, and applied these estimates in a widely used collision rate model. Average flight speed during a foraging trip corrected for individual variation and flight type was 36.9 ± 12.3 SD km h{sup −1} and flight speed was highest during inbound commuting (44.4 ± 12.0 km h{sup −1}) and lowest during foraging (29.9 ± 10.7 km h{sup −1}). Our results show significant differences in flight speeds of Sandwich Terns between behaviour stages during foraging trips, which resulted in divergent estimates of collision victims due to wind turbines depending on the function of the area in which wind farms are proposed. Since these conclusions are likely to hold for many other bird species, we conclude that behaviour of birds in a proposed wind farm is a factor to take into account when modelling collision rates as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.03.007","","","","United States","2018-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 71; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 12-16","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S019592551730389X; TRN: US19W4055035614","10.1016/J.EIAR.2018.03.007","","2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","22791399","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22791399","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","71"

Such a conservative approach often results in underutilization of line ampacity because the worst conditions prevail only for a short period of time during the year. Dynamic line rating (DLR) utilizes local meteorological conditions and grid loadings to adaptively compute additional line ampacity headroom that may be available due to favorable local environmental conditions. This paper details Idaho National Laboratory-developed weather-based DLR, which utilizes a state-of-the-art general line ampacity state solver for real-time computation of thermal ratings of TLs. Performance of the proposed DLR solution is demonstrated in existing TL segments at AltaLink, Canada, and the potential benefits of the proposed DLR for enhanced transmission ampacity utilization are quantified. Moreover, we investigated a hypothetical case for emulating the impact of an additional wind plant near the test grid. Furthermore, the results for the given system and data configurations demonstrated that real-time ratings were above the seasonal static ratings for at least 76.6% of the time, with a mean increase of 22% over the static rating, thereby demonstrating huge potential for improvement on ampacity utilization.","IEEE","","Idaho National Lab.

"Analyzing storage for wind integration in a transmission-constrained power system","Jorgenson, Jennie; Denholm, Paul; Mai, Trieu","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; energy storage; wind energy; production cost modeling; transmission; renewable curtailment","High levels of energy from variable generation sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) can result in significant curtailment, in which the wind and PV energy cannot be used to serve demand. Adding transmission and energy storage can assist in reducing renewable curtailment, but the relative merits of each enabling technology individually or combined is not well understood. Thus, we compare the role of transmission and storage in reducing curtailment, as well as reducing generation costs from conventional sources. Using a high-fidelity model of the electric power grid, we examine a scenario in which the western portion of the U.S. and Canada reaches 37% energy from wind and 12% energy from solar PV. In the case studied, we find that transmission is generally more effective than energy storage in reducing curtailment, due to the curtailment patterns of wind. However, the interaction between transmission and energy storage shows that the two technologies act symbiotically, meaning that their combined energy value is greater than that of each individually. This analysis demonstrates that fully realizing the benefits of wind resources located far from demand centers will require an effective method to deliver wind power at the right times to the right locations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Evaluation of the wind farm parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (version 3.8.1) with meteorological and turbine power data","Lee, Joseph C. Y.; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind farm parameterization; wind power production; grid integration","<p>Forecasts of wind-power production are necessary to facilitate the integration of wind energy into power grids, and these forecasts should incorporate the impact of wind-turbine wakes. Our paper focuses on a case study of four diurnal cycles with significant power production, and assesses the skill of the wind farm parameterization (WFP) distributed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model version 3.8.1, as well as its sensitivity to model configuration. After validating the simulated ambient flow with observations, we quantify the value of the WFP as it accounts for wake impacts on power production of downwind turbines. We also illustrate with statistical significance that a vertical grid with approximately 12 m vertical resolution is necessary for reproducing the observed power production. Further, the WFP overestimates wake effects and hence underestimates downwind power production during high wind speed, highly stable, and low turbulence conditions. We also find the WFP performance is independent of the number of wind turbines per model grid cell and the upwind–downwind position of turbines. Rather, the ability of the WFP to predict power production is most dependent on the skill of the WRF model in simulating the ambient wind speed.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A scanning lidar measures air velocity scalar projected onto its line of sight. However, line of sight is rarely parallel to the velocities of interest. The line of sight projection correction technique showed reduced axial velocity error for a simple wake model. Next, an analysis based on large-eddy simulations of a 27 m diameter wind turbine was used to more accurately assess the projection correction technique in a turbulent wake. During the simulation, flow behind the turbine is sampled with a nacelle mounted virtual lidar matching the scanning trajectory and sampling frequency of the DTU SpinnerLidar. The axial velocity, axial induction, freestream wind speed, thrust coefficient, and power coefficient are calculated from virtual lidar measurements using two different estimates of the flow: line of sight velocity without correction, and line of sight with projection correction. The flow field is assumed to be constant during one complete scan of the lidar field of view, and the average wind direction is assumed to be equal to the instantaneous wind direction at the lidar measurement location for the projection correction. Despite these assumptions, results indicate that all wake and aerodynamic quantity error is reduced significantly by using the projection correction technique; axial velocity error is reduced on average from 7.4% to 2.8%.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This effort is motivated by the need for a robust mesoscale-to-microscale coupling strategy in which a microscale (wind plant) simulation is driven by mesoscale data without any resolved microscale turbulence. A neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary layer was simulated in an LES with 10-m grid spacing. We show how such a fully developed turbulence field may be reproduced with spectral enrichment starting from an under-resolved coarse LES field (with 20-m and 40-m grid spacing). The velocity spectra of the under-resolved fields are enriched by superimposing a fluctuating velocity field calculated by two turbulence simulators: TurbSim and Gabor Kinematic Simulation. Both forms of enrichment accurately simulated the autospectra of all three velocity components at high wavenumbers, with agreement between the enriched fields and the full-resolution LES observed at 400 m from the inflow boundary. In contrast, the spectra of the unenriched fields reached the same fully developed state at four times the downstream distance.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A supervised learning problem is then constructed to find general, predictive representations of the optimal turbulence closure. A machine learning technique using Gaussian process regression is trained to predict the eddy viscosity field based on local RANS flow field information like velocities, pressures, and their gradients. The Gaussian process is trained on LES simulations of a single turbine and implemented in a wind plant simulation with 36 turbines. We show improvement over the baseline RANS model with the machine learning correction, and demonstrate the ability to provide accurate confidence levels for the corrections that enable future uncertainty quantification studies.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We outline a method to construct country-level wind resource supply curves, delineated by resource quality and other parameters. Using mesoscale reanalysis data, we generate estimates for wind quality, both terrestrial and offshore, across the globe. Because not all land or water area is suitable for development, appropriate database layers provide exclusions to reduce the total resource to its technical potential. We expand upon estimates from related studies by: using a globally consistent data source of uniquely detailed wind speed characterizations; assuming a non-constant coefficient of performance for adjusting power curves for altitude; categorizing the distance from resource sites to the electric power grid; and characterizing offshore exclusions on the basis of sea ice concentrations. The product, then, is technical potential by country, classified by resource quality as determined by net capacity factor. Additional classifications dimensions are available, including distance to transmission networks for terrestrial wind and distance to shore and water depth for offshore. We estimate the total global wind generation potential of 560 PWh for terrestrial wind with 90% of resource classified as low-to-mid quality, and 315 PWh for offshore wind with 67% classified as mid-to-high quality. These estimates are based on 3.5 MW composite wind turbines with 90 m hub heights, 0.95 availability, 90% array efficiency, and 5 MW/km<sup>2</sup> deployment density in non-excluded areas. We compare the underlying technical assumption and results with other global assessments.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We imposed both laminar inflow and turbulent inflows, which contain turbulence for the Ekman layer and a low-level jet (LLJ) in the stable boundary layer. To solve the flow through the wind turbines and their wakes, we used a large-eddy simulation technique with an actuator-line method. We compared the time series for the velocity deficit at the first and rear columns to observe the temporal change in velocity deficit for the entire wind farm. The velocity deficit at the first column for LLJ inflow was similar to that for laminar inflow. However, the magnitude of velocity deficit at the rear columns for the case with LLJ inflow was 11.9% greater because of strong wake recovery, which was enhanced by the vertical flux of kinetic energy associated with the LLJ. In order to observe the spatial transition and characteristics of wake recovery, we performed statistical analyses of the velocity at different locations for both the laminar and LLJ inflows. These studies indicated that strong wake recovery was present, and a kurtosis analysis showed that the probability density function for the streamwise velocity followed a Gaussian distribution. In a quadrant analysis of the Reynolds stress, we found that the ejection and sweep motions for the LLJ inflow case were greater than those for the laminar inflow case.","Wiley","","Los Alamos National Lab.

In the energy-releasing period, to improve the frequency nadir and rotor speed convergence by releasing a large amount of kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses in a DFIG-based WTG, the power reference is increased up to the torque limit referred to the power and reduces along with it for a predefined period which is determined based on the occurrence time of the frequency nadir in a power grid. Then, the reference decreases so that the rotor speed is forced to be converged to the preset value in the stable operating region of the rotor speed. In the energy-absorbing period, to quickly recover the rotor speed, the reference smoothly decreases with the rotor speed and time during a predefined period until it intersects with the maximum power point tracking curve. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully achieves rapid frequency stabilization with the improved frequency nadir under various wind conditions based on the IEEE 14-bus system.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To accurately estimate bird mortality at wind farms, the number of dead birds found under turbines is commonly corrected for carcass removal by scavengers, which is quantified by measuring persistence of experimental carcasses through time. These studies often use domestic birds as surrogates because carcasses of wild birds (e.g., raptors) are difficult to obtain. We assessed scavenger removal of carcasses from five bird species at simulated turbines to determine whether domestic surrogates are scavenged at a different rate than raptors, species of interest for wind turbine mortality. The percentage of carcasses scavenged during 14-d rounds ranged from 34.6% for American kestrels (<em>Falco sparverius</em>) to 65.4% for chickens (<em>Gallus gallus</em>), and the percentage of carcasses completely removed ranged from 13.5% for red-tailed hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) to 67.3% for northern bobwhites (<em>Colinus virginianus</em>). Carcass type (i.e., species) was the only predictor included in the best-fit logistic regression model of complete carcass removal, and a survival analysis indicated carcass type influenced elapsed time to scavenging events. Our results suggest the use of surrogate species to quantify carcass removal at wind turbines could lead to inaccurate mortality estimates.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ecosphere Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: 11","","Medium: X","","","DE‐EM0004391; EM0004391","Journal ID: ISSN 2150-8925","10.1002/ecs2.1994","","2021-06-08T00:00:00Z","1408062","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1408062","","Ecosphere","11","8"

However, wind-generated ammonia costs about twice of that made from a traditional fossil-fuel driven process. To reduce the production cost, we replace the conventional ammonia condensation with a selective absorber containing metal halides, e.g. calcium chloride, operating at near synthesis temperatures. With this reaction-absorption process, ammonia can be synthesized at 20 bar from air, water, and wind-generated electricity, with rates comparable to the conventional process running at 150-300 bar. In our reaction-absorption process, the rate of ammonia synthesis is now controlled not by the chemical reaction, but largely by the pump used to recycle the unreacted gases. The results suggest an alternative route to distributed ammonia manufacture which can locally supply nitrogen fertilizer and also a method to capture stranded wind energy as a carbon-neutral liquid fuel.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN (United States)","USDOE Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E)","","United States","2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 827-834","","","AR0000804","Journal ID: ISSN 2168-0485; TRN: US1800320","10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03159","","2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","1412658","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1412658","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1412658","ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering","1","6"

This paper describes an innovative hybrid monopile foundation for OWTs, which is an optimization of the original monopile foundation with broader applications. The behavior of OWTs with the hybrid monopile foundation in service conditions are investigated under lateral cyclic loadings, by considering the effects of wind, waves, and ice. A series of centrifuge tests are conducted in order to analyze these behaviors in detail, and OWT models with the original single-pile as well as wheel-only foundations are tested for comparison. Based on these tests, the accumulated lateral displacement and stiffness during cyclic loadings are presented, and the results indicate that the hybrid foundation exhibits a larger cyclic capacity than the other foundations. The influence of the cycle numbers, cyclic loading characteristics, and soil properties is examined during the tests; furthermore, the effects of these factors on the model deformation responses are illustrated. This study proposes the first analytical method for quantitatively estimating the cyclic lateral displacement of the new hybrid foundation in service conditions, and a degradation coefficient is recommended based on the test results. This method aims to provide a simple approach to predicting responses of OWTs with hybrid monopile foundations in service conditions.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization (LEED), Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-11-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 209; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 127-139","","","EE0006714; DE‐EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619","10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.10.107","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1605662","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605662","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605662","Applied Energy","C","209"

"Investigation of high-speed shaft bearing loads in wind turbine gearboxes through dynamometer testing","Guo, Yi; Keller, Jonathan","17 WIND ENERGY; axial crack; bearing load; gearbox; reliability; white etching crack","Many wind turbine gearboxes require repair or replacement well before reaching the end of their design life. The most common failure is bearing axial cracks, commonly called white etching cracks (WECs), which typically occur in the inner raceways of the high-speed parallel-stage rolling element bearings. Although the root causes of WECs are debated, one theory is that they are related to routine dynamic operating conditions and occasional transient events prevalent in wind turbines that can result in high bearing stress and sliding of the rolling elements. Here, this paper examined wind turbine gearbox high-speed shaft bearing loads and stresses through modeling and full-scale dynamometer testing. Bearing outer race loads were directly measured and predicted using a variety of modeling tools in normal operations, misaligned conditions, and transient events particularly prone to bearing sliding. Test data and models of bearing loads were well correlated. Neither operational misalignment due to rotor moments nor static generator misalignment affected the bearing loads when compared with pure-torque conditions. Thus, it is not likely that generator misalignment is a causal factor of WECs. In contrast, during transient events, the bearings experienced alternating periods of high stress, torque reversals, and loads under the minimum requisite at high rotating speeds while showing indications of sliding, all of which could be related to the formation of WECs.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A pair of counter-rotating vortices are shown to be important in deforming the shape of the wake and in explaining the asymmetry of wake steering in oppositely signed yaw angles. We motivate the development of new physics for control-oriented engineering models of wind farm control, which include the effects of these large-scale flow structures. Such a new model would improve the predictability of control-oriented models. Results presented in this paper indicate that wind farm control strategies, based on new control-oriented models with new physics, that target total flow control over wake redirection may be different, and perhaps more effective, than current approaches. We propose that wind farm control and wake steering should be thought of as the generation of large-scale flow structures, which will aid in the improved performance of wind farms.</p>","European Academy of Wind Energy - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Consistent modelling of wind turbine noise propagation from source to receiver","Barlas, Emre; Zhu, Wei Jun; Shen, Wen Zhong; Dag, Kaya O.; Moriarty, Patrick J.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbines; acoustic signal processing; acoustical properties; flow instabilities; sound generation","The unsteady nature of wind turbine noise is a major reason for annoyance. The variation of far-field sound pressure levels is not only caused by the continuous change in wind turbine noise source levels but also by the unsteady flow field and the ground characteristics between the turbine and receiver. To take these phenomena into account, a consistent numerical technique that models the sound propagation from the source to receiver is developed. Large eddy simulation with an actuator line technique is employed for the flow modelling and the corresponding flow fields are used to simulate sound generation and propagation. The local blade relative velocity, angle of attack, and turbulence characteristics are input to the sound generation model. Time-dependent blade locations and the velocity between the noise source and receiver are considered within a quasi-3D propagation model. Long-range noise propagation of a 5 MW wind turbine is investigated. Sound pressure level time series evaluated at the source time are studied for varying wind speeds, surface roughness, and ground impedances within a 2000 m radius from the turbine.","Acoustical Society of America","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The project is run under the International Energy Agency Wind Research Task 30, and is focused on validating the tools used for modeling offshore wind systems through the comparison of simulated responses of select system designs to physical test data. Validation activities such as these lead to improvement of offshore wind modeling tools, which will enable the development of more innovative and cost-effective offshore wind designs. For Phase II of the project, numerical models of the DeepCwind floating semisubmersible wind system were validated using measurement data from a 1/50th-scale validation campaign performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands offshore wave basin. Validation of the models was performed by comparing the calculated ultimate and fatigue loads for eight different wave-only and combined wind/wave test cases against the measured data, after calibration was performed using free-decay, wind-only, and wave-only tests. The results show a decent estimation of both the ultimate and fatigue loads for the simulated results, but with a fairly consistent underestimation in the tower and upwind mooring line loads that can be attributed to an underestimation of wave-excitation forces outside the linear wave-excitation region, and the presence of broadband frequency excitation in the experimental measurements from wind. Participant results showed varied agreement with the experimental measurements based on the modeling approach used. Modeling attributes that enabled better agreement included: the use of a dynamic mooring model; wave stretching, or some other hydrodynamic modeling approach that excites frequencies outside the linear wave region; nonlinear wave kinematics models; and unsteady aerodynamics models. Also, it was observed that a Morison-only hydrodynamic modeling approach could create excessive pitch excitation and resulting tower loads in some frequency bands.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Bi-Level Arbitrage Potential Evaluation for Grid-Scale Energy Storage Considering Wind Power and LMP Smoothing Effect","Cui, Hantao; Li, Fangxing; Fang, Xin; Chen, Hao; Wang, Honggang","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 17 WIND ENERGY; energy storage; price arbitrage potential; locational marginal price; mathematic program with equilibrium constraints","Our paper deals with extended-term energy storage (ES) arbitrage problems to maximize the annual revenue in deregulated power systems with high penetration wind power. The conventional ES arbitrage model takes the locational marginal prices (LMP) as an input and is unable to account for the impacts of ES operations on system LMPs. This paper proposes a bi-level ES arbitrage model, where the upper level maximizes the ES arbitrage revenue and the lower level simulates the market clearing process considering wind power and ES. The bi-level model is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and then recast into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) using strong duality theory. Wind power fluctuations are characterized by the GARCH forecast model and the forecast error is modeled by forecast-bin based Beta distributions. Case studies are performed on a modified PJM 5-bus system and an IEEE 118-bus system with a weekly time horizon over an annual term to show the validity of the proposed bi-level model. The results from the conventional model and the bi-level model are compared under different ES power and energy ratings, and also various load and wind penetration levels.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The climate and air-quality benefits of wind and solar power in the United States","Millstein, Dev; Wiser, Ryan; Bolinger, Mark; Barbose, Galen","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 14 SOLAR ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; energy and society; environmental impact","Wind and solar energy reduce combustion-based electricity generation and provide air-quality and greenhouse gas emission benefits. These benefits vary dramatically by region and over time. From 2007 to 2015, solar and wind power deployment increased rapidly while regulatory changes and fossil fuel price changes led to steep cuts in overall power-sector emissions. In this paper, we evaluate how wind and solar climate and air-quality benefits evolved during this time period. We find cumulative wind and solar air-quality benefits of 2015 US$29.7–112.8 billion mostly from 3,000 to 12,700 avoided premature mortalities, and cumulative climate benefits of 2015 US5.3–106.8 billion. The ranges span results across a suite of air-quality and health impact models and social cost of carbon estimates. Finally, we find that binding cap-and-trade pollutant markets may reduce these cumulative benefits by up to 16%. In 2015, based on central estimates, combined marginal benefits equal 7.3 ¢ kWh<sup>-1</sup> (wind) and 4.0 ¢ kWh<sup>-1</sup> (solar).","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The structures of wakes and their downwind impacts are sensitive to wind speed and atmospheric variability. Wake characterization can provide important insights for turbine layout optimization in view of decreasing the cost of wind energy. The CWEX-13 field campaign, which took place between June and September 2013 in a wind farm in Iowa, was designed to explore the interaction of multiple wakes in a range of atmospheric stability conditions. Based on lidar wind measurements, we extend, present, and apply a quantitative algorithm to assess wake parameters such as the velocity deficits, the size of the wake boundaries, and the location of the wake centerlines. We focus on wakes from a row of four turbines at the leading edge of the wind farm to explore variations between wakes from the edge of the row (outer wakes) and those from turbines in the center of the row (inner wakes). Using multiple horizontal scans at different elevations, a three-dimensional structure of wakes from the row of turbines can be created. Wakes erode very quickly during unstable conditions and can in fact be detected primarily in stable conditions in the conditions measured here. During stable conditions, important differences emerge between the wakes of inner turbines and the wakes of outer turbines. Further, the strong wind veer associated with stable conditions results in a stretching of the wake structures, and this stretching manifests differently for inner and outer wakes. As a result, these insights can be incorporated into low-order wake models for wind farm layout optimization or for wind power forecasting.</p>","Copernicus Publications, EGU","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Aerodynamics and CFD analysis of equal size dual-rotor wind turbine","Sundararaju, Haripriya; Lo, King H.; Metcalfe, Ralph; Wang, Su Su","42 ENGINEERING; 17 WIND ENERGY","In this study, the linear momentum theory is used to analyze the power-extraction capability of dual-rotor wind turbines with equal-size rotors. The rotors of a dual-rotor wind turbine are modeled as two separate actuator disks. The stream tube encompassing the front rotor is modeled as two (inner and outer) stream tubes, with the rear rotor being fully enclosed within the front rotor inner stream tube. No assumption is made on airflow pressure in between the rotors. The effect of the front and rear rotor interaction on the airflow within the inner stream tube is included in the analysis. With the results obtained, axial thrusts on front and rear rotors are determined and later used as input for computational fluid dynamics simulation to determine flow characteristics across the rotors. Based on the flow pattern between the rotors, the total power coefficient of a dual-rotor wind turbine is related to the rotor separation distance. A general solution for the dual-rotor wind turbine is developed, which shows that the largest total power coefficient that can be obtained is 0.814, occurring at a rotor separation distance of 2.8 times the rotor diameter. Finally, the results of this study are compared with those obtained by similar studies reported in the literature. Discrepancies in the largest possible power coefficient of dual-rotor wind turbines reported in various investigations are examined and discussed.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Univ. of Houston, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-08-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 043305","","","EE0000295","Journal ID: ISSN 1941-7012","10.1063/1.4999500","","2019-10-30T00:00:00Z","1535340","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1535340","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1535340","Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy","4","9"

Changes to the FLORIS model were made to remove discontinuities and add curvature to regions of non-physical zero gradient. Exact gradients for the FLORIS model were obtained using algorithmic differentiation. A set of three case studies demonstrate that using exact gradients with gradient-based optimization reduces the number of function calls by several orders of magnitude. The case studies also show that adding curvature improves convergence behavior, allowing gradient-based optimization algorithms used with the FLORIS model to more reliably find better solutions to wind farm optimization problems.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The GALM can be coupled to any existing microscale solver with minimal or no modifications. The coupling of our GALM model with the open-source microscale code CgWind is used to demonstrate both its ease of use and fidelity. The results obtained from the coupled-model simulations are validated for both isolated turbine in wind tunnel experiments and measurements in offshore wind farm.

Suction bucket foundation is considered to be a viable type of wind turbine foundation. Soil liquefaction caused by earthquakes at offshore seismic active area may lead to a significant degradation of soil strength and stiffness. In this study, nine centrifuge tests were carried out to investigate the seismic response of suction bucket foundation under earthquake loading. Both dry and saturate soil conditions were considered in tests. The geometric design of five suction bucket models considered the bucket diameter, penetration depth, and modified buckets with inside compartments. It was found that soil underlying and near the bucket foundation shown a better ability to resist liquefaction in saturated tests comparing to free field while no significant differences were observed in dry tests. The five bucket models performed quite differently, which demonstrated the aspect ratio effects and inside-bucket compartment effects. The results provide insight into optimized design of suction bucket foundation for wind turbine.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-07-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable Energy; Journal Volume: 114; Journal Issue: Part B","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1013-1022","","","EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-1481","10.1016/j.renene.2017.07.103","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1605668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605668","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605668","Renewable Energy","Part B","114"

The variability caused by different turbulent inflow fields are captured by creating independent surrogates for the mean and standard deviation of each output with respect to the inflow realizations. A global sensitivity analysis shows that the turbulent inflow realization has a bigger impact on the total distribution of equivalent fatigue loads than the shear coefficient or yaw miss-alignment. The methodology presented extends the deterministic power and thrust coefficient curves to uncertainty models and adds new variables like damage equivalent fatigue loads in different components of the turbine. These surrogate models can then be implemented inside other work-flows such as: estimation of the uncertainty in annual energy production due to wind resource variability and/or robust wind power plant layout optimization. It can be concluded that it is possible to capture the global behavior of a modern wind turbine and its uncertainty under realistic inflow conditions using polynomial response surfaces. In conclusion, the surrogates are a way to obtain power and load estimation under site specific characteristics without sharing the proprietary aeroelastic design.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Dynamical downscaling from synoptic-scale down to resolved three-dimensional eddies in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was performed, spanning 4 orders of magnitude in horizontal grid resolution: from 111 km down to 8.2 m (30 m) in stable (convective) conditions. Computationally efficient mesoscale-to-microscale transition was made possible by the generalized cell perturbation method with time-varying parameters derived from mesoscale forcing conditions, which substantially reduced the fetch to achieve fully developed turbulence. In addition, careful design of the simulations was made to inhibit the presence of under-resolved convection at convection-resolving mesoscale resolution and to ensure proper turbulence representation in stably-stratified conditions. Comparison to in situ wind-profiling lidar and near-surface sonic anemometer measurements demonstrated the ability to reproduce the ABL structure throughout the entire diurnal cycle with a high degree of fidelity. The multiscale simulations exhibit realistic atmospheric features such as convective rolls and global intermittency. Also, the diurnal evolution of turbulence was accurately simulated, with probability density functions of resolved turbulent velocity fluctuations nearly identical to the lidar measurements. Explicit representation of turbulence in the stably-stratified ABL was found to provide the right balance with larger scales, resulting in the development of intra-hour variability as observed by the wind lidar; this variability was not captured by the mesoscale model. Moreover, multiscale simulations improved mean ABL characteristics such as horizontal velocity, vertical wind shear, and turbulence.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Generating short-term probabilistic wind power scenarios via nonparametric forecast error density estimators: Generating short-term probabilistic wind power scenarios via nonparametric forecast error density estimators","Staid, Andrea; Watson, Jean -Paul; Wets, Roger J. -B.; Woodruff, David L.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind power; forecasting; uncertainty; probabilistic scenarios; stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch","Forecasts of available wind power are critical in key electric power systems operations planning problems, including economic dispatch and unit commitment. Such forecasts are necessarily uncertain, limiting the reliability and cost effectiveness of operations planning models based on a single deterministic or “point” forecast. A common approach to address this limitation involves the use of a number of probabilistic scenarios, each specifying a possible trajectory of wind power production, with associated probability. We present and analyze a novel method for generating probabilistic wind power scenarios, leveraging available historical information in the form of forecasted and corresponding observed wind power time series. We estimate non-parametric forecast error densities, specifically using epi-spline basis functions, allowing us to capture the skewed and non-parametric nature of error densities observed in real-world data. We then describe a method to generate probabilistic scenarios from these basis functions that allows users to control for the degree to which extreme errors are captured.We compare the performance of our approach to the current state-of-the-art considering publicly available data associated with the Bonneville Power Administration, analyzing aggregate production of a number of wind farms over a large geographic region. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our approach in the context of specific power systems operations planning problems: stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch. Here, our methodology is embodied in the joint Sandia – University of California Davis Prescient software package for assessing and analyzing stochastic operations strategies.","Wiley","","Sandia National Lab.

"Nested mesoscale-to-LES modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer in the presence of under-resolved convective structures","Mazzaro, L. J.; Muñoz-Esparza, D.; Lundquist, J. K.; Linn, R.

Grid-nesting can alleviate this by bridging mesoscales and microscales, but one turbulence scheme must run at resolutions within a range of scales known as the terra incognita (TI). TI grid-cell sizes can violate both mesoscale and microscale subgrid-scale parametrization assumptions, resulting in unrealistic flow structures. Herein we assess the impact of unrealistic lateral boundary conditions from parent mesoscale simulations at TI resolutions on nested large eddy simulations (LES), to determine whether parent domains bias the nested LES. We present a series of idealized nested mesoscale-to-LES runs of a dry convective boundary layer (CBL) with different parent resolutions in the TI. We compare the nested LES with a stand-alone LES with periodic boundary conditions. The nested LES domains develop ~20% smaller convective structures, while potential temperature profiles are nearly identical for both the mesoscales and LES simulations. The horizontal wind speed and surface wind shear in the nested simulations closely resemble the reference LES. Heat fluxes are overestimated by up to ~0.01 K m s-1 in the top half of the PBL for all nested simulations. Overestimates of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds stress in the nested domains are proportional to the parent domain's grid-cell size, and are almost eliminated for the simulation with the finest parent grid-cell size. Based on these results, we recommend that LES of the CBL be forced by mesoscale simulations with the finest practical resolution.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Los Alamos National Lab.

Wind farm controls can be used to increase power production or reduce overall structural loads by properly coordinating turbines. One wind farm control strategy that is addressed in literature is known as wake steering, wherein upstream turbines operate in yaw misaligned conditions to redirect their wakes away from downstream turbines. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO conducted a demonstration of wake steering on a single utility-scale turbine. In this campaign, the turbine was operated at various yaw misalignment setpoints while a lidar mounted on the nacelle scanned five downstream distances. The lidar measurements were combined with turbine data, as well as measurements of the inflow made by a highly instrumented meteorological mast upstream. The full-scale measurements are used to validate controls-oriented tools, including wind turbine wake models, used for wind farm controls and optimization.

The centrifuge tests were performed in lightly over-consolidated clay and heavily over-consolidated clay, and three bucket foundation models with aspect ratios of 0.38, 0.5, and 1.3 were tested. The tests were force-controlled, and both static loads and cyclic loads were applied. In static tests, ultimate bearing capacities of suction bucket foundations were extracted from load-displacement curves as the first method, and the results were reinforced by stiffness-displacement curves. The displacement rates were calculated to find critical bearing capacities and ultimate bearing capacities of the foundations as the second method.

RES units today represent a major share of the generation, and the traditional approach of integrating themas grid following units can lead to frequency instability. Many researchers have pointed towards using inverters with virtual inertia control algorithms so that they appear as synchronous generators to the grid, maintaining and enhancing system stability. Our paper presents a literature review of the current state-of-the-art of virtual inertia implementation techniques, and explores potential research directions and challenges. The major virtual inertia topologies are compared and classified. Through literature review and simulations of some selected topologies it has been shown that similar inertial response can be achieved by relating the parameters of these topologies through time constants and inertia constants, although the exact frequency dynamics may vary slightly. The suitability of a topology depends on system control architecture and desired level of detail in replication of the dynamics of synchronous generators. We present a discussion on the challenges and research directions which points out several research needs, especially for systems level integration of virtual inertia systems.","MDPI","","Idaho National Lab.

"Lateral response of improved suction bucket foundation for offshore wind turbine in centrifuge modelling","Wang, Xuefei; Yang, Xu; Zeng, Xiangwu","17 WIND ENERGY; Centrifuge modelling; Improved suction bucket foundation (ISBF); Lateral response; Sandy soil; Wind turbine","The purpose of our research is to evaluate the improved suction bucket foundation (ISBF) for the offshore wind turbine. The ISBF included the design of two types of internal compartments inside buckets with different aspect ratios (AP). A series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the lateral bearing behavior of ISBF in four types of sandy soils. Both static and cyclic lateral loads were applied by an electrical actuator in a load-controlled system. The first technique interpolated the lateral bearing capacity from the load-displacement curve and reinforced the results with the stiffness-displacement relationship. Moreover, displacement rate was calculated and plotted to obtain the lateral critical and ultimate bearing capacity as the second method. During cyclic tests, the first several cycles changed the lateral displacement and stiffness significantly, whereas the last several cycles did not obviously affect them. It was demonstrated that the geometric designs of ISBF had limited influence on its lateral bearing behavior, but the soil conditions of the foundation did bring about an obvious difference. The lateral capacity of ISBF was further compared to original suction bucket foundation (OSBF), thereby illustrating the advantages of the ISBF in offshore wind turbine constructions.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Twelve possible combinations of three WF level reactive power dispatch strategies and four Wind Turbine (WT) level reactive power control strategies are investigated. All of the combined strategies are formulated based on the comprehensive loss models of WFs, including the loss models of DFIGs, converters, filters, transformers, and cables of the collection system. Optimization problems are solved by a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of these strategies is evaluated by simulations on a carefully designed WF under a series of cases with different wind speeds and reactive power requirements of the WF. The wind speed at each WT inside the WF is calculated using the Jensen wake model. The results show that the best reactive power dispatch strategy for loss minimization comes when the WF level strategy and WT level control are coordinated and the losses from each device in the WF are considered in the objective.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"How low can you go? The importance of quantifying minimum generation levels for renewable integration","Denholm, Paul; Brinkman, Greg; Mai, Trieu","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; renewable integration; electricity planning; grid modeling; grid flexibility","One of the significant limitations of solar and wind deployment is declining value caused by the limited correlation of renewable energy supply and electricity demand as well as limited flexibility of the power system. Limited flexibility can result from thermal and hydro plants that cannot turn off or reduce output due to technical or economic limits. These limits include the operating range of conventional thermal power plants, the need for process heat from combined heat and power plants, and restrictions on hydro unit operation. To appropriately analyze regional and national energy policies related to renewable deployment, these limits must be accurately captured in grid planning models. In this work, we summarize data sources and methods for U.S. power plants that can be used to capture minimum generation levels in grid planning tools, such as production cost models. We also provide case studies for two locations in the U.S. (California and Texas) that demonstrate the sensitivity of variable generation (VG) curtailment to grid flexibility assumptions which shows the importance of analyzing (and documenting) minimum generation levels in studies of increased VG penetration.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Using Large-Eddy Simulations to Define Spectral and Coherence Characteristics of the Hurricane Boundary Layer for Wind-Energy Applications","Worsnop, Rochelle P.; Bryan, George H.; Lundquist, Julie K.; Zhang, Jun A.","17 WIND ENERGY; hurricane boundary layer; large-eddy simulation; tropical cyclone; wind-turbine design","Offshore wind-energy development is planned for regions where hurricanes commonly occur, such as the USA Atlantic Coast. Even the most robust wind-turbine design (IEC Class I) may be unable to withstand a Category-2 hurricane (hub-height wind speeds >50 m s<sup>-1</sup>). Characteristics of the hurricane boundary layer that affect the structural integrity of turbines, especially in major hurricanes, are poorly understood, primarily due to a lack of adequate observations that span typical turbine heights (<200 m above sea level). To provide these data, we use large-eddy simulations to produce wind profiles of an idealized Category-5 hurricane at high spatial (10 m) and temporal (0.1 s) resolution. By comparison with unique flight-level observations from a field project, we find that a relatively simple configuration of the Cloud Model I model accurately represents the properties of Hurricane Isabel (2003) in terms of mean wind speeds, wind-speed variances, and power spectra. Comparisons of power spectra and coherence curves derived from our hurricane simulations to those used in current turbine design standards suggest that adjustments to these standards may be needed to capture characteristics of turbulence seen within the simulated hurricane boundary layer. To enable improved design standards for wind turbines to withstand hurricanes, we suggest modifications to account for shifts in peak power to higher frequencies and greater spectral coherence at large separations.","Springer","","Univ. of Colorado, Boulder, CO (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Optimization Under Uncertainty for Wake Steering Strategies","Quick, Julian; Annoni, Jennifer; King, Ryan N.; Dykes, Katherine L.; Fleming, Paul A.; Ning, Andrew","17 WIND ENERGY; wake steering; wind energy; optimization under uncertainty; yaw; control","Here, wind turbines in a wind power plant experience significant power losses because of aerodynamic interactions between turbines. One control strategy to reduce these losses is known as 'wake steering,' in which upstream turbines are yawed to direct wakes away from downstream turbines. Previous wake steering research has assumed perfect information, however, there can be significant uncertainty in many aspects of the problem, including wind inflow and various turbine measurements. Uncertainty has significant implications for performance of wake steering strategies. Consequently, the authors formulate and solve an optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problem for finding optimal wake steering strategies in the presence of yaw angle uncertainty. The OUU wake steering strategy is demonstrated on a two-turbine test case and on the utility-scale, offshore Princess Amalia Wind Farm. When we accounted for yaw angle uncertainty in the Princess Amalia Wind Farm case, inflow-direction-specific OUU solutions produced between 0% and 1.4% more power than the deterministically optimized steering strategies, resulting in an overall annual average improvement of 0.2%. More importantly, the deterministic optimization is expected to perform worse and with more downside risk than the OUU result when realistic uncertainty is taken into account. Additionally, the OUU solution produces fewer extreme yaw situations than the deterministic solution.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Grid refinement in the vertical dimension removes the requirement of different grid aspect ratios on the bounding versus the nested domain, such that results from refinement are in the horizontal directions only, and thereby can also reduce numerical errors on the bounding domain arising from large aspect ratios in the presence of complex terrain. Herein, the impacts of vertical grid refinement on the evolving downstream flow in nested large-eddy simulations are evaluated in relation to other model configuration choices, including turbulence subfilter-scale (SFS) stress models, mesh configuration, and alternative methods for calculating several near-surface flow parameters. Although vertical nesting requires coarsening of the vertical grid on the bounding domain, leading to a smaller range of resolved turbulence scales in the nest’s lateral boundary conditions, parameter values within the nested domains are generally only minimally impacted, relative to nesting using the same vertical grid on each domain. Two dynamic SFS models examined herein generally improved the simulated mean wind speed, turbulence kinetic energy, stresses and spectra, on both domains, and accelerated equilibration rates within nested domains, relative to two constant coefficient models. A new method of extrapolating horizontal velocity components to near-surface locations at nested domain lateral boundaries, and a correction to the calculation of deformation elements near the surface, are each shown to slightly alter the mean parameter values, yet only minimally impact equilibration rates within the nested domain.</p>","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

This review synthesizes the literature, revealing the following lessons learned. (1) North American support for wind has been consistently high. (2) The NIMBY explanation for resistance to wind development is invalid. (3) Socioeconomic impacts of wind development are strongly tied to acceptance. (4) Sound and visual impacts of wind facilities are strongly tied to annoyance and opposition, and ignoring these concerns can exacerbate conflict. (5) Environmental concerns matter, though less than other factors, and these concerns can both help and hinder wind development. (6) Issues of fairness, participation, and trust during the development process influence acceptance. (7) Distance from turbines affects other explanatory variables, but alone its influence is unclear. (8) Viewing opposition as something to be overcome prevents meaningful understandings and implementation of best practices. (9) Implementation of research findings into practice has been limited. The paper also identifies areas for future research on wind acceptance. With continued research efforts and a commitment toward implementing research findings into developer and policymaker practice, conflict and perceived injustices around proposed and existing wind energy facilities might be significantly lessened.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Gusts and mean wind speeds near the eyewall of a category 5 hurricane exceed the current Class I turbine design threshold of 50 m s<sup>–1</sup> mean wind and 70 m s<sup>–1</sup> gusts. Largest gust factors occur at the eye-eyewall interface. Further, shifts in wind direction suggest that turbines must rotate or yaw faster than current practice. Although current design standards omit mention of wind direction change across the rotor layer, large values (15–50°) suggest that veer should be considered.","American Geophysical Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Atmospheric turbulence affects wind turbine nacelle transfer functions","St. Martin, Clara M.; Lundquist, Julie K. (ORCID:0000000154902702); Clifton, Andrew (ORCID:0000000196985083); Poulos, Gregory S.; Schreck, Scott J.","17 WIND ENERGY; nacelle anemometry; nacelle transfer function; atmospheric stability; turbulence","<p>Despite their potential as a valuable source of individual turbine power performance and turbine array energy production optimization information, nacelle-mounted anemometers have often been neglected because complex flows around the blades and nacelle interfere with their measurements. This work quantitatively explores the accuracy of and potential corrections to nacelle anemometer measurements to determine the degree to which they may be useful when corrected for these complex flows, particularly for calculating annual energy production (AEP) in the absence of other meteorological data. Using upwind meteorological tower measurements along with nacelle-based measurements from a General Electric (GE) 1.5sle model, we calculate empirical nacelle transfer functions (NTFs) and explore how they are impacted by different atmospheric and turbulence parameters. This work provides guidelines for the use of NTFs for deriving useful wind measurements from nacelle-mounted anemometers. Corrections to the nacelle anemometer wind speed measurements can be made with NTFs and used to calculate an AEP that comes within 1&amp;thinsp;% of an AEP calculated with upwind measurements. We also calculate unique NTFs for different atmospheric conditions defined by temperature stratification as well as turbulence intensity, turbulence kinetic energy, and wind shear. During periods of low stability as defined by the Bulk Richardson number (<i>R<sub>B</sub></i>), the nacelle-mounted anemometer underestimates the upwind wind speed more than during periods of high stability at some wind speed bins below rated speed, leading to a more steep NTF during periods of low stability. Similarly, during periods of high turbulence, the nacelle-mounted anemometer underestimates the upwind wind speed more than during periods of low turbulence at most wind bins between cut-in and rated wind speed. Based on these results, we suggest different NTFs be calculated for different regimes of atmospheric stability and turbulence for power performance validation purposes.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Methodology for optimizing composite towers for use on floating wind turbines","Young, Andrew C.; Goupee, Andrew J.; Dagher, Habib J.; Viselli, Anthony M.","42 ENGINEERING; 17 WIND ENERGY","A methodology for the design and optimization of a composite wind turbine tower for use on a floating offshore platform is presented. A composite turbine tower on a floating offshore platform not only has the potential to reduce maintenance and upkeep costs associated with the use of steel offshore but also has potential to reduce the tower mass and subsequently the support platform mass. The optimization problem is formulated to obtain a turbine tower that meets all strength and serviceability criteria and minimizes the tower mass. The optimization and design process link a number of dynamic analyses and finite element routines using a genetic algorithm. This work documents the optimization and design software and illustrates its use in various case studies for a 6 MW floating wind turbine system. Case studies include the optimization of a steel tower as a comparison to a composite material tower and the use of a cored, sandwich panel composite tower versus a solid composite tower. The results demonstrate that significant reductions in the tower mass are likely when comparing a steel tower with a composite tower. Also demonstrated for the platform and turbine configuration considered in this work is that the minimum mass tower design is driven towards a solid shell composite configuration, rather than a sandwich panel tower shell, in the face of reasonable design constraints.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","University of Maine, Orono, ME (United States).

"Centrifuge modeling of lateral bearing behavior of offshore wind turbine with suction bucket foundation in sand","Wang, Xuefei; Yang, Xu; Zeng, Xiangwu","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING","Suction bucket foundation is a promising alternative for offshore wind turbine foundations. The lateral bearing behavior and failure mechanism are significant topics for optimizing its design criteria. In this study, a group of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the lateral bearing capacity of suction bucket foundation with three aspect ratios. Force-controlled lateral static and cyclic tests were performed at a centrifuge acceleration of 50g. Four soil conditions were considered in centrifuge tests with a combination of loose/dense and dry/saturated sand. The load-displacement and the stiffness-displacement relationships are presented in the paper, and it is concluded that the lateral bearing capacity can be reached when the normalized lateral displacement (displacement divided by the bucket diameter) reached 3% as the first method. Displacement rates are plotted against the lateral load to give the second method for defining the ultimate lateral capacity. In cyclic tests, the lateral displacement and stiffness are correlated to the cycle numbers in the first 5 cycles, but the change is less apparent in the rest. The results demonstrated the behavior of bucket foundation in service conditions. Finally, a simplified calculation method is used as the third method and checked with tests results.","Elsevier","","Lake Erie Energy Development Organization, Cleveland, OH (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-05-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Engineering; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 140-151","","","EE0006714; DE‐EE0006714","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-8018","10.1016/j.oceaneng.2017.04.046","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1605664","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1605664","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1605664","Ocean Engineering","C","139"

Results indicate a mean absolute error (MAE) in the temperature retrieved by the microwave radiometers below 1.5 K in the lowest 5?km of the atmosphere and a mean absolute error in the virtual temperature measured by the radio acoustic sounding systems below 0.8 K in the layer of the atmosphere covered by these measurements (up to approximately 1.6-2 km). We also investigated the benefit of the vertical velocity correction applied to the speed of sound before computing the virtual temperature by the radio acoustic sounding systems. We find that using this correction frequently increases the RASS error, and that it should not be routinely applied to all data.<br><br>Water vapor density (WVD) profiles measured by the MWRs were also compared with similar measurements from the soundings, showing the capability of MWRs to follow the vertical profile measured by the sounding and finding a mean absolute error below 0.5 g m<sup>-3</sup> in the lowest 5 km of the atmosphere. However, the relative humidity profiles measured by the microwave radiometer lack the high-resolution details available from radiosonde profiles. Furthermore, an encouraging and significant finding of this study was that the coefficient of determination between the lapse rate measured by the microwave radiometer and the tower measurements over the tower levels between 50 and 300 m ranged from 0.76 to 0.91, proving that these remote-sensing instruments can provide accurate information on atmospheric stability conditions in the lower boundary layer.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Observations were made on three tall masts, forming an inland transect of approximately 5 km. The wind distribution is found to be bimodal and governed by synoptic scales, with onshore and offshore flow regimes. The behavior between the coastal and inland sites is found to be very similar when the flow is directed offshore; for onshore flow, stark differences occur. The mean wind speed at the coastal site is approximately 20% greater than the most inland site and is nearly constant throughout the diurnal cycle. Furthermore, for both flow regimes, the influence of the land–sea breeze circulation is inconsequential relative to the large-scale synoptic forcing. Composite time series are used to study the evolution of sensible heat flux and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) throughout the morning and evening transitions. The TKE budget reveals that at the coastal site mechanical production of TKE is much more important than buoyant production. This allows for the unexpected case in which TKE increases through the ET despite the decrease of buoyant TKE production. Multiresolution flux decomposition is used to further study this phenomenon as well as the evolution of the sensible heat flux at differing time scales. We present an idealized schematic to illustrate the timing and structure of the morning and evening transitions for an inland site and a coastal site that are subjected to similar synoptic forcing.","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

While wind brings us clean and inexpensive energy, its inherent variability and uncertainty present challenges for the power grid. In particular, employing wind energy for power system restoration is very challenging. A fast and reliable restoration plays a vital role to achieve the self-healing power grid. This paper develops a novel offline restoration planning tool for harnessing wind energy to enhance grid resilience. The wind-for-restoration problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem with generated wind energy scenarios. The problem is then decomposed into two stages and solved with the integer L-shaped algorithm. Numerical experiments have been conducted through different case studies using the modified IEEE 57-bus system. The developed tool can provide the scheduled wind power at each restoration time. The impact of wind energy is investigated from the aspects of location and inertia capability, as well as wind penetration, fluctuation, and uncertainty. Moreover, a dynamic response validation tool is developed to validate the results of optimization problem in a dynamic simulation software. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal wind harnessing strategy can help improve system restoration process and enhance system resilience.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2017-07-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 16-28","","","EE0007327; EE0007998","Journal ID: ISSN 1949-3053","10.1109/TSG.2017.2729592","","2021-08-02T00:00:00Z","1601134","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1601134","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1601134","IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","1","10"
"Power-Smoothing Scheme of a DFIG Using the Adaptive Gain Depending on the Rotor Speed and Frequency Deviation","Lee, Hyewon; Hwang, Min; Muljadi, Eduard; Sorensen, Poul; Kang, Yong Cheol","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power smoothing; doubly-fed induction generator; frequency regulation; adaptive gain; rotor speed; frequency deviation","In an electric power grid that has a high penetration level of wind, the power fluctuation of a large-scale wind power plant (WPP) caused by varying wind speeds deteriorates the system frequency regulation. This paper proposes a power-smoothing scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) that significantly mitigates the system frequency fluctuation while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed. The proposed scheme employs an additional control loop relying on the system frequency deviation that operates in combination with the maximum power point tracking control loop. To improve the power-smoothing capability while preventing over-deceleration of the rotor speed, the gain of the additional loop is modified with the rotor speed and frequency deviation. The gain is set to be high if the rotor speed and/or frequency deviation is large. In conclusion, the simulation results based on the IEEE 14-bus system clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly lessens the output power fluctuation of a WPP under various scenarios by modifying the gain with the rotor speed and frequency deviation, and thereby it can regulate the frequency deviation within a narrow range.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The algorithm, which is based on the traditional velocity-azimuth-display (VAD) technique, estimates the wind speed and direction measurement precision using standard error propagation techniques, assuming the input data (i.e., radial velocities) to be contaminated by random, zero-mean, errors. For this study, the lidar was configured to execute an 8-beam plan-position-indicator (PPI) scan once every 12 min during the 6-week deployment period. Several wind retrieval trials were conducted using different schemes for estimating the precision in the radial velocity measurements. Here, the resulting wind speed and direction precision estimates were compared to differences in wind speed and direction between the VAD algorithm and sonic anemometer measurements taken on a nearby 300 m tower.","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

By solving the adjoint equations of the flow model, the gradients needed for optimization are found at a cost that is independent of the number of control variables, thereby permitting optimization of large wind plants with many turbine locations. Moreover, compared to the common approach of superimposing prescribed wake deficits onto linearized flow models, the computational efficiency of the adjoint approach allows the use of higher-fidelity RANS flow models which can capture nonlinear turbulent flow physics within a wind plant. The steady-state RANS flow model is implemented in the Python finite-element package <tt>FEniCS</tt> and the derivation and solution of the discrete adjoint equations are automated within the <tt>dolfin-adjoint</tt> framework.

Herein, we summarize the XPIA field experiment, highlight novel measurement approaches, and quantify uncertainties associated with these measurement methods. Line-of-sight velocities measured by scanning lidars and radars exhibit close agreement with tower measurements, despite differences in measurement volumes. Virtual towers of wind measurements, from multiple lidars or radars, also agree well with tower and profiling lidar measurements. Estimates of winds over volumes from scanning lidars and radars are in close agreement, enabling assessment of spatial variability. Strengths of the radar systems used here include high scan rates, large domain coverage, and availability during most precipitation events, but they struggle at times to provide data during periods with limited atmospheric scatterers. In contrast, for the deployment geometry tested here, the lidars have slower scan rates and less range, but provide more data during non-precipitating atmospheric conditions. Microwave radiometers provide temperature profiles with approximately the same uncertainty as Radio-Acoustic Sounding Systems (RASS). Using a motion platform, we assess motion-compensation algorithms for lidars to be mounted on offshore platforms. As a result, we highlight cases for validation of mesoscale or large-eddy simulations, providing information on accessing the archived dataset. We conclude that modern remote sensing systems provide a generational improvement in observational capabilities, enabling resolution of fine-scale processes critical to understanding inhomogeneous boundary-layer flows.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, analysis indicates that extreme-scale systems (10-20 MW) will have larger angles that may benefit from downwind-aligned configurations. To examine potential rotor mass reduction, the pre-alignment concept was investigated a two-bladed configuration by keeping the structural and aerodynamic characteristics of each blade fixed (to avoids a complete blade re-design). Simulations for a 13.2 MW rated rotor at steady-state conditions show that this concept-level two-bladed design may yield 25% rotor mass savings while also reducing average blade stress over all wind speeds. These results employed a pre-alignment on the basis of a wind speed of 1.25 times the rated wind speed. The downwind pre-aligned concept may also reduce damage equivalent loads on the blades by 60% for steady rated wind conditions. Even higher mass and damage equivalent load savings (relative to conventional upwind designs) may be possible for larger systems (15-20 MW) for which load-alignment angles become even larger. Furthermore, much more work is needed to determine whether this concept can be translated into a practical design that must meet a wide myriad of other criteria.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, we show that the tracking of a certain power reference signal provided by the transmission system operator can be significantly improved by using feedback control at the wind farm level. We propose a simple feedback control law that significantly improves the tracking behavior of the total power output of the farm, resulting in higher performance scores.

This is made possible by controlled inertial response, which is demonstrated on a research turbine - controls advanced research turbine, 3-bladed (CART3). Two distinct inertial control (IC) methods are analysed in terms of their impacts on the grids and the response of the turbine itself. The released kinetic energy in the IC methods are determined by the frequency measurement or shaped active power reference in the turbine speed-power plane. The wind turbine model is based on the high-fidelity turbine simulator fatigue, aerodynamic, structures and turbulence, which constitutes the aggregated wind power plant model with the simplified power converter model. The IC methods are implemented over the baseline CART3 controller, evaluated in the modified 9-bus and 14-bus testing power grids considering different wind speeds and different wind power penetration levels. The simulation results provide various insights on designing such kinds of ICs. The authors calculate the short-term dynamic equivalent loads and give a discussion about the turbine structural loadings related to the inertial response.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A novel vibration-based fault diagnostic algorithm for gearboxes under speed fluctuations without rotational speed measurement","Hong, Liu; Qu, Yongzhi; Dhupia, Jaspreet Singh; Sheng, Shuangwen; Tan, Yuegang; Zhou, Zude","17 WIND ENERGY; gear fault diagnosis; tacho-less algorithm; speed fluctuations; vibration; gearbox","The localized failures of gears introduce cyclic-transient impulses in the measured gearbox vibration signals. These impulses are usually identified from the sidebands around gear-mesh harmonics through the spectral analysis of cyclo-stationary signals. However, in practice, several high-powered applications of gearboxes like wind turbines are intrinsically characterized by nonstationary processes that blur the measured vibration spectra of a gearbox and deteriorate the efficacy of spectral diagnostic methods. Although order-tracking techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of spectral diagnosis for nonstationary signals measured in such applications, the required hardware for the measurement of rotational speed of these machines is often unavailable in industrial settings. Moreover, existing tacho-less order-tracking approaches are usually limited by the high time-frequency resolution requirement, which is a prerequisite for the precise estimation of the instantaneous frequency. To address such issues, a novel fault-signature enhancement algorithm is proposed that can alleviate the spectral smearing without the need of rotational speed measurement. This proposed tacho-less diagnostic technique resamples the measured acceleration signal of the gearbox based on the optimal warping path evaluated from the fast dynamic time-warping algorithm, which aligns a filtered shaft rotational harmonic signal with respect to a reference signal assuming a constant shaft rotational speed estimated from the approximation of operational speed. The effectiveness of this method is validated using both simulated signals from a fixed-axis gear pair under nonstationary conditions and experimental measurements from a 750-kW planetary wind turbine gearbox on a dynamometer test rig. Lastly, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identify fault information from typical gearbox vibration measurements carried out in a resource-constrained industrial environment.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"An error reduction algorithm to improve lidar turbulence estimates for wind energy","Newman, Jennifer F.; Clifton, Andrew (ORCID:0000000196985083)","17 WIND ENERGY; lidar; turbulence; power prediction; machine learning","<p>Remote-sensing devices such as lidars are currently being investigated as alternatives to cup anemometers on meteorological towers for the measurement of wind speed and direction. Although lidars can measure mean wind speeds at heights spanning an entire turbine rotor disk and can be easily moved from one location to another, they measure different values of turbulence than an instrument on a tower. Current methods for improving lidar turbulence estimates include the use of analytical turbulence models and expensive scanning lidars. While these methods provide accurate results in a research setting, they cannot be easily applied to smaller, vertically profiling lidars in locations where high-resolution sonic anemometer data are not available. Thus, there is clearly a need for a turbulence error reduction model that is simpler and more easily applicable to lidars that are used in the wind energy industry.<br><br> In this work, a new turbulence error reduction algorithm for lidars is described. The Lidar Turbulence Error Reduction Algorithm, L-TERRA, can be applied using only data from a stand-alone vertically profiling lidar and requires minimal training with meteorological tower data. The basis of L-TERRA is a series of physics-based corrections that are applied to the lidar data to mitigate errors from instrument noise, volume averaging, and variance contamination. These corrections are applied in conjunction with a trained machine-learning model to improve turbulence estimates from a vertically profiling WINDCUBE v2 lidar. The lessons learned from creating the L-TERRA model for a WINDCUBE v2 lidar can also be applied to other lidar devices.<br><br> L-TERRA was tested on data from two sites in the Southern Plains region of the United States. The physics-based corrections in L-TERRA brought regression line slopes much closer to 1 at both sites and significantly reduced the sensitivity of lidar turbulence errors to atmospheric stability. The accuracy of machine-learning methods in L-TERRA was highly dependent on the input variables and training dataset used, suggesting that machine learning may not be the best technique for reducing lidar turbulence intensity (TI) error. Future work will include the use of a lidar simulator to better understand how different factors affect lidar turbulence error and to determine how these errors can be reduced using information from a stand-alone lidar.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Different strategic decision support tools can be applied to this problem, but much uncertainty remains regarding both input data and modelling assumptions. Our paper aims to investigate and ultimately reduce this uncertainty by comparing four simulation tools, one mathematical optimisation tool and one analytic spreadsheet-based tool applied to select the O&M access vessel fleet that minimizes the total O&M cost of a reference wind farm. The comparison shows that the tools generally agree on the optimal vessel fleet, but only partially agree on the relative ranking of the different vessel fleets in terms of total O&M cost. The robustness of the vessel fleet selection to various input data assumptions was tested, and the ranking was found to be particularly sensitive to the vessels' limiting significant wave height for turbine access. Also the parameter with the greatest discrepancy between the tools, implies that accurate quantification and modelling of this parameter is crucial. The ranking is moderately sensitive to turbine failure rates and vessel day rates but less sensitive to electricity price and vessel transit speed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

DAC incorporates a predetermined waveform model and uses it as part of the state-space formulation, which is known as the internal model principle to reduce or minimize the wind disturbance effects on the outputs of the wind turbine. An asymptotically stabilizing DAC controller with disturbance impact on the wind turbine being totally canceled out can be found if certain conditions are fulfilled. Designing a rotor speed regulation controller without steady-state error is important for applying linear control methodology such as DAC on wind turbines. Therefore, solvability conditions of DAC without steady-state error are attractive and can be taken as examples when designing a multitask turbine controller. DAC controllers solved via Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse and the Kronecker product are discussed, and solvability conditions of using them are given. Additionally, a new solvability condition based on inverting the feed-through D term is proposed for the sake of reducing computational burden in the Kronecker product. Applications of designing collective pitch and independent pitch controllers based on DAC are presented. Recommendations of designing a DAC-based wind turbine controller are given. A DAC controller motivated by the proposed solvability condition that utilizes the inverse of feed-through D term is developed to mitigate the blade flapwise once-per-revolution bending moment together with a standard proportional integral controller in the control loop to assist rotor speed regulation. Simulation studies verify the discussed solvability conditions of DAC and show the effectiveness of the proposed DAC control design methodology.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This allowed for at least one sonic anemometer at each level to be upstream of the tower at all times and for identification of the times when a sonic anemometer is in the wake of the tower frame. Other instrumentation, including profiling and scanning lidars aided in the identification of the tower wake. Here we compare pairs of sonic anemometers at the same heights to identify the range of directions that are affected by the tower for each of the opposing booms. The mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are used to quantify the wake impact on these first- and second-order wind measurements, showing up to a 50% reduction in wind speed and an order of magnitude increase in turbulent kinetic energy. Comparisons of wind speeds from profiling and scanning lidars confirmed the extent of the tower wake, with the same reduction in wind speed observed in the tower wake, and a speed-up effect around the wake boundaries. Wind direction differences between pairs of sonic anemometers and between sonic anemometers and lidars can also be significant, as the flow is deflected by the tower structure. Comparisons of lengths of averaging intervals showed a decrease in wind speed deficit with longer averages, but the flow deflection remains constant over longer averages. Furthermore, asymmetry exists in the tower effects due to the geometry and placement of the booms on the triangular tower. An analysis of the percentage of observations in the wake that must be removed from 2 min mean wind speed and 20 min turbulent values showed that removing even small portions of the time interval due to wakes impacts these two quantities. Furthermorew, a vast majority of intervals have no observations in the tower wake, so removing the full 2 or 20 min intervals does not diminish the XPIA dataset.</p>","European Geosciences Union","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Why wind-farm developers should care about measuring atmospheric turbulence? [Chaos in the Air: Unraveling the Complex Relationship Between Wind Power and Atmospheric turbulence]","Wharton, Sonia; Newman, Jennifer F.","17 WIND ENERGY","The role of atmospheric turbulence in influencing wind-turbine power production remains an unsolved mystery despite a growing number of researchers who have attempted to make sense of this issue. Turbulence, a term for short-term deviations around the average wind speed, can cause fluctuations in turbine power production and structural loads. While research strongly suggests that ignoring atmospheric turbulence can result in significant errors in power-curve measurements and annual energy production, it appears that there may be no universal relationship between turbulence and power production. Typically when we think of a wind farm operating in a turbulent atmosphere, we picture a waked turbine, battered by vortex eddies (circular wind flow) shed from turbine blades upwind. However, turbulence is present nearly everywhere, and is constantly produced and diminished over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.

"Optimal smoothing length scale for actuator line models of wind turbine blades based on Gaussian body force distribution: Wind energy, actuator line model","Martínez-Tossas, L. A.; Churchfield, M. J.; Meneveau, C.","17 WIND ENERGY; actuator line model; large eddy simulations; wind turbine blades; wind energy","The actuator line model (ALM) is a commonly used method to represent lifting surfaces such as wind turbine blades within large-eddy simulations (LES). In the ALM, the lift and drag forces are replaced by an imposed body force that is typically smoothed over several grid points using a Gaussian kernel with some prescribed smoothing width e. To date, the choice of e has most often been based on numerical considerations related to the grid spacing used in LES. However, especially for finely resolved LES with grid spacings on the order of or smaller than the chord length of the blade, the best choice of e is not known. In this work, a theoretical approach is followed to determine the most suitable value of e, based on an analytical solution to the linearized inviscid flow response to a Gaussian force. We find that the optimal smoothing width eopt is on the order of 14%-25% of the chord length of the blade, and the center of force is located at about 13%-26% downstream of the leading edge of the blade for the cases considered. These optimal values do not depend on angle of attack and depend only weakly on the type of lifting surface. It is then shown that an even more realistic velocity field can be induced by a 2-D elliptical Gaussian lift-force kernel. Some results are also provided regarding drag force representation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Stochastic Multi-Timescale Power System Operations With Variable Wind Generation","Wu, Hongyu; Krad, Ibrahim; Florita, Anthony; Hodge, Bri-Mathias; Ibanez, Eduardo; Zhang, Jie; Ela, Erik","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; stochastic processes; biological system modeling; load modeling; optimization; economics; reliability; generators","This paper describes a novel set of stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch models that consider stochastic loads and variable generation at multiple operational timescales. The stochastic model includes four distinct stages: stochastic day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC), stochastic real-time SCUC, stochastic real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED), and deterministic automatic generation control (AGC). These sub-models are integrated together such that they are continually updated with decisions passed from one to another. The progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is applied to solve the stochastic models to maintain the computational tractability of the proposed models. Comparative case studies with deterministic approaches are conducted in low wind and high wind penetration scenarios to highlight the advantages of the proposed methodology, one with perfect forecasts and the other with current state-of-the-art but imperfect deterministic forecasts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with sensitivity tests using both economic and reliability metrics to provide a broader view of its impact.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These observations are crucial to developing a better understanding and modeling of physical processes in the marine ABL. In this study, we use the WRF single column model (SCM), coupled with an ensemble Kalman filter from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), to create 100-member ensembles at the FINO1 location.

The wind power forecasting improvement methodology and error analysis for the data set were elaborated. Production cost simulation was conducted on the three emulated systems with a total of 480 scenarios, considering the impacts of different generation technologies, wind penetration levels, and wind power forecasting improvement timescales. The static operational flexibility of the three systems was compared through the diversity of generation mix, the percentage of must-run baseload generators, as well as the available ramp rate and the minimum generation levels. The dynamic operational flexibility was evaluated by the real-time upward and downward ramp capacity. Simulation results show that the generation resource mix plays a crucial role in evaluating the value of improved wind power forecasting at different timescales. In addition, the changes in annual operational electricity generation costs were mostly influenced by the dominant resource in the system. Lastly, the impacts of pumped-storage resources, generation ramp rates, and system minimum generation level requirements on the value of improved wind power forecasting were also analyzed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind turbine wake characterization from temporally disjunct 3-D measurements","Doubrawa, Paula; Barthelmie, Rebecca J.; Wang, Hui; Pryor, S. C.; Churchfield, Matthew","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; turbine; wakes; LiDAR","Scanning LiDARs can be used to obtain three-dimensional wind measurements in and beyond the atmospheric surface layer. In this work, metrics characterizing wind turbine wakes are derived from LiDAR observations and from large-eddy simulation (LES) data, which are used to recreate the LiDAR scanning geometry. The metrics are calculated for two-dimensional planes in the vertical and cross-stream directions at discrete distances downstream of a turbine under single-wake conditions. The simulation data are used to estimate the uncertainty when mean wake characteristics are quantified from scanning LiDAR measurements, which are temporally disjunct due to the time that the instrument takes to probe a large volume of air. Based on LES output, we determine that wind speeds sampled with the synthetic LiDAR are within 10% of the actual mean values and that the disjunct nature of the scan does not compromise the spatial variation of wind speeds within the planes. We propose scanning geometry density and coverage indices, which quantify the spatial distribution of the sampled points in the area of interest and are valuable to design LiDAR measurement campaigns for wake characterization. Lastly, we find that scanning geometry coverage is important for estimates of the wake center, orientation and length scales, while density is more important when seeking to characterize the velocity deficit distribution.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

First, DLR can utilize the concurrent cooling effect and dynamic monitors on transmission lines to increase the line carry capacity and reduce congestion. Second, more frequent interactions between transmission lines and operators can increase the flexibility and create a more dynamic and responsive hybrid system. In general, DLR can increase the flexibility and optimize the efficiency of a hybrid system utilizing wind energy. DLR helps meet continuously fluctuating electricity demands with real-time observation of transmission lines for more accurate estimation of line carry capacity. For the fuel energy, DLR can contribute greatly in saving fuels and reducing carbon emission by providing timely information for adjusting generation levels. For HES's including NPPs, transmission congestion could be more serious and needs attention. Therefore, by providing additional transmission capacity, DLR can contribute to alleviate the congestion and congestion pricing impact that is threatening the current NPPs and prevent potential congestion that may constrain the operation of future hybrid system involved with a nuclear plant. However, either a fuel plant or nuclear plant is better coupled with a wind turbine to take advantage of the concurrent cooling effect and dynamic monitoring. The research team at Idaho National Laboratory, currently focused on the benefit of DLR technology to assist wind generation, is now exploring the feasibility of implementing the same technology into such HES and NPP. Future work will focus on the analysis of technique feasibility, challenges and benefit-cost analysis of integrating DLR into HES. Detailed studies are anticipated to evaluate the benefits of DLR on HES and NPP with transmission constraints. This paper explores a potential utilization of DLR in hybrid energy systems, especially those involving traditional fossil fuels or nuclear power coupled with wind energy. The goal is to increase the efficiency and flexibility of these types of hybrid systems in order to provide more secure, reliable and low-carbon energy.","","","","","","United States","2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","Conference","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 116; Conference: 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Nuclear Society, San Francisco, CA (United States), 11-15 Jun 2017; Other Information: Country of input: France; 8 refs.; available from American Nuclear Society - ANS, 555 North Kensington Avenue, La Grange Park, IL 60526 (US)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 849-851","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TRN: US21V3066090655","","","2021-11-02T00:00:00Z","23050270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/23050270","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","116"
"A simple method for simulating wind profiles in the boundary layer of tropical cyclones","Bryan, George H.; Worsnop, Rochelle P.; Lundquist, Julie K.; Zhang, Jun A.","17 WIND ENERGY; boundary-layer dynamics; large-eddy simulation; single-column modelling; tropical cyclone","A method to simulate characteristics of wind speed in the boundary layer of tropical cyclones in an idealized manner is developed and evaluated. The method can be used in a single-column modelling set-up with a planetary boundary-layer parametrization, or within large-eddy simulations (LES). The key step is to include terms in the horizontal velocity equations representing advection and centrifugal acceleration in tropical cyclones that occurs on scales larger than the domain size. Compared to other recently developed methods, which require two input parameters (a reference wind speed, and radius from the centre of a tropical cyclone) this new method also requires a third input parameter: the radial gradient of reference wind speed. With the new method, simulated wind profiles are similar to composite profiles from dropsonde observations; in contrast, a classic Ekman-type method tends to overpredict inflow-layer depth and magnitude, and two recently developed methods for tropical cyclone environments tend to overpredict near-surface wind speed. When used in LES, the new technique produces vertical profiles of total turbulent stress and estimated eddy viscosity that are similar to values determined from low-level aircraft flights in tropical cyclones. Lastly, temporal spectra from LES produce an inertial subrange for frequencies ≳0.1 Hz, but only when the horizontal grid spacing ≲20 m.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The wind measurements upwind of the turbine include anemometers mounted on a 135 m meteorological tower as well as profiles from a lidar. We calculate power curves for different regimes based on turbulence parameters such as turbulence intensity (TI) as well as atmospheric stability parameters such as the bulk Richardson number (<i>R</i><sub>B</sub>). We also calculate AEP with and without these atmospheric filters and highlight differences between the results of these calculations. The power curves for different TI regimes reveal that increased TI undermines power production at wind speeds near rated, but TI increases power production at lower wind speeds at this site, the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC). Similarly, power curves for different <i>R</i><sub>B</sub> regimes reveal that periods of stable conditions produce more power at wind speeds near rated and periods of unstable conditions produce more power at lower wind speeds. AEP results suggest that calculations without filtering for these atmospheric regimes may overestimate the AEP. Because of statistically significant differences between power curves and AEP calculated with these turbulence and stability filters for this turbine at this site, we suggest implementing an additional step in analyzing power performance data to incorporate effects of atmospheric stability and turbulence across the rotor disk.</p>","European Wind Energy Association - Copernicus","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The case was originally developed by the boundary layer meteorology community, interested in analysing the performance of single-column and large-eddy simulation atmospheric models dealing with a diurnal cycle leading to the development of a nocturnal low-level jet. The case addresses fundamental questions related to the definition of the large-scale forcing, the interaction of the ABL with the surface and the evaluation of model results with observations. The characterization of mesoscale forcing for asynchronous microscale modelling of the ABL is discussed based on momentum budget analysis of WRF simulations.

Field data were provided by Statoil, which conducted a comprehensive test measurement campaign of its demonstration system, a 2.3-MW Siemens turbine mounted on a spar substructure deployed about 10 km off the island of Karmoy in Norway. A top-down approach was used to develop the FAST model, starting with modeling the blades and working down to the mooring system. Design data provided by Siemens and Statoil were used to specify the structural, aerodynamic, and dynamic properties. Measured wind speeds and wave spectra were used to develop the wind and wave conditions used in the model. The overall system performance and behavior were validated for eight sets of field measurements that span a wide range of operating conditions. The simulated controller response accurately reproduced the measured blade pitch and power. In conclusion, the structural and blade loads and spectra of platform motion agree well with the measured data.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the first phase, a nacelle-mounted scanning lidar was used to verify wake deflection of a misaligned turbine and calibrate wake deflection models. In the second phase, these models were used within a yaw controller to achieve a desired wake deflection. This paper details the experimental design and setup.

"A Highly Resolved Large-Eddy Simulation of a Wind Turbine using an Actuator Line Model with Optimal Body Force Projection","Martinez-Tossas, Luis A.; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Meneveau, Charles","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine wakes; blade aerodynamics; blades; simulation","When representing the blade aerodynamics with rotating actuator lines, the computed forces have to be projected back to the CFD flow field as a volumetric body force. That has been done in the past with a geometrically simple uniform three-dimensional Gaussian at each point along the blade. Here, we argue that the body force can be shaped in a way that better predicts the blade local flow field, the blade load distribution, and the formation of the tip/root vortices. In previous work, we have determined the optimal scales of circular and elliptical Gaussian kernels that best reproduce the local flow field in two-dimensions. Lastly, in this work we extend the analysis and applications by considering the full three-dimensional blade to test our hypothesis in a highly resolved Large Eddy Simulation.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A trailed vorticity model previously used as addition to a blade element momentum theory based aerodynamic model in normal operation has been extended to allow computing the induced velocities in standstill. The model is validated against analytical results for an elliptical wing in constant inflow and against stand still measurements from the NREL/NASA Phase VI unsteady experiment. The extended model obtains good results in case of the elliptical wing, but underpredicts the steady loading for the Phase VI blade in attached flow. The prediction of the dynamic force coefficient loops from the Phase VI experiment is improved by the trailed vorticity modeling in both attached flow and stall in most cases. The exception is the tangential force coefficient in stall, where the codes and measurements deviate and no clear improvement is visible.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Time series of blade-root and tower base bending moments are analyzed. We find that meandering has a large contribution to the fluctuation of the loads. Moreover, considering the wake edge intermittence via the stochastic shape model improves the simulation of load and power fluctuations and of the fatigue damage equivalent loads.

"A new vertical grid nesting capability in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model","Daniels, Megan H.; Lundquist, Katherine A.; Mirocha, Jeffrey D.; Wiersema, David J.; Chow, Fotini K.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; Models and modeling; Boundary conditions; Large eddy simulations; Mesoscale models; Numerical analysis/modeling; Numerical weather prediction/forecasting; Vertical coordinates","Mesoscale atmospheric models are increasingly used for high-resolution (<3 km) simulations to better resolve smaller-scale flow details. Increased resolution is achieved using mesh refinement via grid nesting, a procedure where multiple computational domains are integrated either concurrently or in series. A constraint in the concurrent nesting framework offered by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is that mesh refinement is restricted to the horizontal dimensions. This limitation prevents control of the grid aspect ratio, leading to numerical errors due to poor grid quality and preventing grid optimization. Here, a procedure permitting vertical nesting for one-way concurrent simulation is developed and validated through idealized cases. The benefits of vertical nesting are demonstrated using both mesoscale and large-eddy simulations (LES). Mesoscale simulations of the Terrain-Induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) show that vertical grid nesting can alleviate numerical errors due to large aspect ratios on coarse grids, while allowing for higher vertical resolution on fine grids. Furthermore, the coarsening of the parent domain does not result in a significant loss of accuracy on the nested domain. LES of neutral boundary layer flow shows that, by permitting optimal grid aspect ratios on both parent and nested domains, use of vertical nesting yields improved agreement with the theoretical logarithmic velocity profile on both domains. Lastly, vertical grid nesting in WRF opens the path forward for multiscale simulations, allowing more accurate simulations spanning a wider range of scales than previously possible.","American Meteorological Society","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Surface wind energy trends near Taiwan in winter since 1871","Zhang, Lei; Li, Tim; Lu, Mong-Ming","17 WIND ENERGY; Geology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Oceanography; Surface wind trend near Taiwan; SST trend pattern; Global warming","The tropical surface wind speed in boreal winter reaches a maximum near Taiwan. This stable wind resource may be used for future clean energy development. How this surface wind energy source has changed in past 141 years is investigated using the 20<sup>th</sup> century reanalysis dataset and CMIP5 models. Our observational analysis shows that the surface wind speed experienced a weakening trend in the past 141 years (1871 - 2010). The average decreasing rate is around -1.4 m s<sup>-1</sup> per century. The decrease is primarily attributed to the relative sea surface temperature (SST) cooling in the subtropical North Pacific, which forces a large-scale low-level anti-cyclonic circulation anomaly in situ and is thus responsible for the southerly trend near Taiwan. The relative SST trend pattern is attributed mainly to the greenhouse gas effect associated with anthropogenic activities. The southerly trend near Taiwan is more pronounced in the boreal winter than in summer. Such seasonal difference is attributed to the reversed seasonal mean wind, which promotes more efficient positive feedback in the boreal winter. The CMIP5 historical run analysis reveals that climate models capture less SST warming and large-scale anti-cyclonic circulation in the subtropical North Pacific, but the simulated weakening trend of the surface wind speed near Taiwan is too small.","The Chinese Geoscience Union","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Support structures affect costs associated with the balance of system and operation and maintenance. Understanding the link between these costs and the main environmental design drivers is crucial in the quest for a lower levelized cost of energy, and it is the main rationale for this work. Actual cost and engineering data are still scarce; hence, we evaluated a simplified engineering approach to tie key site and turbine parameters (e.g. water depth, wave height, tower-head mass, hub height and generator rating) to the overall support weight. A jacket-and-tower sizing tool, part of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's system engineering software suite, was utilized to achieve mass-optimized support structures for 81 different configurations. This tool set provides preliminary sizing of all jacket components. Results showed reasonable agreement with the available industry data, and that the jacket mass is mainly driven by water depth, but hub height and tower-head mass become more influential at greater turbine ratings. A larger sensitivity of the structural mass to wave height and target eigenfrequency was observed for the deepest water conditions (>40 m). Thus, techno-economic analyses using this model should be based on accurate estimates of actual metocean conditions and turbine parameters especially for deep waters. Finally, the relationships derived from this study will inform National Renewable Energy Laboratory's offshore balance of system cost model, and they will be used to evaluate the impact of changes in technology on offshore wind lower levelized cost of energy.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Coherent dynamics in the rotor tip shear layer of utility-scale wind turbines","Yang, Xiaolei; Hong, Jiarong; Barone, Matthew; Sotiropoulos, Fotis","42 ENGINEERING; 17 WIND ENERGY","Here, recent field experiments conducted in the near wake (up to 0.5 rotor diameters downwind of the rotor) of a Clipper Liberty C96 2.5 MW wind turbine using snow-based super-large-scale particle image velocimetry (SLPIV) were successful in visualizing tip vortex cores as areas devoid of snowflakes. The so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested tip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct elongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate the structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified experimentally. We show that the LES, with inflow conditions representing as closely as possible the state of the flow approaching the turbine when the SLPIV experiments were carried out, reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative agreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core patterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. The computed results show that the visualized vortex patterns are formed by the tip vortices and a second set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip vortices. To probe the dependence of these newly uncovered coherent flow structures on turbine design, size and approach flow conditions, we carry out LES for three additional turbines: (i) the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) turbine developed by Sandia National Laboratories in Lubbock, TX, USA; (ii) the wind turbine developed for the European collaborative MEXICO (Model Experiments in Controlled Conditions) project; and (iii) the model turbine, and the Clipper turbine under varying inflow turbulence conditions. We show that similar counter-rotating vortex structures as those observed for the Clipper turbine are also observed for the SWiFT, MEXICO and model wind turbines. However, the strength of the counter-rotating vortices relative to that of the tip vortices from the model turbine is significantly weaker. We also show that incoming flows with low level turbulence attenuate the elongation of the tip and counter-rotating vortices. Sufficiently high turbulence levels in the incoming flow, on the other hand, tend to break up the coherence of spiral vortices in the near wake. To elucidate the physical mechanism that gives rise to such rich coherent dynamics we examine the stability of the turbine tip shear layer using the theory. We show that for all simulated cases the theory consistently indicates the flow to be unstable exactly in the region where counter-rotating spirals emerge. We thus postulate that centrifugal instability of the rotating turbine tip shear layer is a possible mechanism for explaining the phenomena we have uncovered herein.","Cambridge University Press","","Sandia National Lab.

"Optimization Under Uncertainty of Site-Specific Turbine Configurations","Quick, J.; Dykes, K.; Graf, P.; Zahle, F.","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; optimization; uncertainty; decision support; turbine design; wind energy","Uncertainty affects many aspects of wind energy plant performance and cost. In this study, we explore opportunities for site-specific turbine configuration optimization that accounts for uncertainty in the wind resource. As a demonstration, a simple empirical model for wind plant cost of energy is used in an optimization under uncertainty to examine how different risk appetites affect the optimal selection of a turbine configuration for sites of different wind resource profiles. Lastly, if there is unusually high uncertainty in the site wind resource, the optimal turbine configuration diverges from the deterministic case and a generally more conservative design is obtained with increasing risk aversion on the part of the designer.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Flexible <formula> <tex>$I_{Q}\!\!-\!\!V$</tex> </formula> Scheme of a DFIG for Rapid Voltage Regulation of a Wind Power Plant","Kim, Jinho; Muljadi, Eduard; Park, Jung -Wook; Kang, Yong Cheol","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; doubly-fed induction generator; DFIG; wind power plant; WPP; voltage control; voltage regulation","This paper proposes a flexible reactive current-to-voltage (I<sub>Q</sub>-V) scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) for the rapid voltage regulation of a wind power plant (WPP). In the proposed scheme, the WPP controller dispatches different voltage set points to the DFIGs depending on their rotor voltage margins. The DFIGs inject different reactive power with the flexible I<sub>Q</sub>-V schemes implemented in the rotor-side and grid-side converters. The I<sub>Q</sub>-V characteristic, which consists of the gain and width of a linear band and I<sub>Q</sub> capability, varies with time depending on the I<sub>Q</sub> capability of the converters and a voltage dip at the point of interconnection (POI). To increase the I<sub>Q</sub> capability during a fault, the active current is reduced in proportion to a voltage dip. If the I<sub>Q</sub> capability and/or the POI voltage dip are large, the I<sub>Q</sub>-V gain is set to be high, thereby providing rapid voltage regulation. To avoid an overvoltage after the fault clearance, a rapid I<sub>Q</sub> reduction scheme is implemented in the WPP and DFIG controllers. The performance of the proposed flexible scheme was verified under scenarios with various disturbances. In conclusion, the proposed scheme can help increase wind power penetration without jeopardizing voltage stability.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A framework to analyze the stochastic harmonics and resonance of wind energy grid interconnection","Cho, Youngho; Lee, Choongman; Hur, Kyeon; Kang, Yong Cheol; Muljadi, Eduard; Park, Sang -Ho; Choy, Young -Do; Yoon, Gi -Gab","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind power plant; WPP; harmonics; resonance; statistical modeling","This study addresses a modeling and analysis methodology for investigating the stochastic harmonics and resonance concerns of wind power plants (WPPs). Wideband harmonics from modern wind turbines are observed to be stochastic, associated with real power production, and they may adversely interact with the grid impedance and cause unexpected harmonic resonance if not comprehensively addressed in the planning and commissioning of the WPPs. These issues should become more critical as wind penetration levels increase. We thus propose a planning study framework comprising the following functional steps: First, the best-fitted probability density functions (PDFs) of the harmonic components of interest in the frequency domain are determined. In operations planning, maximum likelihood estimations followed by a chi-square test are used once field measurements or manufacturers' data are available. Second, harmonic currents from the WPP are represented by randomly-generating harmonic components based on their PDFs (frequency spectrum) and then synthesized for time-domain simulations via inverse Fourier transform. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive assessment by including the impacts of feeder configurations, harmonic filters, and the variability of parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed study approach for a 100-MW offshore WPP consisting of 20 units of 5-MW full-converter turbines, a realistic benchmark system adapted from a WPP under development in Korea, and discuss lessons learned through this research.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A systems engineering analysis of three-point and four-point wind turbine drivetrain configurations","Guo, Yi; Parsons, Tyler; Dykes, Katherine; King, Ryan N.","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; systems engineering; drivetrain design; sensitivity analysis; cost optimization","This study compares the impact of drivetrain configuration on the mass and capital cost of a series of wind turbines ranging from 1.5 MW to 5.0 MW power ratings for both land-based and offshore applications. The analysis is performed with a new physics-based drivetrain analysis and sizing tool, Drive Systems Engineering (DriveSE), which is part of the Wind-Plant Integrated System Design & Engineering Model. DriveSE uses physics-based relationships to size all major drivetrain components according to given rotor loads simulated based on International Electrotechnical Commission design load cases. The model's sensitivity to input loads that contain a high degree of variability was analyzed. Aeroelastic simulations are used to calculate the rotor forces and moments imposed on the drivetrain for each turbine design. DriveSE is then used to size all of the major drivetrain components for each turbine for both three-point and four-point configurations. The simulation results quantify the trade-offs in mass and component costs for the different configurations. On average, a 16.7% decrease in total nacelle mass can be achieved when using a three-point drivetrain configuration, resulting in a 3.5% reduction in turbine capital cost. This analysis is driven by extreme loads and does not consider fatigue. Thus, the effects of configuration choices on reliability and serviceability are not captured. Furthermore, a first order estimate of the sizing, dimensioning and costing of major drivetrain components are made which can be used in larger system studies which consider trade-offs between subsystems such as the rotor, drivetrain and tower.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Improving Wind Predictions in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer Through Parameter Estimation in a Single Column Model","Lee, Jared A.; Hacker, Joshua P.; Monache, Luca Delle; Kosovic, Branko; Clifton, Andrew; Vandenberghe, Francois; Rodrigo, Javier Sanz","17 WIND ENERGY","A current barrier to greater deployment of offshore wind turbines is the poor quality of numerical weather prediction model wind and turbulence forecasts over open ocean. The bulk of development for atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) parameterization schemes has focused on land, partly due to a scarcity of observations over ocean. The 100-m FINO1 tower in the North Sea is one of the few sources worldwide of atmospheric profile observations from the sea surface to turbine hub height. These observations are crucial to developing a better understanding and modeling of physical processes in the marine ABL. In this paper we use the WRF single column model (SCM), coupled with an ensemble Kalman filter from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART), to create 100-member ensembles at the FINO1 location. The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which model parameter estimation can improve offshore wind forecasts. Combining two datasets that provide lateral forcing for the SCM and two methods for determining z<sub>0</sub>, the time-varying sea-surface roughness length, we conduct four WRF-SCM/DART experiments over the October-December 2006 period. The two methods for determining z<sub>0</sub> are the default Fairall-adjusted Charnock formulation in WRF, and using parameter estimation techniques to estimate z<sub>0</sub> in DART. Using DART to estimate z<sub>0</sub> is found to reduce 1-h forecast errors of wind speed over the Charnock-Fairall z<sub>0</sub> ensembles by 4%–22%. Finally, however, parameter estimation of z<sub>0</sub> does not simultaneously reduce turbulent flux forecast errors, indicating limitations of this approach and the need for new marine ABL parameterizations.","American Meteorological Society","","National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind power adoption in Portugal began in the early 2000s, incentivized by a continuous feed-in tariff policy mechanism, coupled with public tenders for connection licenses in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These policies led to an enormous success in terms of having a large share of renewables providing electricity services: wind alone accounts today for ~23.5% of electricity demand in Portugal. We explain the reasons wind power became a key part of Portugal's strategy to comply with European Commission climate and energy goals, and provide a detailed review of the wind feed-in tariff mechanism. We describe the actors involved in wind power production growth. We estimate the environmental and energy dependency gains achieved through wind power generation, and highlight the correlation between wind electricity generation and electricity exports. Finally, we compare the Portuguese wind policies with others countries' policy designs and discuss the relevance of a feed-in tariff reform for subsequent wind power additions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurate prediction is a Big Data problem that requires disparate data, multiple models that are each applicable for a specific time frame, and application of computational intelligence techniques to successfully blend all of the model and observational information in real-time and deliver it to the decision makers at utilities and grid operators.

An efficient sampling algorithm and generalized linear model are used to explore the multiple-dimensional parameter space and quantify the parametric sensitivity of simulated turbine-height wind speeds. The results indicate that most of the variability in the ensemble simulations is due to parameters related to the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), Prandtl number, turbulent length scales, surface roughness, and the von Kármán constant. The parameter associated with the TKE dissipation rate is found to be most important, and a larger dissipation rate produces larger hub-height wind speeds. A larger Prandtl number results in smaller nighttime wind speeds. Increasing surface roughness reduces the frequencies of both extremely weak and strong airflows, implying a reduction in the variability of wind speed. All of the above parameters significantly affect the vertical profiles of wind speed and the magnitude of wind shear. Lastly, the relative contributions of individual parameters are found to be dependent on both the terrain slope and atmospheric stability.","Springer","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

Renewable energy sources are capable of displacing electricity from fossil fuels, but the quantity of health and climate benefits depend on site-specific attributes that are not often included in quantitative models. Here, we link an electrical grid simulation model to an air pollution health impact assessment model and US regulatory estimates of the impacts of carbon to estimate the health and climate benefits of offshore wind facilities of different sizes in two different locations. We find that offshore wind in the Mid-Atlantic is capable of producing health and climate benefits of between $54 and $120 per MWh of generation, with the largest simulated facility (3000 MW off the coast of New Jersey) producing approximately $690 million in benefits in 2017. The variability in benefits per unit generation is a function of differences in locations (Maryland versus New Jersey), simulated years (2012 versus 2017), and facility generation capacity, given complexities of the electrical grid and differences in which power plants are offset. In the end, this work demonstrates health and climate benefits of off shore wind, provides further evidence of the utility of geographically-refined modeling frameworks, and yields quantitative insights that would allow for inclusion of both climate and public health in benefits assessments of renewable energy.","IOP Publishing","","Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE (United States)","USDOE; Heinz Endowments","","United Kingdom","2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Research Letters Journal Volume: 11 Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 074019","","","EE0005388; EE0005366; C2988","Journal ID: ISSN 1748-9326","10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074019","","2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","1262453","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1262453","","Environmental Research Letters","7","11"

Large ramps, one of the biggest concerns, can significantly influence system economics and reliability. The Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP) was to improve the accuracy of forecasts and to evaluate the economic benefits of these improvements to grid operators. This paper evaluates the ramp forecasting accuracy gained by improving the performance of short-term wind power forecasting. This study focuses on the WFIP southern study region, which encompasses most of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) territory, to compare the experimental WFIP forecasts to the existing short-term wind power forecasts (used at ERCOT) at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The study employs four significant wind power ramping definitions according to the power change magnitude, direction, and duration. The optimized swinging door algorithm is adopted to extract ramp events from actual and forecasted wind power time series. The results show that the experimental WFIP forecasts improve the accuracy of the wind power ramp forecasting. This improvement can result in substantial costs savings and power system reliability enhancements.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, a data-driven multi-model wind forecasting methodology is developed with a two-layer ensemble machine learning technique. The first layer is composed of multiple machine learning models that generate individual forecasts. A deep feature selection framework is developed to determine the most suitable inputs to the first layer machine learning models. Then, a blending algorithm is applied in the second layer to create an ensemble of the forecasts produced by first layer models and generate both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts. This two-layer model seeks to utilize the statistically different characteristics of each machine learning algorithm. A number of machine learning algorithms are selected and compared in both layers. This developed multi-model wind forecasting methodology is compared to several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated to provide 1-hour-ahead wind speed forecasting at seven locations of the Surface Radiation network. Numerical results show that comparing to the single-algorithm models, the developed multi-model framework with deep feature selection procedure has improved the forecasting accuracy by up to 30%.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The application of structural damping control techniques to OWTs using Tuned Mass Dampers (TMDs) has shown to be effective in reducing the integrated system loads and accelerations. In this work, the impact of passive and semi-active (S-A) TMD’s applied to both fixed-bottom (monopile) and floating (tension leg platform) OWTs are evaluated under the Fatigue Limit State (FLS) and Ultimate Limit State (ULS). Different S-A control logics like ON/OFF state damping based on the ground hook (GH) control policy are implemented, and the frequency response of each algorithm is investigated. It is shown that the performance of each algorithm varies according to the load conditions such as FLS (normal operation) and ULS (idling state). Fully-coupled time domain simulations are conducted through the developed simulation tool for structural control integrated into the high-fidelity wind turbine design code, FASTv8. Compared to the passive TMD, it is shown that a S-A TMD results in higher load reductions, as well as, smaller strokes under both FLS and ULS conditions. In FLS analysis, the S-A TMD using Displacement Based Ground Hook (DB-GH) control is capable of reducing the fore-aft and side-to-side damage equivalent loads for the monopile substructure by approximately 12 % and 64 %, respectively. The ultimate loads at the tower base for the floating substructure (TLP) are also reduced by 9% with S-A TMD followed by Inverse Velocity Based Ground Hook control (IVB-GH). The dynamic characteristics and practical feasibility of a magnetorheological (MR) damper (for S-A control) are also evaluated.","Wiley","","Alstom Renewable US LLC, Englewood, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Inverse load calculation procedure for offshore wind turbines and application to a 5-MW wind turbine support structure: Inverse load calculation procedure for offshore wind turbines","Pahn, T.; Rolfes, R.; Jonkman, J.","17 WIND ENERGY; continued operation of wind turbines; inverse load calculation; load measurement; system identification","A significant number of wind turbines installed today have reached their designed service life of 20 years, and the number will rise continuously. Most of these turbines promise a more economical performance if they operate for more than 20 years. To assess a continued operation, we have to analyze the load-bearing capacity of the support structure with respect to site-specific conditions. Such an analysis requires the comparison of the loads used for the design of the support structure with the actual loads experienced. This publication presents the application of a so-called inverse load calculation to a 5-MW wind turbine support structure. The inverse load calculation determines external loads derived from a mechanical description of the support structure and from measured structural responses. Using numerical simulations with the software fast, we investigated the influence of wind-turbine-specific effects such as the wind turbine control or the dynamic interaction between the loads and the support structure to the presented inverse load calculation procedure. fast is used to study the inverse calculation of simultaneously acting wind and wave loads, which has not been carried out until now. Furthermore, the application of the inverse load calculation procedure to a real 5-MW wind turbine support structure is demonstrated. In terms of this practical application, setting up the mechanical system for the support structure using measurement data is discussed. The paper presents results for defined load cases and assesses the accuracy of the inversely derived dynamic loads for both the simulations and the practical application.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A surface ice module for wind turbine dynamic response simulation using FAST","Yu, Bingbin; Karr, Dale G.; Song, Huimin; Sirnivas, Senu","17 WIND ENERGY; ice mechanics; offshore wind turbine; FAST; numerical simulation","It is a fact that developing offshore wind energy has become more and more serious worldwide in recent years. Many of the promising offshore wind farm locations are in cold regions that may have ice cover during wintertime. The challenge of possible ice loads on offshore wind turbines raises the demand of modeling capacity of dynamic wind turbine response under the joint action of ice, wind, wave, and current. The simulation software FAST is an open source computer-aided engineering (CAE) package maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In this paper, a new module of FAST for assessing the dynamic response of offshore wind turbines subjected to ice forcing is presented. In the ice module, several models are presented which involve both prescribed forcing and coupled response. For conditions in which the ice forcing is essentially decoupled from the structural response, ice forces are established from existing models for brittle and ductile ice failure. For conditions in which the ice failure and the structural response are coupled, such as lock-in conditions, a rate-dependent ice model is described, which is developed in conjunction with a new modularization framework for FAST. In this paper, analytical ice mechanics models are presented that incorporate ice floe forcing, deformation, and failure. For lower speeds, forces slowly build until the ice strength is reached and ice fails resulting in a quasi-static condition. For intermediate speeds, the ice failure can be coupled with the structural response and resulting in coinciding periods of the ice failure and the structural response. A third regime occurs at high speeds of encounter in which brittle fracturing of the ice feature occurs in a random pattern, which results in a random vibration excitation of the structure. An example wind turbine response is simulated under ice loading of each of the presented models. This module adds to FAST the capabilities for analyzing the response of wind turbines subjected to forces resulting from ice impact on the turbine support structure. The conditions considered in this module are specifically addressed in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 19906:2010 for arctic offshore structures design consideration. Special consideration of lock-in vibrations is required due to the detrimental effects of such response with regard to fatigue and foundation/soil response. Finally, the use of FAST for transient, time domain simulation with the new ice module is well suited for such analyses.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To help better manage and dispatch the wind power, this paper develops a data-driven probabilistic WPR forecasting (p-WPRF) method based on a large number of simulated scenarios. A machine learning technique is first adopted to forecast the basic wind power forecasting scenario and produce the historical forecasting errors. To accurately model the distribution of wind power forecasting errors, a generalized Gaussian mixture model is developed and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is also analytically deduced. The inverse transform method based on the CDF is used to generate a large number of forecasting error scenarios. An optimized swinging door algorithm is adopted to extract all the WPRs from the complete set of wind power forecasting scenarios. The p-WPRF is generated based on all generated scenarios under different weather and time conditions. Numerical simulations on publicly available wind power data show that the developed p-WPRF method can predict WPRs with a high level of reliability and accuracy.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Investigating the process of white etching crack initiation in bearing steel","Gould, Benjamin; Greco, Aaron","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 17 WIND ENERGY; Bearing failures; Microstructural alterations; White etching cracks; Wind turbine gearbox bearings","White etching cracks (WECs) have been identified as a dominant mode of premature failure within wind turbine gearbox bearings. Though WECs have been reported in the field for over a decade, the conditions leading to WECs, and the process by which this failure culminates, are both highly debated. In previously published work, the generation of WECs on a benchtop scale was linked to sliding at the surface of the test sample, it was also postulated that the generation of WECs was dependent on the cumulative energy that had been applied to the sample over the entirety of the test. In this paper, a three ring on roller bench top test rig is used to systematically alter the cumulative energy that a sample experiences through changes in normal load, sliding, and run time, in an attempt to correlate cumulative energy with the formation of WECs. It was determined that, in the current test setup, the presence of WECs can be predicted by this energy criterion. The authors then used this information to study the process by which WECs initiate. Lastly, it was found that, under the current testing conditions, the formation of a dark etching microstructure precedes the formation of a crack, and a crack precedes the formation of white etching microstructure.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

"Measurement-Based Investigation of Inter- and Intra-Area Effects of Wind Power Plant Integration","Allen, Alicia J.; Singh, Mohit; Muljadi, Eduard; Santoso, Surya","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; electromechanical dynamics; doubly fed induction generators; two-area system; inertia; wind power; PMU","This paper has a two pronged objective: the first objective is to analyze the general effects of wind power plant (WPP) integration and the resulting displacement of conventional power plant (CPP) inertia on power system stability and the second is to demonstrate the efficacy of PMU data in power system stability analyses, specifically when knowledge of the network is incomplete. Traditionally modal analysis applies small signal stability analysis based on Eigenvalues and the assumption of complete knowledge of the network and all of its components. The analysis presented here differs because it is a measurement-based investigation and employs simulated measurement data. Even if knowledge of the network were incomplete, this methodology would allow for monitoring and analysis of modes. This allows non-utility entities and study of power system stability. To generate inter- and intra-area modes, Kundur's well-known two-area four-generator system is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC. A doubly-fed induction generator based WPP model, based on the Western Electricity Coordination Council (WECC) standard model, is included to analyze the effects of wind power on system modes. The two-area system and WPP are connected in various configurations with respect to WPP placement, CPP inertia and WPP penetration level. Analysis is performed on the data generated by the simulations. For each simulation run, a different configuration is chosen and a large disturbance is applied. The sampling frequency is set to resemble the sampling frequency at which data is available from phasor measurement units (PMUs). The estimate of power spectral density of these signals is made using the Yule-Walker algorithm. The resulting analysis shows that the presence of a WPP does not, of itself, lead to the introduction of new modes. The analysis also shows however that displacement of inertia may lead to introduction of new modes. The effects of location of inertia displacement (i.e. the effects on modes if WPP integration leads to displacement of inertia in its own region or in another region) and of WPP controls such as droop control and synthetic inertia are also examined. In future work, the methods presented here will be applied to real-world phasor data to examine the effects of integration of variable generation and displacement of CPP inertia on inter- and intra-area modes.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Integrated Design of Downwind Land-Based Wind Turbines using Analytic Gradients","Ning, Andrew; Petch, Derek","17 WIND ENERGY; integrated turbine design; analytic gradients; downwind rotors; upwind rotors; blade optimization; wind turbine optimization","Wind turbines are complex systems where component-level changes can have significant system-level effects. Effective wind turbine optimization generally requires an integrated analysis approach with a large number of design variables. Optimizing across large variable sets is orders of magnitude more efficient with gradient-based methods as compared with gradient-free method, particularly when using exact gradients. We have developed a wind turbine analysis set of over 100 components where 90% of the models provide numerically exact gradients through symbolic differentiation, automatic differentiation, and adjoint methods. This framework is applied to a specific design study focused on downwind land-based wind turbines. Downwind machines are of potential interest for large wind turbines where the blades are often constrained by the stiffness required to prevent a tower strike. The mass of these rotor blades may be reduced by utilizing a downwind configuration where the constraints on tower strike are less restrictive. The large turbines of this study range in power rating from 5-7MW and in diameter from 105m to 175m. The changes in blade mass and power production have important effects on the rest of the system, and thus the nacelle and tower systems are also optimized. For high-speed wind sites, downwind configurations do not appear advantageous. The decrease in blade mass (10%) is offset by increases in tower mass caused by the bending moment from the rotor-nacelle-assembly. For low-wind speed sites, the decrease in blade mass is more significant (25-30%) and shows potential for modest decreases in overall cost of energy (around 1-2%).","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Dynamometer testing on a full scale wind turbine nacelle is used. A combination of external and internal gearbox measurements is analysed. Particular focus is on the characterization of the high speed shaft tapered roller bearing slip behaviour. This slipping behaviour is linked to dynamic events by many researchers and described as potential bearing failure initiator. However only limited full scale dynamic testing is documented. Strain gauge bridges in grooves along the circumference of the outer ring are used to characterize the bearing behaviour in detail. It is shown that during the transient event the high speed shaft experiences a combined torsional and bending deformation. These unfavourable loading conditions induce roller slip in the bearings during the torque reversals indicating the potential of the applied load case to go beyond the preload of the tapered roller bearing.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In order to better understand the dynamic and probabilistic behavior of hybrid energy systems, this paper proposes a model combining Fourier series and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) to characterize historical weather measurements and to generate synthetic weather (e.g., wind speed) data. In particular, Fourier series is used to characterize the seasonal trend in historical data, while ARMA is applied to capture the autocorrelation in residue time series (e.g., measurements minus seasonal trends). The generated synthetic wind speed data is then utilized to perform probabilistic analysis of a particular hybrid energy system con guration, which consists of nuclear power plant, wind farm, battery storage, natural gas boiler, and chemical plant. As a result, requirements on component ramping rate, economic and environmental impacts of hybrid energy systems, and the effects of deploying different sizes of batteries in smoothing renewable variability, are all investigated.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

The output of VG (primarily wind and solar generation) varies over time and cannot be predicted precisely. Therefore, the energy from VG is not always guaranteed to be available at times when it is most needed. This means that its contribution towards resource adequacy can be significantly less than the contribution from traditional resources. Variable renewable resources also have near-zero variable costs, and with production-based subsidies they may even have negative offer costs. Because variable costs drive the spot price of energy, this can lead to reduced prices, sales, and therefore revenue for all resources within the energy market. The characteristics of VG can also result in increased price volatility as well as the need for more flexibility in the resource fleet in order to maintain system reliability. Furthermore, we explore both traditional and evolving electricity market designs in the United States that aim to ensure resource adequacy and sufficient revenues to recover costs when those resources are needed for long-term reliability. We also investigate how reliability needs may be evolving and discuss how VG may affect future electricity market designs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Wind power generation modeling is different, however, due in particular to power curve limitations, wind turbine control methods, and transmission system operation requirements. These differences are even greater for aggregated wind power generation in power systems with high wind penetration. Consequently, models based on one-Weibull component can provide poor characterizations for aggregated wind power generation. With this aim, the present paper focuses on discussing Weibull mixtures to characterize the probability density function (PDF) for aggregated wind power generation. PDFs of wind power data are firstly classified attending to hourly and seasonal patterns. The selection of the number of components in the mixture is analyzed through two well-known different criteria: the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Finally, the optimal number of Weibull components for maximum likelihood is explored for the defined patterns, including the estimated weight, scale, and shape parameters. Results show that multi-Weibull models are more suitable to characterize aggregated wind power data due to the impact of distributed generation, variety of wind speed values and wind power curtailment.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Such uncertainty results in revenue losses to the wind power producers (WPPs) due to penalties in ex-post imbalance settlements. This paper explores the opportunities available for WPPs if they can purchase or schedule some reserves to offset part of their deviation rather than being fully penalized in the real time market. The revenue for WPPs under such mechanism is modeled. The optimal strategy for managing the uncertainty of wind power by purchasing reserves to maximize the WPP's revenue is analytically derived with rigorous optimality conditions. The amount of energy and reserves that should be bid in the market are explicitly quantified by the probabilistic forecast and the prices of the energy and reserves.

OC5 is a project run under the International Energy Agency (IEA) Wind Research Task 30, and is focused on validating the tools used for modelling offshore wind systems through the comparison of simulated responses of select offshore wind systems (and components) to physical test data. For Phase Ib of the project, simulated hydrodynamic loads on a flexible cylinder fixed to a sloped bed were validated against test measurements made in the shallow water basin at the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) with support from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The first phase of OC5 examined two simple cylinder structures (Phase Ia and Ib) to focus on validation of hydrodynamic models used in the various tools before moving on to more complex offshore wind systems and the associated coupled physics. As a result, verification and validation activities such as these lead to improvement of offshore wind modelling tools, which will enable the development of more innovative and cost-effective offshore wind designs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

With the worldwide increase in wind power during the past several years, there is increasing interest and significance regarding its capacity value because this has a direct influence on the amount of other (nonwind) capacity that is needed. We build on previous reviews from IEEE and IEA Wind Task 25a and examine recent work that evaluates the impact of multiple-year data sets and the impact of interconnected systems on resource adequacy. We also provide examples that explore the use of alternative reliability metrics for wind capacity value calculations. We show how multiple-year data sets significantly increase the robustness of results compared to single-year assessments. Assumptions regarding the transmission interconnections play a significant role. To date, results regarding which reliability metric to use for probabilistic capacity valuation show little sensitivity to the metric.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Extended Glauert tip correction to include vortex rollup effects","Maniaci, David; Schmitz, Sven","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING","Wind turbine loads predictions by blade-element momentum theory using the standard tip-loss correction have been shown to over-predict loading near the blade tip in comparison to experimental data. This over-prediction is theorized to be due to the assumption of light rotor loading, inherent in the standard tip-loss correction model of Glauert. A higher- order free-wake method, <i>WindDVE</i>, is used to compute the rollup process of the trailing vortex sheets downstream of wind turbine blades. Results obtained serve an exact correction function to the Glauert tip correction used in blade-element momentum methods. Lastly, it is found that accounting for the effects of tip vortex rollup within the Glauert tip correction indeed results in improved prediction of blade tip loads computed by blade-element momentum methods.","IOP Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

The Task is divided in three work packages: Firstly, a collaboration on the improvement of the scientific basis for the wind predictions themselves. This includes numerical weather prediction model physics, but also widely distributed information on accessible datasets. Secondly, we will be aiming at an international pre-standard (an IEA Recommended Practice) on benchmarking and comparing wind power forecasts, including probabilistic forecasts.

"Improving Lidar Turbulence Estimates for Wind Energy","Newman, Jennifer F.; Clifton, Andrew; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Klein, Petra","17 WIND ENERGY; lidar; turbulence; wind energy; L-TERRA; turbulence intensity","Remote sensing devices (e.g., lidars) are quickly becoming a cost-effective and reliable alternative to meteorological towers for wind energy applications. Although lidars can measure mean wind speeds accurately, these devices measure different values of turbulence intensity (TI) than an instrument on a tower. In response to these issues, a lidar TI error reduction model was recently developed for commercially available lidars. The TI error model first applies physics-based corrections to the lidar measurements, then uses machine-learning techniques to further reduce errors in lidar TI estimates. The model was tested at two sites in the Southern Plains where vertically profiling lidars were collocated with meteorological towers. Results indicate that the model works well under stable conditions but cannot fully mitigate the effects of variance contamination under unstable conditions. To understand how variance contamination affects lidar TI estimates, a new set of equations was derived in previous work to characterize the actual variance measured by a lidar. Terms in these equations were quantified using a lidar simulator and modeled wind field, and the new equations were then implemented into the TI error model.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A data-driven method to characterize turbulence-caused uncertainty in wind power generation","Zhang, Jie; Jain, Rishabh; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; data-driven; surrogate modeling; uncertainty quantification; turbulence intensity; wind distribution","A data-driven methodology is developed to analyze how ambient and wake turbulence affect the power generation of wind turbine(s). Using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data from a wind plant, we select two sets of wind velocity and power data for turbines on the edge of the plant that resemble (i) an out-of-wake scenario and (ii) an in-wake scenario. For each set of data, two surrogate models are developed to represent the turbine(s) power generation as a function of (i) the wind speed and (ii) the wind speed and turbulence intensity. Three types of uncertainties in turbine(s) power generation are investigated: (i) the uncertainty in power generation with respect to the reported power curve; (ii) the uncertainty in power generation with respect to the estimated power response that accounts for only mean wind speed; and (iii) the uncertainty in power generation with respect to the estimated power response that accounts for both mean wind speed and turbulence intensity. Results show that (i) the turbine(s) generally produce more power under the in-wake scenario than under the out-of-wake scenario with the same wind speed; and (ii) there is relatively more uncertainty in the power generation under the in-wake scenario than under the out-of-wake scenario.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Accurately doing so is important to reducing the occurrence and length of curtailment, enhancing market efficiency, and improving the operational reliability of the bulk power system. This research quantifies the value of wind power forecasting improvements in the IEEE 118-bus test system as modified to emulate the generation mixes of Midcontinent, California, and New England independent system operator balancing authority areas. To measure the economic value, a commercially available production cost modeling tool was used to simulate the multi-timescale unit commitment (UC) and economic dispatch process for calculating the cost savings and curtailment reductions. To measure the reliability improvements, an in-house tool, FESTIV, was used to calculate the system's area control error and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Control Performance Standard 2. The approach allowed scientific reproducibility of results and cross-validation of the tools. A total of 270 scenarios were evaluated to accommodate the variation of three factors: generation mix, wind penetration level, and wind fore-casting improvements. The modified IEEE 118-bus systems utilized 1 year of data at multiple timescales, including the day-ahead UC, 4-hour-ahead UC, and 5-min real-time dispatch. The value of improved wind power forecasting was found to be strongly tied to the conventional generation mix, existence of energy storage devices, and the penetration level of wind energy. The simulation results demonstrate that wind power forecasting brings clear benefits to power system operations.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-term implications of sustained wind power growth in the United States: Direct electric system impacts and costs","Lantz, Eric; Mai, Trieu; Wiser, Ryan H.; Krishnan, Venkat","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind costs; scenario modeling; wind integration; transmission; Wind Vision","This paper evaluates potential changes in the power system associated with sustained growth in wind generation in the United States to 35% of end-use demand by 2050; Wiser et al. (2016) evaluate societal benefits and other impacts for this same scenario. Under reference or central conditions, the analysis finds cumulative wind capacity of 404 gigawatts (GW) would be required to reach this level and drive 2050 incremental electricity rate and cumulative electric sector savings of 2% and 3% respectively, relative to a scenario with no new wind capacity additions. Greater savings are estimated under higher fossil fuel costs or with greater advancements in wind technologies. Conversely, incremental costs are found when fossil fuel costs are lower than central assumptions or wind technology improvements are more-limited. Through 2030, the primary generation sources displaced by new wind capacity include natural gas and coal-fired generation. By 2050, wind could displace other renewables. Incremental new transmission infrastructure totaling 29 million megawatt-miles is estimated to be needed by 2050. In conjunction with related societal benefits, this work demonstrates that 35% wind energy by 2050 is plausible, could support enduring benefits, and could result in long-term consumer savings, if nearer-term (pre-2030) cost barriers are overcome; at the same time, these opportunities are not anticipated to be realized in their full form under 'business-as-usual' conditions.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Monitoring of Wind Turbine Gearbox Condition through Oil and Wear Debris Analysis: A Full-Scale Testing Perspective","Sheng, Shuangwen","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine gearbox; oil condition monitoring; oil debris monitoring; oil sample analysis; wear debris analysis","Despite the wind industry's dramatic development during the past decade, it is still challenged by premature turbine subsystem/component failures, especially for turbines rated above 1 MW. Because a crane is needed for each replacement, gearboxes have been a focal point for improvement in reliability and availability. Condition monitoring (CM) is a technique that can help improve these factors, leading to reduced turbine operation and maintenance costs and, subsequently, lower cost of energy for wind power. Although technical benefits of CM for the wind industry are normally recognized, there is a lack of published information on the advantages and limitations of each CM technique confirmed by objective data from full-scale tests. This article presents first-hand oil and wear debris analysis results obtained through tests that were based on full-scale wind turbine gearboxes rated at 750 kW. The tests were conducted at the 2.5-MW dynamometer test facility at the National Wind Technology Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The gearboxes were tested in three conditions: run-in, healthy, and damaged. The investigated CM techniques include real-time oil condition and wear debris monitoring, both inline and online sensors, and offline oil sample and wear debris analysis, both onsite and offsite laboratories. The reported results and observations help increase wind industry awareness of the benefits and limitations of oil and debris analysis technologies and highlight the challenges in these technologies and other tribological fields for the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers and other organizations to help address, leading to extended gearbox service life.","Taylor & Francis","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this paper, the generation and transmission expansion problem for the EI system is modeled as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. Our paper also analyzed a time series generation method to capture the variation and correlation of both load and wind power across regions. The obtained series can be easily introduced into the expansion planning problem and then solved through existing MIP solvers. Simulation results show that the proposed planning model and series generation method can improve the expansion result significantly through modeling more detailed information of wind and load variation among regions in the US EI system. Moreover, the improved expansion plan that combines generation and transmission will aid system planners and policy makers to maximize the social welfare in large-scale power grids.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Our work reveals that the dispatchability of the affine policy based RTD (AF-RTD) is a polytope whose coefficients are linear functions of the generation schedule and the gain matrix of affine policy. Two mathematical formulations of the dispatchability maximized energy and reserve dispatch (DM-ERD) are proposed. The first one maximizes the distance from the forecast to the boundaries of the dispatchability polytope subject to the available production cost or reserve cost. Provided the forecast value and variance of wind power, the generalized Gauss inequality (GGI) is adopted to evaluate the probability of infeasible RTD without the exact probability distribution of wind power. Combining the first formulation and the GGI approach, the second one minimizes the total cost subject to a desired reliability level through dispatchability maximization. Efficient convex optimization based algorithms are developed to solve these two models. Different from the conventional robust optimization method, our model does not rely on the specific uncertainty set of wind generation and directly optimizes the uncertainty accommodation capability of the power system. The proposed method is also compared with the affine policy based robust energy and reserve dispatch (AR-ERD). Case studies on the PJM 5-bus system illustrate the proposed concept and method. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the applicability of our method on moderate sized systems and its scalability to large dimensional uncertainty.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

The optimization controller is based on a novel internal parametric model for wake effects, called the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model. The FLORIS model predicts the steady-state wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy production levels, as a function of the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors. The FLORIS model has a limited number of parameters that are estimated based on turbine electrical power production data.

"Improvement of vertical velocity statistics measured by a Doppler lidar through comparison with sonic anemometer observations","Bonin, Timothy A.; Newman, Jennifer F.; Klein, Petra M.; Chilson, Phillip B.; Wharton, Sonia","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY","<p>Since turbulence measurements from Doppler lidars are being increasingly used within wind energy and boundary-layer meteorology, it is important to assess and improve the accuracy of these observations. While turbulent quantities are measured by Doppler lidars in several different ways, the simplest and most frequently used statistic is vertical velocity variance (<span style=""text-decoration: overline;""><i>w</i>'<sup>2</sup></span>) from zenith stares.

"Turbulent kinetics of a large wind farm and their impact in the neutral boundary layer","Na, Ji Sung; Koo, Eunmo; Munoz-Esparza, Domingo; Jin, Emilia Kyung; Linn, Rodman; Lee, Joon Sang","17 WIND ENERGY; large wind farm; actuator line method; large-eddy simulation; regional-scale simulation; wind farm parameterization; neutral boundary layer","High-resolution large-eddy simulation of the flow over a large wind farm (64 wind turbines) is performed using the HIGRAD/FIRETEC-WindBlade model, which is a high-performance computing wind turbine–atmosphere interaction model that uses the Lagrangian actuator line method to represent rotating turbine blades. These high-resolution large-eddy simulation results are used to parameterize the thrust and power coefficients that contain information about turbine interference effects within the wind farm. Those coefficients are then incorporated into the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model in order to evaluate interference effects in larger-scale models. In the high-resolution WindBlade wind farm simulation, insufficient distance between turbines creates the interference between turbines, including significant vertical variations in momentum and turbulent intensity. The characteristics of the wake are further investigated by analyzing the distribution of the vorticity and turbulent intensity. Quadrant analysis in the turbine and post-turbine areas reveals that the ejection motion induced by the presence of the wind turbines is dominant compared to that in the other quadrants, indicating that the sweep motion is increased at the location where strong wake recovery occurs. Regional-scale WRF simulations reveal that although the turbulent mixing induced by the wind farm is partly diffused to the upper region, there is no significant change in the boundary layer depth. The velocity deficit does not appear to be very sensitive to the local distribution of turbine coefficients. However, differences of about 5% on parameterized turbulent kinetic energy were found depending on the turbine coefficient distribution. Furthermore, turbine coefficients that consider interference in the wind farm should be used in wind farm parameterization for larger-scale models to better describe sub-grid scale turbulent processes.","Elsevier","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Stable Short-Term Frequency Support Using Adaptive Gains for a DFIG-Based Wind Power Plant","Lee, Jinsik; Jang, Gilsoo; Muljadi, Eduard; Blaabjerg, Frede; Chen, Zhe; Cheol Kang, Yong","17 WIND ENERGY; inertial control; releasable kinetic energy; KE; fixed-gain scheme; FGS; adaptive-gain scheme; AGS; frequency nadir; FN; over-deceleration","For the fixed-gain inertial control of wind power plants (WPPs), a large gain setting provides a large contribution to supporting system frequency control, but it may cause over-deceleration for a wind turbine generator that has a small amount of kinetic energy (KE). Further, if the wind speed decreases during inertial control, even a small gain may cause over-deceleration. This paper proposes a stable inertial control scheme using adaptive gains for a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WPP. The scheme aims to improve the frequency nadir (FN) while ensuring stable operation of all DFIGs, particularly when the wind speed decreases during inertial control. In this scheme, adaptive gains are set to be proportional to the KE stored in DFIGs, which is spatially and temporally dependent. To improve the FN, upon detecting an event, large gains are set to be proportional to the KE of DFIGs; to ensure stable operation, the gains decrease with the declining KE. The simulation results demonstrate that the scheme improves the FN while ensuring stable operation of all DFIGs in various wind and system conditions. Further, it prevents over-deceleration even when the wind speed decreases during inertial control.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind Measurements from Arc Scans with Doppler Wind Lidar","Wang, H.; Barthelmie, R. J.; Clifton, Andy; Pryor, S. C.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; lidar; Doppler; scanning geometries; atmospheric boundary layer; NWTC; NREL","When defining optimal scanning geometries for scanning lidars for wind energy applications, we found that it is still an active field of research. Our paper evaluates uncertainties associated with arc scan geometries and presents recommendations regarding optimal configurations in the atmospheric boundary layer. The analysis is based on arc scan data from a Doppler wind lidar with one elevation angle and seven azimuth angles spanning 30° and focuses on an estimation of 10-min mean wind speed and direction. When flow is horizontally uniform, this approach can provide accurate wind measurements required for wind resource assessments in part because of its high resampling rate. Retrieved wind velocities at a single range gate exhibit good correlation to data from a sonic anemometer on a nearby meteorological tower, and vertical profiles of horizontal wind speed, though derived from range gates located on a conical surface, match those measured by mast-mounted cup anemometers. Uncertainties in the retrieved wind velocity are related to high turbulent wind fluctuation and an inhomogeneous horizontal wind field. Moreover, the radial velocity variance is found to be a robust measure of the uncertainty of the retrieved wind speed because of its relationship to turbulence properties. It is further shown that the standard error of wind speed estimates can be minimized by increasing the azimuthal range beyond 30° and using five to seven azimuth angles.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A stochastic wind turbine wake model based on new metrics for wake characterization: A stochastic wind turbine wake model based on new metrics for wake characterization","Doubrawa, Paula; Barthelmie, Rebecca J.; Wang, Hui; Churchfield, Matthew J.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine wakes; meandering; large-eddy simulation; wake model","Understanding the detailed dynamics of wind turbine wakes is critical to predicting the performance and maximizing the efficiency of wind farms. This knowledge requires atmospheric data at a high spatial and temporal resolution, which are not easily obtained from direct measurements. Therefore, research is often based on numerical models, which vary in fidelity and computational cost. The simplest models produce axisymmetric wakes and are only valid beyond the near wake. Higher-fidelity results can be obtained by solving the filtered Navier-Stokes equations at a resolution that is sufficient to resolve the relevant turbulence scales. This work addresses the gap between these two extremes by proposing a stochastic model that produces an unsteady asymmetric wake. The model is developed based on a large-eddy simulation (LES) of an offshore wind farm. Because there are several ways of characterizing wakes, the first part of this work explores different approaches to defining global wake characteristics. From these, a model is developed that captures essential features of a LES-generated wake at a small fraction of the cost. The synthetic wake successfully reproduces the mean characteristics of the original LES wake, including its area and stretching patterns, and statistics of the mean azimuthal radius. The mean and standard deviation of the wake width and height are also reproduced. This preliminary study focuses on reproducing the wake shape, while future work will incorporate velocity deficit and meandering, as well as different stability scenarios.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Different scenarios in terms of wind penetration, wind forecasts, and wind curtailment are modeled in order to analyze the impact of wind power on electricity prices for different wind penetration levels and for different levels of wind power visibility and controllability. The analysis concludes that electricity price volatility increases even as electricity prices decrease with increasing wind penetration levels. The impact of wind power on price volatility is larger in the shorter term (5-min compared to hour-to-hour). The results presented show that over-forecasting wind power increases electricity prices while under-forecasting wind power reduces them. The modeling results also show that controlling wind power by allowing curtailment increases electricity prices, and for higher wind penetrations it also reduces their volatility.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Could Crop Height Affect the Wind Resource at Agriculturally Productive Wind Farm Sites?","Vanderwende, Brian; Lundquist, Julie K.","17 WIND ENERGY; agriculture; Iowa; roughness length; wind-farm parametrization; weather research and forecasting model","The collocation of cropland and wind turbines in the US Midwest region introduces complex meteorological interactions that could influence both agriculture and wind-power production. Crop management practices may affect the wind resource through alterations of land-surface properties. We use the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model to estimate the impact of crop height variations on the wind resource in the presence of a large turbine array. A hypothetical wind farm consisting of 121 1.8-MW turbines is represented using the WRF model wind-farm parametrization. We represent the impact of selecting soybeans rather than maize by altering the aerodynamic roughness length in a region approximately 65 times larger than that occupied by the turbine array. Roughness lengths of 0.1 and 0.25 m represent the mature soy crop and a mature maize crop, respectively. In all but the most stable atmospheric conditions, statistically significant hub-height wind-speed increases and rotor-layer wind-shear reductions result from switching from maize to soybeans. Based on simulations for the entire month of August 2013, wind-farm energy output increases by 14 %, which would yield a significant monetary gain. Further investigation is required to determine the optimal size, shape, and crop height of the roughness modification to maximize the economic benefit and minimize the cost of such crop-management practices. As a result, these considerations must be balanced by other influences on crop choice such as soil requirements and commodity prices.","Springer Science + Business Media","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Long-term implications of sustained wind power growth in the United States: Direct electric system impacts and costs","Lantz, Eric; Mai, Trieu; Wiser, Ryan H.; Krishnan, Venkat","17 WIND ENERGY","This paper evaluates potential changes in the power system associated with sustained growth in wind generation in the United States to 35% of end-use demand by 2050; Wiser et al. (forthcoming) evaluates societal benefits and other impacts for this same scenario. Under reference or central conditions, the analysis finds cumulative wind capacity of 404 GW would be required to reach this level and drive 2050 incremental electricity rate and cumulative electric sector savings of 2% and 3%, respectively, relative to a scenario with no new wind capacity additions. Greater savings are estimated under higher fossil fuel costs or with greater advancements in wind technologies. Conversely, incremental costs are found when fossil fuel costs are lower than central assumptions or wind technology improvements are more-limited. Through 2030 the primary generation sources displaced by new wind capacity include natural gas and coal-fired generation. By 2050 wind could displace other renewables. Incremental new transmission infrastructure totaling 29 million MW-miles is estimated to be needed by 2050. In conjunction with related societal benefits, this work demonstrates that 35% wind energy by 2050 is plausible, could support enduring benefits, and could result in long-term consumer savings, if nearer-term (pre-2030) cost barriers are overcome; at the same time, these opportunities are not anticipated to be realized in their full form under “business-as-usual” conditions.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

WFIP was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), with partners that included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), private forecasting companies (WindLogics and AWS Truepower), DOE national laboratories, grid operators, and universities. WFIP employed two avenues for improving wind power forecasts: first, through the collection of special observations to be assimilated into forecast models and, second, by upgrading NWP forecast models and ensembles. The new observations were collected during concurrent year-long field campaigns in two high wind energy resource areas of the United States (the upper Great Plains and Texas) and included 12 wind profiling radars, 12 sodars, several lidars and surface flux stations, 184 instrumented tall towers, and over 400 nacelle anemometers. Results demonstrate that a substantial reduction (12%–5% for forecast hours 1–12) in power RMSE was achieved from the combination of improved numerical weather prediction models and assimilation of new observations, equivalent to the previous decade’s worth of improvements found for low-level winds in NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS) operational weather forecast models. Data-denial experiments run over select periods of time demonstrate that up to a 6% improvement came from the new observations. Ensemble forecasts developed by the private sector partners also produced significant improvements in power production and ramp prediction.

Out of which, the Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine and the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine have now advanced design, but still there is scope to improve their efficiency. The Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) has the advantage over Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) for working on omnidirectional air flow without any extra control system. A modified H-rotor Darrieus type VAWT is analysed in this paper, which is a lift based wind turbine. The effect of solidity (i.e. chord length, no. of blades) on power coefficient (C{sub P}) of H-rotor for different tip speed ratios is numerically investigated. The study is conducted using time dependent RANS equations using SST k-ω model.

Wind plant control is an active research field that attempts to improve wind plant performance by coordinating control of individual turbines to take into account these turbine–wake interactions. High-fidelity simulations of a two-turbine fully waked scenario are used to investigate several wake mitigation strategies, in this paper, including modification of yaw and tilt angles of an upstream turbine to induce wake skew, as well as repositioning of the downstream turbine. The simulation results are compared through change relative to a baseline operation in terms of overall power capture and loading on the upstream and downstream turbine.

"Dynamic Droop–Based Inertial Control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator","Hwang, Min; Muljadi, Eduard; Park, Jung-Wook; Sorensen, Poul; Kang, Yong Cheol","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind generator; inertial control; dynamic droop; rate of change of frequency; frequency nadir","If a large disturbance occurs in a power grid, two auxiliary loops for the inertial control of a wind turbine generator have been used: droop loop and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) loop. Because their gains are fixed, difficulties arise in determining them suitable for all grid and wind conditions. This paper proposes a dynamic droop-based inertial control scheme of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The scheme aims to improve the frequency nadir (FN) and ensure stable operation of a DFIG. To achieve the first goal, the scheme uses a droop loop, but it dynamically changes its gain based on the ROCOF to release a large amount of kinetic energy during the initial stage of a disturbance. To do this, a shaping function that relates the droop to the ROCOF is used. To achieve the second goal, different shaping functions, which depend on rotor speeds, are used to give a large contribution in high wind conditions and prevent over-deceleration in low wind conditions during inertial control. The performance of the proposed scheme was investigated under various wind conditions using an EMTP-RV simulator. The results indicate that the scheme improves the FN and ensures stable operation of a DFIG.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Advanced Modeling System for Optimization of Wind Farm Layout and Wind Turbine Sizing Using a Multi-Level Extended Pattern Search Algorithm","DuPont, Bryony; Cagan, Jonathan; Moriarty, Patrick","17 WIND ENERGY; wind farm optimization; wind farm modeling; extended pattern search algorithm; systems optimization; wind plant layout","This paper presents a system of modeling advances that can be applied in the computational optimization of wind plants. These modeling advances include accurate cost and power modeling, partial wake interaction, and the effects of varying atmospheric stability. To validate the use of this advanced modeling system, it is employed within an Extended Pattern Search (EPS)-Multi-Agent System (MAS) optimization approach for multiple wind scenarios. The wind farm layout optimization problem involves optimizing the position and size of wind turbines such that the aerodynamic effects of upstream turbines are reduced, which increases the effective wind speed and resultant power at each turbine. The EPS-MAS optimization algorithm employs a profit objective, and an overarching search determines individual turbine positions, with a concurrent EPS-MAS determining the optimal hub height and rotor diameter for each turbine. Two wind cases are considered: (1) constant, unidirectional wind, and (2) three discrete wind speeds and varying wind directions, each of which have a probability of occurrence. Results show the advantages of applying the series of advanced models compared to previous application of an EPS with less advanced models to wind farm layout optimization, and imply best practices for computational optimization of wind farms with improved accuracy.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Analysis of the sweeped actuator line method","Nathan, Jörn; Masson, Christian; Dufresne, Louis; Churchfield, Matthew J.","17 WIND ENERGY; actuator line method; wind turbines; blade tip vortex generation","The actuator line method made it possible to describe the near wake of a wind turbine more accurately than with the actuator disk method. Whereas the actuator line generates the helicoidal vortex system shed from the tip blades, the actuator disk method sheds a vortex sheet from the edge of the rotor plane. But with the actuator line come also temporal and spatial constraints, such as the need for a much smaller time step than with actuator disk. While the latter one only has to obey the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, the former one is also restricted by the grid resolution and the rotor tip-speed. Additionally the spatial resolution has to be finer for the actuator line than with the actuator disk, for well resolving the tip vortices. Therefore this work is dedicated to examining a method in between of actuator line and actuator disk, which is able to model the transient behavior, such as the rotating blades, but which also relaxes the temporal constraint. Therefore a larger time-step is used and the blade forces are swept over a certain area. As a result, the main focus of this article is on the aspect of the blade tip vortex generation in comparison with the standard actuator line and actuator disk.","EDP Sciences","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, PMSG-WTGs can provide value to an electric grid by contributing to the system's inertial response through the inherent kinetic energy stored in their rotating masses and fast power converter control. In this study, an improved inertial control method based on the maximum power point tracking operation curve is introduced to enhance the overall frequency support capability of PMSG-WTGs in the case of large supply-demand imbalances. Moreover, this method is implemented in the CART2-PMSG integrated model in MATLAB/Simulink to investigate its impact on the wind turbine's structural loads during the inertial response process. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the frequency nadir, arrest the rate of change of frequency, and alleviate the secondary frequency dip while imposing no negative impact on the major mechanical components of the wind turbine.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Maximization of the annual energy production of wind power plants by optimization of layout and yaw-based wake control: Maximization of wind plant AEP by optimization of layout and wake control","Gebraad, Pieter; Thomas, Jared J.; Ning, Andrew; Fleming, Paul; Dykes, Katherine","17 WIND ENERGY; wind plant optimization; wind turbine control; wind turbine wakes; wind plant systems engineering; NREL","This paper presents a wind plant modeling and optimization tool that enables the maximization of wind plant annual energy production (AEP) using yaw-based wake steering control and layout changes. The tool is an extension of a wake engineering model describing the steady-state effects of yaw on wake velocity profiles and power productions of wind turbines in a wind plant. To make predictions of a wind plant's AEP, necessary extensions of the original wake model include coupling it with a detailed rotor model and a control policy for turbine blade pitch and rotor speed. This enables the prediction of power production with wake effects throughout a range of wind speeds. We use the tool to perform an example optimization study on a wind plant based on the Princess Amalia Wind Park. In this case study, combined optimization of layout and wake steering control increases AEP by 5%. The power gains from wake steering control are highest for region 1.5 inflow wind speeds, and they continue to be present to some extent for the above-rated inflow wind speeds. The results show that layout optimization and wake steering are complementary because significant AEP improvements can be achieved with wake steering in a wind plant layout that is already optimized to reduce wake losses.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Investigating wind turbine impacts on near-wake flow using profiling lidar data and large-eddy simulations with an actuator disk model","Mirocha, Jeffrey D.; Rajewski, Daniel A.; Marjanovic, Nikola; Lundquist, Julie K.; Kosović, Branko; Draxl, Caroline; Churchfield, Matthew J.","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; LIDAR; wind turbines; automatic speech recognition systems; large eddy simulations; computer modeling","In this study, wind turbine impacts on the atmospheric flow are investigated using data from the Crop Wind Energy Experiment (CWEX-11) and large-eddy simulations (LESs) utilizing a generalized actuator disk (GAD) wind turbine model. CWEX-11 employed velocity-azimuth display (VAD) data from two Doppler lidar systems to sample vertical profiles of flow parameters across the rotor depth both upstream and in the wake of an operating 1.5 MW wind turbine. Lidar and surface observations obtained during four days of July 2011 are analyzed to characterize the turbine impacts on wind speed and flow variability, and to examine the sensitivity of these changes to atmospheric stability. Significant velocity deficits (VD) are observed at the downstream location during both convective and stable portions of four diurnal cycles, with large, sustained deficits occurring during stable conditions. Variances of the streamwise velocity component, σ<sub>u</sub>, likewise show large increases downstream during both stable and unstable conditions, with stable conditions supporting sustained small increases of σ<sub>u</sub> , while convective conditions featured both larger magnitudes and increased variability, due to the large coherent structures in the background flow. Two representative case studies, one stable and one convective, are simulated using LES with a GAD model at 6 m resolution to evaluate the compatibility of the simulation framework with validation using vertically profiling lidar data in the near wake region. Virtual lidars were employed to sample the simulated flow field in a manner consistent with the VAD technique. Simulations reasonably reproduced aggregated wake VD characteristics, albeit with smaller magnitudes than observed, while σu values in the wake are more significantly underestimated. The results illuminate the limitations of using a GAD in combination with coarse model resolution in the simulation of near wake physics, and validation thereof using VAD data.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, forecasting errors, inherent to the point forecasts, increase requirements for energy storage and can affect optimal system operation. Probabilistic forecasts can help tackle this issue by providing a proper characterization of forecasting errors in the optimization process. This paper proposes a multivariate model of forecasting data for wind generation. Predictive uncertainty intervals of wind power can be obtained by sampling from the proposed model. The main goal is to use empirical data models without linear or Gaussian approximations of the distributional or temporal variations. The predictive modeling is utilized within a case study of an energy storage system. Finally, a modified robust convex programming is used to maintain the practical robustness and feasibility of the solution based on the sampled scenarios from the model.","IEEE","","Univ. of Central Florida, Orlando, FL (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 1350-1360","","","EE0007327","Journal ID: ISSN 1551-3203","10.1109/TII.2016.2569531","","2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","1574254","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1574254","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1574254","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","4","12"
"On infrasound generated by wind farms and its propagation in low-altitude tropospheric waveguides","Marcillo, Omar; Arrowsmith, Stephen; Blom, Philip; Jones, Kyle","17 WIND ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; wind farm; thickness sound; infrasound","Infrasound from a 60-turbine wind farm was found to propagate to distances up to 90 km under nighttime atmospheric conditions. Four infrasound sensor arrays were deployed in central New Mexico in February 2014; three of these arrays captured infrasound from a large wind farm. The arrays were in a linear configuration oriented southeast with 13, 54, 90, and 126 km radial distances and azimuths of 166°, 119°, 113°, and 111° from the 60 1.6 MW turbine Red Mesa Wind Farm, Laguna Pueblo, New Mexico, USA. Peaks at a fundamental frequency slightly below 0.9 Hz and its harmonics characterize the spectrum of the detected infrasound. The generation of this signal is linked to the interaction of the blades, flow gradients, and the supporting tower. The production of wind-farm sound, its propagation, and detection at long distances can be related to the characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer. First, under stable conditions, mostly occurring at night, winds are highly stratified, which enhances the production of thickness sound and the modulation of other higher-frequency wind turbine sounds. Second, nocturnal atmospheric conditions can create low-altitude waveguides (with altitudes on the order of hundreds of meters) allowing long-distance propagation. Third, night and early morning hours are characterized by reduced background atmospheric noise that enhances signal detectability. This paper describes the characteristics of the infrasound from a quasi-continuous source with the potential for long-range propagation that could be used to monitor the lower part of the atmospheric boundary layer.","American Geophysical Union","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"High-Throughput Computation and the Applicability of Monte Carlo Integration in Fatigue Load Estimation of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines","Graf, Peter A.; Stewart, Gordon; Lackner, Matthew; Dykes, Katherine; Veers, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; FAST; high-throughput; openMDAO; turbine fatigue; Monte Carlo integration","Long-term fatigue loads for floating offshore wind turbines are hard to estimate because they require the evaluation of the integral of a highly nonlinear function over a wide variety of wind and wave conditions. Current design standards involve scanning over a uniform rectangular grid of metocean inputs (e.g., wind speed and direction and wave height and period), which becomes intractable in high dimensions as the number of required evaluations grows exponentially with dimension. Monte Carlo integration offers a potentially efficient alternative because it has theoretical convergence proportional to the inverse of the square root of the number of samples, which is independent of dimension. In this paper, we first report on the integration of the aeroelastic code FAST into NREL's systems engineering tool, WISDEM, and the development of a high-throughput pipeline capable of sampling from arbitrary distributions, running FAST on a large scale, and postprocessing the results into estimates of fatigue loads. Second, we use this tool to run a variety of studies aimed at comparing grid-based and Monte Carlo-based approaches with calculating long-term fatigue loads. We observe that for more than a few dimensions, the Monte Carlo approach can represent a large improvement in computational efficiency, but that as nonlinearity increases, the effectiveness of Monte Carlo is correspondingly reduced. The present work sets the stage for future research focusing on using advanced statistical methods for analysis of wind turbine fatigue as well as extreme loads.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Morphing Downwind-Aligned Rotor Concept Based on a 13-MW Wind Turbine","Ichter, Brian; Steele, Adam; Loth, Eric; Moriarty, Patrick; Selig, Michael","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; extreme-scale; turbine; morphing; MoDaR","To alleviate the mass-scaling issues associated with conventional upwind rotors of extreme-scale wind turbines (>/=10 MW), a morphing downwind-aligned rotor (MoDaR) concept is proposed herein. The concept employs a downwind rotor with blades whose elements are stiff (no intentional flexibility) but with hub-joints that can be unlocked to allow for moment-free downwind alignment. Aligning the combination of gravitational, centrifugal and thrust forces along the blade path reduces downwind cantilever loads, resulting in primarily tensile loading. For control simplicity, the blade curvature can be fixed with a single morphing degree of freedom using a near-hub joint for coning angle: 22 degrees at rated conditions. The conventional baseline was set as the 13.2-MW Sandia 100-m all glass blade in a three-bladed upwind configuration. To quantify potential mass savings, a downwind load-aligning, two-bladed rotor was designed. Because of the reduced number of blades, the MoDaR concept had a favorable 33% mass reduction. The blade reduction and coning led to a reduction in rated power, but morphing increased energy capture at lower speeds such that both the MoDaR and conventional rotors have the same average power: 5.4 MW. A finite element analysis showed that quasi-steady structural stresses could be reduced, over a range of operating wind speeds and azimuthal angles, despite the increases in loading per blade. However, the concept feasibility requires additional investigation of the mass, cost and complexity of the morphing hinge, the impact of unsteady aeroelastic influence because of turbulence and off-design conditions, along with system-level Levelized Cost of Energy analysis.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This causes the agricultural land moves to mountain area. In mountainous agricultural area, farmers use the water resources of small rivers in the groove of the mountain to irrigate the farmland. Farmers use their power to lift up water from the river to their land which causes inefectivity in the work of the farmers. Farmers who have capital utilize pump to raise water to their land. The only way to use pump in mountain area is by using fuel energy as there is no electricity, and the fuel price in mountain area is very expensive. Based on those reasons it is wise to consider the exploration of renewable energy available in the area such as solar energy, wind energy and hybrid energy. This study analyses the potential of the application of hybrid power plant, which is the combination of solar and wind energy, to power agricultural pump. In this research, the data of wind speed and solar radiation are collected from the measurement of BMKG SMPK Plus Sare. Related to the solar energy, the photovoltaic output power calculation is 193 W with duration of irradiation of 5 hours/day.

Field data are not acquired at sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to dissect some of the mysteries of wake turbulence. It is here that the actuator line method has evolved to become the technology standard in the wind energy community. This work presents the actuator line method embedded into an Open source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) large-eddy simulation solver and applies it to two small wind farms, the first one consisting of an array of two National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 Megawatt (NREL 5-MW) turbines separated by seven rotor diameters in neutral and unstable atmospheric boundary-layer flow and the second one consisting of five NREL 5-MW wind turbines in unstable atmospheric conditions arranged in two staggered arrays of two and three turbines, respectively. Detailed statistics involving power spectral density (PSD) of turbine power along with standard deviations reveal the effects of atmospheric turbulence and its space and time scales. In conclusion, high-resolution surface data extracts provide new insight into the complex recovery process of the wake momentum deficit governed by turbulence transport phenomena.","MDPI AG","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind and Water Technologies Office (EE-4W)","","United States","2015-06-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 7","","Medium: ED; Size: p. 6468-6496","","","EE0005481","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en8076468","10.3390/en8076468","","2021-08-27T00:00:00Z","1348917","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1348917","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1348917","Energies","7","8"
"Large Eddy Simulation of Wind Turbine Wakes.

The study focuses on prediction of wind turbine wakes and their breakdown when subject to uniform inflow. Previous studies have shown relative insensitivity to subgrid modeling in the context of a finite-volume code. The present study uses the low dissipation pseudo-spectral LES code from Johns Hopkins University (LESGO) and the second-order, finite-volume OpenFOAMcode (SOWFA) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. When subject to uniform inflow, the loads on the blades are found to be unaffected by subgrid models or numerics, as expected. The turbulence in the wake and the location of transition to a turbulent state are affected by the subgrid-scale model and the numerics.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

L.","17 WIND ENERGY; Mesoscale simulation; low-level jet; Weather Research and Forecasting model; Wind Forecast Improvement Project; lidar wind profiler","The accuracy of boundary-layer wind profiles occurring during nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) events, and their sensitivities to variations of user-specifiable model configuration parameters within the Weather Research and Forecasting model, was investigated. Simulations were compared against data from a wind-profiling lidar, deployed to the Northern Great Plains during the U.S. Department of Energy-supported Weather Forecast Improvement Project. Two periods during the autumn of 2011 featuring LLJs of similar magnitudes and durations occurring during several consecutive nights were selected for analysis. Simulated wind speed and direction at 80 and 180 m above the surface, the former a typical wind turbine hub height, bulk vertical gradients between 40 and 120 m, a typical rotor span, and the maximum wind speeds occurring at 80 and 180 m, and their times of occurrence, were compared with the observations. Sensitivities of these parameters to the horizontal and vertical grid spacing, planetary boundary layer and land surface model physics options, and atmospheric forcing dataset, were assessed using ensembles encompassing changes of each of these configuration parameters. Furthermore, each simulation captured the diurnal cycle of wind speed and stratification, producing LLJs during each overnight period; however, large discrepancies in relation to the observations were frequently observed, with each ensemble producing a wide range of distributions, reflecting highly variable representations of stratification during the weakly stable overnight conditions. Root mean square error and bias values computed over the LLJ cycle (late evening through the following morning) revealed that, while some configurations performed better or worse in different aspects and at different times, none exhibited definitively superior performance. The considerable root mean square error and bias values, even among the ‘best’ performing simulations, underscore the need for improved simulation capabilities for the prediction of near-surface winds during LLJ conditions.","Wiley","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Atmospheric Flow Development and Associated Changes in Turbulent Sensible Heat Flux over a Patchy Mountain Snow Cover","Mott, Rebecca; Daniels, Megan; Lehning, Michael","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 17 WIND ENERGY; Atmosphere-land interaction; Cold pools; Fluxes; Hydrometeorology; Sensible heating; Small scale processes","In this study, the small-scale boundary layer dynamics and the energy balance over a fractional snow cover are numerically investigated. The atmospheric boundary layer flows over a patchy snow cover were calculated with an atmospheric model (Advanced Regional Prediction System) on a very high spatial resolution of 5 m. The numerical results revealed that the development of local flow patterns and the relative importance of boundary layer processes depend on the snow patch size distribution and the synoptic wind forcing. Energy balance calculations for quiescent wind situations demonstrated that well-developed katabatic winds exerted a major control on the energy balance over the patchy snow cover, leading to a maximum in the mean downward sensible heat flux over snow for high snow-cover fractions. This implies that if katabatic winds develop, total melt of snow patches may decrease for low snow-cover fractions despite an increasing ambient air temperature, which would not be predicted by most hydrological models. In contrast, stronger synoptic winds increased the effect of heat advection on the catchment’s melt behavior by enhancing the mean sensible heat flux over snow for lower snow-cover fractions. A sensitivity analysis to grid resolution suggested that the grid size is a critical factor for modeling the energy balance of a patchy snow cover. The comparison of simulation results from coarse (50 m) and fine (5 m) horizontal resolutions revealed a difference in the spatially averaged turbulent heat flux over snow of 40%–70% for synoptic cases and 95% for quiescent cases.","American Meteorological Society","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Coalescing Wind Turbine Wakes","Lee, S.; Churchfield, M.; Sirnivas, S.; Moriarty, P.; Nielsen, F. G.; Skaare, B.; Byklum, E.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind turbine; wakes","A team of researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Statoil used large-eddy simulations to numerically investigate the merging wakes from upstream offshore wind turbines. Merging wakes are typical phenomena in wind farm flows in which neighboring turbine wakes consolidate to form complex flow patterns that are as yet not well understood. In the present study, three 6-MW turbines in a row were subjected to a neutrally stable atmospheric boundary layer flow. As a result, the wake from the farthest upstream turbine conjoined the downstream wake, which significantly altered the subsequent velocity deficit structures, turbulence intensity, and the global meandering behavior. The complexity increased even more when the combined wakes from the two upstream turbines mixed with the wake generated by the last turbine, thereby forming a ""triplet"" structure. Although the influence of the wake generated by the first turbine decayed with downstream distance, the mutated wakes from the second turbine continued to influence the downstream wake. Two mirror-image angles of wind directions that yielded partial wakes impinging on the downstream turbines yielded asymmetric wake profiles that could be attributed to the changing flow directions in the rotor plane induced by the Coriolis force. In conclusion, the turbine wakes persisted for extended distances in the present study, which is a result of low aerodynamic surface roughness typically found in offshore conditions","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The role of atmospheric stability/turbulence on wakes at the Egmond aan Zee offshore wind farm","Barthelmie, R. J.; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Moriarty, Patrick J.; Lundquist, Julie K.; Oxley, G. S.; Hahn, S.; Pryor, S. C.","17 WIND ENERGY; atmospheric stability; turbulence; wake behavior; wind farm","Here, the aim of the paper is to present results from the NREL SOWFA project that compares simulations from models of different fidelity to meteorological and turbine data from the Egmond aan Zee wind farm. Initial results illustrate that wake behavior and impacts are strongly impacted by turbulence intensity. This includes both power losses from wakes and loading illustrated by the out of plane bending moment. Here we focus on understanding the relationship between turbulence and atmospheric stability and whether power losses due to wakes can effectively be characterized by measures of turbulence alone or whether atmospheric stability as a whole plays a fundamental role in wake behavior. The study defines atmospheric stability using the Monin-Obukhov length estimated based on the temperature difference between 116 and 70 m. The data subset selected using this method for the calculation of the Monin-Obukhov length indicate little diurnal or directional dependence of the stability classes but a dominance of stable classes in the spring/unstable classes in fall and of near-neutral classes at high wind speeds. The analysis is complicated by the need to define turbulence intensity. We can select the ratio of the standard deviation of wind speed to mean wind speed in each observation period using data from the meteorological mast, in which case a substantial amount of data must be excluded due to the presence of the wind farm. An alternative is to use data from the wind turbines which could provide a larger data set for analysis. These approaches are examined and compared to illustrate their robustness. Finally, power losses from wakes are categorized according to stability and/or turbulence in order to understand their relative importance in determining the behavior of wind turbine wakes.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

LIPC has recently been introduced as an alternative to the conventional individual pitch control (IPC) strategy for two-bladed wind turbines. The main advantage of LIPC over conventional IPC is that it requires, at most, only two feedback loops to potentially reduce the periodic blade loads. In previous work, LIPC was designed to implement blade pitch angles at a fixed frequency (e.g., the once-per-revolution (1P) frequency), which made it only applicable in above-rated wind turbine operating conditions. In this study, LIPC is extended to below-rated operating conditions by gain scheduling the controller on the rotor speed. With this extension, LIPC and conventional IPC are successfully applied to the NREL CART2 wind turbine. Lastly, the field-test results obtained during the measurement campaign indicate that LIPC significantly reduces the wind turbine loads for both below-rated and above-rated operation.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Variability of interconnected wind plants: correlation length and its dependence on variability time scale","St. Martin, Clara M.; Lundquist, Julie K.; Handschy, Mark A.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind power; variability; geographic diversity","The variability in wind-generated electricity complicates the integration of this electricity into the electrical grid. This challenge steepens as the percentage of renewably-generated electricity on the grid grows, but variability can be reduced by exploiting geographic diversity: correlations between wind farms decrease as the separation between wind farms increases. However, how far is far enough to reduce variability? Grid management requires balancing production on various timescales, and so consideration of correlations reflective of those timescales can guide the appropriate spatial scales of geographic diversity grid integration. To answer 'how far is far enough,' we investigate the universal behavior of geographic diversity by exploring wind-speed correlations using three extensive datasets spanning continents, durations and time resolution. First, one year of five-minute wind power generation data from 29 wind farms span 1270 km across Southeastern Australia (Australian Energy Market Operator). Second, 45 years of hourly 10 m wind-speeds from 117 stations span 5000 km across Canada (National Climate Data Archive of Environment Canada). Finally, four years of five-minute wind-speeds from 14 meteorological towers span 350 km of the Northwestern US (Bonneville Power Administration). After removing diurnal cycles and seasonal trends from all datasets, we investigate dependence of correlation length on time scale by digitally high-pass filtering the data on 0.25–2000 h timescales and calculating correlations between sites for each high-pass filter cut-off. Correlations fall to zero with increasing station separation distance, but the characteristic correlation length varies with the high-pass filter applied: the higher the cut-off frequency, the smaller the station separation required to achieve de-correlation. Remarkable similarities between these three datasets reveal behavior that, if universal, could be particularly useful for grid management. For high-pass filter time constants shorter than about τ = 38 h, all datasets exhibit a correlation length $\xi $ that falls at least as fast as ${{\tau }^{-1}}$ . Since the inter-site separation needed for statistical independence falls for shorter time scales, higher-rate fluctuations can be effectively smoothed by aggregating wind plants over areas smaller than otherwise estimated.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Characterizing wind power resource reliability in southern Africa","Fant, Charles; Gunturu, Bhaskar; Schlosser, Adam","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind energy; Intermittency; Africa; South Africa; Reanalysis; Renewable energy","Producing electricity from wind is attractive because it provides a clean, low-maintenance power supply. However, wind resource is intermittent on various timescales, thus occasionally introducing large and sudden changes in power supply. A better understanding of this variability can greatly benefit power grid planning. In the following study, wind resource is characterized using metrics that highlight these intermittency issues; therefore identifying areas of high and low wind power reliability in southern Africa and Kenya at different time-scales. After developing a wind speed profile, these metrics are applied at various heights in order to assess the added benefit of raising the wind turbine hub. Furthermore, since the interconnection of wind farms can aid in reducing the overall intermittency, the value of interconnecting near-by sites is mapped using two distinct methods. Of the countries in this region, the Republic of South Africa has shown the most interest in wind power investment. For this reason, we focus parts of the study on wind reliability in the country. The study finds that, although mean Wind Power Density is high in South Africa compared to its neighboring countries, wind power resource tends to be less reliable than in other parts of southern Africa—namely central Tanzania. We also find that South Africa’s potential varies over different timescales, with higher reliability in the summer than winter, and higher reliability during the day than at night. This study is concluded by introducing two methods and measures to characterize the value of interconnection, including the use of principal component analysis to identify areas with a common signal.","Elsevier","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC)","","United Kingdom","2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy Journal Volume: 161 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: p. 565-573","","","XA-83240101; PI-83412601-0; RD-83427901-0; XA-83505101-0; XA-83600001-1; UTA12-000624; fg02-94ER61937","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; S0306261915010053; PII: S0306261915010053","10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.08.069","","2021-07-12T00:00:00Z","1213785","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1213785","","Applied Energy","C","161"
"Voltage control for a wind power plant based on the available reactive current of a DFIG and its impacts on the point of interconnection","Usman, Yasir; Kim, Jinho; Muljadi, Eduard; Kang, Yong Cheol","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; doubly-fed induction generator; voltage control; wind power plant; wake effect; available reactive current; point of interconnection","Wake effects cause wind turbine generators (WTGs) within a wind power plant (WPP) to produce different levels of active power and subsequent reactive power capabilities. Further, the impedance between a WTG and the point of interconnection (POI)-which depends on the distance between them-impacts the WPP's reactive power injection capability at the POI. This paper proposes a voltage control scheme for a WPP based on the available reactive current of the doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) and its impacts on the POI to improve the reactive power injection capability of the WPP. In this paper, a design strategy for modifying the gain of DFIG controller is suggested and the comprehensive properties of these control gains are investigated. In the proposed scheme, the WPP controller, which operates in a voltage control mode, sends the command signal to the DFIGs based on the voltage difference at the POI. The DFIG controllers, which operate in a voltage control mode, employ a proportional controller with a limiter. The gain of the proportional controller is adjusted depending on the available reactive current of the DFIG and the series impedance between the DFIG and the POI. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated for various disturbances such as a reactive load connection and grid fault using an EMTP-RV simulator. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme promptly recovers the POI voltage by injecting more reactive power after a disturbance than the conventional scheme.","Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Quantifying error of lidar and sodar Doppler beam swinging measurements of wind turbine wakes using computational fluid dynamics","Lundquist, J. K.; Churchfield, M. J.; Lee, S.; Clifton, A.","17 WIND ENERGY; LIDAR; line-of-sight velocity; atmospheric boundary layer; wind turbine wakes; computational fluid dynamics","<p>Wind-profiling lidars are now regularly used in boundary-layer meteorology and in applications such as wind energy and air quality. Lidar wind profilers exploit the Doppler shift of laser light backscattered from particulates carried by the wind to measure a line-of-sight (LOS) velocity. The Doppler beam swinging (DBS) technique, used by many commercial systems, considers measurements of this LOS velocity in multiple radial directions in order to estimate horizontal and vertical winds. The method relies on the assumption of homogeneous flow across the region sampled by the beams. Using such a system in inhomogeneous flow, such as wind turbine wakes or complex terrain, will result in errors. <br><br> To quantify the errors expected from such violation of the assumption of horizontal homogeneity, we simulate inhomogeneous flow in the atmospheric boundary layer, notably stably stratified flow past a wind turbine, with a mean wind speed of 6.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> at the turbine hub-height of 80 m. This slightly stable case results in 15° of wind direction change across the turbine rotor disk. The resulting flow field is sampled in the same fashion that a lidar samples the atmosphere with the DBS approach, including the lidar range weighting function, enabling quantification of the error in the DBS observations. The observations from the instruments located upwind have small errors, which are ameliorated with time averaging. However, the downwind observations, particularly within the first two rotor diameters downwind from the wind turbine, suffer from errors due to the heterogeneity of the wind turbine wake. Errors in the stream-wise component of the flow approach 30% of the hub-height inflow wind speed close to the rotor disk. Errors in the cross-stream and vertical velocity components are also significant: cross-stream component errors are on the order of 15% of the hub-height inflow wind speed (1.0 m s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and errors in the vertical velocity measurement exceed the actual vertical velocity. By three rotor diameters downwind, DBS-based assessments of wake wind speed deficits based on the stream-wise velocity can be relied on even within the near wake within 1.0 s<sup>-1</sup> (or 15% of the hub-height inflow wind speed), and the cross-stream velocity error is reduced to 8% while vertical velocity estimates are compromised.

Reactive power planning (RPP) in this particular condition involves a high level of uncertainty because of wind power characteristic. To properly model wind generation uncertainty, a multi-scenario framework optimal power flow that considers the voltage stability constraint under the worst wind scenario and transmission N 1 contingency is developed. The objective of RPP in this study is to minimise the total cost including the VAR investment cost and the expected generation cost. Therefore RPP under this condition is modelled as a two-stage stochastic programming problem to optimise the VAR location and size in one stage, then to minimise the fuel cost in the other stage, and eventually, to find the global optimal RPP results iteratively. Benders decomposition is used to solve this model with an upper level problem (master problem) for VAR allocation optimisation and a lower problem (sub-problem) for generation cost minimisation. Impact of the potential reactive power support from doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is also analysed. Lastly, case studies on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems are provided to verify the proposed method.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Demonstrated characteristics include probability distribution for different ramp durations, seasonal and diurnal variability and low net load events. The comparison shows regions with low variability (Sweden, Spain and Germany), medium variability (Portugal, Ireland, Finland and Denmark) and regions with higher variability (Quebec, Bonneville Power Administration and Electric Reliability Council of Texas in North America; Gansu, Jilin and Liaoning in China; and Norway and offshore wind power in Denmark). For regions with low variability, the maximum 1 h wind ramps are below 10% of nominal capacity, and for regions with high variability, they may be close to 30%. Wind power variability is mainly explained by the extent of geographical spread, but also higher capacity factor causes higher variability. It was also shown how wind power ramps are autocorrelated and dependent on the operating output level. When wind power was concentrated in smaller area, there were outliers with high changes in wind output, which were not present in large areas with well-dispersed wind power.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wind Power Curve Modeling in Complex Terrain Using Statistical Models","Bulaevskaya, V.; Wharton, S.; Clifton, A.; Qualley, G.; Miller, W. O.","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind Energy","The simplest power curves model wind power only as a function of the wind speed at the turbine hub height. While the latter is an essential predictor of power output, wind speed information in other parts of the vertical profile, as well as additional atmospheric variables, are also important determinants of power. The goal of this work was to determine the gain in predictive ability afforded by adding wind speed information at other heights, as well as other atmospheric variables, to the power prediction model. Using data from a wind farm with a moderately complex terrain in the Altamont Pass region in California, we trained three statistical models—a neural network, a random forest and a Gaussian process model—to predict power output from various sets of aforementioned predictors. The comparison of these predictions to the observed power data revealed that considerable improvements in prediction accuracy can be achieved both through the addition of predictors other than the hub-height wind speed and the use of statistical models. To our knowledge, the use of the Gaussian process model in this context is new, in contrast to neural networks and random forests. The advantage of this model over the other two models is that it provides a much more natural way to estimate the uncertainty associated with its predictions. In addition, this study presents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of the relative importance of various wind power curve inputs.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The Influence of Sliding and Contact Severity on the Generation of White Etching Cracks","Gould, Benjamin; Greco, Aaron","17 WIND ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; Bearing Failures; Microstructural Alterations; White Etching Cracks; Wind Turbine Gearbox Bearings","White etching cracks (WECs) have been identified as the dominant mechanism of premature failure for bearings within wind turbine gearboxes. Though WECs have been observed in the field for over a decade, the exact mechanisms which lead to this failure are still debated, and benchtop replication has proven difficult. In previously published work, WECs have been replicated only through the use of component level test rigs, where complete bearings are tested. In these tests, the factors that are thought to drive the formation of WECs, such as slide-to-roll ratio (SRR) and lubricant film thickness, cannot not be easily altered or controlled. In this paper, WECs have been replicated on a three rings on roller, benchtop test rig, which allowed for a direct investigation into the influence that SRR magnitude, sliding direction, and the lubricant film thickness have on surface failures and WEC generation. It was determined that WEC were formed in samples that experienced -30% SRR at various lubrication conditions, however, at lower levels of negative SRR and positive SRR up to 30% no white-etching cracks were observed.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

"Comparison of numerical weather prediction based deterministic and probabilistic wind resource assessment methods","Zhang, Jie; Draxl, Caroline; Hopson, Thomas; Monache, Luca Delle; Vanvyve, Emilie; Hodge, Bri-Mathias","17 WIND ENERGY; analog ensemble; numerical weather prediction; probabilistic wind resource assessment; variability; wind toolkit; Merra","Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been widely used for wind resource assessment. Model runs with higher spatial resolution are generally more accurate, yet extremely computational expensive. An alternative approach is to use data generated by a low resolution NWP model, in conjunction with statistical methods. In order to analyze the accuracy and computational efficiency of different types of NWP-based wind resource assessment methods, this paper performs a comparison of three deterministic and probabilistic NWP-based wind resource assessment methodologies: (i) a coarse resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.67 degrees) global reanalysis data set, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA); (ii) an analog ensemble methodology based on the MERRA, which provides both deterministic and probabilistic predictions; and (iii) a fine resolution (2-km) NWP data set, the Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit, based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Results show that: (i) as expected, the analog ensemble and WIND Toolkit perform significantly better than MERRA confirming their ability to downscale coarse estimates; (ii) the analog ensemble provides the best estimate of the multi-year wind distribution at seven of the nine sites, while the WIND Toolkit is the best at one site; (iii) the WIND Toolkit is more accurate in estimating the distribution of hourly wind speed differences, which characterizes the wind variability, at five of the available sites, with the analog ensemble being best at the remaining four locations; and (iv) the analog ensemble computational cost is negligible, whereas the WIND Toolkit requires large computational resources. Future efforts could focus on the combination of the analog ensemble with intermediate resolution (e.g., 10-15 km) NWP estimates, to considerably reduce the computational burden, while providing accurate deterministic estimates and reliable probabilistic assessments.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

A nonlinear feedforward controller is extended by an adaptive filter to remove all uncorrelated frequencies of the wind speed measurement to avoid unnecessary control action. Positive effects on the rotor speed regulation as well as on tower, blade and shaft loads have been observed in the case that the previous measured correlation and timing between the wind preview and the turbine reaction are accomplish. The feedforward controller had negative impact, when the LIDAR measurement was disturbed by obstacles in front of the turbine. This work proves, that LIDAR is valuable tool for wind turbine control not only in simulations but also under real conditions. Moreover, the paper shows that further understanding of the relationship between the wind measurement and the turbine reaction is crucial to improve LIDAR assisted control of wind turbines.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

One of the leading causes has been micropitting, a failure mode that is possibly overlooked by design, selection and life-prediction tools. It remains to be seen if retrofitting problematic spherical roller bearings (SRBs) with improved bearing design solutions can improve their durability. Questions to ask might be: ‘Are the operating conditions of the main bearing well understood?’ and ‘Are the failures caused by deficient design practice or other unidentified external sources within the system?’ These questions fundamentally challenge the underlying design basis and encourage the need for a system analysis approach that is currently being undertaken by researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Specifically, this article discusses a few potential design alternatives and system-level reassessment to circumvent micropitting in main bearings used in TPM drivetrains.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Dissipation of turbulence in the wake of a wind turbine","Lundquist, J. K.; Bariteau, L.","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind turbines; atmospheric boundary layer; turbulence; dissipation rate; tethered lifting system; turbulent kinetic energy","The wake of a wind turbine is characterized by increased turbulence and decreased wind speed. Turbines are generally deployed in large groups in wind farms, and so the behaviour of an individual wake as it merges with other wakes and propagates downwind is critical in assessing wind-farm power production. This evolution depends on the rate of turbulence dissipation in the wind-turbine wake, which has not been previously quantified in field-scale measurements. In situ measurements of winds and turbulence dissipation from the wake region of a multi-MW turbine were collected using a tethered lifting system (TLS) carrying a payload of high-rate turbulence probes. Ambient flow measurements were provided from sonic anemometers on a meteorological tower located near the turbine. Good agreement between the tower measurements and the TLS measurements was established for a case without a wind-turbine wake. When an operating wind turbine is located between the tower and the TLS so that the wake propagates to the TLS, the TLS measures dissipation rates one to two orders of magnitude higher in the wake than outside of the wake. These data, collected between two and three rotor diameters D downwind of the turbine, document the significant enhancement of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate within the wind-turbine wake. These wake measurements suggest that it may be useful to pursue modelling approaches that account for enhanced dissipation. Furthermore. comparisons of wake and non-wake dissipation rates to mean wind speed, wind-speed variance, and turbulence intensity are presented to facilitate the inclusion of these measurements in wake modelling schemes.","Springer","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In 2007, the FAST wind turbine simulation tool, developed and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was expanded to include capabilities that are suitable for modeling floating offshore wind turbines. In an effort to validate FAST and other offshore wind energy modeling tools, DOE funded the DeepCwind project that tested three prototype floating wind turbines at 1/50<sup>th</sup> scale in a wave basin, including a semisubmersible, a tension-leg platform, and a spar buoy. This paper describes the use of the results of the spar wave basin tests to calibrate and validate the FAST offshore floating simulation tool, and presents some initial results of simulated dynamic responses of the spar to several combinations of wind and sea states. Wave basin tests with the spar attached to a scale model of the NREL 5-megawatt reference wind turbine were performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands under the DeepCwind project. This project included free-decay tests, tests with steady or turbulent wind and still water (both periodic and irregular waves with no wind), and combined wind/wave tests. The resulting data from the 1/50th model was scaled using Froude scaling to full size and used to calibrate and validate a full-size simulated model in FAST. Results of the model calibration and validation include successes, subtleties, and limitations of both wave basin testing and FAST modeling capabilities.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Computational examination of utility scale wind turbine wake interactions","Okosun, Tyamo; Zhou, Chenn Q.","17 WIND ENERGY; turbine; kinetic energy; upstream and downstream","We performed numerical simulations of small, utility scale wind turbine groupings to determine how wakes generated by upstream turbines affect the performance of the small turbine group as a whole. Specifically, various wind turbine arrangements were simulated to better understand how turbine location influences small group wake interactions. The minimization of power losses due to wake interactions certainly plays a significant role in the optimization of wind farms. Since wind turbines extract kinetic energy from the wind, the air passing through a wind turbine decreases in velocity, and turbines downstream of the initial turbine experience flows of lower energy, resulting in reduced power output. Our study proposes two arrangements of turbines that could generate more power by exploiting the momentum of the wind to increase velocity at downstream turbines, while maintaining low wake interactions at the same time. Furthermore, simulations using Computational Fluid Dynamics are used to obtain results much more quickly than methods requiring wind tunnel models or a large scale experimental test.","","","Purdue Univ.

The performance of the model with different grid nesting configurations, turbulence closures, and grid resolutions is investigated through comparisons with observation data. For the simple terrain site, no significant improvement in the simulation results is found when using higher resolution. In contrast, for the complex terrain site, there is significant improvement when using higher resolution, but only during the locally driven event. This suggests the possibility that computational resources could be spared under certain conditions, for example when the topography is adequately resolved at coarser resolutions. Physical parameters such as soil moisture have a very large effect, but mostly for the locally forced events for both simple and complex terrain. The effect of the PBL scheme choice varies significantly depending on the meteorological forcing and terrain. On average, prognostic TKE equation schemes perform better than non-local eddy viscosity schemes.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Large-scale anisotropy in stably stratified rotating flows","Marino, R.; Mininni, P. D.; Rosenberg, D. L.; Pouquet, A.","17 WIND ENERGY","We present results from direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations in the presence of rotation and/or stratification, both in the vertical direction. The runs are forced isotropically and randomly at small scales and have spatial resolutions of up to $1024^3$ grid points and Reynolds numbers of $\approx 1000$. We first show that solutions with negative energy flux and inverse cascades develop in rotating turbulence, whether or not stratification is present. However, the purely stratified case is characterized instead by an early-time, highly anisotropic transfer to large scales with almost zero net isotropic energy flux. This is consistent with previous studies that observed the development of vertically sheared horizontal winds, although only at substantially later times. However, and unlike previous works, when sufficient scale separation is allowed between the forcing scale and the domain size, the total energy displays a perpendicular (horizontal) spectrum with power law behavior compatible with $\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$, including in the absence of rotation. In this latter purely stratified case, such a spectrum is the result of a direct cascade of the energy contained in the large-scale horizontal wind, as is evidenced by a strong positive flux of energy in the parallel direction at all scales including the largest resolved scales.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Bridging the Transition from Mesoscale to Microscale Turbulence in Numerical Weather Prediction Models","Munoz-Esparza, Domingo; Kosovic, Branko; Mirocha, Jeff D; van Beeck, Jeroen","17 WIND ENERGY; Boundary layer turbulence; Inflow turbulence generation; Multiscale modelling; Nested mesoscale to large-eddy simulations; Weather Research and Forecasting model.","With a focus towards developing multiscale capabilities in numerical weather prediction models, the specific problem of the transition from the mesoscale to the microscale is investigated. For that purpose, idealized one-way nested mesoscale to large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments were carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting model framework. It is demonstrated that switching from one-dimensional turbulent diffusion in the mesoscale model to three-dimensional LES mixing does not necessarily result in an instantaneous development of turbulence in the LES domain. However, very large fetches are needed for the natural transition to turbulence to occur. The computational burden imposed by these long fetches necessitates the development of methods to accelerate the generation of turbulence on a nested LES domain forced by a smooth mesoscale inflow. To that end, four new methods based upon finite amplitude perturbations of the potential temperature field along the LES inflow boundaries are developed, and investigated under convective conditions. Each method accelerated the development of turbulence within the LES domain, with two of the methods resulting in a rapid generation of production and inertial range energy content associated to microscales that is consistent with non-nested simulations using periodic boundary conditions. The cell perturbation approach, the simplest and most efficient of the best performing methods, was investigated further under neutral and stable conditions. Successful results were obtained in all the regimes, where satisfactory agreement of mean velocity, variances and turbulent fluxes, as well as velocity and temperature spectra, was achieved with reference non-nested simulations. In contrast, the non-perturbed LES solution exhibited important energy deficits associated to a delayed establishment of fully-developed turbulence. The cell perturbation method has negligible computational cost, significantly accelerates the generation of realistic turbulence, and requires minimal parameter tuning, with the necessary information relatable to mean inflow conditions provided by the mesoscale solution.","Springer","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

One of the critical issues is how to keep increasing wind penetration without jeopardizing grid security and reliability. This paper explores the possibility of changing transmission network topology, by transmission switching, to accommodate higher utilization of wind power and reduce the generation costs of thermal units. Considering the uncertainty in wind power output, we use chance constraints to ensure that the wind energy utilized exceeds a minimal usage level at a certain probability. We develop a deterministic approximation approach using sample average approximation and provide a strong extended formulation. Numerical results show the potential benefit the proposed model can achieve.","IEEE","","Argonne National Lab.

Michael; Weickmann, Ann M.","17 WIND ENERGY; lidars; lidar observations; experimental design; field experiments; renewable energy","Wind turbine wakes in the atmosphere are three-dimensional (3D) and time dependent. An important question is how best to measure atmospheric wake properties, both for characterizing these properties observationally and for verification of numerical, conceptual, and physical (e.g., wind tunnel) models of wakes. Here a scanning, pulsed, coherent Doppler lidar is used to sample a turbine wake using 3D volume scan patterns that envelop the wake and simultaneously measure the inflow profile. The volume data are analyzed for quantities of interest, such as peak velocity deficit, downwind variability of the deficit, and downwind extent of the wake, in a manner that preserves the measured data. For the case study presented here, in which the wake was well defined in the lidar data, peak deficits of up to 80% were measured 0.6-2 rotor diameters (D) downwind of the turbine, and the wakes extended more than 11D downwind. Temporal wake variability over periods of minutes and the effects of atmospheric gusts and lulls in the inflow are demonstrated in the analysis. Lidar scanning trade-offs important to ensuring that the wake quantities of interest are adequately sampled by the scan pattern, including scan coverage, number of scans per volume, data resolution, and scan-cycle repeat interval, are discussed.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The method falls into the general category of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian methods; it is based on a fixed mesh that is locally adapted in the immediate vicinity of the moving interfaces and reverts to its original shape once the moving interfaces go past the elements. The moving interfaces are defined by separate sets of marker points so that the global mesh is independent of interface movement and the possibility of mesh entanglement is eliminated. The results is a fully robust formulation capable of calculating on domains of complex geometry with moving boundaries or devises that can also have a complex geometry without danger of the mesh becoming unsuitable due to its continuous deformation thus eliminating the need for repeated re-meshing and interpolation. Moreover, the boundary conditions on the interfaces are imposed exactly. This work is intended to support the internal combustion engines simulator KIVA developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. The model's capabilities are illustrated through application to incompressible flows in different geometrical settings that show the robustness and flexibility of the technique to perform simulations involving moving boundaries in a three-dimensional domain.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

WRF-LES with the GAD model enables numerical investigation of the effects of an operating wind turbine on and interactions with a broad range of atmospheric boundary layer phenomena. Numerical simulations using WRF-LES with the GAD model were compared with measurements obtained from the Turbine Wake and Inflow Characterization Study (TWICS-2011), the goal of which was to measure both the inflow to and wake from a 2.3-MW wind turbine. Data from a meteorological tower and two light-detection and ranging (lidar) systems, one vertically profiling and another operated over a variety of scanning modes, were utilized to obtain forcing for the simulations, and to evaluate characteristics of the simulated wakes. Simulations produced wakes with physically consistent rotation and velocity deficits. Two surface heat flux values of 20 W m<sup>–2</sup> and 100 W m<sup>–2</sup> were used to examine the sensitivity of the simulated wakes to convective instability. Simulations using the smaller heat flux values showed good agreement with wake deficits observed during TWICS-2011, whereas those using the larger value showed enhanced spreading and more-rapid attenuation. This study demonstrates the utility of actuator models implemented within atmospheric LES to address a range of atmospheric science and engineering applications. In conclusion, validated implementation of the GAD in a numerical weather prediction code such as WRF will enable a wide range of studies related to the interaction of wind turbines with the atmosphere and surface.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

The actuator line method is being increasingly used for the computation of wake interactions in large wind farms in which fully blade-resolving simulations are expensive and require complicated rotating meshes. The focus is on actuator line behavior using fairly isotropic grids of low aspect ratio typically used for large-eddy simulation (LES). Forces predicted along the actuator lines need to be projected onto the flow field as body forces, and this is commonly accomplished using a volumetric projection. In this study, particular attention is given to the spanwise distribution of the radius of this projection. A new method is proposed where the projection radius varies along the blade span following an elliptic distribution. The proposed guidelines for actuator line parameters are applied to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Phase VI rotor and the NREL 5-MW turbine. Results obtained are compared with available data and the blade-element code XTurb-PSU. As a result, it is found that the new criterion for the projection radius leads to improved prediction of blade tip loads for both blade designs.","ASME","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind and Water Technologies Office (EE-4W)","","United States","2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 031003","","","EE0005481","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231","10.1115/1.4026252","","2023-02-22T00:00:00Z","1348878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1348878","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","136"

"Structural health and prognostics management for the enhancement of offshore wind turbine operations and maintenance strategies","Griffith, D. Todd; Yoder, Nathanael C.; Resor, Brian; White, Jonathan; Paquette, Joshua","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Offshore wind turbines are an attractive source for clean and renewable energy for reasons including their proximity to population centers and higher capacity factors. One obstacle to the more widespread installation of offshore wind turbines in the USA, however, is that recent projections of offshore operations and maintenance costs vary from two to five times the land-based costs. One way in which these costs could be reduced is through use of a structural health and prognostics management (SHPM) system as part of a condition-based maintenance paradigm with smart loads management. Our paper contributes to the development of such strategies by developing an initial roadmap for SHPM, with application to the blades. One of the key elements of the approach is a multiscale simulation approach developed to identify how the underlying physics of the system are affected by the presence of damage and how these changes manifest themselves in the operational response of a full turbine. A case study of a trailing edge disbond is analysed to demonstrate the multiscale sensitivity of damage approach and to show the potential life extension and increased energy capture that can be achieved using simple changes in the overall turbine control and loads management strategy. Finally, the integration of health monitoring information, economic considerations such as repair costs versus state of health, and a smart loads management methodology provides an initial roadmap for reducing operations and maintenance costs for offshore wind farms while increasing turbine availability and overall profit.","Wiley","","Sandia National Lab.

This paper provides a report of two pioneering schemes-one in the U.S. and one in the U.K.-where real-time thermal ratings have been applied. Thereby, we demonstrate that observing the local weather conditions in real time leads to additional capacity and safer operation.

"Guidelines for Volume Force Distributions Within Actuator Line Modeling of Wind Turbines on Large-Eddy Simulation-Type Grids","Jha, Pankaj K.; Churchfield, Matthew J.; Moriarty, Patrick J.; Schmitz, Sven","17 WIND ENERGY; Wind Energy","The objective of this work is to develop and test a set of general guidelines for choosing parameters to be used in the state-of-the-art actuator line method (ALM) for modeling wind turbine blades in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The actuator line method is being increasingly used for the computation of wake interactions in large wind farms in which fully blade-resolving simulations are expensive and require complicated rotating meshes. The focus is on actuator line behavior using fairly isotropic grids of low aspect ratio typically used for large-eddy simulation (LES). Forces predicted along the actuator lines need to be projected onto the flow field as body forces, and this is commonly accomplished using a volumetric projection. In this study, particular attention is given to the spanwise distribution of the radius of this projection. A new method is proposed where the projection radius varies along the blade span following an elliptic distribution. The proposed guidelines for actuator line parameters are applied to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Phase VI rotor and the NREL 5-MW turbine. Results obtained are compared with available data and the blade-element code XTurb-PSU. It is found that the new criterion for the projection radius leads to improved prediction of blade tip loads for both blade designs.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"The New Modularization Framework for the FAST Wind Turbine CAE Tool","Jonkman, Jason","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINE; FAST CAE TOOL; MODULARIZATION FRAMEWORK; AERO-HYDRO-SERVO-ELASTIC MODELING; Wind Energy","NREL has recently put considerable effort into improving the overall modularity of its FAST wind turbine aero-hydro-servo-elastic tool to (1) improve the ability to read, implement, and maintain source code; (2) increase module sharing and shared code development across the wind community; (3) improve numerical performance and robustness; and (4) greatly enhance flexibility and expandability to enable further developments of functionality without the need to recode established modules. The new FAST modularization framework supports module-independent inputs, outputs, states, and parameters; states in continuous-time, discrete-time, and in constraint form; loose and tight coupling; independent time and spatial discretizations; time marching, operating-point determination, and linearization; data encapsulation; dynamic allocation; and save/retrieve capability. This paper explains the features of the new FAST modularization framework, as well as the concepts and mathematical background needed to understand and apply it correctly. It is envisioned that the new modularization framework will transform FAST into a powerful, robust, and flexible wind turbine modeling tool with a large number of developers and a range of modeling fidelities across the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, servo-dynamic, and structural-dynamic components.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Screening of approximately 240 LCAs of onshore and offshore systems yielded 72 references meeting minimum thresholds for quality, transparency, and relevance. Of those, 49 references provided 126 estimates of life cycle GHG emissions. Published estimates ranged from 1.7 to 81 grams CO{sub 2}-equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh), with median and interquartile range (IQR) both at 12 g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh. After adjusting the published estimates to use consistent gross system boundaries and values for several important system parameters, the total range was reduced by 47% to 3.0 to 45 g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh and the IQR was reduced by 14% to 10 g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh, while the median remained relatively constant (11 g CO{sub 2}-eq/kWh). Harmonization of capacity factor resulted in the largest reduction in variability in life cycle GHG emission estimates. This study concludes that the large number of previously published life cycle GHG emission estimates of wind power systems and their tight distribution suggest that new process-based LCAs of similar wind turbine technologies are unlikely to differ greatly. However, additional consequential LCAs would enhance the understanding of true life cycle GHG emissions of wind power (e.g., changes to other generators operations when wind electricity is added to the grid), although even those are unlikely to fundamentally change the comparison of wind to other electricity generation sources.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, we performed numerical experiments to explore some of the effects of atmospheric stability and surface roughness on wind turbine dynamics. We used large-eddy simulation to create atmospheric winds and compute the wind turbine flows, and we modeled the wind turbines as revolving and flexible actuator lines coupled to a wind turbine structural and system dynamic model. We examined the structural moments about the wind turbine blade, low-speed shaft, and nacelle; power production; and wake evolution when large 5-MW turbines are subjected to winds generated from low- and high-surface roughness levels representative of offshore and onshore conditions, respectively, and also neutral and unstable atmospheric conditions. In addition, we placed a second turbine 7 rotor diameters downwind of the first one so that we could explore wake effects under these different conditions. The results show that the turbulent structures generated within the atmospheric boundary layer wind simulations cause isolated loading events at least as significant as when a turbine is waked by an upwind turbine. The root-mean-square (RMS) turbine loads are consistently larger when the surface roughness is higher. The RMS blade-root out-of-plane bending moment and low-speed shaft torque are higher when the atmospheric boundary layer is unstable as compared with when it is neutral. However, the RMS yaw moments are either equal or reduced in the unstable case as compared with the neutral case. For a given surface roughness, the ratio of power produced by the downwind turbine relative to that of the upwind turbine is 15-20% higher when the conditions are unstable as compared with neutral. For a given atmospheric stability, this power ratio is 10% higher with the onshore roughness value versus the offshore one. The main conclusion is that various coherent turbulent structures that form under different levels of atmospheric stability and surface roughness have important effects on wind turbine structural response, power production, and wake evolution.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We find that wind has the potential to supply a significant portion of world energy needs, although this potential varies substantially by region as well as with assumptions such as on what types of land can be used to site wind farms. Total global wind potential under central assumptions is estimated to be approximately 89 petawatt hours per year at less than 9 cents/kWh with substantial regional variations. One limitation of global wind analyses is that the resolution of current global wind speed reanalysis data can result in an underestimate of high wind areas. A sensitivity analysis of eight key parameters is presented. Wind potential is sensitive to a number of input parameters, particularly those related to land suitability and turbine density as well as cost and financing assumptions which have important policy implications. Transmission cost has a relatively small impact on total wind costs, changing the potential at a given cost by 20-30%. As a result of sensitivities studied here we suggest that further research intended to inform wind supply curve development focus not purely on physical science, such as better resolved wind maps, but also on these less well-defined factors, such as land-suitability, that will also have an impact on the long-term role of wind power.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Vehicle fuel is the only current energy use large enough to absorb all the energy capacity that might be diverted from the power industry, and its ease of storage obviates problems with discontinuous synfuel production. The potential benefits and challenges of synfuels integration are illustrated by the production of methanol from natural gas (as a source of carbon) using steam from a light water nuclear power reactor which is assumed to be available in accord with a year's worth of power demand data. Methanol's synthesis process is easily adapted to using 300 C heat from a light water reactor and this simple compound can be further processed into gasoline, biodiesel, or dimethyl ether, fuels which can be used with the current vehicle fleet. A supplemental feed to the methanol process of natural gas (for energy) allows operation at constant full rate when the nuclear heat is being used to produce electrical power. The higher capital costs of such a system are offset by a lower cost of heat and power production from a large base load type of plant and by reduced costs associated with much lower CO2 emissions. Other less tangible economic benefits of this and similar hybrid systems include better use of natural resource for fuels and greater energy services security from the domestic production of vehicle fuel.","","","Idaho National Lab.

We present a detailed emissions analysis based on comprehensive modeling of power system operations with unit commitment and economic dispatch for different wind penetration levels. First, by minimizing cost, the unit commitment model decides which thermal power plants will be utilized based on a wind power forecast, and then, the economic dispatch model dictates the level of production for each unit as a function of the realized wind power generation. Finally, knowing the power production from each power plant, the emissions are calculated. The emissions model incorporates the effects of both cycling and start-ups of thermal power plants in analyzing emissions from an electric power system with increasing levels of wind power. Our results for the power system in the state of Illinois show significant emissions effects from increased cycling and particularly start-ups of thermal power plants. However, we conclude that as the wind power penetration increases, pollutant emissions decrease overall due to the replacement of fossil fuels.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The intermittent nature of solar and wind power requires storage of energy, so electrocatalysts that convert electrical energy to chemical bonds in fuels are needed. Platinum is an excellent catalyst, but it is of low abundance and high cost. Hydrogenase enzymes in Nature catalyze the evolution of H2 and use earth-abundant metals such as nickel and iron. We report that a synthetic nickel catalyst, [Ni(7PPh2NPh)2](BF4)2, (7PPh2NPh = 1,3,6-triphenyl-1-aza-3,6-diphosphacycloheptane) catalyzes the production of H2 using [(DMF)H]+OTf as the proton source, with turnover frequencies of 31,000 s-1 in dry acetonitrile and 108,000 s-1 in the presence of H2O (1.2 M), at a potential of -1.13 V (vs. the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple). These turnover frequencies exceed those reported for the [FeFe] hydrogenase enzyme by more than an order of magnitude, and are the fastest reported for any molecular catalyst for H2 production. This material is based upon work supported as part of the Center for Molecular Electrocatalysis, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Four PHEV charging scenarios are simulated for the Illinois power system: (1) unconstrained charging, (2) 3-hour delayed constrained charging, (3) smart charging, and (4) smart charging with DR. The PHEV charging is assumed to be optimally controlled by the system operator in the latter two scenarios, along with load shifting and shaving enabled by DR programs. The simulation results show that optimally dispatching the PHEV charging load can significantly reduce the total operating cost of the system. With DR programs in place, the operating cost can be further reduced.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The approach includes three steps: forecast data acquisition, statistical analysis of retrospective information, and prediction of grid balancing requirements for a specified time horizon and a given confidence level. An assessment of the capacity and ramping requirements is performed using a specially developed probabilistic algorithm based on histogram analysis, incorporating sources of uncertainty - both continuous (wind and load forecast errors) and discrete (forced generator outages and start-up failures). A new method called the 'flying-brick' technique is developed to evaluate the look-ahead required generation performance envelope for the worst case scenario within a user-specified confidence level. A self-validation process is used to validate the accuracy of the confidence intervals. To demonstrate the validity of the developed uncertainty assessment methods and its impact on grid operation, a framework for integrating the proposed methods with an EMS system is developed. Demonstration through EMS integration illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology and the developed tool for actual grid operation and paves the road for integration with EMS systems in control rooms.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluating the Impacts of Real-Time Pricing on the Cost and Value of Wind Generation","Siohansi, Ramteen","17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","One of the costs associated with integrating wind generation into a power system is the cost of redispatching the system in real-time due to day-ahead wind resource forecast errors. One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In the current research, a form of vacuum assisted resin transfer molding known as SCRIMP registered is used to manufacture wind turbine blades. Often, during the compacting of the fabric layers by the vacuum pressure, several plies may bunch together out-of-plane and form wave defects. When the resin is infused, the areas beneath the waves become resin rich and can compromise the structural integrity of the blade. A reliable simulation tool is valuable to help predict where waves and other defects may appear as a result of the manufacturing process. Forming simulations often focus on the in-plane shearing and tensile behavior of fabrics and do not necessarily consider the bending stiffness of the fabrics, which is important to predict the formation of wrinkles and/or waves. This study incorporates experimentally determined in-plane shearing, tensile, and bending stiffness information of NCFs into a finite element model (ABAQUS/Explicit) of a 9-meter wind turbine blade to investigate the mechanical behaviors that can lead to the formation of waves as a result of the manufacturing process.","","","","","","United States","2011-05-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1353; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ESAFORM 2011: 14. international ESAFORM conference on material forming, Belfast, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), 27-29 Apr 2011; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3589629; (c) 2011 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 895-900","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US11A7456107204","10.1063/1.3589629","","2011-12-29T00:00:00Z","21516784","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21516784","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1353"

The increase in the penetration of wind generation in recent years has led to a number of challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. A key metric for system adequacy is the capacity value of generation. The capacity value of a generator is the contribution that a given generator makes to overall system adequacy. The variable and stochastic nature of wind sets it apart from conventional energy sources. As a result, the modeling of wind generation in the same manner as conventional generation for capacity value calculations is inappropriate. In this paper a preferred method for calculation of the capacity value of wind is described and a discussion of the pertinent issues surrounding it is given. Approximate methods for the calculation are also described with their limitations highlighted. The outcome of recent wind capacity value analyses in Europe and North America are highlighted with a description of open research questions also given.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The methodology aims at producing random wind and load forecast time series reflecting the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of historical forecast data sets. Five statistical characteristics are considered: the means, standard deviations, autocorrelations, and cross-correlations. A stochastic optimization routine is developed to minimize the differences between the statistical characteristics of the generated time series and the targeted ones. An optimal set of parameters are obtained and used to produce the RT, HA, and DA forecasts in due order of succession. This method, although implemented as the first-order regressive random forecast error generator, can be extended to higher-order. Results show that the methodology produces random series with desired statistics derived from real data sets provided by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). The wind and load forecast error generator is currently used in wind integration studies to generate wind and load inputs for stochastic planning processes. Our future studies will focus on reflecting the diurnal and seasonal differences of the wind and load statistics and implementing them in the random forecast generator.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This approach makes use of a deterministic algorithm to suggest, among a list of commercially available system devices, the optimal number and type of units ensuring that the total cost of the system is minimized while guaranteeing the availability of the energy. The collection of 6 months of data of wind speed, solar radiation and ambient temperature recorded for every hour of the day were used. The mathematical modeling of the main elements of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel system is exposed showing the more relevant sizing variables. A deterministic algorithm is used to minimize the total cost of the system while guaranteeing the satisfaction of the load demand. A comparison between the total cost of the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system with batteries and the hybrid wind/PV/diesel energy system without batteries is presented. The reached results demonstrate the practical utility of the used sizing methodology and show the influence of the battery storage on the total cost of the hybrid system.

The reliability of the blades thus depends on the mechanical behaviors of the FRP under various loading conditions. Specifically, the fracture behavior of FRP is of great importance to both the scientific research community and the wind industry. In the current project, a new testing technique is proposed based on the spiral notch torsion test (SNTT) to study the fracture behavior of composite structures under mixed mode loading conditions, particularly under combined Mode I (flexural or normal tensile stress) and Mode III (torsional shear stress) loading. For the SNTT test method, round-rod specimens with V-grooved spiral lines are subjected to pure torsion. Depending on the pitch angle of the spiral lines, pure Mode I, pure Mode III, or mixed Mode I/Mode III loading conditions can be simulated. A three dimensional finite element analysis is then used to evaluate the fracture toughness and energy release rate of SNTT specimens. In the current study, both epoxy and fiberglass reinforced epoxy materials are investigated using the SNTT technique. This paper will discuss the fracture behaviors of mode I and mixed mode samples, with or without fatigue precrack. In addition, results from fractographic study and finite element analysis will be presented and discussed in detail.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States).

Epoxy is a thermosetting polymer that is currently used in manufacturing wind turbine blades. The fracture behavior of epoxy is relevant to the mechanical integrity of the wind turbine composite materials. In this study, a novel fracture testing methodology, the spiral notch torsion test (SNTT), was applied to study the fracture behavior of an epoxy material. SNTT samples were tested using either monotonic loading or cyclic loading, while both mode I and mixed mode I/III loading conditions were used. Fractographic examination indicated the epoxy samples included in this study were prone to mode I failure even when the samples were subject to mixed mode loading. Different fatigue precracks were observed on mode I and mixed mode samples, i.e. precracks appeared as a uniform band under mode I loading, and a semi-ellipse under mixed mode loading. Fracture toughness was also estimated using quantitative fractography.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab. (ORNL), Oak Ridge, TN (United States). High Temperature Materials Lab.

"More wind generation means lower GHG emissions, right?","","17 WIND ENERGY; GREENHOUSE GASES; WIND POWER; MINIMIZATION","The answer to what will be the net effect of an x percent increase in wind generation on GHG emissions in a given system is not a simple y percent -- but is likely to depend on many variables, assumptions, modeling, and number crunching. But the result is important, and hence there has been a flurry of contradictory studies, confusing policymakers and the general public alike. While one can certainly find exceptions, under most circumstances, more renewable generation can be expected to result in lower GHG emissions.","","Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2010.10.007","","","","United States","2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

"Market protocols in ERCOT and their effect on wind generation","Sioshansi, Ramteen; Hurlbut, David","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; wind integration; reliability; transmission operation","Integrating wind generation into power systems and wholesale electricity markets presents unique challenges due to the characteristics of wind power, including its limited dispatchability, variability in generation, difficulty in forecasting resource availability, and the geographic location of wind resources. Texas has had to deal with many of these issues beginning in 2002 when it restructured its electricity industry and introduced aggressive renewable portfolio standards that helped spur major investments in wind generation. In this paper we discuss the issues that have arisen in designing market protocols that take account of these special characteristics of wind generation and survey the regulatory and market rules that have been developed in Texas. We discuss the perverse incentives some of the rules gave wind generators to overschedule generation in order to receive balancing energy payments, and steps that have been taken to mitigate those incentive effects. Lastly, we discuss more recent steps taken by the market operator and regulators to ensure transmission capacity is available for new wind generators that are expected to come online in the future.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The variable and stochastic nature of renewable sources however makes solar and wind power difficult to manage, especially at high levels of penetration. To effectively use the intermittent renewable energy and enable its delivery demand electrical energy storage (EES) that can also improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of the electrical grid, which is expected to support plug-in electrical vehicles; enable real-time, two-way communication to balance demand and supply. While EES has gained wide attention for hybrid and electrical vehicle (e.g. plug-in-hybrid electrical) needs, public awareness and understanding of the critical challenges in energy storage for renewable integration and the future grid is relatively lacking. This paper examines the benefits and challenges of EES, in particular electrochemical storage or battery technologies, and discusses the fundamental principles, economics, and feasibility of the storage technologies. It intends to provide an understanding of the needs and challenges of electrical storage technologies for the stationary applications and offer general directions of research and development to the materials community.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

One of the options for building isolated power systems is by hybridizing renewable power sources like wind, solar, micro-hydro, etc. along with appropriate energy storage. A method to optimally size and to evaluate the cost of energy produced by a renewable hybrid system is proposed in this paper. The proposed method, which is based on the design space approach, can be used to determine the conditions for which hybridization of the system is cost effective. The simple and novel methodology, proposed in this paper, is based on the principles of process integration. It finds the minimum battery capacity when the availability and ratings of various renewable resources as well as load demand are known. The battery sizing methodology is used to determine the sizing curve and thereby the feasible design space for the entire system. Chance constrained programming approach is used to account for the stochastic nature of the renewable energy resources and to arrive at the design space. The optimal system configuration in the entire design space is selected based on the lowest cost of energy, subject to a specified reliability criterion. The effects of variation of the specified system reliability and the coefficient of correlation between renewable sources on the design space, as well as the optimum configuration are also studied in this paper. The proposed method is demonstrated by designing an isolated power system for an Indian village utilizing wind-solar photovoltaic-battery system.

Until now, various anti-islanding methods (AIMs) for detecting and preventing islanding of photovoltaic and other distributed generations (DGs) have been proposed. This paper presents an overview of recent anti-islanding method developments for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power generation, focusing on the concept and operating principle, mainly based on single phase system. For the performance comparison, the experimental results of the various AIMs with 3 kW PV inverter are provided based on the islanding detection capability and power quality. As a result, the active AIMs have better islanding detection capability rather than the passive one. However, the active AIMs have power quality degradation on harmonic distortion or displacement power factor based on the injected active signal type. In addition to the evaluation and comparison of the main anti-islanding methods, this paper also summarizes the related anti-islanding standards to evaluate anti-islanding capability for PV system. This paper can be used as a useful anti-islanding reference for future work in DG like PV, and wind turbine.

To date, the program has been heavily subscribed, particularly by wind power projects, which had received 86% of the nearly $2.6 billion in grants that had been disbursed as of March 1, 2010. As of that date, 6.2 GW of the 10 GW of new wind capacity installed in the U.S. in 2009 had applied for grants in lieu of production tax credits. Roughly 2.4 GW of this wind capacity may not have otherwise been built in 2009 absent the grant program; this 2.4 GW may have supported approximately 51,600 short-term full-time-equivalent (FTE) gross job-years in the U.S. during the construction phase of these wind projects, and 3,860 longterm FTE gross jobs during the operational phase. The program’s popularity stems from the significant economic value that it provides to renewable power projects, relative to the otherwise available tax credits. Although grants reward investment rather than efficient performance, this evaluation finds no evidence at this time of either widespread “gold-plating” or performance problems.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Evaluating the impacts of real-time pricing on the usage of wind generation","Sioshansi, Ramteen; Short, Walter","17 WIND ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; power system economics; wind power generation; variable renewable energy resources; real-time pricing; unit commitment","One of the impediments to large-scale use of wind generation within power systems is its nondispatchability and variable and uncertain real-time availability. Operating constraints on conventional generators such as minimum generation points, forbidden zones, and ramping limits as well as system constraints such as power flow limits and ancillary service requirements may force a system operator to curtail wind generation in order to ensure feasibility. Furthermore, the pattern of wind availability and electricity demand may not allow wind generation to be fully utilized in all hours. One solution to these issues, which could reduce these inflexibilities, is the use of real-time pricing (RTP) tariffs which can both smooth-out the diurnal load pattern in order to reduce the impact of binding unit operating and system constraints on wind utilization, and allow demand to increase in response to the availability of costless wind generation. As a result, we use and analyze a detailed unit commitment model of the Texas power system with different estimates of demand elasticities to demonstrate the potential increases in wind generation from implementing RTP.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Although wind power is a renewable energy source, there are environmental concerns over increasing numbers of wind farm proposals and associated cumulative impacts. Individually, a wind farm, or indeed any action, may have minor effects on the environment, but collectively these may be significant, potentially greater than the sum of the individual parts acting alone. EU and UK legislation requires a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) as part of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). However, in the absence of detailed guidance and definitions, such assessments within EIA are rarely adequate, restricting the acquisition of basic knowledge about the cumulative impacts of wind farms on bird populations. Here we propose a conceptual framework to promote transparency in CIA through the explicit definition of impacts, actions and scales within an assessment. Our framework requires improved legislative guidance on the actions to include in assessments, and advice on the appropriate baselines against which to assess impacts. Cumulative impacts are currently considered on restricted scales (spatial and temporal) relating to individual development EIAs.

Understanding the onset of tribochemical wear damage on component surfaces requires the use of high resolution techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this study, two steel types, case carburized AISI 3310 and through-hardened AISI 52100, were wear tested using a ball-on-disk rolling/sliding contact tribometer in fully formulated commercial wind turbine gearbox oil under boundary lubrication conditions with 10% slip. With the exception of steel type, all other test conditions were held constant. Conventional tribofilm analysis in the wear tracks was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and no significant composition differences were detected in the tribofilms for the different steel disk types. However, TEM analysis revealed significant tribochemical wear differences between the two steel types at multiple length scales, from the near-surface material microstructure (depth &lt; 500 nm) to the tribofilm nanostructure. Nanometer-scale interfacial cracking and surface particle detachment was observed for the AISI 52100 case, whereas the tribofilm/substrate interface was abrupt and undamaged for the AISI 3310 case. Differences in tribofilm structure, including the location and orientation of MoS{sub 2} single sheet inclusions, were observed as a function of steel type as well. It is suggested that the tribochemical wear modes observed in these experiments may be origins of macroscopic surface-initiated damage such as micropitting in bearings and gears.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This paper focuses primarily on the requirements to limit radiative forcing from Kyoto gases to 2.6 W/m2. Given that we estimate year 2005 radiative forcing to be 2.4 W/m2, the 2.6 W/m2 limit creates a non-trivial constraint. Allowing radiative forcing to exceed the long-term target level provides greater latitude in achieving the goal, but implies major changes to both global energy and land-use systems in the near term as well as the long term. In addition, delay on the part of major emitting parties creates potential leakage in both energy and land-use.

However, prior to construction of a renewable generation station, it is necessary to determine the optimum number of PV panels and wind turbines for minimal cost during continuity of generated energy to meet the desired consumption. In fact, the traditional sizing procedures find optimum number of the PV modules and wind turbines subject to minimum cost. However, the optimum battery capacity is either not taken into account, or it is found by a full search between all probable solution spaces which requires extensive computation. In this study, a novel description of the production/consumption phenomenon is proposed, and a new sizing procedure is developed. Using this procedure, optimum battery capacity, together with optimum number of PV modules and wind turbines subject to minimum cost can be obtained with good accuracy.

Despite significant wind resources, the U.S. currently obtains about one percent of its electric power from wind generation. A recent analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL), and the American Wind Energy Association demonstrated the technical feasibility of expanding the U.S. wind industry to meet 20% of U.S. electric power needs by 2030 (U.S. DOE 2008). Many of the challenges associated with a substantial increase in the use of wind energy reflect fundamental gaps that remain in our knowledge of both atmospheric flow and the interaction of that flow with turbines. To better define these gaps, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) convened a workshop on Research Needs for Wind Resource Characterization in Broomfield, Colorado, during January 14–16, 2008. The workshop was organized jointly by DOE’s Office of Science and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The purposes of the workshop were to assess the current state-of-science related to wind power production and to define fruitful directions for research. More than 120 international participants, representing national laboratories, academia, and the wind energy industry, attended the workshop. The workshop focused on four potential research areas ordered by the scale of associated atmospheric phenomena: 1) turbine dynamics, 2) micrositing and array effects, 3) mesoscale processes, and (4) climate effects. The structure of the workshop involved a plenary speaker to review each of these areas followed by a discussion of each area by all participants. Based on this discussion, participants then generated recommendations for research in each of the areas. The remainder of this report summarizes the reviews provided by each of the plenary speakers and the research recommendations produced by the workshop.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In addition to its contribution to the enhancement of reliable indigenous resources, the introduction of renewable energy such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power systems reduces the emission of GHGs and air pollutants by substituting a part of the carbon- and pollutant-intensive power with power generated by methods that are cleaner and less carbon-intensive. To evaluate the reduction potentials, consequential changes in the operation of different types of existing power plants have to be taken into account. In this study, a linear mathematical programming model is constructed to simulate a power mix for a given power demand in a power market sharing a cost-minimization objective. By applying the model, the emission reduction potentials of capacity extension case studies, including the enhancement of PV and wind power introduction at different scales, were assessed. In particular, the consequences of power mix changes in carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulates were discussed. Seasonally varying power demand levels, solar irradiation, and wind strength were taken into account. In this study, we have found that the synergetic reduction of carbon dioxide emission induced by PV and wind power introduction occurs under a certain level of additional installed capacity. Investigation of a greater variety of case studies on scenario development with emerging power sources becomes possible by applying the model developed in this study. 15 refs., 8 figs., 11 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association; Journal Volume: 59; Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 360-372","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1047-3289; JAWAEB; TRN: 090600267","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21176928","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21176928","","Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association","3","59"

In this work, meteorological forcing mechanisms, such as the Ekman spiral, thermal wind, and inertial oscillation, are discussed as likely drivers of such shears in the statically stable environment. Since the inertial oscillation, the Ekman spiral, and statically stable conditions are independent of geography, potentially significant magnitudes of speed and direction shear are hypothesized to occur to some extent at any inland site in the world. The frequency of occurrence of non-trivial magnitudes of speed and direction shear are analyzed from observation platforms in Lubbock, Texas and Goodland, Indiana. On average, the correlation between speed and direction shear magnitudes and static atmospheric stability are found to be very high. Moreover, large magnitude speed and direction shears are observed in conditions with relatively high hub-height wind speeds. The effects of speed and direction shear on wind turbine power performance are tested by incorporating a simple steady direction shear profile into the fatigue analysis structures and turbulence simulation code from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In general, the effect on turbine power production varies with the magnitude of speed and direction shear across the turbine rotor, with the majority of simulated conditions exhibiting power loss relative to a zero shear baseline. When coupled with observational data, the observed power gain is calculated to be as great as 0.5% and depletion as great as 3% relative to a no shear baseline. The average annual power change at Lubbock is estimated to be -0.5%","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Adaptive control techniques are well suited to nonlinear applications, such as wind turbines, which are difficult to accurately model and which have effects from poorly known operating environments. In this paper, we extended the direct model reference adaptive control (DMRAC) approach to track a reference point and to reject persistent disturbances. This approach was then used to design an adaptive collective pitch controller for a high-fidelity simulation of a variable-speed horizontal axis wind turbine. The objective of the adaptive pitch controller was to regulate generator speed in Region 3 and to reject step disturbances. The control objective was accomplished by collectively pitching the turbine blades. The turbine simulation models the controls advanced research turbine (CART) of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. The CART is a utility-scale wind turbine that has a well-developed and extensively verified simulator. This novel application of adaptive control was compared in simulations with a classical proportional integrator (PI) collective pitch controller. In the simulations, the adaptive pitch controller showed improved speed regulation in Region 3 when compared with the PI pitch controller.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The wind turbine has been controlled via two control methods: the variable pitch angle and by regulation of the field current of the generator and examined under real wind conditions. The characteristics of the thin airfoil, called ''Seven arcs thin airfoil'' named so because the airfoil is composed of seven circular arcs, are analyzed with the airfoil design and analysis program XFOIL. The thin airfoil blade is designed and calculated by blade element and momentum theory. The performance characteristics of the machine such as rotational speed, generator output as well as stability for wind speed changes are described.

Vertical profiles of streamwise velocity variances obtained from NOAA's high-resolution Doppler lidar (HRDL), which have been shown to be approximately equal to turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) for stable conditions, are a measure of the turbulence in the SBL. In the present study, the mean horizontal wind component U and variance {sigma}2u were computed from HRDL measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity using a method described by Banta et al., which uses an elevation (vertical slice) scanning technique. The method was tested on datasets obtained during the Lamar Low-Level Jet Project (LLLJP) carried out in early September 2003, near the town of Lamar in southeastern Colorado. This paper compares U with mean wind speed obtained from sodar and sonic anemometer measurements. The results for the mean U and mean wind speed measured by sodar and in situ instruments for all nights of LLLJP show high correlation (0.71-0.97), independent of sampling strategies and averaging procedures, and correlation coefficients consistently &gt;0.9 for four high-wind nights, when the low-level jet speeds exceeded 15 m s{sup -1} at some time during the night. Comparison of estimates of variance, on the other hand, proved sensitive to both the spatial and temporal averaging parameters. Several series of averaging tests are described, to find the best correlation between TKE calculated from sonic anemometer data at several tower levels and lidar measurements of horizontal-velocity variance {sigma}{sup 2}{sub u}. Because of the nonstationarity of the SBL data, the best results were obtained when the velocity data were first averaged over intervals of 1 min, and then further averaged over 3-15 consecutive 1-min intervals, with best results for the 10- and 15-min averaging periods. For these cases, correlation coefficients exceeded 0.9. As a part of the analysis, Eulerian integral time scales ({tau}) were estimated for the four high-wind nights. Time series of {tau} through each night indicated erratic behavior consistent with the nonstationarity. Histograms of {tau} showed a mode at 4-5 s, but frequent occurrences of larger {tau} values, mostly between 10 and 100 s.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Careful corrections for the spatial filtering of the wind field by the lidar pulse produce turbulence estimates equivalent to point sensors but with the added advantage of a larger sampling volume to increase the statistical accuracy of the estimates. For a well-designed lidar system, this permits accurate estimates of the key turbulent statistics over various subdomains and with sufficiently short observation times to monitor rapid changes in conditions. These features may be ideally suited for optimal operation of wind farms and also for improved resource assessment of potential sites.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In a companion paper we examine wind integration costs as a function of balancing area size to determine if the larger system size helps mitigate wind integration cost increases. In this paper we turn to an examination of the NYISO sub-hourly energy market to understand how it incentivizes generators to respond to ramping signals without having to explicitly pay for the service. Because markets appear to have the ability of bringing out supply response in sub-hourly energy markets, and because existing thermal resources appear to have significant untapped ramping capability, we believe that a combination of fast energy markets and combined balancing area operations can increase the grid's ability to absorb higher wind penetrations without experiencing significant operational problems or costs.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Safety-Factor Calibration for Wind Turbine Extreme Loads","Moriarty, P","17 WIND ENERGY; CALIBRATION; DESIGN; EXTRAPOLATION; FORECASTING; ROTORS; SAFETY; SAMPLING; WIND TURBINES; Wind Energy","Proper prediction of long-term extreme values for operating wind turbine loads and deflections is a critical component of wind turbine design. Direct observations or simulations of long-term extremes are not yet available; therefore, these predictions rely on some combination of large numbers of simulations and extrapolation. Extrapolation methods themselves can have significant uncertainty, and they also require that the wind turbine designer have a greater level of statistical expertise--factors that make the methods less attractive for industrial application. As an alternative to extrapolation, safety factors can be calibrated using techniques that allow designers to use smaller data sets. To calculate such factors, a series of simulations was used to extrapolate 50 year extreme values for a 5 MW wind turbine. Two methods are proposed for calculating such safety factors: one based on the mean and standard deviation of extreme values, and one based on the median of extreme values. Through a process of random sampling without replacement, the safety factor based on the median of extreme values was found to be less variable and also more independent of the number of simulations. The safety factors required were as large as 1.7, or were only 1.25 if rotor thrust loads were considered the dominant design drivers.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To reduce such variability, more precise definition and validation of these techniques are necessary. As part of a wider effort to test loads extrapolation techniques used in wind turbine design, two data sets were created. The first data set was created as an example typical of what designers use to extrapolate loads according to wind turbine design standards. The second data set was a series of year-long simulations that could be used to quantify the accuracy of extrapolation methods. Due to the large number of simulations, care was taken not to reproduce random samplings in individual time series. Additionally, a grid computing architecture was used to run the simulations in a reasonable time frame. The wind speeds where loads were highest were identified, which varied with loading type. The identification of dominant wind speeds is important to ensure an adequate number of simulations at such speeds, which often influence extrapolated loads. In-plane loads and deflections tended to be dominated by high wind speeds near cut-out wind speed. Out-of-plane loads and deflections were most influenced by winds that were near the rated wind speed. Some loads were influenced by a range of wind speeds. The loads dominated by high wind speeds had greater variability in the extreme values, which could be a reflection of the greatly varying wind and also greater sensitivity to higher energy content of the wind at such speeds.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

In this study, as the appropriate device to achieve the purpose of it, a guide-box tunnel is employed. The guide-box tunnel is like a rectangular box as wind passage in which a test rotor is included. The area ratio between the inlet and exit of it is variable to adjust the inlet mass flow rate or input power. At first, the experiment was conducted to find the adequate configuration which would provide the best relative performance. The present experiment, however, does not include the test to retain the guide-box tunnel from the strong wind. The experiments include the static torque test of the fixed rotor at any phase angle and the dynamic torque test at rotation of them. Consequently, it was found that the maximum rotor rotational speed was achieved in the range of the guide-box area ratio between 0.3 and 0.7 and the value of the output power coefficient of the rotor with guide-box tunnel of the area ratio 0.43 increases about 1.5 times with three blades and 1.23 times with two blades greater than that without guide-box tunnel, respectively. It seemed that the performance of Savonius rotor within the guide-box tunnel is comparable enough with other methods for augmentation and control of the output.

These challenges stem primarily from the natural characteristics of wind plants, which differ in some respects from conventional plants. Wind plants operate when the wind blows, and their power levels vary with the strength of the wind. Hence, they are not dispatchable in the traditional sense, which lessens the ability of system operators to control them while maintaining the system's balance between load and generation.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"To Capture the Wind","Thresher, Robert; Robinson, Michael; Veers, Paul","17 WIND ENERGY; wind energy; wind turbines; wind energy generation; predictive models; blades; costs; manufacturing","Abstract: From the birth of modern electricity-generating wind turbines in the late 1970s to now, wind energy technology has dramatically improved. Capital costs have plummeted, reliability has improved, and efficiency has increased. High-quality turbine manufacturers exist around the world, and wind plants of 300 MW and larger are being integrated into the electrical grid to exacting utility specifications. These modern wind plants are now routinely produced by multinational manufacturing companies at a cost of energy approaching, and in some cases below, that of fossil-fuel generating plants. At the end of 2006, the total U.S. wind energy capacity had grown to 11,603 MW, or enough to provide the electrical energy needs of more than 2.9 million American homes. Wind capacity in the United States and in Europe has grown at a rate of 20% to 30% per year over the past decade. Despite this rapid growth, wind currently provides less than 1% of total electricity consumption in the United States. The vision of the wind industry in the United States and in Europe is to increase wind's fraction of the electrical energy mix to more than 20% within the next two decades.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, Germany is facing a major renewal and restructuring process in electricity generation. Within the next two decades, up to 50% of current electricity generation capacity may retire because of end-of-plant lifetime and the nuclear phase-out pact of 1998. Substantial opportunities therefore exist for deployment of advanced electricity generating technologies in both a projected baseline and in alternative carbon policy scenarios. We simulate the potential role of coal integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), and wind power within a computable general equilibrium of Germany from the present through 2050. These advanced technologies and their role within a future German electricity system are the focus of this paper. We model the response of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany to various technology and carbon policy assumptions over the next few decades. In our baseline scenario, all of the advanced technologies except CCS provide substantial contributions to electricity generation. We also calculate the carbon price where each fossil technology, combined with CCS, becomes competitive. Constant carbon price experiments are used to characterize the model response to a carbon policy. This provides an estimate of the cost of meeting an emissions target, and the share of emissions reductions available from the electricity generation sector.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

There also remains a small hard core of skeptics (&lt;10%) who do not believe in the science of climate change and the need for action, a group that is much smaller in the other countries surveyed. The similarities are, however, pervasive.

This system can eliminate problems associated with wind intermittency and provide a source of electrical energy functionally equivalent to a large fossil or nuclear power plant. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) can be economically deployed in the Midwestern US, an area with significant low-cost wind resources. CAES systems require a combustible fuel, typically natural gas, which results in fuel price risk and greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing natural gas with synfuel derived from biomass gasification eliminates the use of fossil fuels, virtually eliminating net CO{sub 2} emissions from the system. In addition, by deriving energy completely from farm sources, this type of system may reduce some opposition to long distance transmission lines in rural areas, which may be an obstacle to large-scale wind deployment.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Thus, the accuracy and reliability of aerodynamic load prediction has become a primary consideration in turbine design codes. Dynamically stalled flows routinely generated during yawed operation are powerful and potentially destructive, as well as complex and difficult to model. As a prerequisite to aerodynamics model improvements, wind turbine dynamic stall must be characterized in detail and thoroughly understood. The current study analyzed turbine blade surface pressure data and local inflow data acquired by the NREL Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment during the NASA Ames wind tunnel experiment. Analyses identified and characterized two key dynamic stall processes, vortex initiation and vortex convection, across a broad parameter range. Results showed that both initiation and convection exhibited pronounced three-dimensional kinematics, which responded in systematic fashion to variations in wind speed, turbine yaw angle, and radial location.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Unfortunately, induction generators require reactive power from the grid to operate; capacitor compensation is often used. Because the level of required reactive power varies with the output power, the capacitor compensation must be adjusted as the output power varies. The interactions among the wind turbine, the power network, and the capacitor compensation are important aspects of wind generation that may result in self-excitation and higher harmonic content in the output current. This paper examines the factors that control these phenomena and gives some guidelines on how they can be controlled or eliminated.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Utility Integrated Resource Planning: An Emerging Driver of NewRenewable Generation in the Western United States","Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan","03 NATURAL GAS; 17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; AVAILABILITY; CAPACITY; CARBON; ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ELECTRICITY; NATURAL GAS; PLANNING; PRICES; PUGET SOUND; WIND POWER","In the United States, markets for renewable generation--especially wind power--have grown substantially in recent years. This growth is typically attributed to technology improvements and resulting cost reductions, the availability of federal tax incentives, and aggressive state policy efforts. But another less widely recognized driver of new renewable generation is poised to play a major role in the coming years: utility integrated resource planning (IRP). Common in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, but relegated to lesser importance as many states took steps to restructure their electricity markets in the late-1990s, IRP has re-emerged in recent years as an important tool for utilities and regulators, particularly in regions such as the western United States, where retail competition has failed to take root. As practiced in the United States, IRP is a formal process by which utilities analyze the costs, benefits, and risks of all resources available to them--both supply- and demand-side--with the ultimate goal of identifying a portfolio of resources that meets their future needs at lowest cost and/or risk. Though the content of any specific utility IRP is unique, all are built on a common basic framework: (1) development of peak demand and load forecasts; (2) assessment of how these forecasts compare to existing and committed generation resources; (3) identification and characterization of various resource portfolios as candidates to fill a projected resource deficiency; (4) analysis of these different ''candidate'' resource portfolios under base-case and alternative future scenarios; and finally, (5) selection of a preferred portfolio, and creation of a near-term action plan to begin to move towards that portfolio. Renewable resources were once rarely considered seriously in utility IRP. In the western United States, however, the most recent resource plans call for a significant amount of new wind power capacity. These planned additions appear to be motivated by the improved economics of wind power, an emerging understanding that wind integration costs are manageable, and a growing acceptance of wind by electric utilities. Equally important, utility IRPs are increasingly recognizing the inherent risks in fossil-based generation portfolios--especially natural gas price risk and the financial risk of future carbon regulation--and the benefits of renewable energy in mitigating those risks. This article, which is based on a longer report from Berkeley Lab,i examines how twelve investor-owned utilities (IOUs) in the western United States--Avista, Idaho Power, NorthWestern Energy (NWE), Portland General Electric (PGE), Puget Sound Energy (PSE), PacifiCorp, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), Nevada Power, Sierra Pacific, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&amp;E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&amp;E)--treat renewable energy in their most recent resource plans (as of July 2005). In aggregate, these twelve utilities supply approximately half of all electricity demand in the western United States. In reviewing these plans, our purpose is twofold: (1) to highlight the growing importance of utility IRP as a current and future driver of renewable generation in the United States, and (2) to suggest possible improvements to the methods used to evaluate renewable generation as a resource option. As such, we begin by summarizing the amount and types of new renewable generation planned as a result of these twelve IRPs. We then offer observations about the IRP process, and how it might be improved to more objectively evaluate renewable resources.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Parameter sensitivities affecting the flutter speed of a MW-sized blade.","Lobitz, Donald Wayne, Jr.","17 WIND ENERGY; AIR; AIRCRAFT; DESIGN; SENSITIVITY; VELOCITY; WIND TURBINES","With the current trend toward larger and larger horizontal axis wind turbines, classical flutter is becoming a more critical issue. Recent studies have indicated that for a single blade turning in still air the flutter speed for a modern 35 m blade occurs at approximately twice its operating speed (2 per rev), whereas for smaller blades (5-9 m), both modern and early designs, the flutter speeds are in the range of 3.5-6 per rev. Scaling studies demonstrate that the per rev flutter speed should not change with scale. Thus, design requirements that change with increasing blade size are producing the concurrent reduction in per rev flutter speeds. In comparison with an early small blade design (5 m blade), flutter computations indicate that the non rotating modes which combine to create the flutter mode change as the blade becomes larger (i.e., for the larger blade the second flapwise mode, as opposed to the first flapwise mode for the smaller blade, combines with the first torsional mode to produce the flutter mode). For the more modern smaller blade design (9 m blade), results show that the non rotating modes that couple are similar to those of the larger blade. For the wings of fixed-wing aircraft, it is common knowledge that judicious selection of certain design parameters can increase the airspeed associated with the onset of flutter. Two parameters, the chordwise location of the center of mass and the ratio of the flapwise natural frequency to the torsional natural frequency, are especially significant. In this paper studies are performed to determine the sensitivity of the per rev flutter speed to these parameters for a 35 m wind turbine blade. Additional studies are performed to determine which structural characteristics of the blade are most significant in explaining the previously mentioned per rev flutter speed differences. As a point of interest, flutter results are also reported for two recently designed 9 m twist/coupled blades.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in the Journal of Solar Energy Engineering.; Journal Volume: 127; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: X; Size: 16 p.","","SAND2005-5030J","AC04-94AL85000","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; JSEEDO; TRN: US201006%%1048","10.1115/1.2037091","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","973668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/973668","","Proposed for publication in the Journal of Solar Energy Engineering.","4","127"
"Accounting for fuel price risk when comparing renewable togas-fired generation: the role of forward natural gas prices","Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan; Golove, William","03 NATURAL GAS; 17 WIND ENERGY; AVAILABILITY; NATURAL GAS; PRICES; STABILITY","Unlike natural gas-fired generation, renewable generation (e.g., from wind, solar, and geothermal power) is largely immune to fuel price risk. If ratepayers are rational and value long-term price stability, then--contrary to common practice--any comparison of the levelized cost of renewable to gas-fired generation should be based on a hedged gas price input, rather than an uncertain gas price forecast. This paper compares natural gas prices that can be locked in through futures, swaps, and physical supply contracts to contemporaneous long-term forecasts of spot gas prices. We find that from 2000-2003, forward gas prices for terms of 2-10 years have been considerably higher than most contemporaneous long-term gas price forecasts. This difference is striking, and implies that comparisons between renewable and gas-fired generation based on these forecasts over this period have arguably yielded results that are biased in favor of gas-fired generation.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Apples with apples: accounting for fuel price risk in comparisons of gas-fired and renewable generation","Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan","03 NATURAL GAS; 17 WIND ENERGY; CAPACITY; COMBUSTION; COMPETITION; MARKET; NATURAL GAS; POWER PLANTS; PRICES; SEVERANCE TAX; STABILITY; TURBINES; US ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION; WIND POWER","For better or worse, natural gas has become the fuel of choice for new power plants being built across the United States. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), natural gas combined-cycle and combustion turbine power plants accounted for 96% of the total generating capacity added in the US between 1999 and 2002--138 GW out of a total of 144 GW. Looking ahead, the EIA expects that gas-fired technology will account for 61% of the 355 GW new generating capacity projected to come on-line in the US up to 2025, increasing the nationwide market share of gas-fired generation from 18% in 2002 to 22% in 2025. While the data are specific to the US, natural gas-fired generation is making similar advances in other countries as well. Regardless of the explanation for (or interpretation of) the empirical findings, however, the basic implications remain the same: one should not blindly rely on gas price forecasts when comparing fixed-price renewable with variable-price gas-fired generation contracts. If there is a cost to hedging, gas price forecasts do not capture and account for it. Alternatively, if the forecasts are at risk of being biased or out of tune with the market, then one certainly would not want to use them as the basis for resource comparisons or investment decisions if a more certain source of data (forwards) existed. Accordingly, assuming that long-term price stability is valued, the most appropriate way to compare the levelized cost of these resources in both cases would be to use forward natural gas price data--i.e. prices that can be locked in to create price certainty--as opposed to uncertain natural gas price forecasts. This article suggests that had utilities and analysts in the US done so over the sample period from November 2000 to November 2003, they would have found gas-fired generation to be at least 0.3-0.6 cents/kWh more expensive (on a levelized cost basis) than otherwise thought. With some renewable resources, in particular wind power, now largely competitive with gas-fired generation in the US (including the impact of the federal production tax credit and current high gas prices), a margin of 0.3-0.6 cents/kWh may in some cases be enough to sway resource decisions in favor of renewables.","","OSTI as DE00837245","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Revisiting the 'Buy versus Build' Decision for Publicly Owned Utilities in California Considering Wind and Geothermal Resources","Bolinger, Mark; Wiser, Ryan; Golove, William","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 17 WIND ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; AVAILABILITY; CAPACITY; COMPETITION; DEPRECIATION; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ELECTRICITY; GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES; MARKET; OWNERSHIP; PRODUCTION; SCHEDULES; TAX CREDITS; Geothermal Legacy","The last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the market share of independent, nonutility generators (NUGs) relative to traditional, utility-owned generation assets. Accordingly, the ''buy versus build'' decision facing utilities--i.e., whether a utility should sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a NUG, or develop and own the generation capacity itself--has gained prominence in the industry. Very little of this debate, however, has focused specifically on publicly owned electric utilities, and with few exceptions, renewable sources of supply have received similarly scant attention. Contrary to historical treatment, however, the buy versus build debate is quite relevant to publicly owned utilities and renewables because publicly owned utilities are able to take advantage of some renewable energy incentives only in a ''buy'' situation, while others accrue only in a ''build'' situation. In particular, possible economic advantages of public utility ownership include: (1) the tax-free status of publicly owned utilities and the availability of low-cost debt, and (2) the renewable energy production incentive (REPI) available only to publicly owned utilities. Possible economic advantages to entering into a PPA with a NUG include: (1) the availability of federal tax credits and accelerated depreciation schedules for certain forms of NUG-owned renewable energy, and (2) the California state production incentives available to NUGs but not utilities. This article looks at a publicly owned utility's decision to buy or build new renewable energy capacity--specifically wind and geothermal power--in California. To examine the economic aspects of this decision, we used a 20-year financial cash-flow model to assess the levelized cost of electricity under four supply options: (1) public utility ownership of new geothermal capacity, (2) public utility ownership of new wind capacity, (3) a PPA for new geothermal capacity, and (4) a PPA for new wind capacity. We focus on wind and geothermal because both resources are abundant and, in some cases, potentially economic in California. Our analysis is not intended to provide precise estimates of the levelized cost of electricity from wind projects and geothermal plants; nor is our intent to compare the levelized costs of wind and geothermal power to one another. Instead, our intent is simply to compare the costs of buying wind or geothermal power to the costs of building and operating wind or geothermal capacity under various scenarios. Of course, the ultimate decision to buy or build cannot and should not rest solely on a comparison of the levelized cost of electricity. Thus, in addition to quantitative analysis, we also include a qualitative discussion of several important features of the ''buy versus build'' decision not reflected in the economic analysis.","","OSTI as DE00836793","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Wind farms are springing up around the US, providing clean energy as well as an economic boon to farmers and local communities. This year's headlines announced the rebirth of the US wind energy market, as wind farms were dedicated in local communities from coast to coast. At this year's exuberant pace of development, utility-scale wind energy seems well on its way to generating 5% of the nation's electricity by 2020, the target set by the Administration and announced by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson at the wind industry's annual conference earlier this year. Wind energy projects have mushroomed throughout the country, most notably in the Midwest. In the eighteen months from July 1998 to December 1999, the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) estimates that wind energy companies will have added almost 900 megawatts (MW) to the nation's generating capacity. At the same time, new, more efficient turbines replaced some 200 MW of aging equipment. In all, 1,096 MW of new wind generators were installed over that period, representing an investment of well over $1.1 billion and bringing American utility-scale generating capacity to over 2,500 MW.","","","American Wind Energy Association, Washington, DC (US)","","","United States","2000-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Today; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1042-0630; SOTOEV; TRN: US0001155","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20014681","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20014681","","Solar Today","1","14"

The wind speed means are computed using arithmetic mean, root mean square and cubic mean cuberoot. Wind Speed frequency distributions are modeled using Weibull and Rayleigh probability density functions. Wind speed data of an existing wind power station, located at Kappadagudda, Karnataka, India, is used for computational purposes. The analytically obtained capacity factors are validated by comparing with the actual capacity factors obtained at Kappadagudda. It is observed that the capacity factors computed from the Weibull statistical model using cubic mean of wind speed data fairly match the actual capacity factors obtained from Kappadagudda wind power station. Various commercially available wind turbine generators are used for site matching study.

A simple PI conventional controller for the exciter loop is carried out by using a first order model. When the system operating points change, the PI controller fails to provide sufficient damping or acceptable performance. Therefore both a fuzzy voltage and a fuzzy power regulators are introduced. Also a conventional adaptive pitch controller is proposed to adjust the pitch angle of the rotor blades in order to maximize the energy capture and reduce the mechanical loads. As an alternative to this controller, a neural network controller is also designed. Using the existing nonlinear wind model and the different control algorithms, the dynamic behavior of the controlled (WECS) is simulated.

Stochastic analysis of hourly wind-speed data showed that the average daily wind speed lies most frequently in the range of 5.5--6 m/s, with the upper and lower limits being 16 and 4.5 m/s, respectively. This is conductive to most of the wind energy conversion systems manufactured today. The discharge of the electrical windpump was more than four times higher than the mechanical windpumps at high wind speeds. The performance of the electrical windpump was also much better at a high operating head (60 m) than at low operating heads under high wind regimes. showing its suitability for ground-water pumping in the Southern High Plains. Stochastic estimation of daily windpump discharge revealed that pumping rates are high in the spring and autumn seasons, favoring irrigation of a winter wheat crop. The trend of variation in unit reservoir capacity, under different levels of daily demand and risk, shows that wind-powered irrigation systems with high risk can be adopted under higher economic return conditions. Though the results obtained in this study are applicable mainly to the Southern High Plains of the US, the methodology developed will have general applicability.","","","Indian Inst. of Tech., Kharagpur (IN)","","","United States","1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 79-83","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9402; JLEED9; TRN: IM200004%%140","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1999)125:3(79)","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20003918","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20003918","","Journal of Energy Engineering","3","125"

Blades were optimized for both maximum annual energy production and minimum cost of energy using a method that takes into account aerodynamic and structural considerations. The results indicate that the effect of the maximum-lift coefficient on the cost of energy is small with a slight advantage to the highest maximum lift coefficient airfoils for the tip-region of the blade become more desirable as machine size increases, provided the airfoils yield acceptable stall characteristics. The conclusions are applicable to large wind turbines that use passive or active stall to regulate peak power.","","","Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, IL (US)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 217-223","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; JSEEDO; TRN: IM200030%%137","10.1115/1.2888170","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","20075652","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20075652","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","121"

In this paper, I review these fatigue data. Major sections are devoted to the properties developed for wood, metals (primarily aluminum) and fiberglass. Special emphasis is placed on the fiberglass discussion because this material is current the material of choice for wind turbine blades.

The dynamic stall model takes variations in both angle of attack and flow velocity into account. The paper gives a brief description of the dynamic stall model and presents results from analyses of dynamic stall measurements for a variety of experiments with different airfoils in wind tunnel and on operating rotors. The wind tunnel experiments comprises pitching as well as plunging motion of the airfoils. The dynamic stall model is applied for derivation of aerodynamic damping characteristics for cyclic motion of the airfoils in flapwise and edgewise direction combined with pitching. The investigation reveals that the airfoil dynamic stall characteristics depend on the airfoil shape, and the type of motion (pitch, plunge). The aerodynamic damping characteristics, and thus the sensitivity to stall induced vibrations, depend highly on the relative motion of the airfoil in flapwise and edgewise direction, and on a possibly coupled pitch variation, which is determined by the structural characteristics of the blade.","","","Risoe National Lab., Roskilde (DK)","","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page 150-155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231; JSEEDO","10.1115/1.2888426","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20001209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20001209","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","3","121"

"Performance optimization for doubly fed wind power generation systems","Bhowmik, S; Spee, R; Enslin, J H.R.","17 WIND ENERGY; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; WIND TURBINES; CONTROL THEORY; ELECTRIC CONTROLLERS; PERFORMANCE","Significant variation of the resource kinetic energy, in the form of wind speed, results in substantially reduced energy capture in a fixed-speed wind turbine. In order to increase the wind energy capture in the turbine, variable-speed generation (VSG) strategies have been proposed and implemented. However, that requires an expensive ac/ac power converter, which increases the capital investment significantly. Consequently, doubly fed systems have been proposed to reduce the size of the power converter and, thereby, the associated cost. Additionally, in doubly fed systems, as a fixed operating point (power and speed), power flow can be regulated between the two winding systems on the machine. This feature can by utilized to essentially minimize losses in the machine associated with the given operating point or achieve other desired performance enhancements. In this paper, a brushless doubly fed machine (BDFM) is utilized to develop a VSG wind power generator. The VSG controller employs a wind-speed-estimation-based maximum power point tracker and a heuristic-model-based maximum efficiency point tracker to optimize the power output of the system.

Many small wind-turbine manufacturers use direct-drive PM generators. For wind-turbine generators, the design philosophy must cover the following characteristics: low cost, light weight, low speed, high torque, and variable-speed generation. The generator is easy to manufacture and the design can be scaled up for a larger size without major retooling. A modular PM generator with axial flux direction was chosen. The permanent magnet used is NdFeB or ferrite magnet with flux guide to focus flux density in the air gap. Each unit module of the generator may consist of one, two, or more phases. Each generator can be expanded to two or more unit modules. Each unit module is built from simple modular poles. The stator winding is formed like a torus. Thus, the assembly process is simplified and the winding insertion in the slot is less tedious. The authors built a prototype of one unit module and performed preliminary tests in the laboratory. Follow-up tests will be conducted in the laboratory to improve the design.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The local power companies, Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (TTEC) and Powergen (Power Generation Company of Trinidad and Tobago), have expressed an interest in wind power generation and integration to supplement its conventional fossil fuel, i.e., natural gas, approach. The Caribbean island of Tobago was chosen for investigation of its wind power potential mainly due to its better alignment to the prevailing winds, i.e., the North East Trades, than Trinidad. This article focuses on an optimal selection method of matching a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) to wind patterns, such as Tobago.

The proposed technique allows the simulation of wind farms containing identical or different wind turbines types and considers a bi-directional flow of power in and out of the battery. The model is based upon a simple procedure to estimate the joint probability distribution function of the total available wind power and that of the turbines operating modes due to hardware failure. A methodology is also developed to use the proposed model to determine an upper limit on the size of the battery storage required for a given number of turbines to satisfy the load with a certain expected energy not supplied (EENS). The model can also be used to evaluate the energy purchased from or injected to the grid in the case of grid-connected systems.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 217-224","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9930%%186","10.1109/60.766986","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","354445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/354445","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","2","14"

The results obtained are reasonable in the vicinity of the design point, but in stalled conditions the BEM is known to underpredict the forces acting on the blades. Here, a quasi-3D model of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating frame of reference has been developed. The equations governing the flow past a rotating blade are approximated using an order of magnitude analysis on the spanwise derivatives. The model takes into account rotational effects and spanwise outflow at computing expenses in the order of what is typical for similar 2D calculations. Results are presented for both laminar and turbulent flows past blades in pure rotation. In the turbulent case the influence of small-scale turbulence is modelled by the one-equation Baldwin-Barth turbulence model.

For this purpose, a numerical solver based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations expressed in a streamfunction-vorticity formulation in a non-inertial frame of reference was developed. The governing equations are solved by the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin finite element method (FEM). Temporal discretization is achieved by second-order-accurate finite differences. The resulting global matrix system is linearized by the Newton method and solved by the generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) with an incomplete triangular factorization preconditioning (ILU). Turbulence effects are introduced in the solver by an eddy viscosity model. The investigation centers on an evaluation of the algebraic Cebeci-Smith model (CSM) and the nonequilibrium Johnson-King model (JKM). In an effort to predict dynamic stall features on rotating airfoils, first the authors present some testing results concerning the performance of both turbulence models for the flat plate case. Then, computed flow structure together with aerodynamic coefficients for a NACA 0015 airfoil in Darrieus motion under dynamic stall conditions are presented.","","","","Sandia National Labs., Albuquerque, NM (United States)","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 69-75","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9915%%18","10.1115/1.2888145","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","330502","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330502","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","121"

The concept consists of a planetary differential transmission in which one input is driven by the variable speed rotor and the second by the variable speed control system, both driving the main generator at a constant speed. The increase in the energy output is estimated to be of about 15%--20% using the new transmission with the same rotor. The control system, designed to operate efficiently at the entire anticipated wind speed range, varies the rotor speed to provide optimal output power for slow wind speed range, varies the rotor speed to provide optimal output power for slow wind speed variations and to attenuate high frequency shaft torque fatigue damage in gusty wind operation. The net result is a cost effective system compared to contemporary variable speed solutions.

"Application of measured loads to wind turbine fatigue and reliability analysis","Veers, P S; Winterstein, S R","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND TURBINES; FATIGUE; RELIABILITY; WIND LOADS; STRESSES; SERVICE LIFE","Cyclic loadings produce progressive damage that can ultimately result in wind turbine structural failure. There are many issues that must be dealt with in turning load measurements into estimates of component fatigue life. This paper deals with how the measured loads can be analyzed and processed to meet the needs of both fatigue life calculations and reliability estimates. It is recommended that moments of the distribution of rainflow-range load amplitudes be calculated and used to characterize the fatigue loading. These moments reflect successively more detailed physical characteristics of the loading (mean, spread, tail behavior). Moments can be calculated from data samples and functional forms can be fitted to wind conditions, such as wind speed and turbulence intensity, with standard regression techniques. Distributions of load amplitudes that accurately reflect the damaging potential of the loadings can be estimated from the moments at any wind condition of interest. Fatigue life can then be calculated from the estimated load distributions, and the overall, long-term, or design spectrum can be generated for any particular wind-speed distribution. Characterizing the uncertainty in the distribution of cyclic loads is facilitated by using a small set of descriptive statistics for which uncertainties can be estimated. The effects of loading parameter uncertainty can then be transferred to the fatigue life estimate and compared with other uncertainties, such as material durability.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 233-239","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9908%%200","10.1115/1.2888125","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","316120","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/316120","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","4","120"

This is mainly due to the variation in wind velocity. Two risk-based capacity indices designated as Load Carrying Capacity Benefit Ratio (LCCBR) and Equivalent Capacity Rate (ECR) are introduced in this paper. These two indices can be used to indicate capacity benefit and credit of a WECS, and thus provide valuable information for energy policy makers in decision problems involving the selection and classification of wind sites. A midpoint sectionalized technique has been developed to calculate the Incremental Peak Load Carrying Capability (IPLCC) and to assess the LCCBR and ECR. The technique is effective and usually takes only a few iterations to obtain the indices. Sequential Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to estimate the adequacy of a generating system including WECS.

The results indicate that small variable-speed wind turbines should benefit from the use of the new airfoils which provide enhanced lift-to-drag ratio performance as compared with previously existing airfoils.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 108-114","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9819%%255","10.1115/1.2888052","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","619665","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619665","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","2","120"

A simple numerical algorithm has been developed for generation unit sizing. It has been used to determine the optimum generation capacity and storage needed for a stand-alone, wind, PV, and hybrid wind/PV system for an experimental site in a remote area in Montana with a typical residential load. Generation and storage units for each system are properly sized in order to meet the annual load and minimize the total annual cost to the customer. In addition, an economic analysis has been performed for the above three scenarios and is used to justify the use of renewable energy versus constructing a line extension from the nearest existing power line to supply the load with conventional power. Annual average hourly values for load, wind speed, and insolation have been used.","","","","","","United States","1998-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-75","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9815%%131","10.1109/60.658206","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","605799","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/605799","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","13"

These factors relate mainly to political and social conditions, and to technical advances and economics. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to quantify the various divergencies of opinions, practices and events that lead to confusion and uncertainties in planning HSWPS. The trade-off/risk method is used to generate multiple plans under 16 different futures and obtain the corresponding trade-off curves. Unlike the traditional 2-D simulation, a novel modeling of a trade-off surface in 3-D space is presented where the knee set is determined using the minimum distance approach. Robust and inferior plans are segregated based on their frequent occurrence din the conditional decision set of each future and hedging analysis to reduce risk is performed in order to assign alternative options in case risky futures occur.","","","","","","United States","1998-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 76-83","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9815%%132","10.1109/60.658207","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","605800","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/605800","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","13"
"Wind around the world","Rackstraw, K","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND POWER; GLOBAL ASPECTS; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; BUSINESS; CONSTRUCTION; POWER GENERATION","A combination of cost reductions and progressive policies in key markets kept the world wind market percolating in 1997 with a record 1510 MW of new wind capacity installed, representing annual sales of more than $1.5 billion. This new record surpasses last year`s total by 24 percent, about the average annual rate of growth for the last three years. Worldwide utility-scale wind installations at the end of 1997 totaled 7763 MW. Most activity occurred in Europe, which accounted for over 75 percent of 1997 installations. Germany was again the world`s leading single market, this time by quite a large margin, accounting for more than one-third of the annual total by itself at 532 MW in 1997. The end of 1997 also marked the time at which Germany officially passed the US as the largest total single market with over 2079 MW in total installations versus about 1805 MW for the US, although the US had actually lost the lead by mid-year. Spain is the new addition to the top echelon of world wind markets, installing 215 MW in 1997 that more than doubles their total installed capacity over the previous year and ranks them number three in the world for the year. Denmark`s 1997 total of 300 MW is also a record, although this estimate could go up as the official count is finalized. India, the second largest wind market in 1995 and 1996, slipped several notches because of a variety of factors, including a change in government and a slowdown in the economy. The US wind market continues to stagnate as it has for the last several years, largely because of the uncertainty surrounding restructuring of US electric utilities. The US market is poised for a big comeback in 1998, however.","","","","","","United States","1998-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Today; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 22-25","","","","Journal ID: SOTOEV; ISSN 1042-0630; TRN: 98:004638","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","585202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/585202","","Solar Today","2","12"
"Wind gets competitive in the US","Gray, T","17 WIND ENERGY; WIND POWER INDUSTRY; COMPETITION; BUSINESS; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTION; USA","After several years becalmed in the doldrums of electric utility restructuring, the US wind energy industry appears poised to enter the power generation market in a serious way as the 1990s draw to a close. Although wind is the world`s fastest growing energy source, the technology has stalled in the US. Precise statistics are difficult to come by, but the nation`s total installed wind energy capacity actually declined over the past three years, as older, non-operating turbines were removed and the pace of new development slowed to a crawl. However, analysts expect installed capacity to jump by nearly fifty percent (800 megawatts [MW]) over the next two years as major wind plants are completed in Iowa, Minnesota, Texas, Wyoming and elsewhere. In 1997, several events occurred that give US wind advocates reason to be optimistic about the future.","","","","","","United States","1998-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solar Today; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 18-21","","","","Journal ID: SOTOEV; ISSN 1042-0630; TRN: 98:004637","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","585200","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/585200","","Solar Today","2","12"
"Wind turbine performance under icing conditions","Jasinski, W J; Noe, S C; Selig, M S; Bragg, M B","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; PERFORMANCE; ICE; L CODES; P CODES; WIND TUNNELS; EXPERIMENTAL DATA","The effects of rime ice on horizontal axis wind turbine performance were estimated. For typical supercooled fog conditions found in cold northern regions, four rime ice accretions on the S809 wind turbine airfoil were predicted using the NASA LEWICE code. The resulting airfoil/ice profile combinations were wind tunnel tested to obtain the lift, drag, and pitching moment characteristics over the Reynolds number range 1--2 {times} 10{sup 6}. These data were used in the PROPID wind turbine performance prediction code to predict the effects of rime ice on a 450-kW rated-power, 28.7-m diameter turbine operated under both stall-regulated and variable-speed/variable-pitch modes. Performance losses on the order of 20% were observed for the variable-speed/variable-pitch rotor. For the stall-regulated rotor, however, a relatively small rime ice profile yielded significantly larger performance losses. For a larger 0.08c-long rime ice protrusion, however, the rated peak power was exceeded by 16% because at high angles the rime ice shape acted like a leading edge flap, thereby increasing the airfoil C{sub l,max} and delaying stall.","","","","National Renewable Energy Lab., Golden, CO (United States)","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 60-65","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9817%%206","10.1115/1.2888048","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","616323","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616323","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","120"

For operation in yaw and turbulent inflow, the blade sections appear to execute a motion more complex than a harmonic blade oscillation, which causes dynamic stall. Predictions of dynamic stall caused by simple harmonic oscillation are crucial to efforts in understanding and improving wind turbine performance. Investigation of dynamic stall development caused by a combined oscillatory and translatory motion contributes to better understand blade loading under complex flow conditions. In this paper, numerical predictions of light and deep stall caused by simple oscillatory motion are obtained first. The ability of the numerical solution to predict dynamic stall loads caused by a combined motion is further investigated. The numerical solution is obtained with a factorized, upwind-biased numerical scheme. The turbulent flow region is computed with a one-equation turbulence model. A transition model is used to simulate the transitional flow effects, which play an important role to the overall unsteady flow-field development. The computed results are compared with available experimental data.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 75-84","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9817%%208","10.1115/1.2888050","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","616325","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616325","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","120"
"Mass and aerodynamic imbalance of a horizontal axis wind turbine","Borg, J P; Kirchhoff, R H","17 WIND ENERGY; HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINES; AERODYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; HARMONICS; MASS","It is very common among wind turbines of all designs that a spectral analysis of operating variables, such as yaw motion, torque, or electrical power output has a large concentration of variance at the rotational frequency of the low speed shaft. This spike in the spectrum of the operating variables has come to be known as the once per revolution response or 1P. In addition to this 1P spike, three-bladed wind turbine spectral signatures usually include the harmonic integers 2P and 3P. The two main sources of 1P are mass imbalance in the rotor plane and various aerodynamic performance imbalances of the rotor blades. This paper is dedicated to determining the specific contribution of each of these sources to 1P as well as their effects on the 2P and 3P harmonics. Mass imbalance and aerodynamic imbalance issues are addressed separately so that the relative contribution of each can be quantified. The nonlinear differential equations describing the coupled azimuth and yaw motion with mass imbalance were analytically solved using a perturbation technique. A blade strip element technique was used to determine the effects of aerodynamic imbalance on 1P, 2P, and 3P fluctuations. It was found that 60% of the 1P low-speed shaft torque (LSST) fluctuation is due to mass imbalance and 40% due to aerodynamic imbalance. These results compare quite favorably with the NREL 15 kW Combined Experiment wind turbine data.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 120; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 66-74","","","","Journal ID: JSEEDO; ISSN 0199-6231; TRN: IM9817%%207","10.1115/1.2888049","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","616324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/616324","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","1","120"

The meter runs backward when the customer generates more energy than the household can use, and forward again when the house needs to draw energy from the grid. Hurdles net metering must overcome are also discussed, and the point at which PV equipment installation and energy production reach a break-even point in different areas. 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Home Energy; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-34","","","","Journal ID: HOENE2; ISSN 0896-9442; TRN: 98:000636-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","569254","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/569254","","Home Energy","1","15"
