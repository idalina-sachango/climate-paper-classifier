"Influence on Structural Loading of a Wave Energy Converter by Controlling Variable-Geometry Components and the Power Take-Off","Husain, Salman; Davis, Jacob; Tom, Nathan; Thiagarajan, Krish; Burge, Cole; Nguyen, Nhu","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; coastal engineering; design of offshore structures; hydrodynamics; ocean energy technology; offshore material performance and applications; wave mechanics and wave effects; damping; geometry; stress; surges; waves; wave energy converters","Oceans are harsh environments and can impose significant loads on deployed structures. A wave energy converter (WEC) should be designed to maximize the energy absorbed while ensuring the operating wave condition does not exceed the failure limits of the device itself. Therefore, the loads endured by the support structure are a design constraint for the system. Furthermore, the WEC should be adaptable to different sea states. Herethis work uses a WEC-Sim model of a variable-geometry oscillating wave energy converter (VGOSWEC) mounted on a support structure simulated under different wave scenarios. A VGOSWEC resembles a paddle pitching about a fixed hinge perpendicular to the incoming wave fronts. The geometry of the VGOSWEC is varied by opening a series of controllable flaps on the pitching paddle when the structure experiences threshold loads. It is hypothesized that opening the flaps should result in load shedding at the base of the support structure by reducing the moments about the hinge axis. This work compares the hydrodynamic coefficients, natural periods, and response amplitude operators from completely closed to completely open configurations of the controllable flaps. This work shows that the completely open configuration can reduce the pitch and surge loads on the base of the support structure by as much as 80%. Increased loads at the structure’s natural period can be mitigated by an axial power take-off damping acting as an additional design parameter to control the loads at the WEC’s support structure.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Toward the Instrumentation and Data Acquisition of a Tidal Turbine in Real Site Conditions","Murray, Robynne E.; Simms, Andrew; Bharath, Aidan; Beach, Ryan; Murphy, Mark; Kilcher, Levi; Scholbrock, Andy","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; data acquisition; instrumentation; thermoplastic blade; tidal turbine; water power","The National Renewable Energy Laboratory manufactured, instrumented, and deployed thermoplastic composite blades and a data acquisition system (NDAQ) on one of Verdant Power’s Gen5d 5 m diameter tidal turbines in New York’s East River. The thermoplastic blades had internal strain gages, and the NDAQ was a stand-alone system for monitoring and recording the strain and angular position of the blades. The turbine with thermoplastic blades operated and produced power successfully for 3 months, contributing energy to the New York City electric grid. The NDAQ hardware, instrumentation, and structure all survived the deployment and were still functional upon retrieval of the system, but no data were collected. Even though the data retrieval was not a success, data acquisition for deployed subsea marine renewable structures is a new undertaking, and it is critical to share lessons learned from national laboratory experiences. The successful deployment of thermoplastic composite blades marks a significant advancement toward improved materials for subsea components, as well as an advancement in recyclable composite materials.

"Marine renewable energy for Arctic observations","Branch, Ruth A.; Ticona Rollano, Fadia M.; Cotter, Emma D.; McVey, James R.; Cavagnaro, Robert J.; Rigor, Ignatius","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; ocean observations; blue economy; autonomous platforms; wave energy converter; tidal turbine; vortex induced vibration","Arctic observations are becoming increasingly valuable as researchers investigate climate change and its associated concerns, such as decreasing sea ice and increasing ship traffic. Networks of sensors with frequent sampling capabilities are needed to run forecast models, improve navigation, and inform climate research. Sampling frequency and deployment duration are currently constrained by battery power limitations. In-situ power generation using marine renewable energy sources such as waves and currents can be used to circumvent this constraint. Wave and current resources vary spatially and temporally in the Arctic, with some locations and seasons being better suited for marine renewable energy power generation. Locations and seasons with small resources may still be able to use marine renewable energy because of the low power requirements of the instruments. In this study, we describe the wave and current resources in the Arctic, outline the electricity generation developments that are needed to utilize the resources, and suggest use cases. Wave and current energy converters developed to power observations in the Arctic could also be used to power observations at lower latitudes. Marine renewable energy has the potential to decrease dependence on batteries and improve data collection capabilities in the Arctic; however, this would require the development of new low power technologies that can operate in extreme Arctic environments.","Frontiers Research Foundation","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In particular, permitting processes—an uncertainty for industry advancement that can be costly and time consuming to navigate—have rarely been tested and used for marine energy. The novelty of the marine energy industry and utilization of open ocean permitting processes that were not originally developed for marine energy have led to extensive efforts to gain consensus amongst state and federal regulatory agencies to authorize marine energy projects. In 2021, Oregon State University successfully completed permitting of a wave energy test facility, called PacWave South, off the coast of Oregon, which is designed to advance wave energy research and development. This article documents the multi-year process that Oregon State University used to receive federal and state authorization for a pre-permitted commercial-scale grid connected facility by detailing the development of the test facility, management of uncertainty and challenges, and key decisions. The PacWave South case study provides insights for the larger marine energy community as the industry advances towards commercialization.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluating the resilience benefits of marine energy in microgrids","Newman, Sarah F.; Bhatnagar, Dhruv; O'Neil, Rebecca S.; Reiman, Andrew P.; Preziuso, Danielle C.; Robertson, Bryson","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; microgrids; resilience; value proposition of marine energy resources","Marine energy resources could promote clean energy and resilience of coastal and island microgrids, and thus, these applications are a key future market for marine energy development. To demonstrate these benefits, this paper illustrates how inclusion of wave resources into energy resilience solutions can improve overall grid efficiency and sustainability, as well as maintain electricity supply during grid outages. The paper describes a case study evaluation of the potential to add wave energy to the Moloka'i grid as Hawaii strives to meet a 100% clean energy target. The Microgrid Component Optimization for Resilience tool is used to simulate operation in off-grid conditions and size different combinations of wave, solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, storage, and fuel resources required to meet resilience objectives. This research investigates how including wave resources in a microgrid contributes to reducing or eliminating biofuel generation, producing a zero-greenhouse gas emission profile in the latter case, and avoiding the over-sizing of PV and battery systems to accommodate periods of unavailability or high demand. Insight from this paper supports the value proposition of wave resources for future markets and informs the relationship between marine generators and microgrids or isolated grids.","European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A feasibility assessment for co-locating and powering offshore aquaculture with wave energy in the United States","Garavelli, Lysel; Freeman, Mikaela C.; Tugade, Levy G.; Greene, David; McNally, Jim","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; offshore aquaculture; marine renewable energy; co-location; energy assessment; spatial analysis","Offshore aquaculture and marine renewable energy (energy from waves, tides, currents, and ocean gradients) are two developing ocean-based industries. Aquaculture, an industry that has typically relied on diesel for power, is expected to grow globally, presenting an opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable sources as it expands. As the industry moves further offshore and is situated in more energetic environments, the prospect to co-locate offshore aquaculture with wave energy increases. To improve understanding of this potential, a feasibility assessment was completed to estimate the energy needs and wave resource required to power offshore finfish aquaculture operations. The study found it is possible to power offshore aquaculture operations entirely with wave energy. A spatial analysis was then performed to assess the suitability of co-locating offshore finfish aquaculture and wave energy off California and Hawaii. Suitable locations were identified offshore of O’ahu, Hawaii, and northern California. Southern California was also assessed, using a lower wave resource, based on study areas evaluated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify Aquaculture Opportunity Areas, and while limited there are suitable locations that may warrant further evaluation. This study presents an analysis into the potential to pair wave energy with offshore aquaculture, and how various factors can help determine suitable areas for co-location. The analyses developed in this study will support future identification of potential sites for development and decision-making to optimize the success of co-locating wave energy resources and offshore finfish aquaculture.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This is particularly applicable with wind and solar photovoltaics, as the offsetting of these renewable resources results in more reliable renewable generation. This study utilises ten metrics to quantify the temporal complementarity and supply-demand balancing requirements of the energy mix in Great Britain, to investigate the potential magnitude of these system benefits. Wave and tidal generation profiles are created using historical resource data and hydrodynamic models. The results show that the inclusion of wave and tidal generation creates a renewable energy mix which is more available under multiple conditions: throughout a year of operation; at times of peak demand; for multiple consecutive hourly time periods; and at times when wind and solar generation are not available. Three regional case studies also show that the inclusion of marine energy allows for improved regional supply-demand matching, reducing instances of energy shortage and excess and potentially relieving transmission congestion at particularly constrained locations within GB. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed in terms of GB wholesale market operation, system balancing and system security.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Global wave energy resource classification system for regional energy planning and project development","Ahn, Seongho; Neary, Vincent S.; Haas, Kevin A.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Wave energy resource classification; Global wave energy resource; Global wave climate","Efforts to streamline and codify wave energy resource characterization and assessment for regional energy planning and wave energy converter (WEC) project development have motivated the recent development of resource classification systems. Given the unique interplay between WEC absorption and resource attributes, viz, available wave power frequency, directionality, and seasonality, various consensus resource classification metrics have been introduced. However, the main international standards body for the wave energy industry has not reached consensus on a wave energy resource classification system designed with clear goals to facilitate resource assessment, regional energy planning, project site selection, project feasibility studies, and selection of WEC concepts or archetypes that are most suitable for a given wave energy climate. In this work, a primary consideration of wave energy generation is the available energy that can be captured by WECs with different resonant frequency and directional bandwidths. Therefore, the proposed classification system considers combinations of three different wave power classifications: the total wave power, the frequency-constrained wave power, and the frequency-directionally constrained wave power. The dominant wave period bands containing the most wave power are sub-classification parameters that provide useful information for designing frequency and directionally constrained WECs. The bulk of the global wave energy resource is divided into just 22 resource classes representing distinct wave energy climates that could serve as a common language and reference framework for wave energy resource assessment if codified within international standards.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Utilizing generic frequency domain representations of the Oscilla Power Triton WEC and spectral wave conditions at PacWave (Oregon), Los Angeles (California) and WETS (Hawaii), a series of interesting results emerge. Firstly, the ‘optimal’ WEC size, from an energy standpoint, is fundamentally dependent on the frequency distribution of the incoming wave variance density spectrum. Secondly, and from a seasonality perspective, the seasonal WEC energy generation doesn’t necessarily follow the seasonal distribution of gross wave power. Finally, from an hourly power variability perspective, a reduction in WEC size generally decreases variability. However, for each of the locations investigated, there appears to be a WEC size threshold; a threshold where further reducing WEC size results in increased power variability.","European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

High-fidelity numerical models are usually employed to study the wave-structure interaction, but the computational cost is demanding. As an alternative, midfidelity models can provide simulations in the order of real time. In this study, we operate Uppsala University’s WEC in a relatively mild sea state and model it using WEC-Sim. The model is verified based on OpenFOAM simulations. To analyze the ability of the midfidelity model to capture WEC dynamics, we investigate the system separately with 1, 2, and 3 degrees of freedom. We examine the contribution of viscous phenomena, and study both linear and weakly nonlinear solutions provided by WEC-Sim. Our results indicate that the viscous effects can be neglected in heave and surge motion, but not for pitch. We also find that the weakly nonlinear WEC-Sim solution successfully agrees with the computational fluid dynamics, whereas the linear solution could suggest misleading results.","European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Further verification shows that the model can predict the dynamic performance of the PTO well. The test results show that the mechanical motion rectifier-based PTO can achieve overall energy transfer efficiency as high as 65% in regular waves even when the generator is working below the rated electric load and speed.

However, ascertaining an optimal array layout is a complex problem, subject to specific site hydrodynamics and multiple inter-disciplinary constraints. In this work, we present a novel optimisation approach that combines an analytical-based wake model, FLORIS, with an ocean model, Thetis. The approach is demonstrated through applications of increasing complexity. By utilising the method of analytical wake superposition, the addition or alteration of turbine position does not require re-calculation of the entire flow field, thus allowing the use of simple heuristic techniques to perform optimisation at a fraction of the computational cost of more sophisticated methods. Using a custom condition-based placement algorithm, this methodology is applied to the Pentland Firth for arrays with turbines of 3.05 m/s rated speed, demonstrating practical implications whilst considering the temporal variability of the tide. For a 24-turbine array case, micro-siting using this technique delivered an array 15.8% more productive on average than a staggered layout, despite flow speeds regularly exceeding the rated value. Performance was evaluated through assessment of the optimised layout within the ocean model that treats turbines through a discrete turbine representation. Used iteratively, this methodology could deliver improved array configurations in a manner that accounts for local hydrodynamic effects.","Springer International Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The demand for self-powered UUVs suitable for long-term deployments has been growing, and further research related to small-scale ocean gradient energy systems is needed. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review about harvesting energy from ocean thermal or salinity gradients for powering UUVs, focusing on gliders and profiling floats. Thermal gradient energy systems for UUVs based on phase change materials (PCM) cannot provide the energy required for powering autonomous sensing systems because of the systems’ low energy conversion efficiency. Besides reducing energy consumption by developing more efficient electrical-mechanical systems, enhancing the thermal conductivity of the PCMs may help address this challenge by increasing the power generation rate of the UUVs. Several other emerging technologies, such as thermoelectric generators, shape memory alloys, and small-scale thermodynamic cycle systems, have shown potential for powering UUVs, but they are still only at the laboratory testing or conceptual design phase. The most advanced power generation technologies based on salinity gradients, reverse electrodialysis and pressure-retarded osmosis, are still not economically viable for large-scale deployment, mainly because of the high cost of the components required to operate in harsh saline environments. Our feasibility evaluation showed that existing salinity gradient power generation technologies are not directly feasible for powering UUVs in the open ocean.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Such a configuration would result in drastic feed pressure fluctuations. For a technology conventionally operated with a constant feed condition, the effect of these variable pressures on membrane integrity and performance is unknown. Here, experiments were conducted with spiral wound membranes coupled to a system capable of producing feed pressure fluctuations of more than 400 psi. Feed composition included 5, 20, and 35 g/L NaCl, and a synthetic seawater at normal and 1.5x concentration. The variable feed conditions included sine-like pressure waves swings of 200-500 and 500-900 psi with frequencies of 1.25, 7.5, and 12 waves/min, and a model-generated random waveform. Between each wave experiment we performed membrane integrity tests at 650 psi and 25 g/L NaCl feed, which showed a 7.4% drop in the membrane's water permeability coefficient, an 18.4% flux decline, and more than 99% salt rejection over 1770 h of cumulative experimental time. Analysis of permeate samples showed high salt rejection. In general, variable feed pressure had no significant deleterious effect on membrane integrity or performance.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, measuring effects is difficult given the limited number of operational devices currently deployed. Numerical modeling is a powerful tool for estimating environmental effects and quantifying risks. It is most effective when informed by empirical data and coordinated with the development and implementation of monitoring protocols. We reviewed modeling techniques and information needs for six environmental stressor–receptor interactions related to ME: changes in oceanographic systems, underwater noise, electromagnetic fields (EMFs), changes in habitat, collision risk, and displacement of marine animals. This review considers the effects of tidal, wave, and ocean current energy converters. We summarized the availability and maturity of models for each stressor–receptor interaction and provide examples involving ME devices when available and analogous examples otherwise. Models for oceanographic systems and underwater noise were widely available and sometimes applied to ME, but need validation in real-world settings. Many methods are available for modeling habitat change and displacement of marine animals, but few examples related to ME exist. Models of collision risk and species response to EMFs are still in stages of theory development and need more observational data, particularly about species behavior near devices, to be effective. We conclude by synthesizing model status, commonalities between models, and overlapping monitoring needs that can be exploited to develop a coordinated and efficient set of protocols for predicting and monitoring the environmental effects of ME.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Regulatory bodies often require baseline characterization and/or post-installation monitoring to determine whether changes in these habitats are being observed. However, a great diversity of technologies is available for surveying and sampling marine habitats, and selecting the most suitable instrument to identify and measure changes in habitats at marine energy sites can become a daunting task. We conducted a thorough review of journal articles, survey reports, and grey literature to extract information about the technologies used, the data collection and processing methods, and the performance and effectiveness of these instruments. We examined documents related to marine energy development, offshore wind farms, oil and gas offshore sites, and other marine industries around the world over the last 20 years. A total of 120 different technologies were identified across six main habitat categories: seafloor, sediment, infauna, epifauna, pelagic, and biofouling. The technologies were organized into 12 broad technology classes: acoustic, corer, dredge, grab, hook and line, net and trawl, plate, remote sensing, scrape samples, trap, visual, and others. Visual was the most common and the most diverse technology class, with applications across all six habitat categories. Technologies and sampling methods that are designed for working efficiently in energetic environments have greater success at marine energy sites. In addition, sampling designs and statistical analyses should be carefully thought through to identify differences in faunal assemblages and spatiotemporal changes in habitats.</p>","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Knowledge gaps remain about whether marine energy systems can affect the environment, adding another threat to animal populations and habitats already under pressure from climate change and anthropogenic activities. To date, potential environmental effects have been studied under the scope of stressor–receptor interactions, where moving parts of, or emissions from, a system could harm the animals, habitats, and natural processes. While crucial for understanding effects and identifying knowledge gaps, this approach misses a holistic view of what animals may experience in the presence of marine energy systems. We look at six biological consequences and forces that drive the health of an animal population and the effects expected from marine energy development: success of early life stages; changes in competitive capabilities; growth and survival based on food availability; susceptibility to predators; injury or death; and reproductive success. We use case studies to develop this approach, focusing on a variety of marine animals. An approximate level of risk is assigned for each interaction based on the biological consequences.

In particular, the design and testing of wave energy control systems, a process which includes experimental design, empirical modeling, control design, and performance evaluation, is of interest. This goal motivated the redesign and testing of a floating dual flap wave energy converter. As summarized in this paper, the steps taken in the design, testing, and analysis of the device mirrored those previously demonstrated on a three-degree of freedom point absorber device. The method proposed does not require locking WEC degrees of freedom to develop an excitation model, and presents a more attainable system identification procedure for at-sea deployments. The results show that the methods employed work well for this dual flap device, lending additional support for the broad applicability of the design and testing methods applied here. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that these models are particularly useful for deducing areas of device design or controller implementation that can be reasonably improved to increase device power capture.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

To examine this underprediction, a coordinated investigation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and model-basin experiments was carried out. Both investigations involved a fixed and simplified OC5-DeepCwind semisubmersible in bichromatic waves. The wave excitations - especially the nonlinear, difference-frequency excitation - on the structure from the CFD simulations were compared to the experimental measurements for validation, with uncertainty analyses for both the experimental and the CFD results. Furthermore, the wave excitations on each column of the semisubmersible were measured separately in the experiment, allowing the validation of the CFD results to be done on a per-column basis. Overall, the CFD predictions of the difference-frequency excitations agree with the experimental measurements, suggesting the CFD solutions can be used as a reference for tuning and improving the engineering-level tools and can provide a means to better understand the underprediction at low frequencies.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

We develop a technique for the design of a discrete-time controller, which has three design stages. In the first stage, a linear controller is optimized while imposing a relaxation of the maximum stroke constraint on the design. In the second stage, a tandem nonlinear feedback loop is designed for the purpose of stroke protection. In the third stage, the two designs (linear and nonlinear) are fused in a manner that preserves the stability of the overall system. The technique is demonstrated in a simulation of a simple cylindrical buoy. We show that the controller may be tuned through the adjustment of scalar design parameters, which adjust the tradeoff between the mean generated power and the force levels required to protect the stroke.","IEEE","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This additionally could encourage deployments in remote locations where maintenance is costly or resource availability is low if dependent on solar power. More importantly, gaps in spatial data could be filled. This paper examines the feasibility of a modular horizontal pendulum wave energy converter to power National Data Buoy Center’s Self-Contained Ocean Observations Payload (SCOOP) off the coast of Washington State, U.S. The effect on power output was studied when the pendulum’s radius arm, mass, and power take-off damping were varied. Results using Matlab toolbox WEC-Sim revealed positive correlation between radius arm length and mass to power output, where power maximized for optimal damping values. Seasonal trends in power were not significant, where a 20 kg pendulum mass was needed to meet the SCOOP base power requirement of 5 W throughout the year.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Reliability-based hull geometry optimisation of a point-absorber wave energy converter with power take-off structural reliability objectives","Garcia‐Teruel, Anna; Clark, Caitlyn E.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; geometry; power converters; power takeoffs; reliability","Recent studies have focused on optimising wave energy converter (WEC) designs, maximising their power performance and techno-economic feasibility. Reliability has yet to be fully considered in these formulations, despite its impact on cost and performance. In this study, this gap is addressed by developing a reliability-based design optimisation framework for WEC hull geometries to explore the trade-off between power performance and power take-off (PTO) system damage equivalent loading (DEL). Optimised hull geometries for two sites are considered (from the centre of the North Sea and off the west coast of Norway), and two directions of motions (heave and surge). Results indicate that site characteristics affect the potential power production and DEL for an optimal WEC design. These are also affected by the direction of motion for power extraction, which also significantly changes optimal hull shape characteristics. Optimal surging WEC designs have edges facing oncoming wave directions, while heaving WECs have pointed bottoms, both to streamline movement.

Data are organized in categories of technology type, permitted capacity, pre- and post-installation, geographic location, and funding types. We also compare our findings with earlier logic models created for the Department of Energy (i.e., Reference Models). Environmental studies most commonly performed were for Fish and Fisheries, Noise, Marine Habitat/Benthic Studies and Marine Mammals. Studies for tidal projects were more expensive than those performed for wave projects and the range of reported project costs tended to be wider than ranges predicted by logic models. For eight projects reporting full project costs, from project start to FERC or USACE permit, the average amount for environmental permitting compliance was 14.6%.</p>","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

The presented framework is based on pseudo-quadratisation and weight scheduling, which is implemented using the ACADO toolkit for MATLAB/Simulink. The proposed strategy features code generation and deployment on the real-time target machines for industrial applications.

Numerical models are used for wave resource assessments to quantify the amount of available power and its seasonality. Alaska is the U.S. state with the longest coastline and has extensive wave resources, but it is affected by seasonal sea ice that dampens the wave energy and the full extent of this dampening is unknown. To accurately characterize the wave resource in regions that experience seasonal sea ice, coastal wave models must account for these effects. The aim of this study is to determine how the dampening effects of sea ice change wave energy resource assessments in the nearshore. Here, we show that by combining high-resolution sea ice imagery with a sea ice/wave dampening parameterization in an unstructured grid, the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model improves wave height predictions and demonstrates the extent to which wave power decreases when sea ice is present. The sea ice parametrization decreases the bias and root mean square errors of wave height comparisons with two wave buoys and predicts a decrease in the wave power of up to 100 kW/m in areas around Prince William Sound, Alaska. The magnitude of the improvement of the model/buoy comparison depends on the coefficients used to parameterize the wave–ice interaction.","MDPI AG","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Some wave energy converters are prone to this phenomenon, which is usually detrimental to their performance. Here, a computationally efficient way of simulating parametric resonance in point absorbers is presented. The model is based on linear potential theory, so the wave forces are evaluated at the mean position of the body. However, the first-order variation of the body's centres of gravity and buoyancy is taken into account. This gives essentially the same result as a more rigorous approach of keeping terms in the equation of motion up to second order in the body motions. The only difference from a linear model is the presence of non-zero off-diagonal elements in the mass matrix. The model is benchmarked against state-of-the-art non-linear Froude–Krylov and computational fluid dynamics models for free decay, regular wave, and focused wave group cases. It is shown that the simplified model is able to simulate parametric resonance in pitch to a reasonable accuracy even though no non-linear wave forces are included. The simulation speed on a standard computer is up to two orders of magnitude faster than real time.","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To minimize the cost of a WEC power take off (PTO) system, it is desirable to reduce the PTAP ratio while maximizing the mean power extracted by WECs. The important issue of how PTAP ratio reduction measures (such as adding an inertia element) can affect the mean power extracted in a reference model has not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. To investigate this correlation, this study focuses on the integration of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Reference Model 3, a two-body point absorber, with a slider-crank WEC for linear-to-rotational conversion. In the first phase of this study, a full-scale numerical model was developed that predicts how PTO system parameters, along with an advanced control algorithm, can potentially affect the proposed WEC’s PTAP ratio as well as the mean power extracted. In the second phase, an appropriate scaled-down model was developed, and extracted power results were successfully validated against the full-scale model. Finally, numerical and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations based on the scaled-down model were designed and conducted to optimize or make trade-offs between the operational performance and PTAP ratio. The initial results with numerical and HIL simulations reveal that gear ratio, crank radius, and generator parameters substantially impact the PTAP ratio and mean power extracted.</p>","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is natural to focus first on the impressive magnitudes of power available from ocean waves, and to be drawn to locations where mean power levels are highest. However, a number of additional factors such as intermittency and capacity factor may be influential in determining economic viability of a wave energy converter, and should therefore be considered at the resource level, so that these factors can influence device design decisions. This study examines a set of wave resource metrics aimed towards this end of bettering accounting for variability in wave energy converter design. The results show distinct regional trends that may factor into project siting and wave energy converter design.

Our approach leverages the same concepts that are exploited by a simple FM radio to achieve a feedback controller for wave energy devices that approaches optimal power absorption. If fully utilized, this approach can deliver immediate and consequential reductions to the cost of wave energy.

Initial results for point absorbers were presented in previous work, and here we present results for a breakwater-mounted Oscillating Water Column (OWC) device. The experimental model is at scale 1:4 relative to a full-scale installation in a water depth of 12.8 m. The power-extracting air turbine is modeled by an orifice plate of 1–2% of the internal chamber surface area. Measurements of chamber surface elevation, air flow through the orifice, and pressure difference across the orifice are compared with numerical calculations using both weakly-nonlinear potential flow theory and computational fluid dynamics. Both compressible- and incompressible-flow models are considered, and the effects of air compressibility are found to have a significant influence on the motion of the internal chamber surface. Recommendations are made for reducing uncertainties in future experimental campaigns, which are critical to enable firm conclusions to be drawn about the relative accuracy of the numerical models. It is well-known that boundary element method solutions of the linear potential flow problem (e.g., WAMIT) are singular at infinite frequency when panels are placed directly on the free surface. This is problematic for time-domain solutions where the value of the added mass matrix at infinite frequency is critical, especially for OWC chambers, which are modeled by zero-mass elements on the free surface. A straightforward rational procedure is described to replace ad-hoc solutions to this problem that have been proposed in the literature.","MDPI AG","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the ability of computational methods to accurately simulate the prescribed focused waves and resulting wave structure interactions is not well validated. This study uses two computational fluid dynamic methods, WEC-Sim and STAR-CCM+, to evaluate the responses of two taut-moored WEC-like buoys to three different focused waves. WEC-Sim is a computationally efficient, mid-fidelity model, based on linearised potential flow theory. In contrast, STAR-CCM+ is a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, unsteady, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based model. The two buoy geometries considered are a hemispherical-bottom cylinder and a truncated cylinder with a cylindrical moon pool. Three prescribed focused waves are generated in both codes, and the simulated displacements and mooring loads are obtained for each of the hydrodynamic bodies. The resulting STAR-CCM+ generated focused waves have approximately the same accuracy, in comparison with the analytic solution, as experimentally generated focused waves. The WEC-Sim simulated responses, when using viscous coefficients tuned to the measured displacements, are, on average, within 11.5% of experimentally measured values, whereas the STAR-CCM+ simulated responses are, on average, within 14.2% of the experimental values.","ICE Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This analysis derives and presents expected extreme wind and wave conditions for the sixteen lease areas that are currently being developed. Using the homogeneous ERA5 reanalysis dataset it is shown that the fifty-year return period wind speed (U50) at 100 m a.s.l. in the lease areas ranges from 29.2 to 39.7 ms<sup>-1</sup>. After applying corrections to account for spectral smoothing and averaging period, the associated pseudo-point U50 estimates are 34 to 46 ms<sup>-1</sup>. The derived uncertainty in U50 estimates due to different distributional fitting is smaller than the uncertainty associated with under-sampling of the interannual variability in annual maximum wind speeds. It is shown that, in the northern lease areas, annual maximum wind speeds are generally associated with intense extratropical cyclones rather than cyclones of tropical origin. Extreme wave statistics are also presented and indicate that the 50-year return period maximum wave height may substantially exceed 15 m. From this analysis, there is evidence that annual maximum wind speeds and waves frequently derive from the same cyclone source and often occur within a 6 h time interval.","MDPI","","New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), Albany, NY (United States); Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA (United States); Univ. of California, Davis, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2021-02-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 1053","","","EE0008390; SC0016438; SC0016605","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en14041053","10.3390/en14041053","","2022-04-26T00:00:00Z","1848768","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1848768","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1848768","Energies","4","14"

Furthermore, established molding techniques for marine energy structures generally require many manufacturing steps, such as secondary bonding and tooling. This research explores the possibilities of additively manufactured internal composite molds and how they can be used to reduce costs and lead times through novel design features and processes for marine energy composite structures. In this approach, not only can the composite mold be additively manufactured but it can also serve as part of the final load-bearing structure. We developed a conceptual design and implemented it to produce a reduced-scale additive/composite tidal turbine blade section to fully demonstrate the manufacturing possibilities. The manufacturing was successful and identified several critical features that could expedite the tidal turbine blade manufacturing process, such as single-piece construction, an integrated shear web, and embedded root fasteners. The hands-on manufacturing also helped identify key areas for continued research to allow for efficient, durable, and low-cost additive/composite-manufactured structures for future marine energy systems.","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This work considers the floating sphere used in the OES Task 10 WEC modeling and verification effort for analysis. Analytical equations are derived to determine bounds on displacement amplitude, time-averaged power (TAP), and power-take-off (PTO) force. A unique result found shows that the TAP absorbed by a WEC can be defined solely by the inertial properties and radiation hydrodynamic coefficients. In addition, a unique expression for the PTO force was derived that provides lower and upper bounds when resistive control is used to maximize power generation. For complex conjugate control, this same expression only provides a lower bound, as there is theoretically no upper bound. These bounds assist in comparing the performance of the floating sphere if it were to extract energy using surge or heave motion. The analysis shows because of differences in hydrodynamic coefficients for each oscillating mode, there are different frequency ranges that provide better power capture efficiency. The influence of a motion constraint on TAP while utilizing a nonideal power take-off is examined and found to reduce the losses associated with bidirectional energy flow. The expression to calculate TAP with a nonideal PTO is modified by the electrical conversion efficiency and the ratio of the PTO spring and damping coefficients. Furthermore, the PTO spring and damping coefficients were separated in the expression, allowing for limits to be set on the PTO coefficients to ensure net power generation.","ASME","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Wave energy resource characterization employing joint distributions in frequency-direction-time domain","Ahn, Seongho; Neary, Vincent S.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Wave energy; Buoy measurement; Dominant wave energy system; Spatial variation; US west coast","Joint and marginal distributions in the frequency, direction, and time domain are employed to demonstrate their value for wave energy resource characterization when full spectra are available. Insights gained through analysis of these distributions support wave energy converter concept design, operation and maintenance. Spatial trends in the wave energy resource and contributing wave energy systems along the continental shelf of the West Coast of the United States are investigated using the most recent two-dimensional wave spectra measurements at four buoys over an eleven year period (2008 to 2018). Resource hot spots and dominant resolved energy resource bands in the frequency-direction-time domain are delineated. Resource attributes, including frequency and directional spreading, and seasonal variability, are characterized using joint distributions and marginal distributions of wave power spectra. North Pacific westerly swells in the winter season, augmented by Aleutian low-pressure southwesterly swells, are the principal suppliers of the dominant resource and main drivers influencing resource attributes. In conclusion, the modification of these systems southward, especially the North Pacific westerly swells, explains the observed spatial resource trends. The dominant resource wave period shifts two seconds to higher wave periods, thirty degrees in the dominant direction band to a more northward orientation, and forward by one month.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Marine hydrokinetic current energy converters require large-domain simulations to estimate array efficiencies and environmental impacts. Meso-scale models typically represent turbines as actuator discs that act as momentum sinks and sources of turbulence and its dissipation. An OpenFOAM model was developed where actuator disc k-ε turbulence was characterized using an approach developed for flows through vegetative canopies. Turbine-wake data from laboratory flume experiments collected at two influent turbulence intensities were used to calibrate parameters in the turbulence-source terms in the k-ε equations. Additionally, parameter influences on longitudinal wake profiles were estimated using Gaussian process regression with subsequent optimization minimizing the objective function within 3.1% of those obtained using the full model representation, but for 74% of the computational cost (far fewer model runs). This framework facilitates more efficient parameterization of the turbulence-source equations using turbine-wake data.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"The Wave Energy Converter Design Process: Methods Applied in Industry and Shortcomings of Current Practices","Trueworthy, Ali; DuPont, Bryony","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; wave energy converter; conceptual design; stakeholder requirements; industry survey; design methods","Wave energy is among the many renewable energy technologies being researched and developed to address the increasing demand for low-emissions energy. The unique design challenges for wave energy converter design—integrating complex and uncertain technological, economic, and ecological systems, overcoming the structural challenges of ocean deployment, and dealing with complex system dynamics—have lead to a disjointed progression of research and development. There is no common design practice across the wave energy industry and there is no published synthesis of the practices that are used by developers. In this paper, we summarize the methods being employed in WEC design as well as promising methods that have yet to be applied. We contextualize these methods within an overarching design process. We present results from a survey of WEC developers to identify methods that are common in industry. From the review and survey results, we conclude that the most common methods of WEC design are iterative methods in which design parameters are defined, evaluated, and then changed based on evaluation results. This leaves a significant space for improvement of methods that help designers make better-informed decisions prior to sophisticated evaluation, and methods of using the evaluation results to make better design decisions during iteration. Despite the popularity of optimization methods in academic research, they are less common in industry development. We end this paper with a summary of the areas of WEC design in which the testing and development of new methods is necessary, and where more research is required to fully understand the influence of design decisions on WEC performance.","MDPI","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The international MRE industry is in the early stages of development, focused largely on tidal and riverine turbines, and wave energy converters (WECs), to harness energy from tides, run of the river, and waves, respectively. Although MRE supports climate change mitigation, there are concerns that MRE devices and systems could affects portions of the marine and river environment. The greatest concern for tidal and river turbines is the potential for animals to be injured or killed by collision with rotating blades. Other risks associated with MRE device operation include the potential for turbines and WECs to cause disruption from: underwater noise emissions; emissions of electromagnetic fields; changes in benthic and pelagic habitats; changes in oceanographic processes; entanglement of large marine animals; and displacement of animals from preferred habitats. The accumulated knowledge of interactions of MRE devices with animals and habitats is summarized here, along with a discussion of preferred management methods for encouraging MRE development in an environmentally responsible manner.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although a number of devices are designed for operation in intermediate water depths, little work has been reported on deterministic wave prediction in such depths. Here, we investigated a deterministic wave-prediction technique based on an approximate propagation model that leads to an analytical formulation, which may be convenient to implement in practice. To improve accuracy, an approach to combine predictions based on multiple up-wave measurement points is evaluated. The overall method is tested using experimental time-series measurements recorded in the U.S. Navy MASK basin in Carderock, MD, USA. For comparison, an alternative prediction approach based on Fourier coefficients is also tested with the same data. Comparison of prediction approaches with direct measurements suggest room for improvement. Possible sources of error including tank reflections are estimated, and potential mitigation approaches are discussed.","Springer International Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

"The Performance of a Spectral Wave Model at Predicting Wave Farm Impacts","McNatt, J. Cameron; Porter, Aaron; Chartrand, Christopher; Roberts, Jesse","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; wave energy converters; numerical modeling; wave farms; spectral wave models; environmental impacts","For renewable ocean wave energy to support global energy demands, wave energy converters (WECs) will likely be deployed in large numbers (farms), which will necessarily change the nearshore environment. Wave farm induced changes can be both helpful (e.g., beneficial habitat and coastal protection) and potentially harmful (e.g., degraded habitat, recreational, and commercial use) to existing users of the coastal environment. It is essential to estimate this impact through modeling prior to the development of a farm, and to that end, many researchers have used spectral wave models, such as Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), to assess wave farm impacts. However, the validity of the approaches used within SWAN have not been thoroughly verified or validated. Herein, a version of SWAN, called Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)-SWAN, which has a specialized WEC implementation, is verified by comparing its wave field outputs to those of linear wave interaction theory (LWIT), where LWIT is theoretically more appropriate for modeling wave-body interactions and wave field effects. The focus is on medium-sized arrays of 27 WECs, wave periods, and directional spreading representative of likely conditions, as well as the impact on the nearshore. A quantitative metric, the Mean Squared Skill Score, is used. Results show that the performance of SNL-SWAN as compared to LWIT is “Good” to “Excellent”.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

To date, most MRE development has focused on utility-scale electrical grid generation, but a growing body of work focuses on non-grid applications in the blue economy where MRE could provide power on-site and at the scale needed for specific maritime sectors. Additionally, one of the blue economy sectors with promising applications for MRE is ocean observations using both mobile and stationary platforms. This paper documents the steps and results of engaging with experts across the myriad ocean observation platforms and capabilities to inform five use cases. These use cases include descriptions of specific ocean observation applications performing measurements of high societal value (e.g., data for weather forecasting and tsunami detection) that closely resemble specific sensing systems and, in most cases, are placed in a particular area of the ocean. Rapid resource assessments (i.e., first-order estimates) were performed at these locations to determine the suitability of marine and other renewable energy sources. From the information gathered so far, MRE has significant potential to enable improved ocean observation missions, expand ocean observing capacity, and develop as an industry in parallel with the needs of our changing oceans.</jats:p>","Marine Technology Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Overall, the primary objective is to inform future energy planning. The authors evaluated offshore wind, wave energy, tidal energy, ocean-based solar photovoltaics (PV), ocean current, and ocean thermal energy conversion. Of these energy resources, offshore wind was the most viable option and was the focus of the second part of the study. The technical challenges of developing offshore wind in the GOM are discussed including hurricane design for turbines and substructures, as well as turbine solutions to overcome lower wind regimes. In addition, advantages to offshore wind development in the GOM are described including proximity to oil and gas supply chains. Economic analysis using established cost models at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory identified hypothetical project locations where net value of offshore wind was the highest, and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was calculated for three sites: Port Isabel, Port Arthur, and Pensacola. Offshore wind LCOE in the GOM was found to be higher than those in sites along the north and mid-Atlantic coasts, but decreasing cost trajectories indicate the possibility of economic viability for locations in Texas and west Louisiana after 2030. The extrapolated 2030 LCOE values range from 73 dollars per MWh (Site 1, Port Isabel) and 79 dollars per MWh (Site 3, Port Arthur) to 91 dollars per MWh (Site 5, Pensacola).","Marine Technology Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Specifically, the wave energy is extracted through relative heaving motion between a floating buoy and a submerged second body, while the current energy is extracted using a marine current turbine (MCT). Energy from both sources are integrated by a hybrid PTO whose concept is based on a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR). The hybrid PTO with two one-way clutches converts bidirectional, up-and-down motion from the waves into unidirectional rotation of the generator. Meanwhile a third one-way clutch couples the MCT with the same generator. The wave and current can simultaneously or separately drive the same generator through different engagement and disengagement statuses of the one-way clutches. Time-domain simulation is conducted with hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from computational fluid dynamics analysis and boundary element method. Tank tests were conducted for a HWCEC under co-existing wave and current inputs. For comparison, separate baseline tests of a turbine and a two-body point absorber, each acting in isolation, are conducted. Experimental results validate the dynamic modeling and show that a HWCEC can increase the output power with a range between 29-87% over either current turbine and wave energy converter acting individually, and it can reduce by up to 70% the peak-to-average power ratio compared with the wave energy converter on the tested conditions.","Elsevier","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

This paper introduces an innovative compact mechanical PTO using a ball screw mechanism and a Mechanical Motion Rectifier (MMR) to improve the energy conversion performance. The proposed MMR PTO converts bidirectional oscillatory motion of the ocean waves into unidirectional rotation. The detailed design and working principle of the MMR PTO are explicitly explained. Dynamic analysis is presented for the three most important factors that influence the performance, including the equivalent mass, the equivalent damping, and the excitation frequency. The analytical relationship between these factors and the disengaged freewheeling motion caused by the MMR mechanism is derived, and the analytical solution is verified through dry lab testing. Experimental results in bench tests show that compared with the traditional linear PTO which use the ball screw to drive the generator directly, the MMR PTO is more efficient because of the unique freewheeling motion, achieving a maximum 81.2% energy transfer efficiency.

"Robust Control of Wave Energy Converters Using Unstructured Uncertainty","Lao, Yejun; Scruggs, Jeffrey T.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","In the design of ocean wave energy converters, proper control design is essential to the maximization of the power generation performance for the device. However, in realistic applications, this control design must be undertaken in the presence of model uncertainty. This paper considers the use of robust control theory to optimize the nominal performance for a wave energy converter in stochastic waves, subject to the constraint that the controller be stability-robust to unstructured uncertainties. We formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimal control problem, in which the primary objective is the maximization of power generation for the nominal system, and the competing objective is the norm of the uncertainty input/output channel. This optimal control problem is nonconvex, and we therefore propose an iterative algorithm that can be used to arrive at a local optimal solution. This iterative approach employs the concept of Iterative Convex Overbounding, in the context of the classical Method of Centers. Here, the methodology is demonstrated on a model of a single, buoy- type wave energy converter.","IEEE","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The location on the east shore of Oahu is open to year-round wind waves and seasonal north swells as well as severe seas from subtropical systems and hurricanes. We have assembled a spectral wave model system comprising WAVEWATCH III and SWAN on a hierarchy of global, regional, and nearshore computational grids. With wind forcing from global forecast and rean-alysis datasets as well as their regional downscaling, the system produces operational 7-day wave forecasts and a long-term hindcast. The daily forecasts, validated with real-time buoy measurements, facilitate safe deployment, operation, and retrieval of wave energy converters (WECs). The wave hindcast from 1979 to 2017 defines the intra- and inter-annual variations for statistical analysis of sea states and energy resources. Due to limited occurrences of hurricanes in Hawaii waters, their wind forcing is determined parametrically with simulated tracks from climate model downscaling. Finally, systematic analysis of the hindcast and simulation datasets provides significant wave heights from trade winds, swells, subtropical systems, and hurricanes with return periods up to 100 years for WECs survival analysis.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

With a direct-drive linear generator, the WEC consists of dual floating cylinders and a moon-pool between the cylinders, which can utilize three resonance phenomena from moon-pool dynamics as well as heave motions of inner and outer buoys. The contact and friction between the two buoys observed in the experiment are also properly modeled in the time-domain simulation by the Coulomb-friction model. Moon-pool resonance peaks significantly exaggerated in linear potential theory are empirically adjusted through comparisons with measured values. A systematic comparative study between the simulations and experiments with and without PTO (power-take-off) is conducted, and the relative heave displacements/velocities and power outputs are well matched. Then, parametric studies are carried out with the simulation program to determine optimum generator parameters.

The first MHK deployments in the U.S. have incurred very high permitting costs and long timelines for deploying projects, which increases project risk and discourages investment. A key challenge to advancing an economically competitive U.S. MHK industry is reducing the time and cost required for environmental permitting and compliance with government regulations. Other industries such as offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy, subsea power and data cables, onshore wind energy, and solar energy facilities have all developed more robust permitting and compliance pathways that provide lessons for the MHK industry in the U.S. and may help inform the global consenting process. Based on in-depth review and research into each of the other industries, we describe the environmental permitting pathways, the main environmental concerns and types of monitoring typically associated with them, and factors that appear to have eased environmental permitting and compliance issues.","MDPI","","Sandia National Lab.

"Dominant Wave Energy Systems and Conditional Wave Resource Characterization for Coastal Waters of the United States","Ahn, Seongho; Haas, Kevin A.; Neary, Vincent S.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","Opportunities and constraints for wave energy conversion technologies and projects are evaluated by identifying and characterizing the dominant wave energy systems for United States (US) coastal waters using marginal and joint distributions of the wave energy in terms of the peak period, wave direction, and month. These distributions are computed using partitioned wave parameters generated from a 30 year WaveWatch III model hindcast, and regionally averaged to identify the dominant wave systems contributing to the total annual available energy (AAE) for eleven distinct US wave energy climate regions. These dominant wave systems are linked to the wind systems driving their generation and propagation. In addition, conditional resource parameters characterizing peak period spread, directional spread, and seasonal variability, which consider dependencies of the peak period, direction, and month, are introduced to augment characterization methods recommended by international standards. These conditional resource parameters reveal information that supports project planning, conceptual design, and operation and maintenance. The present study shows that wave energy resources for the United States are dominated by long-period North Pacific swells (Alaska, West Coast, Hawaii), short-period trade winds and nor’easter swells (East Coast, Puerto Rico), and wind seas (Gulf of Mexico). Seasonality, peak period spread, and directional spread of these dominant wave systems are characterized to assess regional opportunities and constraints for wave energy conversion technologies targeting the dominant wave systems.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

Moreover, due to their isolated nature and harsh operating environment, WEC systems are projected to possess high operations and maintenance (O&M) cost, i.e., around 27% of their leveled cost of energy. As such, developing techniques to mitigate these costs through the application of condition monitoring and fault tolerant control will significantly impact the economic feasibility of grid connected WEC power. Toward this goal, models of faulty components are developed in the open source modeling platform, WEC-Sim, to estimate the performance and measurable states of a WEC operating with likely device and sensor failures. Two types of faulty component models are then applied to a point absorber WEC model with basic controller damping and spring forces. Resulting changes in device behavior are recorded as a benchmark, and a graph-theoretic approach is proposed for fault detection and identification utilizing multivariate time series. Simulation results demonstrate that these faults can greatly affect the WEC performance, and that the proposed method can effectively detect and classify different types of faults.","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The present study compares extreme sea state estimates derived from univariate and bivariate methods and investigates the performance of spectral wave models for predicting extreme sea states at buoy locations within several regional wave climates along the US East and West Coasts. Two common third-generation spectral wave models are evaluated, a WAVEWATCH III® model with a grid resolution of 4 arc-minutes (6–7 km), and a Simulating WAves Nearshore model, with a coastal resolution of 200–300 m. Both models are used to generate multi-year hindcasts, from which extreme sea state statistics used for wave conditions characterization can be derived and compared to those based on in-situ observations at National Data Buoy Center stations. Comparison of results using different univariate and bivariate methods from the same data source indicates reasonable agreement on average. Discrepancies are predominantly random. Large discrepancies are common and increase with return period. There is a systematic underbias for extreme significant wave heights derived from model hindcasts compared to those derived from buoy measurements. This underbias is dependent on model spatial resolution. However, simple linear corrections can effectively compensate for this bias. A similar approach is not possible for correcting model-derived environmental contours, but other methods, e.g., machine learning, should be explored.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"A Tidal Hydrodynamic Model for Cook Inlet, Alaska, to Support Tidal Energy Resource Characterization","Wang, Taiping; Yang, Zhaoqing","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","Cook Inlet in Alaska has been identified as a prime site in the U.S. for potential tidal energy development, because of its enormous tidal power potential that accounts for nearly one-third of the national total. As one important step to facilitate tidal energy development, a tidal hydrodynamic model based on the unstructured-grid, finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) was developed for Cook Inlet to characterize the tidal stream energy resource. The model has a grid resolution that varies from about 1000 m at the open boundary to 100–300 m inside the Inlet. Extensive model validation was achieved by comparing model predictions with field observations for tidal elevation and velocity at various locations in Cook Inlet. The error statistics confirmed the model performs reasonably well in capturing the tidal dynamics in the system, e.g., R2 > 0.98 for tidal elevation and generally > 0.9 for velocity. Model results suggest that tides in Cook Inlet evolve from progressive waves at the entrance to standing waves at the upper Inlet, and that semi-diurnal tidal constituents are amplified more rapidly than diurnal constituents. The model output was used to identify hotspots that have high energy potential and warrant additional velocity and turbulence measurements such as East Foreland, where averaged power density exceeds 5 kw/m2. Lastly, a tidal energy extraction simulation was conducted for a hypothetical turbine farm configuration at the Forelands cross section to evaluate tidal energy extraction and resulting changes in far-field hydrodynamics.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Tidal energy’s predictability indicates that the resource could introduce less volatility into balancing the electric grid when compared to other renewables, a fundamentally desirable attribute for the electric system. More specifically, tidal energy resources are unique in that they have the potential to produce relatively smoother power profiles over time through aggregation. In order to generate smooth power profiles from tidal resources, sufficient complexity within the timing of tides is necessary within electrical proximity. This study evaluates the concept of aggregating diverse tides for the purpose of reducing periods of no and low energy production and creating smoother power profiles in regions around Alaska and Washington by calculating cross-correlations of tidal current velocity time series. Ultimately, study results show limited potential to exploit the resources for this purpose and describe the institutional mechanisms necessary to realize the benefits in practice.</p>","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It was developed with the primary goal of supporting the evaluation of potential acoustic effects of offshore renewable energy projects. The system consists of a compact array of three acoustic vector sensors, which measures acoustic pressure and the three-dimensional particle velocity vector associated with the propagation of an acoustic wave, thereby inherently providing bearing information to an underwater source of sound. By utilizing an array of three vector sensors, the application of beamforming techniques can provide sound source localization, allowing for characterization of the acoustic signature of specific underwater acoustic sources. In this study, performance characteristics of the system are presented, using data from controlled acoustic transmissions in a quiet environment and ambient noise measurements in an energetic tidal channel in the presence of non-acoustic flow noise. Data quality is demonstrated by the ability to reduce non-acoustic flow noise contamination, while system utility is shown by the ability to characterize and localize sources of sound in the underwater environment.","MDPI","","Integral Consulting Inc., Santa Cruz, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","Sandia National Laboraties; Proteus Technologies; Noise Control Engineering","Switzerland","2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Marine Science and Engineering Journal Volume: 8 Journal Issue: 3","","Medium: X; Size: Article No. 187","","","EE0007822","Journal ID: ISSN 2077-1312; PII: jmse8030187","10.3390/jmse8030187","","2020-06-12T00:00:00Z","1603825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1603825","","Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","3","8"
"Risk Retirement—Decreasing Uncertainty and Informing Consenting Processes for Marine Renewable Energy Development","Copping, Andrea E.; Freeman, Mikaela C.; Gorton, Alicia M.; Hemery, Lenaig G.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; marine renewable energy; risk retirement; environmental effects","Marine renewable energy (MRE) is under development in many coastal nations, adding to the portfolio of low carbon energy sources that power national electricity grids as well as off-grid uses in isolated areas and at sea. Progress in establishing the MRE industry, largely wave and tidal energy, has been slowed in part due to uncertainty about environmental risks of these devices, including harm to marine animals and habitats, and the associated concerns of regulators and stakeholders. A process for risk retirement was developed to organize and apply knowledge in a strategic manner that considered whether specific environmental effects are likely to cause harm. The risk retirement process was tested against two key MRE stressors: effects of underwater noise from operational MRE devices on marine animals, and effects of electromagnetic fields from MRE electrical export cables on marine animals. The effects of installation of MRE devices were not accounted for in this analysis. Applying the risk retirement process could decrease the need for costly investigations of each potential effect at every new MRE project site and help move the industry beyond current barriers.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Comparison of Numerical Methods for Modeling the Wave Field Effects Generated by Individual Wave Energy Converters and Multiple Converter Wave Farms","McNatt, J. Cameron; Porter, Aaron; Ruehl, Kelley","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; wave energy; wave farm; arrays; spectral wave action balance; boundary element method","This numerical study compares the wave field generated by the spectral wave action balance code, SNL-SWAN, to the linear-wave boundary-element method (BEM) code, WAMIT. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of SNL-SWAN for modeling wave field effects produced by individual wave energy converters (WECs) and wave farms comprising multiple WECs by comparing results from SNL-SWAN with those produced by the BEM code WAMIT. BEM codes better model the physics of wave-body interactions and thus simulate a more accurate near-field wave field than spectral codes. In SNL-SWAN, the wave field’s energy extraction is modeled parametrically based on the WEC’s power curve. The comparison between SNL-SWAN and WAMIT is made over a range of incident wave conditions, including short-, medium-, and long-wavelength waves with various amounts of directional spreading, and for three WEC archetypes: a point absorber (PA), a pitching flap (PF) terminator, and a hinged raft (HR) attenuator. Individual WECs and wave farms of five WECs in various configuration were studied with qualitative comparisons made of wave height and spectra at specific locations, and quantitative comparisons of the wave fields over circular arcs around the WECs as a function of radial distance. Results from this numerical study demonstrate that in the near-field, the difference between SNL-SWAN and WAMIT is relatively large (between 20% and 50%), but in the far-field from the array the differences are minimal (between 1% and 5%). The resultant wave field generated by the two different numerical approaches is highly dependent on parameters such as: directional wave spreading, wave reflection or scattering, and the WEC’s power curve.","MDPI","","Sandia National Lab.

This is potentially useful when a successful linear controller already exists and it is necessary to incorporate the constraint-handling capabilities of MPC. This is the case for a wave energy converter (WEC), where the maximum power transfer law is well-understood. In addition to solutions based on numerical optimization, a simple analytical solution is also derived for cases with a short prediction horizon. These methods are applied for the control of an empirically-based WEC model. The results show that the MPC can be successfully tuned to follow an existing linear control law and to comply with both input and state constraints, such as actuator force and actuator stroke.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

The U.S. Navy deploys AUVs in locations around the world that must be charged manually, decreasing their operational endurance and creating operational limitations. Ocean waves are a potential power source that can be converted into electricity using a WEC and stored using a battery. It would be beneficial to develop a WEC that could autonomously charge AUVs offshore. Numerous locations were analyzed to determine the minimum size of a WEC capable of providing sufficient charging power and offering a strategic advantage. By predicting the WEC efficiency (based on empirical equations) and wave resource (based on available data), electrical power generation across numerous WEC types and locations was compared in MATLAB. The generalized process developed here could be used to determine the required size and type of WECs to charge a fleet of AUVs in different locations around the world.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

If the variability is great enough, then this may influence future financial decisions. This paper provides the unique contribution of quantifying variability in the predicted cost of energy and introduces a framework for investigating reduction of variability through investment in components. Following review of existing methodologies for parametric analysis of ocean energy array design, the development of the DTOcean software tool is presented. DTOcean can quantify variability by simulating the design, deployment and operation of arrays with higher complexity than previous models, designing sub-systems at component level. A case study of a theoretical floating wave energy converter array is used to demonstrate that the variability in levelised cost of energy (LCOE) can be greatest for the smallest arrays and that investment in improved component reliability can reduce both the variability and most likely value of LCOE. A hypothetical study of improved electrical cables and connectors shows reductions in LCOE up to 2.51% and reductions in the variability of LCOE of over 50%; these minima occur for different combinations of components.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Experimental and numerical investigations of a two-body floating-point absorber wave energy converter in regular waves","Xu, Qianlong; Li, Ye; Yu, Yi-Hsiang; Ding, Boyin; Jiang, Zhiyu; Lin, Zhiliang; Cazzolato, Benjamin","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; wave energy; floating-point absorber; experimental test; Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations; boundary element method; viscous damping; nonlinear effect","This paper presents experimental and numerical studies on the hydrodynamics of a two-body floating-point absorber (FPA) wave energy converter (WEC) under both extreme and operational wave conditions. In this study, the responses of the WEC in heave, surge, and pitch were evaluated for various regular wave conditions. For extreme condition analysis, we assume the FPA system has a survival mode that locks the power-take-off (PTO) mechanism in extreme waves, and the WEC moves as a single body in this scenario. A series of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations was performed for the survival condition analysis, and the results were validated with the measurements from experimental wave tank tests. For the FPA system in operational conditions, both a boundary element method (BEM) and the RANS simulations were used to analyze the motion response and power absorption performance. Additional viscous damping, primarily induced by flow separation and vortex shedding, is included in the BEM simulation as a quadratic drag force proportional to the square of body velocity. The inclusion of viscous drag improves the accuracy of BEM's prediction of the heave response and the power absorption performance of the FPA system, which agrees well with experimental data and the RANS simulation results over a broad range of incident wave periods, except near resonance in large wave height scenarios. Overall, the experimental and numerical results suggest that nonlinear effects, caused by viscous damping and interaction between waves and the FPA, significantly influence the system response and power absorption performance. Nonlinear effects were found to be particularly significant when the wave height was large and the period was near or shorter than the resonant period of the FPA system. The study is expected to be helpful for understanding the nonlinear interaction between waves and the FPA system so that the structure of the FPA can be adequately designed.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Two types of direct-drive power take off (PTO) systems are examined. One adopts a ball screw system in inverse driving mode with mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) that converts the oscillating bi-directional input heave motion into unidirectional rotation to drive an electromagnetic generator, and another one uses a ball screw system to directly drive the generator (called non-MMR). Dynamic models for both types of PTOs are established and integrated with the overall WEC system model in both the time and frequency domains. Numerical simulation is used to investigate the dynamic performance of both PTOs. The influences of the PTO inerter, which is from the rotational inertia of the flywheel and generator, and the WEC drag damping coefficient are discussed and explored. The analytical closed-form solution for the optimum condition of the non-MMR system is derived based on the criterion of maximum power absorption, and numerical simulation yields the optimum condition for the MMR system. Overall, the results under regular and irregular waves show that the PTO inerter in the MMR system can improve the power absorption for small wave periods and maintain the same performance for large wave periods. The PTO inerter in the non-MMR system shifts the peak frequency. The WEC drag damping negatively influences the power absorption in both PTO systems, especially at large wave periods.","Elsevier","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

Unlike previous studies, this study considers structural loads, for which, an accurate assessment is crucial to the optimization and survival of a WEC. Three levels of computational fidelity are considered. The first set of design load approximations are made using a potential flow frequency-domain boundary-element method with generalized body modes. The second set of design load approximations are made using a modified version of the linear-based time-domain code WEC-Sim. The final set of design load simulations are realized using computational fluid dynamics coupled with finite element analysis to evaluate the WEC’s loads in response to both regular and focused waves. This study demonstrates an efficient framework for evaluating loads through each of the design stages. In comparison with experimental and high-fidelity simulation results, the linear-based methods can roughly approximate the design loads and the sea states at which they occur. The high-fidelity simulations for regular wave responses correspond well with experimental data and appear to provide reliable design load data. The high-fidelity simulations of focused waves, however, result in highly nonlinear interactions that are not predicted by the linear-based most-likely extreme response design load method.</p>","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The motion of the WEC device is a significant contribution to the energy absorbed by the device. Reactive (complex conjugate) control maximizes the energy absorption due to the impedance matching. The issue with complex conjugate control is that, in general, the controller is noncausal, which requires prediction of the incoming waves. This article explores the potential of employing system identification techniques to build a causal transfer function that approximates the complex conjugate controller over a finite frequency band of interest. This approach is quite viable given the band-limited nature of ocean waves. The resulting controller is stable, and the average efficiency of the power captured by the causal controller in realistic ocean waves is 99%, when compared to the noncausal complex conjugate.","IEEE","","Sandia National Lab.

"Experimental Validation of Model Predictive Control Applied to the Azura Wave Energy Converter","Ling, Bradley Adam; Bosma, Bret; Brekken, Ted K. A.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Renewable Energy sources; marine technology; ocean wave energy; model predictive control","Ocean wave energy is a promising area of renewable energy development. However, there are unique operational challenges, particularly with regards to modeling, estimation, and control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely studied control approach that has strong potential for successful application to ocean wave energy conversion. It combines a predictive element, which is necessary for optimal wave energy conversion, along with consideration of system limitations, which is extremely important when operating within the very large forces present in ocean hydrodynamics. This paper presents MPC formulation and experimental testing, applied to the 1/15th scale Azura wave energy converter developed and tested by Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI). Here, the results demonstrate successful prototype testing, with MPC providing an average increase in power production of 36% over standard fixed damping for six cases of sea states.","IEEE","","Northwest Energy Innovations, Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

These challenges result from a lack of sufficient devices in the water from which to learn, a dearth of quality monitoring data, and a lack of accessibility to information about these effects in general. This paper describes an ongoing process to improve understanding of the environmental effects of MRE through a public, online knowledge management system developed by the U.S. Department of Energy, known as Tethys (https://tethys.pnnl.gov). Tethys collects and curates relevant documents while supporting a diverse international community through intentional outreach and synthesis activities, many of which support an international collaboration under the IEA Ocean Energy System’s Annex IV. After eight years of operation, Tethys is internationally recognized and viewed as a trusted broker of information, with over 50,000 visitors annually. Tethys has provided clarity around environmental effects during a critical time in the industry when deployments are increasing in size and frequency.","European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Although engineering design and analysis tools used for other ocean systems, such as offshore structures and ships, can be applied, the unique nature and limited historical experience of WEC design necessitates assessment of the effectiveness of these methods for this specific application. This paper details a study to predict extreme loading in a two-body WEC using a combination of mid-fidelity and high-fidelity numerical modeling tools. Here, the mid-fidelity approach is a time-domain model based on linearized potential flow hydrodynamics and the high-fidelity modeling tool is an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model. In both models, the dynamics of the WEC power take-off and mooring system have been included. For the high-fidelity model, two design wave approaches (an equivalent regular wave and a focused wave) are used to estimate the worst case wave forcing within a realistic irregular sea state. These simplified design wave approaches aim to capture the extreme response of the WEC within a feasible amount of computational effort. When compared to the mid-fidelity model results in a long-duration irregular sea, the short-duration design waves simulated in CFD produce upper percentile load responses, hinting at the suitability of these two approaches.","Springer International Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

"Model Predictive Control of a Wave Energy Converter Using Duality Techniques","Kody, Alyssa; Tom, Nathan; Scruggs, Jeffrey","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","In this paper, a method for implementing model predictive control for vibration energy harvesting systems with the goal of maximizing generated energy is presented. This is generally a nonconvex problem, which can be computationally expensive and converging to a global minimum cannot be guaranteed. We introduce a dual-domain method to relax the nonconvex primal problem into a convex dual optimization problem, which can be performed in real time. Based on previous work, we determine when the duality gap is zero and, by extension, whether the global optimal primal solution is found. Here, we demonstrate the algorithm on a single, buoy-type wave energy converter with energy storage constraints and power take-off force constraints.","IEEE","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"A new passivity-based nonlinear causal control technique for wave energy converters with finite stroke","Scruggs, Jeffrey T.; Lao, Yejun","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","A new technique is proposed for the design of nonlinear causal feedback controllers for wave energy converters, which explicitly protect against stroke saturation. Here, the technique is an improvement of a technique originally proposed. The primary challenge associated with the problem is the design of nonlinear controllers for which global closed-loop stability can be assured with probability 1 for stationary stochastic response, without also unduly sacrificing power generation performance. The proposed technique consists of three steps: 1) designing a linear feedback controller using multi-objective optimization techniques; 2) augmenting this design with an extra input channel that adheres to a closed-loop passivity condition; and 3) designing an outer, nonlinear passive feedback loop that controls this augmented input in such a way as to ensure stroke limits are maintained. The primary contribution of this paper is a fundamental improvement to the second of these steps, for which the previous technique was not guaranteed to return a valid solution. The proposed technique, by contrast, is shown to always produce a nonlinear controller with the desired properties, under very general modeling assumptions. The technique is illustrated on a simple heaving-buoy wave energy converter example.","IEEE","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Here, quantification and analysis of the hydrodynamic modifications in the river caused by the turbine are presented. Field observations are used to produce a unique three-dimensional data set of fluid velocities in the vicinity of the turbine before and after turbine deployment. Three dynamic regions are distinguished in the wake. There is an induction zone just upstream of the turbine, where velocities decrease and turbulence increases. There is a near wake just downstream of the turbine, where the reduced velocities recover slightly and the elevated turbulence decays rapidly. Finally, there is a far wake well beyond the turbine, where reduced velocities are persistent and turbulence remains elevated. The results are used in a coarse energy budget for the river, including quantifying the total energy dissipated by turbulence in the near wake. This wake dissipation is found to be almost as large as the energy extracted for electricity generation, even when the turbine is not operational.","Elsevier","","Ocean Renewable Power Company, Portland, ME (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE); Naval Facilities and Engineering Command","","United Kingdom","2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable Energy Journal Volume: 139 Journal Issue: C","","Medium: X; Size: p. 483-495","","","EE0006397; N00024-10-D-63","Journal ID: ISSN 0960-1481; S096014811930206X; PII: S096014811930206X","10.1016/j.renene.2019.02.052","","2020-06-04T00:00:00Z","1547743","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1547743","","Renewable Energy","C","139"
"Non-linear Model Predictive Control of Wave Energy Converters with Realistic Power Take-off Configurations and Loss Model","Karthikeyan, A.; Previsic, M.; Scruggs, J.; Chertok, A.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been recognized as a well-developed control strategy for optimizing the performance of wave energy converters (WECs). The standard problem involves maximizing the absorbed power from oncoming waves while respecting motion constraints of the device and force constraints of the power take-off (PTO). The generated electrical power is then calculated by assuming an ideal PTO with no power conversion losses or limitations to power flow. In this article, we remove the assumption of an ideal PTO and present four different control options that reflect unique combinations of PTO control and power flow constraints. We also recast the MPC problem to maximize the generated power instead of the absorbed power by accounting for the losses in the power train. Using a WEC with a hydraulic PTO, we develop a loss model suitable for controls optimization. Lastly, we illustrate the process of setting up the non-linear MPC problem and compare the performance of competing control strategies using a common benchmark based on annual energy captured at a reference site.","IEEE","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The Hamiltonian represents the stored energy in the system and can be constructed as a function of the WEC’s system states, its position, and velocity. The Hamiltonian surface is defined by the energy storage, while the system trajectories are constrained to this surface and determined by the power flows of the applied non-conservative forces. The HSS approach presented in this paper can be used as a tool for the design of nonlinear control systems that are guaranteed to be stable.

The body consists of a bottom-hinged rectangular paddle in which the frame holds five horizontal flaps spanning the interior of the frame. Each flap can rotate independently about its center of rotation to alter hydrodynamic coefficients. A 1:14 scale model was built for wave tank tests where the OSWEC's natural response to regular waves was measured. Tests with the paddle fixed vertically were conducted to measure the moment induced by incident waves. Conclusions were compared to numerical simulations which determined that flap orientation significantly affected wave energy transmission past the device. Numerical simulations with the addition of a linear rotational damper power take-off (PTO) suggested that with flaps open, the resistive moment was reduced by up to 47%, the surge force on the foundation up to 55%, and the capture width up to 72% over a range of wave periods and PTO damping values. The experimental nondimensional excitation moments and reflection coefficients were reduced by up to 54%. Overall, the flaps provide mechanical means to reduce loads, thus improving the design life of a WEC system.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The submerged body can be used to increase the equivalent excitation force on the WEC, as well as provide resonance tuning. This paper presents numerical analysis and experimental validation of a two-body point absorber type WEC using a mechanical motion rectifier (MMR) based power takeoff. The two-body point absorber consists of a floating buoy connected to a neutrally buoyant submerged body via the power-takeoff. The mechanical motion rectifier and a ball screw translate the relative heave motion of the two bodies into unidirectional rotation, which in turn spins a generator. Frequency domain analysis suggests there is an optimal submerged body mass for maximum WEC power absorption. Regular wave simulations in the time domain are compared to the results obtained in the frequency domain. While the time domain and frequency domain results predict the same optimal mass ratio, time domain analysis provides a more complex and accurate power result. To validate the time domain model, experimental wave tank testing is conducted using a 1:30 scale model WEC. The experiment shows the two-body WEC can produce twice the amount of power as the single-body WEC with same floating buoy and can be further increased by PTO design and power electronics optimization. Furthermore, wave tank testing shows the two-body WEC has a capture width ratio up to 58% at 59 kW/m and 51% at 36 kW/m.","Elsevier","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

The accurate predictions of large-wave events are critical to the success of wave resource characterization because of the risk on WEC installation, maintenance, and damage caused by extreme sea states. Because wind forcing is the primary driver of wave models, the quality of wind data plays an important role in the accuracy of wave predictions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of large-wave prediction to different wind-forcing products, and identifies a feasible approach to improve wave model results through improved wind forcing. Using a multi-level nested-grid modeling approach, we perform a series of sensitivity tests at four representative National Data Buoy Center buoy locations on the U.S. East and West Coasts. The selected wind-forcing products include the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis global wind product and North American Regional Reanalysis regional wind product as well as the observed wind at the buoys. Sensitivity test results indicate a consistent improvement in model predictions for the large-wave events (e.g., >90th percentile of significant wave height) at all buoys when observed-wind data were used to drive the wave model simulations.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Numerical Modeling and Dynamic Analysis of a Wave-Powered Reverse-Osmosis System","Yu, Yi -Hsiang; Jenne, Dale S.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; wave energy; desalination; reverse osmosis; time-domain numerical model","<p>A wave energy converter (WEC) system has the potential to convert the wave energy resource directly into the high-pressure flow that is needed by the desalination system to pump saltwater to the reverse-osmosis membrane and provide the required pressure level to generate freshwater. In this study, a wave-to-water numerical model was developed to investigate the potential use of a wave-powered desalination system (WPDS) for water production. The model was developed by coupling a time-domain radiation-and-diffraction method-based numerical tool (WEC-Sim) for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of WECs with a solution-diffusion model that was used to simulate the reverse-osmosis (RO) process. The objective of this research is to evaluate the WPDS dynamics and the overall efficiency of the system. To evaluate the feasibility of the WPDS, the wave-to-water numerical model was applied to simulate a desalination system that used an oscillating surge WEC device to pump seawater through the system. The hydrodynamics WEC-Sim simulation results for the oscillating surge WEC device were validated against existing experimental data. The RO simulation was verified by comparing the results to those from the Dow Chemical Company’s reverse osmosis system analysis (ROSA) model, which has been widely used to design and simulate RO systems. The wave-to-water model was then used to analyze the WPDS under a range of wave conditions and for a two-WECs-coupled RO system to evaluate the influence of pressure and flow rate fluctuation on the WPDS performance. The results show that the instantaneous energy fluctuation from waves has a significant influence on the responding hydraulic pressure and flow rate, as well as the recovery ratio and, ultimately, the water-production quality. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce the hydraulic fluctuation for different sea states while maintaining a certain level of freshwater production, and a WEC array that produces water can be a viable, near-term solution to the nation’s water supply. Furthermore, a discussion on the dynamic impact of hydraulic fluctuation on the WPDS performance and potential options to reduce the fluctuation and their trade-offs is also presented.</p>","MDPI","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Often in these tests, a real-time realization of prospective control algorithms is applied in order to assess and optimize energy absorption as well as other factors. This paper details the design and execution of an experiment for evaluating the capability of a model-scale WEC to execute basic control algorithms. Model-scale hardware, system, and experimental design are considered, with a focus on providing an experimental setup capable of meeting the dynamic requirements of a control system. To more efficiently execute such tests, a dry bench testing method is proposed and utilized to allow for controller tuning and to give an initial assessment of controller performance; this is followed by wave tank testing. The trends from the dry bench test and wave tank test results show good agreement with theory and confirm the ability of a relatively simple feedback controller to substantially improve energy absorption. Additionally, the dry bench testing approach is shown to be an effective and efficient means of designing and testing both controllers and actuator systems for wave energy converters.","","","Sandia National Lab.

This PTO system, mainly consisting of dual ball screws, gearbox with mechanical motion rectification (MMR) and a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), can convert bidirectional irregular motions from a floating wave buoy into unidirectional regular generator rotations. Systematical operating principles, design and prototyping details of the PTO system are presented and analyzed. A hydrodynamics-mechanical-electrical model of the system is established by reasonably representing power switches attached to the PMSG as an equivalent external resistance. The overall dynamics of the system are then analyzed in the frequency-domain. Three power control strategies are proposed to maximize the wave power absorption by changing the equivalent external resistance. The effectiveness and relatively high energy conversion efficiency of the PTO system have been demonstrated based on lab bench test results. The levelized cost of energy of a full scale wave energy converter system is also calculated based on the proposed PTO system.","IEEE","","Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.

As technologies advance toward commercialization, benchmarking is needed to quantify performance and costs. In this review, experimental datasets of Wave Energy Converter (WEC) devices tested in the final stage of the Wave Energy Prize (WEPrize) are compared and ranked using performance metrics found in the literature and those developed as WEPrize judging metrics at both U.S. and European representative wave climates. Because the WEPrize devices were tested under a set of identical sea states, which ranged from typical operating conditions to extreme storm events, consistent datasets were produced to facilitate comparison. This allows for a rare addition to the open literature on device performance trends. In addition, a reevaluation of trends established in previous power performance benchmarking studies is given. Trends found in previous studies were confirmed, except for the absorbed energy per characteristic mass metric, in which some of the WEPrize devices had higher values. Each of the metrics considered in this study has limitations due to the assumptions in simplifying the economic potential (e.g., power absorbed vs. a proxy to cost). In addition, each of these proxies is limited to the capital cost of a device, unlike the final metric used in the WEPrize, HPQ, which includes limited proxies of operational and capital expenditures, as well as array considerations. Recommendations are given for the use and potential modification of the metrics considered. Specifically, it is recommended that the ACE metric (from the WEPrize) be modified to more accurately include the other important system costs, such as the PTO and mooring, as well as installation, operation and maintenance costs.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

These investigations have produced a new methodology to evaluate the probabilities associated with peak power values on an annual basis. It has been shown that the peaks in pneumatic power production will follow an exponential probability function for a linear model. A methodology to combine all the individual probability functions into an annual view has been demonstrated on pneumatic power production by a Backward Bent Duct Buoy (BBDB). These investigations have also resulted in a highly simplified and perfunctory model of installed cable cost as a function of voltage and conductor cross-section. This work solidifies the need to determine electrical export cable rating based on expected energy delivery as opposed to device rating as small decreases in energy delivery can result in cost savings.","","","Sandia National Lab.

"A Preliminary Investigation of the Effect of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Effluent Discharge Options on Global OTEC Resources","Nihous, Gérard","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC); OTEC Effluent Discharge; Global OTEC Resources","A simple algorithm previously used to evaluate steady-state global Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) resources is extended to probe the effect of various effluent discharge methodologies. It is found that separate evaporator and condenser discharges potentially increase OTEC net power limits by about 60% over a comparable mixed discharge scenario. This stems from a relatively less severe degradation of the thermal resource at given OTEC seawater flow rates, which corresponds to a smaller heat input into the ocean. Next, the most practical case of a mixed discharge into the mixed layer is found to correspond to only 80% of the so-called baseline case (mixed discharge at a water depth of initial neutral buoyancy). In general, locating effluent discharges at initial neutral-buoyancy depths appears to be nearly optimal in terms of OTEC net power production limits. The depth selected for the OTEC condenser effluent discharge, however, has by far the greatest impact. Clearly, these results are preliminary and should be investigated in more complex ocean general circulation models.","MDPI","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

Although many MRE developers are designing devices that will harvest energy to contribute to the electrical grid from waves, tides, and ocean currents, a number of other promising maritime markets could be supplied with MRE power at sea. These maritime markets are often less price sensitive, have fewer options than utility-scale electricity markets, and can handle some degree of intermittency. Some of the promising maritime markets that could benefit from co-located power generation include ocean observation nodes, underwater recharge of autonomous vehicles, desalination of seawater for remote coastal areas, offshore aquaculture, shoreline protection and electricity generation, providing electricity and freshwater following coastal emergencies, providing power to islanded and isolated communities, powering and cooling nearshore underwater data centers, recharging of electric surface vessels, and personal charging of electronics.

"An Evaluation of the Large-Scale Implementation of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) Using an Ocean General Circulation Model with Low-Complexity Atmospheric Feedback Effects","Jia, Yanli; Nihous, Gérard; Rajagopalan, Krishnakumar","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion; OTEC; ocean general circulation model","Previous investigations of the large-scale deployment of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversions (OTEC) systems are extended by allowing some atmospheric feedback in an ocean general circulation model. A modified ocean-atmosphere thermal boundary condition is used where relaxation corresponds to atmospheric longwave radiation to space, and an additional term expresses horizontal atmospheric transport. This produces lower steady-state OTEC power maxima (8 to 10.2 TW instead of 14.1 TW for global OTEC scenarios, and 7.2 to 9.3 TW instead of 11.9 TW for OTEC implementation within 100 km of coastlines). When power production peaks, power intensity remains practically unchanged, at 0.2 TW per Sverdrup of OTEC deep cold seawater, suggesting a similar degradation of the OTEC thermal resource. Large-scale environmental effects include surface cooling in low latitudes and warming elsewhere, with a net heat intake within the water column. These changes develop rapidly from the propagation of Kelvin and Rossby waves, and ocean current advection. Two deep circulation cells are generated in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific basins. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is reinforced while an AMOC-like feature appears in the North Pacific, with deep convective winter events at high latitudes. Transport between the Indo-Pacific and the Southern Ocean is strengthened, with impacts on the Atlantic via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).","MDPI","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2018-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Marine Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 6; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 12","","","FG36-08GO18180","Journal ID: ISSN 2077-1312","10.3390/jmse6010012","","2021-07-30T00:00:00Z","1507789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1507789","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1507789","Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","1","6"

The three modes are the heave, pitch, and surge. The dynamic model is characterized by a coupling between the pitch and surge modes, while the heave is decoupled. The heave, however, excites the pitch motion through nonlinear parametric excitation in the pitch mode. This paper uses Fourier series (FS) as basis functions to approximate the states and the control. A simplified model is first used where the parametric excitation term is neglected and a closed-form solution for the optimal control is developed. For the parametrically excited case, a sequential quadratic programming approach is implemented to solve for the optimal control numerically. Numerical results show that the harvested energy from three modes is greater than three times the harvested energy from the heave mode alone. Moreover, the harvested energy using a control that accounts for the parametric excitation is significantly higher than the energy harvested when neglecting this nonlinear parametric excitation term.","ASME","","Sandia National Lab.

"<i>Sniffle</i>: a step forward to measure <i>in situ</i> CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes with the floating chamber technique","Ribas-Ribas, Mariana; Kilcher, Levi F.; Wurl, Oliver","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; 47 OTHER INSTRUMENTATION; air-water CO2 flux; coastal area; ocean technology; gas transfer velocity; carbon cycle; Wadden Sea","Understanding how the ocean absorbs anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is critical for predicting climate change. We designed Sniffle, a new autonomous drifting buoy with a floating chamber, to measure gas transfer velocities and air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes with high spatiotemporal resolution. Currently, insufficient in situ data exist to verify gas transfer parameterizations at low wind speeds (<4 m s<sup>-1</sup>), which leads to underestimation of gas transfer velocities and, therefore, of air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. The Sniffle is equipped with a sensor to consecutively measure aqueous and atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub> and to monitor increases or decreases of CO<sub>2</sub> inside the chamber. During autonomous operation, a complete cycle lasts 40 minutes, with a new cycle initiated after flushing the chamber. The Sniffle can be deployed for up to 15 hours at wind speeds up to 10 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Floating chambers often overestimate fluxes because they create additional turbulence at the water surface. We correct fluxes by measuring turbulence with two acoustic Doppler velocimeters, one positioned directly under the floating chamber and the other positioned sideways, to compare artificial disturbance caused by the chamber and natural turbulence. The first results of deployment in the North Sea during the summer of 2016 demonstrate that the new drifting buoy is a useful tool that can improve our understanding of gas transfer velocity with in situ measurements. At low and moderate wind speeds and different conditions, the results obtained indicate that the observed tidal basin was acting as a source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Wind speed and turbulence alone could not fully explain the variance in gas transfer velocity. We suggest therefore, that other factors like surfactants, rain or tidal current will have an impact on gas transfer parameterizations.","University of California Press","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Causal control design for wave energy converters with finite stroke","Scruggs, J. T.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Wave energy; optimal control; stroke saturation; passivity","Control design is of central importance in the optimization of power generation from ocean wave energy converters (WECs). The problem is made challenging by the fact that the resource is vibratory and stochastic, with a low quality factor. It has recently been shown that when constrained to causality, the optimal feedback controller for a WEC is solvable in closed-form as a sign-indefinite LQG problem, for the case in which the WEC exhibits linear dynamics and quadratic power transmission dissipation. However, most WECs exhibit stroke limits, which must be explicitly accounted for in control design to avoid end-stop collisions. This is important because such collisions lead to damage, and also because the introduction of unmodeled stroke limits can actually destabilize the otherwise-optimal closed loop. We illustrate a control design technique to address this issue, which consists of two design steps. In the first step, LMI techniques are used to optimize the mean power harvested from waves with a known power spectral density, subject to several competing objectives. In the second step, the controller is augmented via a nonlinear passivity-based outer-loop design which guarantees to prevent stroke saturation while also guaranteeing to preserve closed-loop stability. Furthermore, the technique is illustrated using a model of a simple heaving point absorber, and verified in simulation.","Elsevier","","Re Vision Consulting, LLC, Sacramento, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Development of performance specifications for hybrid modeling of floating wind turbines in wave basin tests","Hall, Matthew; Goupee, Andrew; Jonkman, Jason","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; floating; wind turbine; real time; hybrid; model testing; wave basin","Hybrid modeling—combining physical testing and numerical simulation in real time$-$opens new opportunities in floating wind turbine research. Wave basin testing is an important validation step for floating support structure design, but the conventional approaches that use physical wind above the basin are limited by scaling problems in the aerodynamics. Applying wind turbine loads with an actuation system that is controlled by a simulation responding to the basin test in real time offers a way to avoid scaling problems and reduce cost barriers for floating wind turbine design validation in realistic coupled wind and wave conditions. This paper demonstrates the development of performance specifications for a system that couples a wave basin experiment with a wind turbine simulation. Two different points for the hybrid coupling are considered: the tower-base interface and the aero-rotor interface (the boundary between aerodynamics and the rotor structure). Analyzing simulations of three floating wind turbine designs across seven load cases reveals the motion and force requirements of the coupling system. By simulating errors in the hybrid coupling system, the sensitivity of the floating wind turbine response to coupling quality can be quantified. The sensitivity results can then be used to determine tolerances for motion tracking errors, force actuation errors, bandwidth limitations, and latency in the hybrid coupling system. These tolerances can guide the design of hybrid coupling systems to achieve desired levels of accuracy. An example demonstrates how the developed methods can be used to generate performance specifications for a system at 1:50 scale. Results show that sensitivities vary significantly between support structure designs and that coupling at the aero-rotor interface has less stringent requirements than those for coupling at the tower base. As a result, the methods and results presented here can inform design of future hybrid coupling systems and enhance understanding of how test results are affected by hybrid coupling quality.","Springer International Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Of these layouts, array placement that did not consider environmental constraints extracted the most energy from flow (4.38 MW-hr/day), 19% higher than output from the baseline configuration (3.69 MW-hr/day). Array placement that considered environmental constraints removed 4.27 MW-hr/day of energy (16% more than baseline). In conclusion, this analysis framework accounts for bathymetry and flow-pattern variations that typical experimental studies cannot, demonstrating that it is a valuable tool for identifying improved array layouts for field deployments.","Informa UK Limited","","Sandia National Lab.

"Model Predictive Control of parametric excited pitch-surge modes in wave energy converters","Zou, Shangyan; Abdelkhalik, Ossama; Robinett, III, Rush D.; Korde, Umesh A.; Bacelli, Giorgio; Wilson, David G.; Coe, Ryan","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Wave energy conversion; Parametric excited wave energy conversion; Pitch-surge control; Model Predictive Control","For a heave-pitch-surge three-degrees-of-freedom wave energy converter, the heave mode is usually decoupled from the pitch-surge modes for small motions. The pitch-surge modes are usually coupled and are parametrically excited by the heave mode, depending on the buoy geometry. In this paper, a Model Predictive Control is applied to the parametric excited pitch-surge motion, while the heave motion is optimized independently. The optimality conditions are derived, and a gradient-based numerical optimization algorithm is used to search for the optimal control. Numerical tests are conducted for regular and Bretschneider waves. The results demonstrate that the proposed control can be implemented to harvest more than three times the energy that can be harvested using a heave-only wave energy converter. As a result, the energy harvested using a parametrically excited model is higher than that is harvested when using a linear model.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"Power-to-load balancing for asymmetric heave wave energy converters with nonideal power take-off","Tom, Nathan M.; Madhi, Farshad; Yeung, Ronald W.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; asymmetric heave wave energy converter; power absorption control; structural load mitigation; nonideal PTO efficiency; Berkeley Wedge","The aim of this study is to maximize the power-to-load ratio for asymmetric heave wave energy converters. Linear hydrodynamic theory was used to calculate bounds of the expected time-averaged power (TAP) and corresponding surge-restraining force, pitch-restraining torque, and power take-off (PTO) control force with the assumption of sinusoidal displacement. This paper formulates an optimal control problem to handle an objective function with competing terms in an attempt to maximize power capture while minimizing structural and actuator loads in regular and irregular waves. Penalty weights are placed on the surge-restraining force, pitch-restraining torque, and PTO actuation force, thereby allowing the control focus to concentrate on either power absorption or load mitigation. The penalty weights are used to control peak structural and actuator loads that were found to curb the additional losses in power absorption associated with a nonideal PTO. Thus, in achieving these goals, a per-unit gain in TAP would not lead to a greater per-unit demand in structural strength, hence yielding a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio. Demonstrative results for 'The Berkeley Wedge' in the form of output TAP, reactive TAP needed to drive WEC motion, and the amplitudes of the surge-restraining force, pitch-restraining torque, and PTO control force are shown.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Balancing Power Absorption Against Structural Loads With Viscous Drag and Power-Takeoff Efficiency Considerations","Tom, Nathan; Yu, Yi -Hsiang; Wright, Alan; Lawson, Michael","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; oscillating surge wave energy converter; nonideal power take-off; linearized models; pseudo-spectral control; load shedding","The focus of this paper is to balance power absorption against structural loading for a novel fixed-bottom oscillating surge wave energy converter in both regular and irregular wave environments. The power-to-load ratio will be evaluated using pseudospectral control (PSC) to determine the optimum power-takeoff (PTO) torque based on a multiterm objective function. This paper extends the pseudospectral optimal control problem to not just maximize the time-averaged absorbed power but also include measures for the surge-foundation force and PTO torque in the optimization. The objective function may now potentially include three competing terms that the optimizer must balance. Separate weighting factors are attached to the surge-foundation force and PTO control torque that can be used to tune the optimizer performance to emphasize either power absorption or load shedding. To correct the pitch equation of motion, derived from linear hydrodynamic theory, a quadratic-viscous-drag torque has been included in the system dynamics; however, to continue the use of quadratic programming solvers, an iteratively obtained linearized drag coefficient was utilized that provided good accuracy in the predicted pitch motion. Furthermore, the analysis considers the use of a nonideal PTO unit to more accurately evaluate controller performance. The PTO efficiency is not directly included in the objective function but rather the weighting factors are utilized to limit the PTO torque amplitudes, thereby reducing the losses resulting from the bidirectional energy flow through a nonideal PTO. Furthermore, results from PSC show that shedding a portion of the available wave energy can lead to greater reductions in structural loads, peak-to-average power ratio, and reactive power requirement.","IEEE","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"A modeling study of tidal energy extraction and the associated impact on tidal circulation in a multi-inlet bay system of Puget Sound","Wang, Taiping; Yang, Zhaoqing","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; In-stream tidal energy; Modeling; Puget Sound; Agate Pass; Rich Passage; Tidal circulation","Previously, a major focus of tidal energy studies in Puget Sound were the deep channels such as Admiralty Inlet that have a larger power potential. Our paper focuses on the possibility of extracting tidal energy from minor tidal channels of Puget Sound by using a hydrodynamic model to quantify the power potential and the associated impact on tidal circulation. The study site is a multi-inlet bay system connected by two narrow inlets, Agate Pass and Rich Passage, to the Main Basin of Puget Sound. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was applied to the study site and validated for tidal elevations and currents. Here, we examined three energy extraction scenarios in which turbines were deployed in each of the two passages and concurrently in both. Extracted power rates and associated changes in tidal elevation, current, tidal flux, and residence time were examined. Maximum instantaneous power rates reached 250 kW, 1550 kW, and 1800 kW, respectively, for the three energy extraction scenarios. Model results suggest that with the level of energy extraction in the three energy extraction scenarios, the impact on tidal circulation is very small. It is worth investigating the feasibility of harnessing tidal energy from minor tidal channels of Puget Sound.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Benchmarking sensor fusion capabilities of an integrated instrumentation package","Cotter, Emma; Murphy, Paul; Polagye, Brian","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Environmental monitoring; Instrumentation; Target tracking; Target classification","Quantifying and mitigating environmental risks introduced by marine energy conversion systems requires a variety of sensors (active acoustic, passive acoustic, and optical). The operation of these sensors must satisfy three directives to be effective: (1) do not alter the environment through operation of sensors; (2) capture rare events; and (3) do not accrue unmanageable volumes of low-value data. This requires integrating sensors into a single package, rather than operating them independently. The Adaptable Monitoring Package is an integrated instrumentation package that combines a multibeam sonar, acoustic camera, current profiler, optical cameras, and an array of hydrophones. The capabilities and limitations of the AMP sensors were benchmarked using cooperative targets, and real-time target tracking and detection was used to detect opportunistic targets (e.g., diving birds, seals). During an initial deployment, automatic detection of opportunistic targets achieved a 58% true positive rate and a 99% true negative rate (100% corresponding to an ideal system in both cases). In post-processing, target tracking data were used to evaluate automatic target classification capabilities using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Findings suggest that real-time target classification should be possible and enable integrated instrumentation systems to meet the monitoring needs of marine energy deployments.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Effects of hydrokinetic turbine sound on the behavior of four species of fish within an experimental mesocosm","Schramm, Michael P.; Bevelhimer, Mark; Scherelis, Constantin","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; Hydrokinetic turbine; Underwater sound; Renewable energy; Fish behavior","The development of hydrokinetic energy technologies (e.g., tidal turbines) has raised concern over the potential impacts of underwater sound produced by hydrokinetic turbines on fish species likely to encounter these turbines. To assess the potential for behavioral impacts, we exposed four species of fish to varying intensities of recorded hydrokinetic turbine sound in a semi-natural environment. Although we tested freshwater species (redhorse suckers [Moxostoma spp], freshwater drum [Aplondinotus grunniens], largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides], and rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss]), these species are also representative of the hearing physiology and sensitivity of estuarine species that would be affected at tidal energy sites. Here, we evaluated changes in fish position relative to different intensities of turbine sound as well as trends in location over time with linear mixed-effects and generalized additive mixed models. We also evaluated changes in the proportion of near-source detections relative to sound intensity and exposure time with generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive models. Models indicated that redhorse suckers may respond to sustained turbine sound by increasing distance from the sound source. Freshwater drum models suggested a mixed response to turbine sound, and largemouth bass and rainbow trout models did not indicate any likely responses to turbine sound. Lastly, findings highlight the importance for future research to utilize accurate localization systems, different species, validated sound transmission distances, and to consider different types of behavioral responses to different turbine designs and to the cumulative sound of arrays of multiple turbines.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Also, a rule-based phase control strategy is applied to maximize energy extraction, making the system suitable for not only regular sinusoidal waves but also irregular waves. Simulations are carried out under regular sinusoidal wave and synthetically produced irregular wave conditions; performance validations are also presented with high-precision, real ocean wave surface elevation data. The influences of significant wave height, and peak period upon energy extraction of the system are studied.

We know very little about the effects of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices on fish, yet many fish species use tidal currents for movements. We used empirical data from stationary and mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine the probability that fish would be at the depth of an MHK device and may therefore encounter it. The probability was estimated using three components: 1) probability of fish being at device-depth when the device was absent; 2) probability of fish behavior changing to avoid the device in the far-field; and 3) probability of fish being at device-depth in the near-field when the device was present. Furthermore, there were differences in probabilities of fish encountering the MHK device based on month, diel condition and tidal stage. The maximum probability of fish encountering the whole device was 0.432 (95% CI: [0.305, 0.553]), and the probability of fish encountering only device foils was 0.058 (95% CI: [0.043, 0.073]). Mobile hydroacoustics indicated that fish likely avoided the device with horizontal movement beginning 140 m away. Finally, we estimated the encounter probability for one device, but results can be applied to arrays, which may have bay-wide implications.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Maine, Orono, ME (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","Ocean Renewable Power Company","United States","2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Renewable Energy; Journal Volume: 97; Journal Issue: C; Related Information: (c) 2016.

In response, a measurement technique has been developed to deploy an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) to mid-water locations on a compliant mooring. A variety of instrumentation platforms have been deployed as part of this work with a range of dynamic motion characteristics. The platforms discussed herein include the streamlined StableMoor™ buoy (SMB), the Tidal Turbulence Mooring (TTM) system based on a conventional 0.9 m spherical buoy, and a 100 lb sounding weight suspended from the stern of a research vessel. The ADV head motion is computed from inertial motion sensors integrated into an ADV, and the spectra of these signals are investigated to quantify the motion of each platform. The SMB with a single ADV head mounted on the nose provided the most stable platform for the measurement of tidal turbulence in the inertial sub-range for flow speeds exceeding 1:0 ms<sup>-1</sup>. The modification of the SMB with a transverse wing configuration for multiple ADVs showed a similar frequency response to the nose configuration in the horizontal plane but with large contamination in the vertical direction as a result of platform roll. While the ADV motion on the TTM was significant in the horizontal directions, the vertical motion of this configuration was the most stable of all configurations tested. The sounding weight measurements showed the greatest motion at the ADV head but are likely to be influenced by both prop-wash and vessel motion.","American Meteorological Society","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

E.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; 58 GEOSCIENCES; air‐sea interaction; air‐water gas transfer; wind waves; capillary waves; air‐water heat transfer","Forecast of the heat and chemical budgets of lakes, rivers, and oceans requires improved predictive understanding of air-water interfacial transfer coefficients. Here in this paper we present laboratory observations of the coherent motions that occupy the air-water interface at wind speeds (U<sub>10</sub>) 1.1–8.9 m/s. Spatiotemporal near-surface velocity data and interfacial renewal data are made available by a novel flow tracer method. The relative activity, velocity scales, and time scales of the various coherent interfacial motions are measured, namely for Langmuir circulations, streamwise streaks, nonbreaking wind waves, parasitic capillary waves, nonturbulent breaking wind waves, and turbulence-generating breaking wind waves. Breaking waves exhibit a sudden jump in streamwise interfacial velocity wherein the velocity jumps up to exceed the wave celerity and destroys nearby parasitic capillary waves. Four distinct hydrodynamic regimes are found to exist between U<sub>10</sub>=0 and 8.9 m/s, each with a unique population balance of the various coherent motions. The velocity scales, time scales, and population balance of the different coherent motions are input to a first-principles gas transfer model to explain the waterside transfer coefficient (k<sub>w</sub>) as well as experimental patterns of temperature and gas concentration. The model mixes concepts from surface renewal and divergence theories and requires surface divergence strength (β), the Lagrangian residence time inside the upwelling zone (t<sub>Lu</sub>), and the total lifetime of new interface before it is downwelled (t<sub>LT</sub>). The model’s output agrees with time-averaged measurements k<sub>w</sub>, patterns of temperature in infrared photographs, and spatial patterns of gas concentration and k<sub>w</sub> from direct numerical simulations. Finally, several nondimensional parameters, e.g. βt<sub>Lu</sub> and τ<sub>s</sub>t<sub>LT</sub> where ss is the interfacial shear rate, determine the effectiveness of a particular type of coherent motion for affecting k<sub>w</sub>.","American Geophysical Union","","Univ of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2016-10-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geophysical Research.

"Turbulence Measurements from Compliant Moorings. Part II: Motion Correction","Kilcher, Levi F.; Thomson, Jim; Harding, Samuel; Nylund, Sven","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; turbulence; acoustic measurements/effects; buoy observations; in situ oceanic observations; instrumentation/sensors; renewable energy","Acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) are a valuable tool for making high-precision measurements of turbulence, and moorings are a convenient and ubiquitous platform for making many kinds of measurements in the ocean. However, because of concerns that mooring motion can contaminate turbulence measurements and that acoustic Doppler profilers make middepth velocity measurements relatively easy, ADVs are not frequently deployed from moorings. This work demonstrates that inertial motion measurements can be used to reduce motion contamination from moored ADV velocity measurements. Three distinct mooring platforms were deployed in a tidal channel with inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs. In each case, motion correction based on the inertial measurements reduces mooring motion contamination of velocity measurements. The spectra from these measurements are consistent with other measurements in tidal channels and have an f<sup>–5/3</sup> slope at high frequencies - consistent with Kolmogorov's theory of isotropic turbulence. Motion correction also improves estimates of cross spectra and Reynolds stresses. A comparison of turbulence dissipation with flow speed and turbulence production indicates a bottom boundary layer production-dissipation balance during ebb and flood that is consistent with the strong tidal forcing at the site. Finally, these results indicate that inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs are a valuable new tool for making high-precision turbulence measurements from moorings.","American Meteorological Society","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Pseudo-spectral control of a novel oscillating surge wave energy converter in regular waves for power optimization including load reduction","Tom, Nathan M.; Yu, Yi -Hsiang; Wright, Alan D.; Lawson, Michael J.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; oscillating surge wave energy converter; variable structures; load shedding; convex optimization; nonlinear optimization; psuedo-spectral control","The aim of this study is to describe a procedure to maximize the power-to-load ratio of a novel wave energy converter (WEC) that combines an oscillating surge wave energy converter with variable structural components. The control of the power-take-off torque will be on a wave-to-wave timescale, whereas the structure will be controlled statically such that the geometry remains the same throughout the wave period. Linear hydrodynamic theory is used to calculate the upper and lower bounds for the time-averaged absorbed power and surge foundation loads while assuming that the WEC motion remains sinusoidal. Previous work using pseudo-spectral techniques to solve the optimal control problem focused solely on maximizing absorbed energy. This work extends the optimal control problem to include a measure of the surge foundation force in the optimization. The objective function includes two competing terms that force the optimizer to maximize power capture while minimizing structural loads. A penalty weight was included with the surge foundation force that allows control of the optimizer performance based on whether emphasis should be placed on power absorption or load shedding. Results from pseudo-spectral optimal control indicate that a unit reduction in time-averaged power can be accompanied by a greater reduction in surge-foundation force.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Numerical hindcasting from surface winds provides essential space-time information to complement buoy and satellite observations for studies of the marine environment. We utilize WAVEWATCH III and SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) in a nested grid system to model basin-wide processes as well as high-resolution wave conditions around the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013. The wind forcing includes the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) for the globe and downscaled regional winds from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Long-term in-situ buoy measurements and remotely-sensed wind speeds and wave heights allow thorough assessment of the modeling approach and data products for practical application. The high-resolution WRF winds, which include orographic and land-surface effects, are validated with QuickSCAT observations from 2000 to 2009. The wave hindcast reproduces the spatial patterns of swell and wind wave events detected by altimeters on multiple platforms between 1991 and 2009 as well as the seasonal variations recorded at 16 offshore and nearshore buoys around the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013. The hindcast captures heightened seas in interisland channels and around prominent headlands, but tends to overestimate the heights of approaching northwest swells and give lower estimates in sheltered areas. Finally, the validated high-resolution hindcast sets a baseline for future improvement of spectral wave models.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

D.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; oscillating surge wave energy converter; variable structures; structural load control; linearization","This paper presents an analysis of a novel wave energy converter concept that combines an oscillating surge wave energy converter (OSWEC) with control surfaces. The control surfaces allow for a variable device geometry that enables the hydrodynamic properties to be adapted with respect to structural loading, absorption range and power-take-off capability. The device geometry is adjusted on a sea state-to-sea state time scale and combined with wave-to-wave manipulation of the power take-off (PTO) to provide greater control over the capture efficiency, capacity factor, and design loads. This work begins with a sensitivity study of the hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to device width, support structure thickness, and geometry. A linear frequency domain analysis is used to evaluate device performance in terms of absorbed power, foundation loads, and PTO torque. Previous OSWEC studies included nonlinear hydrodynamics, in response a nonlinear model that includes a quadratic viscous damping torque that was linearized via the Lorentz linearization. Inclusion of the quadratic viscous torque led to construction of an optimization problem that incorporated motion and PTO constraints. Results from this study found that, when transitioning from moderate-to-large sea states the novel OSWEC was capable of reducing structural loads while providing a near constant power output.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Numerical modeling of the effects of wave energy converter characteristics on nearshore wave conditions","Chang, G.; Ruehl, K.; Jones, C. A.; Roberts, J.; Chartrand, C.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER","Modeled nearshore wave propagation was investigated downstream of simulated wave energy converters (WECs) to evaluate overall near- and far-field effects of WEC arrays. Model sensitivity to WEC characteristics and WEC array deployment scenarios was evaluated using a modified version of an industry standard wave model, Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN), which allows the incorporation of device-specific WEC characteristics to specify obstacle transmission. The sensitivity study illustrated that WEC device type and subsequently its size directly resulted in wave height variations in the lee of the WEC array. Wave heights decreased up to 30% between modeled scenarios with and without WECs for large arrays (100 devices) of relatively sizable devices (26 m in diameter) with peak power generation near to the modeled incident wave height. Other WEC types resulted in less than 15% differences in modeled wave height with and without WECs, with lesser influence for WECs less than 10 m in diameter. Wave directions and periods were largely insensitive to changes in parameters. Furthermore, additional model parameterization and analysis are required to fully explore the model sensitivity of peak wave period and mean wave direction to the varying of the parameters.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

Here, a parameterization based on Kunze et al. is examined, which estimates ..epsilon.. as the amount of energy contained in an unstable shear layer (Ri < Ric) that must be dissipated to increase the Richardson number Ri = N2/S2 to a critical value Ric within a turbulent decay time scale. Observations from the tidal Columbia River plume are used to quantitatively assess the relevant parameters controlling ..epsilon.. over a range of tidal and river discharge forcings. Observed ..epsilon.. is found to be characterized by Kunze et al.'s form within a factor of 2, while exhibiting slightly decreased skill near Ri = Ric. Observed dissipation rates are compared to estimates from a constant interfacial drag formulation that neglects the direct effects of stratification. This is found to be appropriate in energetic regimes when the bulk-averaged Richardson number Rib is less than Ric/4. However, when Rib > Ric/4, the effects of stratification must be included. Similarly, ..epsilon.. scaled by the bulk velocity and density differences over the plume displays a clear dependence on Rib, decreasing as Rib approaches Ric. The Kunze et al. ..epsilon.. parameterization is modified to form an expression for the nondimensional dissipation rate that is solely a function of Rib, displaying good agreement with the observations. It is suggested that this formulation is broadly applicable for unstable to marginally unstable stratified shear flows.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

This study demonstrates that a compressible point absorber, with a passive power-take-off (PTO) and optimized damping, can also achieve equal or better performance levels than an optimally controlled rigid point absorber (with the same shape and mass) using reactive power from the PTO. Wave energy is converted to mechanical energy in both cases using a linear damper PTO, with the PTO coefficient optimized for each resonance frequency and compressible volume. The large compressible volume required to tune the compressible point absorber to the desired frequency is a practical limitation that needs to be addressed with further research, especially for low frequencies. While realistic, these auxiliary units would increase the CapEx and OpEx costs, potentially reducing the aforementioned benefits gained by CDOF. However, alternative approaches can be developed to implement CDOF without the large compressible volume requirements, including the development of flexible surface panels tuned with mechanical springs.","Sandia","","Sandia National Lab.

We built a pressure cell capable of measuring in situ electrical properties of multicomponent systems such that the effects of individual components and mixing relations can be assessed. We first established the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity (σ) of pure, single-phase methane hydrate to be ~5 orders of magnitude lower than seawater, a substantial contrast that can help differentiate hydrate deposits from significantly more conductive water-saturated sediments in EM field surveys. We report σ measurements of two-component systems in which methane hydrate is mixed with variable amounts of quartz sand or glass beads. Sand by itself has low σ but is found to increase the overall σ of mixtures with well-connected methane hydrate. Alternatively, the overall σ decreases when sand concentrations are high enough to cause gas hydrate to be poorly connected, indicating that hydrate grains provide the primary conduction path. Our measurements suggest that impurities from sand induce chemical interactions and/or doping effects that result in higher electrical conductivity with lower temperature dependence. Finally, these results can be used in the modeling of massive or two-phase gas-hydrate-bearing systems devoid of conductive pore water. Further experiments that include a free water phase are the necessary next steps toward developing complex models relevant to most natural systems.","American Geophysical Union","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

These variables were derived from two-months of acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) measurements at the design hub height of the Verdant Power Gen5 hydrokinetic turbine. The study site is a tidal strait that exhibits semi-diurnal tidal current characteristics, with a mean horizontal current speed of 1.4 m s<sup>-1</sup>, and turbulence intensity of 15% at a reference mean current of 2 m s<sup>-1</sup>. Flood and ebb flow directions are nearly bi-directional, with higher current magnitude during flood tide, which skews the power production towards the flood tide period. The tidal hydrodynamics at the site are highly regular, as indicated by the tidal current time series that resembles a sinusoidal function. This study also shows that the theoretical force and power densities derived from the current measurements can significantly be influenced by the length of the time window used for averaging the current data. Furthermore, the theoretical power density at the site, derived from the current measurements, is one order of magnitude greater than that reported in the U.S. national resource assessment. As a result, this discrepancy highlights the importance of conducting site resource assessments based on measurements at the tidal energy converter device scale.","Elsevier","","Sandia National Lab.

"The method of imbedded Lagrangian element to estimate wave power absorption by some submerged devices","Nihous, Gérard C.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Hydrodynamics; wave power absorption; wave energy conversion; power take-off (PTO); Lagrangian element (LE); hydrodynamic coefficients","A simple approach is described to estimate the wave power absorption potential of submerged devices known to cause wave focusing and flow enhancement. In particular, the presence of a flow-through power take-off (PTO) system, such as low-head turbines, can be accounted for. The wave radiation characteristics of an appropriately selected Lagrangian element (LE) in the fluid domain are first determined. In the limit of a vanishing mass, the LE reduces to a patch of distributed normal dipoles. Here, the hydrodynamic coefficients of this virtual object are then input in a standard equation of motion where the effect of the PTO can be represented, for example, as a dashpot damping term. The process is illustrated for a class of devices recently proposed by Carter and Ertekin (2011), although in a simplified form. Favorable wave power absorption is shown for large ratios of the LE wave radiation coefficient over the LE added mass coefficient. Under optimal conditions, the relative flow reduction from the PTO theoretically lies between 0.50 and 1/√2≈ 0.71, with lower values corresponding to better configurations. Wave power capture widths, the sensitivity of results to PTO damping and sample spectral calculations at a typical site in Hawaiian waters are proposed to further illustrate the versatility of the method.","Springer Nature","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

The method falls into the general category of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian methods; it is based on a fixed mesh that is locally adapted in the immediate vicinity of the moving interfaces and reverts to its original shape once the moving interfaces go past the elements. The moving interfaces are defined by separate sets of marker points so that the global mesh is independent of interface movement and the possibility of mesh entanglement is eliminated. The results is a fully robust formulation capable of calculating on domains of complex geometry with moving boundaries or devises that can also have a complex geometry without danger of the mesh becoming unsuitable due to its continuous deformation thus eliminating the need for repeated re-meshing and interpolation. Moreover, the boundary conditions on the interfaces are imposed exactly. This work is intended to support the internal combustion engines simulator KIVA developed at Los Alamos National Laboratories. The model's capabilities are illustrated through application to incompressible flows in different geometrical settings that show the robustness and flexibility of the technique to perform simulations involving moving boundaries in a three-dimensional domain.","","","Los Alamos National Lab.

"Maximum wave power absorption by slender bodies of arbitrary cross sections in oblique seas","Nihous, G. C.","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; Wave power absorption; Slender body theory; Kochin function; Attenuators; Terminators","Published results for the maximum wave power absorption by slender bodies subjected to vertical defor-mations are extended. To this end, a more general form of the Kochin function is derived for floating or submerged slender bodies of arbitrary (asymmetric) cross sections undergoing vertical or horizontal deformations. The Kochin function allows a determination of the theoretical maximum wave power absorption in oblique seas. It is shown that in beam seas, two-dimensional limits can be recovered when the slender body length tends to infinity. This establishes a formal continuity in behavior from atten-uators (head seas) to terminators (beam seas). The wavelike vertical and horizontal deformations of a flexible body, as well as the hinge motions of an articulated raft are also considered in oblique seas. In the former case, results suggest an equivalence between the maximum absorption width of bodies with symmetric cross sections and two degrees of freedom, and that of bodies with optimal cross sections and one degree of freedom. Altogether, the potential for significant wave power absorption from horizontal motions is also demonstrated.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

While the developers have performed verification and validation, there is little information on their relative performance in particular related to their use in ocean modeling. This study focuses on the intercomparison of wind and wave reanalysis datasets from ERA-I and CFSR utilizing the same set of altimetry and buoy observations and error metrics to assess their consistency in time and space. Both products have good spatial homogeneity with consistent levels of errors in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. ERA-I proves to be homogenous through time, while CFSR exhibits an abrupt decrease in the level of errors in the Southern Ocean beginning 1994. ERA-I generally underestimates the wind speed and wave height with lower standard deviations in comparison to observations, but maintains slightly better error metrics. Despite having a slightly positive bias, CFSR provides a better description of the variability of the observations and improved performance in the upper percentiles associated with extreme events. Altogether ERA-I has better homogeneity through time deeming it more reliable for modeling of long-term processes; however caution must be applied with analysis of the upper percentiles.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

First, a horizontally-periodic precursor simulation is performed to create turbulent flow data. Then that data is used as inflow into a tidal turbine array two rows deep and infinitely wide. The turbines are modeled using rotating actuator lines, and the finite-volume method is used to solvethe governing equations. In studying the wakes created by the turbines, we observed that the vertical shear of the inflow combined with wake rotation causes lateral wake asymmetry. Also, various turbine configurations are simulated, and the total power production relative to isolated turbines is examined. Staggering consecutive rows of turbines in the simulated configurations allows the greatestefficiency using the least downstream row spacing. Counter-rotating consecutive downstream turbines in a non-staggered array shows a small benefit. This work has identified areas for improvement, such as the use of a larger precursor domain to better capture elongated turbulent structures, the inclusion of salinity and temperature equations to account for density stratification and its effect onturbulence, improved wall shear stress modelling, and the examination of more array configurations.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

It is located near shipping lanes, is a highly variable acoustic environment, and is frequented by the endangered southern resident killer whale (SRKW). Resolving environmental impacts is the first step to receiving approval to deploy tidal turbines. Several monitoring technologies are being considered to determine the presence of SRKW near the turbines. Broadband noise level measurements are critical for determining design and operational specifications of these technologies. Acoustic environment data at the proposed site was acquired at different depths using a cabled vertical line array from three different cruises during high tidal period in February, May, and June 2011. The ambient noise level decreases approximately 25 dB re 1 μPa per octave from frequency ranges of 1 kHz to 70 kHz, and increases approximately 20 dB re 1 μPa per octave for the frequency from 70 kHz to 200 kHz. The difference of noise pressure levels in different months varies from 10 to 30 dB re 1 μPa for the frequency range below 70 kHz. Commercial shipping and ferry vessel traffic were found to be the most significant contributors to sound pressure levels for the frequency range from 100 Hz to 70 kHz, and the variation could be as high as 30 dB re 1 μPa.

An active monitoring system is being proposed for killer whale detection, tracking, and alerting that links to and triggers temporary turbine shutdown when there is risk of collision. Target strength (TS) modeling of the killer whale is critical to the design and application of any active monitoring system. A 1996 study performed a high-resolution measurement of acoustic reflectivity as a function of frequency of a female bottlenose dolphin (2.2 m length) at broadside aspect and TS as a function of incident angle at 67 kHz frequency. Assuming that killer whales share similar morphology structure with the bottlenose dolphin, we extrapolated the TS of an adult killer whale 7.5 m in length at 67 kHz frequency with -8 dB at broadside aspect and -28 dB at tail side. The backscattering data from three Southern Resident killer whales were analyzed to obtain the TS measurement. These data were collected at Lime Kiln State Park using a split-beam system deployed from a boat. The TS of the killer whale at higher frequency (200 kHz) was estimated based on a three-layer model for plane wave reflection from the lung of the whale. The TS data of killer whales were in good agreement with our model. In this paper, we also discuss and explain possible causes for measurement estimation error.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The alternative method demonstrated here is general enough for most cable configurations (slack or taut) and ranges of cable elasticity. The forces acting on the cable are attributable to elasticity, weight, buoyancy, and hydrodynamics.

While there is now a growing body of data on the ecological impacts of offshore wind farms, the scientific basis on which to make informed decisions about the environmental effects of other offshore energy developments is lacking. Tidal barrages have the potential to cause significant ecological impacts particularly on bird feeding areas when they are constructed at coastal estuaries or bays. Offshore tidal stream energy and wave energy collectors offer the scope for developments at varying scales. They also have the potential to alter habitats.

This paper starts by discussing the RF heating efficiency theoretically expected in such plasmas, covering both relevant aspects of wave and of particle dynamics. Then it gives a concise summary of the main conclusions drawn from recent experiments that were either focusing on studying RF heating physics aspects or that were adopting RF heating as a tool to study plasma behavior. Depending on the minority concentration chosen, different physical phenomena are observed. At very low concentration (X[3He] < 1%), energetic tails are formed which trigger MHD activity and result in loss of fast particles. Alfv n cascades were observed and gamma ray tomography indirectly shows the impact of sawtooth crashes on the fast particle orbits. Low concentration (X[3He] < 10%) favors minority heating while for X[3He] 10% electron mode conversion damping becomes dominant. Evidence for the Fuchs et al standing wave effect (Fuchs et al 1995 Phys. Plasmas 2 1637 47) on the absorption is presented. RF induced deuterium tails were observed in mode conversion experiments with large X[3He] (18%). As tentative modeling shows, the formation of these tails can be explained as a consequence of wave power absorption by neutral beam particles that efficiently interact with the waves well away from the cold D cyclotron resonance position as a result of their substantial Doppler shift. As both ion and electron RF power deposition profiles in (3He) D plasmas are fairly narrow giving rise to localized heat sources the RF heating method is an ideal tool for performing transport studies. Various of the experiments discussed here were done in plasmas with internal transport barriers (ITBs). ITBs are identified as regions with locally reduced diffusivity, where poloidal spinning up of the plasma is observed. The present know-how on the role of RF heating for impurity transport is also briefly summarized.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Since ready access to the ocean is likely an essential requirement for AWL, it is shown that significant limestone resources are relatively close to a majority of CO{sub 2}-emitting power plants along the coastal US. Furthermore, waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (&gt;10{sup 9} tonnes/yr), could be used in many instances as an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate. With limestone transportation to coastal sites then as the dominant cost variable, CO{sub 2} sequestration (plus capture) costs of $3-$4/tonne are achievable in certain locations. While there is vastly more limestone and water on earth than that required for AWL to capture and sequester all fossil fuel CO{sub 2} production, the transportation cost of bringing limestone, seawater, and waste CO{sub 2} into contact likely limits the method's applicability to perhaps 10-20% of US point-source emissions. Using a bench-scale laboratory reactor, it is shown that CO{sub 2} sequestration rates of 10{sup -6} to 10{sup -5} moles/sec per m{sup 2} of limestone surface area are readily achievable using seawater. This translates into reaction densities as high as 2 x 10{sup -2} tonnes CO{sub 2} m{sup -3}day{sup -1}, highly dependent on limestone particle size, solution turbulence and flow, and CO{sub 2} concentration. Modeling of AWL end-solution disposal in the ocean shows significantly reduced effects on ocean pH and carbonate chemistry relative to those caused by direct CO{sub 2} disposal into the atmosphere or ocean. In fact the increase in ocean Ca{sup 2+} and bicarbonate offered by AWL should significantly enhance the growth of corals and other marine calcifiers whose health is currently being threatened by anthropogenic CO{sub 2} invasion and pH reduction in the ocean.","","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

In this paper, we investigate whether high-harmonic ion cyclotron damping could be responsible for the low FWCD efficiency in these experiments, since a number of high-harmonic hydrogen and deuterium cyclotron resonance layers existed in the plasma. The main analysis tool is the ICRF code PION [Eriksson, Hellsten and Willen, Nucl. Fusion 33, 1037 (1993)], modified to allow multiple frequencies simultaneously as was done in the DIII-D experiments. According to the PION modeling, high harmonic damping of fast wave power can give rise to enhanced fusion reactivity and fast ion energy content, which is consistent with the experimental observations.","","Oakland Operations Office, Oakland, CA (US); INIS","General Atomics, San Diego, CA (United States)","USDOE National Nuclear Security Administration (US)","","United States","2001-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: PHYSICS OF PLASMAS; Other Information: Submitted to PHYSICS OF PLASMAS; PBD: 1 Aug 2001","","Medium: X; Size: 26 pages","","","AC03-99ER54463","TRN: US0302706","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","804410","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/804410","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/804410","PHYSICS OF PLASMAS","",""

The roof of the chamber will open onto a ducted Wells air turbine, which will be driven by the oscillatory airflow developed by the forcing action of the surface of the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) inside the chamber. The design of such an OWC conversion plant is considered with particular reference to the air turbine stage and its synthesis into the system. Consequently, a semiempirical method for predicting the performance of the contrarotating Wells turbine configuration is presented, notably, detailing aerofoil performance into the stall region. The predicted turbine performance is subsequently utilized to facilitate the design of a 310 kW plant, including efficient accommodation of the pneumatic power levels for maximal aerodynamic conversion.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 35-53","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9827%%411","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1998)124:2(35)","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","653517","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/653517","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","124"

Several models have been routinely producing good quality wave estimates globally since the mid-1980s. The verifications of wind-wave models have mainly focused on the evaluation of the error of the significant wave height H{sub s} estimates. However, for wave energy purposes, the main parameters to be assessed are the wave power P{sub w} and the mean (energy) period T{sub e}. Since P{sub w} is proportional to H{sub s}{sup 2}T{sub e}, its expected error is much larger than for the single-wave parameters. This paper summarizes the intercomparison of two wind-wave models against buoy data in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea to select the most suitable one for the construction of an Atlas of the wave energy resource in European waters. A full verification in the two basins of the selected model--the WAM model, implemented in the routine operation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts--was then performed against buoy and satellite altimeter data. It was found that the WAM model accuracy is very good for offshore locations in the North Atlantic; but for the Mediterranean Sea the results are much less accurate, probably due to a lower quality of the input wind fields.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering; Journal Volume: 119; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 15. international symposium and exhibit on offshore mechanics and arctic engineering, June 16--20, 1996, Florence (IT); PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 184-190","","","","Journal ID: JMOEEX; ISSN 0892-7219; TRN: IM9745%%265","10.1115/1.2829066","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","536426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/536426","","Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering","3","119"

Performance of the pump is optimized by means of a variable volume air compression chamber (patents pending) which tunes the system to the incoming wave frequency. Wave tank experiments with an instrumented, 1:20-scale model of the pump are described.

Double-effect generation could be achieved with an axial-flow turbine that reverses direction after each half of the tidal cycle. Such a system might be attractive for unmanned operation in remote areas, perhaps on a smaller scale than for conventional barrage systems. Predictions have been made about the energy obtainable from such a system, and the conditions necessary to maximize energy capture have been determined. A mathematical model of a high specific speed turbine, incorporated into the prediction procedures, allowed the behavior of the system under varying tidal range (and hence varying head) to be examined. Differential heads across the turbine are somewhat less than those achievable with a gated barrage, and performance is correspondingly affected in very small tidal ranges. Variable-speed turbine operation was found to be beneficial in these circumstances. Overall levels of predicted output were very encouraging and compare surprisingly well with conventional barrage schemes. The concept would seem to merit further investigation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 123; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 11-19","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9726%%226","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1997)123:1(11)","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","483833","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/483833","","Journal of Energy Engineering","1","123"

We take into account the departure from an endoreversible regime through a parameter arising from the Clausius inequality. We use this approach for the Gordon{endash}Zarmi maximum power criterion with two possible cold reservoirs: the 3 K surrounding universe and the 200 K isothermal tropopause shell. Our numerical results for the average extreme temperatures of the earth{close_quote}s atmosphere and for the annual average energy of the earth{close_quote}s winds are reasonable. We also use an ecological optimization criterion for the Gordon{endash}Zarmi model. This criterion consists of an austere compromise between power and entropy production.

"Optimum control of a floating wave-energy converter with restricted amplitude","Eidsmoen, H","16 TIDAL AND WAVE POWER; WATER WAVES; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS; WAVE FORCES; DESIGN; WAVE POWER","In this paper, the use of optimal control techniques for improving the energy absorption by a wave-energy converter (WEC) is investigated. A mathematical model is developed for a floating body, which is exposed to an irregular incident wave, and is moving relative to a fixed reference. This model includes a control force from the power take-off and control machinery, and a friction force which restricts the oscillation amplitude. This force models end-stop devices, which are necessary to protect the machinery. An optimal control strategy is determined, based on variations of a Lagrange functional. This gives a set of adjoint equations in addition to the state equations, as a necessary condition for optimum. An algorithm is given for solving the problem numerically by iteration, based on a gradient method. It is shown that the optimal motion in a sinusoidal wave is not sinusoidal when the excursion is constrained. Instead, the motion should be stopped in certain intervals. In irregular waves the constrained solution is close to the unconstrained solution when the excursion is small. Moreover, the timings of the extrema and of the zero crossings agree fairly well. When the excursion is constrained, the mean output power is reduced compared to the unconstrained case, but the ratio between the output energy and the total energy passing through the machinery is increased. This means that the conversion efficiency of the machinery is less critical.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: International conference on offshore mechanics and arctic engineering, Copenhagen (Denmark), 18-22 Jun 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 96-102","","CONF-950695-","","Journal ID: JMOEEX; ISSN 0892-7219; TRN: IM9637%%39","10.1115/1.2828829","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","277530","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/277530","","Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering","2","118"

The oscillatory system of the wave energy converter is therefore designed for a comparatively narrow frequency range in a rather broad spectrum of swells. The force relation between the float and medium forces us to use iteration methods of calculation, as a result of which we can link the properties of the actual medium with the characteristic design features of the converters in an optimal manner. Searches for the solution of this problem are being conducted on the basis of analysis and investigation of the law governing the oscillations of an installation floating on the water surface of the swell. This paper analyzes the oscillatory phenomena of waves and enables developers of wave power plants to analyze rather simply the operating conditions and calculate the basic parameters of the elements of the oscillatory systems with allowance for the given energy spectrum of the waves.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 6, 22-25(Jun 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 337-342","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:001897-0006","10.1007/BF02447851","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","223646","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223646","","Hydrotechnical Construction","6","29"

It was found that the specifics of these projects required significant capital expenditures and construction times of 7-10 years. These economic factors have rendered this option unattractive. This article examines the current viability of such projects and concludes that their ecological advantages bring about a significant cost savings and that these savings make tidal power projects economically attractive.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 6, 25-28(Jun 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 343-346","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:001897-0007","10.1007/BF02447852","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","223647","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223647","","Hydrotechnical Construction","6","29"

The authors have developed two-dimensional mathematical models of dynamic equilibrium of various hydroengineering and coastal constructions with weak thin sections of natural or artificial origin (low-strength inclusions, cracks, technological seams), where shearing strength conditions must be considered. These models are applicable to objects whose dynamic characteristics can be fully described by considering their profile cross-sections (dams, coastal slopes, wave breakers). The weak thin sections are modeled by cuts with appropriate contact conditions. Finite-element algorithms have been developed for solving the corresponding initial-boundary-value problems, and a model example has been solved.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Cybernetics and Systems Analysis; Journal Volume: 31; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995; TN: Translated from Kibernetika i Sistemnyi Analiz; No. 2, 124-130(Mar-Apr 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 261-267","","","","Journal ID: CYASEC; ISSN 1060-0396; TRN: 95:008714-0001","10.1007/BF02366926","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","146816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/146816","","Cybernetics and Systems Analysis","2","31"

The project is based in part on new generator designs and emerging materials technologies. Its successful completion would demonstrate the technology and produce prototype turbines that can be mass produced and sold with service support. Past research and experimentation indicates that energy can be generated from the Gulf Stream. Problems exist such as fluctuations in the current`s axis and inconsistency. Above all, the ocean is a difficult environment in which to work. Therefore, the question is not whether or not a generator can be put in the ocean to generate electricity, but rather can it be done in an economically and environmentally sound way and still be practical?","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sea Technology; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-14","","","","Journal ID: SEATAD; ISSN 0093-3651; TRN: 95:006861-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","121741","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/121741","","Sea Technology","9","36"

Tidal power is an environmentally benign means of producing electricity, particularly during off-peak demand. A number of tidal power schemes have been evaluated. These include Cumberland (1.4 Gigawatts (GW)), Cobequid (4.4 GW) in Canada; Sevrn (8.6 GW), Mersey (0.7 GW), Wyre (0.06 GW) and Conwy (0.03 GW) in Great Britain; Tugur (6.8 GW) in Russia and Garolim (0.5 GW) in South Korea. These schemes ar opening up future prospects for very large scale opportunities which could have global importance, for example, the transmission of 24 GW of electricity from tidal power plants in Great Britain to Europe. Another example is the potential transmission of 87 GW from Penzhinsh tidal power plant in Russia.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: Winter meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, New York, NY (United States), 29 Jan - 2 Feb 1995; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 591-599","","CONF-950103-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: 96:005760","10.1109/60.464887","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","147938","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/147938","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","10"

By the 1980s, however, lack of a commercial breakthrough to justify government investment put wave energy firmly on a downward spiral to its nadir around 1990. The stimulant for the latest revival is general concern for the environment, or more particularly the effects on it by most other forms of power generation.

Shelving, funneling, reflection, and resonance phenomena that have a significant effect on tidal range are also discussed. The paper then examines tidal energy resource for principal developments estimated from parametric modeling in Europe and worldwide. Basic parameters that govern the design of tidal power schemes in terms of mean tidal range and surface area of the enclosed basin are identified. While energy extracted is proportional to the tidal amplitude squared, requisite sluicing are is proportional to the square root of the tidal amplitude. Sites with large tidal amplitudes are therefore best suited for tidal power developments, whereas sites with low tidal amplitudes have sluicing that may be prohibitive. It is shown that 48% of the European tidal resource is in the United Kingdom, 42% in France and 8% in Ireland, other countries having negligible potential. Worldwide tidal resource is identified. Tidal barrage design and construction using caissons is examined, as are alternative operating modes (single-action generation, outflow generation, flood generation, two-way generation, twin basin generation, pumping, etc), development trends and possibilities, generation cost at the barrage boundary, sensitivity to discount rates, general economics, and markets.

The energy required to propel the system is a parasitic energy of the wave energy conversion subsystem. The analysis includes a feedback between the internal water motions and the floating body dynamics. The performance of the BBDB operating in a design (head) sea is shown to be far superior to both a BBDB in a following sea and a fixed BBDB in a following sea. For this comparison, a 35.6-m long system having a 9.91-m beam and displacing 500 metric tons is studied.

However, it has been conjectured that this theory is incapable of explaining why, under certain conditions, the image contrast of airborne SAR imagery of ocean waves can be enhanced by defocusing the SAR processor. It this were true it would raise serious doubts about the validity of the velocity bunching theory to describe the SAR imaging of ocean waves. In this paper the velocity bunching theory is defended. It is shown that image contrast enhancement by defocusing can also be obtained by this theory, which does not require the introduction of the phase or group velocity of the long ocean waves as a basic element of the SAR imaging theory.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 29:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 120-128","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0196-2892; CODEN: IGRSD","10.1109/36.103301","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5908086","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5908086","","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","29:1"

There is an inherent 180{degrees} ambiguity in the derived wave propagation direction when using conventional spectral analysis techniques on standard synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image products. Three different techniques are successfully used to resolve this ambiguity in propagation direction using a single pass of airborne SAR data. The fact that the SAR is characterized by a large time-bandwidth product is used to advantage. Therefore, a sequence of individual looks extracted from the Doppler spectrum represents images of the scene collected at a sequence of discretely delayed intervals of time. The techniques utilized include cross-correlation-based motion analysis of a pair of looks, phase weighting based upon a pair of looks and the ocean wave dispersion relation, and a three-dimensional spectral analysis. The phase weighting technique is also demonstrated for a SEASAT SAR scene.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 29:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 105-112","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0196-2892; CODEN: IGRSD","10.1109/36.103299","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6083226","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6083226","","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","29:1"

The slight modification is related to the landward boundary condition required for the transmitted wave propagating landward. In addition to the conservation equations of mass and momentum used to compute the flow field, an equation of energy is derived to estimate the rate of energy dissipation due to wave breaking. The computed reflection and transmission coefficients are shown to be in agreement with available small-scale test data. The numerical model also predicts the spatial variation of the energy dissipation, the mean water level difference, and the time-averaged volume flux per unit width, although available measurements are not sufficient for evaluating the capabilities and limitations of the numerical model for predicting these quantities.","","","","","","United States","1989-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Waterway Port Coastal and Ocean Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 662-680","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: JWPED","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1989)115:5(662)","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6658906","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6658906","","Journal of Waterway Port Coastal and Ocean Engineering; (USA)","","115:5"

The implications of these results are discussed and contrasted with a number of similar results stated in previous studies. Certain discrepancies and points of concern encountered are clarified. The two leading terms to the envelope spectral density are then examined in detail and compared with simulated data typical of wide- and narrow-banded waves. It is found that the sum of these two leading terms would represent the envelope spectral density with sufficient accuracy for most purposes. As an alternative to the relatively complex analytical forms implied by envelope-related spectra, the possibility of constructing more practical approximations is considered.","","","","","","United States","1989-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Waterway Port Coastal and Ocean Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 515-533","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: JWPED","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1989)115:4(515)","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6886612","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6886612","","Journal of Waterway Port Coastal and Ocean Engineering; (USA)","","115:4"

The primary data consisted of seven years of measurements at Tromsoflaket (71{degrees}30'N, 19{degrees}E, 230 m depth), including 38 storms with peak significant wave heights above 7 m. The maximum wave height and maximum current occurred simultaneously in only one of the 38 storms. The wave and current time-series data were used to calculate the time series of drag load on a simple structure and statistics of wave height and drag load were developed. The data showed that the in-line current that must be added to extreme waves in order to preserve the extreme loads approaches 25 cm/s asymptotically as storm severity increases. Sensitivity studies suggest that this limit is largely insensitive to reasonable variations in current profile, wave kinematics theory, structure geometry, tidal current removal, length of data base, or site location.

In pneumatic wave energy conversion, internal water motions are excited by the external water wave. Depending on the volume of water in the capture chamber, resonance with the external wave may occur. That is, the natural frequency of the rising and falling internal water column may equal or be close to the frequency of the external wave. When this resonance phenomenon occurs large motions of the water column also occur. The amplitudes of these motions can be several times that of the alternately inhaling and exhausting air above the water through the turbine.

A linear array of such platforms along a coastline, with the power transmitted ashore by submarine cable, constitutes the type of wave energy powerplant discussed herein. The OWC concept utilizes the energy in a wave field to cause the sea, trapped within a cavity in a fixed or floating housing, to oscillate vertically within the cavity, thereby alternately pushing and pulling the air in the cavity through a turbine mounted at an opening in the cavity, thus converting wave energy to usable power. The design, maintenance, and economic aspects of the wave energy powerplant described in the foregoing are discussed for siting around England and Scotland. Gravity, piled, and caisson platform designs are considered in light of current offshore petroleum industry practices and capabilities. Wave energy researchers have made little effort to use proven offshore fixed structure technology, developed by the offshore petroleum industry, in studying ways to house a wave energy conversion device. Such a combination was suggested by McCormick in 1974 and is the subject of this study.","","","McDermott Incorporated, New Orleans, LA","","","United States","1983-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

These equations are quite general and allow for the specification of device specific information, such as, the wave capture/conversion efficiency and vertical projected capture height. Previously published field data is used to emphasize that the wave power resource at a particular offshore site can be quite variable and may not provide adequate energy for continuous power generations. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the sensitivity of wave power estimates for a hypothetical wave energy device. The first example shows that as the seastate at a particular offshore site increases, the useful power generated by a wave energy convertor does not necessarily increase. The second numerical example indicates the importance of the vertical capture height for both design and feasibility studies.","","","Dept. of Ocean Engr., Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI","","","United States","1983-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

In addition to the general dimensions determining the size of the tidal pond resource (surface area and tidal range) two site-specific dimensions (depth and length of closure structure) are required for this estimate. Dimensionless parameters and variables describing the power plant performance are used in the cost analysis to specify the relative sizes of the power plant components (turbine-generator, power house, sluice gates, cofferdam, and barrage). The generic cost estimates are compared with those used in several site-specific studies. Unit total capital cost (cost per unit of average power produced) is calculated as a function of the size of the tidal pond resource, the latter being measured in terms of the ideal tidal pond power. A range of closure depths and lengths was used in these generic cost estimates. The minimum unit capital cost is shown to depend upon the size of the tidal pond as well as the site-specific dimensions. An optimum turbogenerator size can be determined to minimize the capital cost.","","","Massachusetts Inst of Technology, Cambridge, MA","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The dynamical behavior of such systems is calculated in terms of dimensionless variables and parameters so that the size of the system is inconsequential (except for one parameter related to the slope of the walls of the tidal basin). Two measures of system performance are defined: capacity factor (ratio of average to rated power) and effectiveness (ratio of average to ideal tidal power). It was found that improving both parameters is mutually incompatible so that an economic analysis will determine the optimum values of the system design and performance parameters. The effects of variation of tidal range and basin shape were determined. Using typical variable flow properties of low-head hydroturbines, a favorable design head could be determined from the analysis. It was found that the change in the area of the intertidal zone relative to the surface area of the tidal pond is greater for small, as compared to large, systems, possibly leading to proportionately greater environmental effects. A comparison of the performance of several tidal power plant designs with the methodology of this paper showed generally good agreement with the dimensionless performance parameters and only a modest difference among them over several orders of magnitude in size of power plant.","","","Massachusetts Inst. of Technology, Cambridge, MA","","","United States","1983-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The situation relates to the operation of an ocean thermal energy conversion plant and is an example of buoyancy and confinement offering opposing influences on jet trajectory. For shallow submergence, the jet is attached to the free surface while for large submergence or greater (negative) buoyancy, the jet is detached. An experimental program yielded data on jet trajectory, temperature, velocity and discharge conditions associated with transition between attached and detached regimes. A hysteresis effect was noted as the conditions for attachment and detachment were different. Dimensional analysis yielded a single parameter of primary importance and two parameters of secondary importance in describing jet behavior.

Large scale plants, back to the Cobscook Bay plant, have never been economical. ''Windmills'' set in the tidal stream are one alternative. The units could be located in deep water, spaced so as not to interfere with navigation, and fish migration. As the energy in a fluid is proportional to the fluid density, the power in slow moving tidal currents is still ten times more concentrated than in wind. The costs of tidal and wind turbines are equal. And such a technology would be much more compatible to the lifestyle of the Gulf of Maine than the proposed huge projects using dams.","","","M.I.T.","","","United States","1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Technol.

Converters have a variety of effects on the hydraulic environment, most noticeably by modifying the local wave climate. A decrease in incident wave energy influences shores and shallow subtidal areas and results in changes in the density and species of organisms they support. Extensive shell-sand beaches occur along the west coast of the Uists but although wave activity and wave steepness would be reduced, accretion on these beaches might be limited by the availability of sediment. Fixed converters off the Hebrides would have more pronounced environmental impacts than offshore floating devices, mainly through their greater sheltering effect, the possibly stronger tidal flows generated between devices and shores, and the need to site fixed converters in the kelp zone. Devices would represent a new habitat for colonisation by attached algae and invertebrates and would probably attract fish, seabirds and seals. Seabed-mounted devices, once no longer operational, would become artificial reefs if left in place. Device noise might affect communication and navigation systems of fish and marine mammals. The navigational hazard to shipping posed by converters would be likely to increase the risk of severe oil pollution incidents in areas that are populated by internationally important numbers of seabirds.","","","Nature Conservancy Council","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Eng.; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 459-469","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OCENB","10.1016/0029-8018(83)90047-1","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6333360","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6333360","","Ocean Eng.; (United States)","","10:6"

The characteristics of the new methods are as follows: (1) in tidal power generation utilizing the atmospheric pressure, the air pressure exerted on an air turbine can be maintained at 1 atm regardless of the water head; (2) in tidal power generation utilizing the air recirculation, the air pressure exerted on an air turbine can be made twice as high as the available water head; (3) higher tidal energy conversion efficiency can be obtained by flowing larger quantities of water in a shorter time period; (4) the generating turbines can be located at a convenient place remote from the reservoir; and (5) equipment corrosion due to salt is minimized.","","","","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The -10 dB width, determined from theoretical model estimates of the Doppler spectrum as a function of radar frequency for a wide range of ocean wave conditions, changes in a complex way with the continuum of second-order echoes surrounding the stronger first-order echo. Because the amplitude of the second-order echoes is directly related to changes in the directional ocean wave spectrum, the wind speed estimates derived from these expressions are highly dependent on the wave field (both the total energy and its distribution with direction); significant differences in these expressions are also found, for example, between fetch-limited and fully developed seas, and for wind seas and swell. These expressions are extremely difficult to use experimentally to obtain reliable estimates of wind speed because a priori knowledge of the wave field is required to apply the correct expression, and yet this knowledge cannot be determined from the unresolved second-order structure at this spectral resolution. Several Doppler spectra recorded under known ocean wind and wave conditions illustrate the difficulty in applying these theoretical expressions to estimate wind speed.","","","Remote Sensing Lab., SRI International","","","United States","1982-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The existing numerical models of wave refraction due to current are all for regular waves. A numerical model is proposed for the computation of the change of the directional spectral density of irregular waves due to current-depth refraction. The wave action equation is applied as the basic equation, in which the wave direction is introduced as the fourth independent variable. Several sample computations show that this model can explain the change of the directional spectra due to current.

This paper presents the experience with a heave/pitch/roll buoy off the Norwegian coast. The buoy has been in operation there since January 1980 as part of a large oceanographic measuring program financed jointly by the Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and three Norwegian oil companies. The calibration and field testing of the buoy heave response and meteorological sensor performance indicate good agreement with reference values. Data recovery has also been satisfactory. The directional results appear to have good physical backing. There is good correlation between wind and wave fields in the high frequency band, the Norwegian coastal shadow is clearly seen at low frequency, and veering winds are shown to give an increased spreading around the mean.","","","Continental Shelf Institute, Trondheim","","","United States","1982-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Sci.

For many of these technologies, insufficient historical data are available from which to assess the health risks and environmental impacts. However, their similarities to other projects make certain predictions possible, and some examples of these are discussed with respect to worker safety in the construction and operation of various systems. Satellite power systems have several unique risks. These include the effects of long-term space travel for construction workers, effects on the ozone layer and the attendant risk of skin cancer in the general public, and the as-yet-undetermined effects of long-term, low-level microwave exposure. Hazards may arise from three sources in solar heating and cooling systems: water contamination from corrosion inhibitors, heat transfer fluids, and bactericides; collector over-heating, fires, and ''out-gassing''; and handling and disposal of system fluids and wastes. Similar concerns exist for solar thermal power systems. Even passive solar systems may increase indoor exposure levels to various air pollutants and toxic substances.

Problems associated with the low-grade nature of wave energy and the rate at which wave crests approach are pointed out, and simple devices already in use for the supply of energy to bell buoys, whistle buoys and lighted buoys are noted. Attention is then given to wave energy conversion systems based on the focusing of waves onto a narrow ramp leading to a reservoir from which water is released to power a turbine generator: a slightly submerged circular shell which directs waves into its center cavity where waves act to turn a turbine (the Dam-Atoll), a long vertical pipe with an internal valve allowing water to move in an upward direction (the Isaacs wave-energy pump), a turbine located at the bottom of an open-topped pipe (the Masuda buoy), a completely submerged closed air chamber from which runs a large pipe open to the sea, a wave piston which acts by the compression of air to drive a turbine, a massive structure with upper and lower reservoirs (the Russel rectifier), and devices which consist of floating or submerged objects which transfer wave energy to pumps (the Salter duck and Cockerell raft). It is concluded that although wave-powered generators are not likely to become competitive in the near future or provide more than a small portion of world demand, they may be found useful under special conditions.","","","","","","United States","1981-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sea Front.; (United States); Journal Volume: 27","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 139-149","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SEAFA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5516864","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5516864","","Sea Front.; (United States)","","27"

A theory was developed for the oscillation of two-dimensional energy-absorbing cylindrical sections which can be utilized for estimating hydrodynamic characteristics of fully three-dimensional ship hulls.

First, the cam is allowed to have one degree of freedom (the cam rolls about a rigid and fixed shaft) and is in a shallow sea where the waves are modeled by the JONSWAP spectrum. Power extraction, efficiency and dynamic response are presented in terms of wind characteristics for a cam radius of 3 m. In the open sea where typical waves are longer and higher, waves are represented by the P-M spectrum and the cam radius is taken to be 7 m.

Shore-based and sea-based devices have been invented. Three types of the more practical sea-based devices are flapping plates, floating rafts, and air bells. Much further work needs to be done before the technical and economic viability can be reliably assessed. There are other possible methods of harnessing solar energy by using the sea. Ocean currents could be used to drive turbines in a manner analogous to wind generation. Another possible way of generating electricity is to use the difference in salt concentration between fresh water and sea water where rivers enter the sea to drive a voltaic cell. The method of power generation, explored 50 years ago, is to make use of the temperature difference between the depths of the ocean and the surface to drive a heat engine. Of the many ideas that have been proposed for harnessing the tides, barrage schemes offer the best prospects for economic power generation. Tidal power cannot contribute much to global power generation due to the number of limited sites and uncertainties in costs and feasibility of large schemes.

The concept has the advantages of environmental acceptability, the opportunity to free conventional energy resources for export, employment opportunities, a capacity to produce hydrogen and oxygen, anticipated revenues in excess of capital costs, and an inexhaustible energy source. The ebb and flow of tides can be used in inlet and bay areas by installing turbines with reversible propellers. Where this is not feasible, a tidal paddle wheel on a floating platform offers a low capital cost. Anchored semi-submersible large-diameter turbines are under study for generating electricity from slow-moving ocean streams. An integrated system, dependent on the timing of tidal movements, could offer continuous production. Power transmission to the integration unit and then to centers of use will result in as much as 35 percent loss. Schemes to ship hydrogen and water for recombination and conversion to electrical energy or to convert to methanol introduce high costs and environmental problems, while microwave transmission has technical requirements to be met. Submarine cable appears to be the most logical method for short distances.

Unlike Israel, both France and Britain have advanced commercial nuclear power technology, while Israel has an abundance of solar radiation not shared by parts of France and most of the United Kingdom. In essence then, Israel is stressing the use of solar energy to heat water for consumption in the home, for space heating and cooling, and for solar ponds--the ponds are an original scheme for generating process heat and electricity. France, with the world's most advanced solar furnace, is involved in solar-thermal power development as well as in research to reduce the cost of photovoltaic conversion, and also has geothermal heating systems in operation and under construction.

The absorber utilises a machine to control its movement in an optimum way relative to the time evolvement of the incident wave. As a result, the improved absorber becomes theoretically as efficient in non-harmonic waves as the resonance-tuned absorber is in harmonic waves. Assuming waves and oscillations of small amplitudes, mathematical expressions are derived for the maximum obtainable absorbed power and for the corresponding optimum velocity function of the oscillating heaving absorber body. Provided the wave spectrum is reasonably narrow, the optimum velocity is approximately proportional to and in phase with the excitation force due to the incident wave.","","","Norges Tekniske Hoegskole, Trondheim, Norway","","","United States","1977-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mar.

However, there is some doubt as to whether citizens will want to see further loss of large tracts of land. An alternative to the large hydro systems now in use is a revitalization of the thousands of small hydroelectric facilities built during the last century. There are an estimated 48,000 such dams that might be put back to work generating electricity. It is estimated that these dams, if power-generating turbines were placed on them, would produce seven times more energy than the Administration anticipates from solar heating in 1985 and almost the same amount of electricity produced by all nuclear plants in operation today. The tides could yield the energy equivalent of 560 billion kWh/year, i.e., 14% of 1969's world electricity consumption. A third major source for water power is harnessing the energy contained in the action of waves. Recent estimates have placed wave power potentials from 2700 to 89.3 million gigawatts; wave power in the year 2000 could be supplying 10% of the world's energy needs.

The tidal range is generally between 9 and 12 meters throughout much of the area, and there are many inlets or basins with narrow entrances suitable for damming. However, one critical factor missing in any tidal power assessment of the region is a nearby energy market. But, with Western Australia's shortage of black coal deposits and crude oil reserves, the State Government has undertaken to continue its investigation of the potential for tidal power generation on the Kimberley coast. Nevertheless the energy authorities in Western Australia, backed by successive State Governments, have regarded it as their duty to see what can be done to harness this tantalizing energy resource. The State is becoming rapidly energy-intensive through mineral processing but lacks the huge fuel resources available in the eastern part of Australia. If a way can be found to develop tidal power, it will certainly be worth the effort in the long run. The Kimberly area suffers from its remoteness and a lack of sizable energy market, but the area is free of shipping traffic with the possible exception of Wyndham. Data are provided for four possible sites: Secure Bay, Walcott Inlet, George Water, and St. George's Basin. The caisson types for closing Secure Bay and Walcott Inlet are discussed, and it is concluded that they are economically feasible.

However, the head might be quite adequate for a hydraulic ram installation if in fact a suitable ram mechanism can be developed. The output from the rams might be arranged to flow directly to a surge tank which in turn would supply conventional generating sets, or a storage feature might be introduced, depending on circumstances. In most cases run-of-river sites would be developed through the use of the tunnel system, in which a tunnel would by-pass a rapids or fast water section of river. As a component of a tidal power system, the ability of the hydraulic ram to operate efficiently under very low heads makes it appear very attractive as a means of providing a supply of water to prolong the periods during which the turbines would have an adequate head for their operation. Wave energy, too could be exploited with the aid of a ram. For instance, by means of an array of check gates, high and low-level pools might be established within a suitable enclosure or caisson, with hydraulic rams arranged to be operated by the available flow from the high to the low pool, the rams delivering water to a surge tank from which, in turn, conventional turbine-generators would operate.

Wind energy is widely available but irregular and variable, the basic problem being storage. Tidal and wave power are of practical interest only to large electricity supply organizations; wave power is more of a conventional base-load energy source for which storage is needed if the full potential is to be realized; an expanded tidal scheme could provide this storage because it is complementary to any primary source. Estuaries like the Severn provide suitable conditions--pumping at night combined with an intermittent tidal input can give steady daytime output to meet up to 30 percent of the present maximum excess of daytime over night load; no other storage is needed for either source. This would reduce by 40 percent the amount of thermal plant operating by day and would lower total thermal generating capacity by 10 percent. Technical and economic constraints are present for geothermal energy, but the total heat content under Britain is enough to supply all her energy needs at present consumption rates, for 20,000 years. Solar energy is by far the most versatile of the renewable sources. Thermal applications for space heating, hot water heating, and electricity generation through solar thermal power cycles are well known. Solar cells are potentially an attractive means of generating electricity for all sectors (except transportation) because they have no running costs or moving parts and no waste products. The present capital cost is too high to be competitive. The economics of the development of all the alternative sources is summarized.

Results of the analysis are then compared with experimental data in a study of the relative air velocity within the turbine passage. The results compare very well. The effect of the variation of the center pipe length is found to be significant for periods about the surge chamber resonance but is negligible in the neighborhood of the heaving resonance period. Further, the theory is applied to a prototype buoy under study by the U.S. Coast Guard, and a dimensionless design curve is developed from the results of the prototype analysis.","","","Naval Academy, Annapolis","","","United States","1976-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Ocean Eng.; (United States); Journal Volume: 3:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 133-144","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OCENB","10.1016/0029-8018(76)90029-9","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","7247090","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7247090","","Ocean Eng.; (United States)","","3:3"

Wave power conversion devices include propulsion schemes, buoy power supply devices, offshore power plants and shore-based power stations. If the power generated from ocean waves is to be competitive, one of the first requirements of a device may be to amplify power density per unit area before conversion. The energy densification schemes proposed include resonance, accumulation with time, converging channels and refraction. Wave energy is most amenable for densification as processes like refraction, reflection and resonance are characteristic of waves. Hence, proper technology is likely to render wave power economically competitive.","","","Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst., MA","","","United States","1976-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mar.

Specific configurations include simple, small point absorbers that can theoretically focus the incident wave energy from a capture width of about half a wavelength and hinged vessels contouring to the waves and elongated in the direction perpendicular to the wave crests, power being extracted from the relative motion of the hinged subelements.

Moreover, it could be lowered or pulled aside to allow ship traffic to pass or to protect it during storms. The top of the barrier would be supported by a cable (fixed to floats) spanning the entrance to the bay, while the conversion of tidal energy would be accomplished using compressed air, with two tidal chambers connected to a large piston air motor, although the possible use of gas turbine engines will also be tested.","","","","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oceanus; (United States); Journal Volume: 22","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 64-67","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OCEAA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","5921299","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5921299","","Oceanus; (United States)","","22"

First, the occupants, uses, and constructions of the world's 440,000-kilometer coastline continually change in response to economic and social pressures. Second, the ever-increasing populations stress both the land and water environments of the coastal zone. Finally, the early-1990s de-emphasis of military operations will open up space presently occupied by armies and navies in many countries. In addition to these contenders for coastal-ocean space, there are some minor competitors from the mining, energy, and fishing industries. Today all have potential, but none loom as serious challengers. The continuous recovery of energy from the sea remains elusive although it is often discussed in the popular media. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), utilizes the temperature differences between warm surface and cold deep waters to run a turbine in closed or open cycles. Energy can be drawn from ocean tides generated by gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun upon the earth. A straightforward way to harness this tidal energy involves placing a barrier with sluices and turbines across a marine basin. There are probably 30 sites in the world that could be successfully employed for tidal energy. Many ideas for harnessing wave energy have been proposed but today most devices involve compressing air to run a turbine connected to a generator. Japan and Norway, which have successfully demonstrated pilot models, appear to be at the forefront of wave-energy activity, with the UK not far behind.","","","","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oceanus; (United States); Journal Volume: 36:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12-18","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-8182; CODEN: OCEAAK","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6543933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6543933","","Oceanus; (United States)","","36:1"

Interest in tidal problems ebbs and flows like the tides themselves, but it is now fully recognized that tides do more than alter the water level in harbors; they affect many facets of circulation and mixing in continental shelf seas. The success of the theory in accounting for natural changes in tides increased confidence in predicting changes that would accompany Canadian development of tidal power in the Bay of Fundy's upper reaches. The simple expectation that barriers would effectively shorten the bay and bring it closer to resonance, with a consequent increase in the regional tides, was borne out in detailed modeling by David Greenberg (Bedford Institute of Oceanography). The predicted increase for the largest scheme discussed (with a proposed capacity of about 5,000 megawatts) was about 10% at Boston.","","","","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oceanus; (United States); Journal Volume: 36:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 27-36","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-8182; CODEN: OCEAAK","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6804551","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6804551","","Oceanus; (United States)","","36:1"

Potential designs involve ebb-generation with 1400- 5300-MW plants using 7.6 m diameter, straight-flow, low-head turbines installed in dams up to 8 km in length. Discharge through individual turbines will be 400 m/sup 3//second at 50 rev/minute with draft tube velocities of 11.4 m/second. Calculated parameters for these turbines are a water length of 2.26 m, impact velocity of 23.99 m/second, blade tip velocity up to 28.7 m/second and a total pressure flux of 1.7 atm. The existing environment is macrotidal (tide range 11-16 m). The intertidal biological community is a salt marsh-mudflat biome. The pelagic zone supports large populations of migratory fishes, particularly the alosids, Alosa sapidissima, A. aestivalis, A. pseudoharengus, and Clupea harengus. Striped bass, spiny dogfish, Atlantic salmon, and Atlantic sturgeon also constitute a significant portion of the fish community. Tagging experiments indicate this region is a northern migration terminus for American shad populations from all Atlantic coast rivers and abundance in an individual tidal basin is about 1.5 million adults during a single tidal cycle. Striped bass and alewife tagged in this region have been taken as far south as North Carolina. Upstream tidal headponds will have reduced tidal ranges of 5-6 m and the lower energy will result in stratification of the water column and less turbidity. Increased sedimentation above and below the dams is expected to affect local soft-shell clam fisheries. Tidal barrages may alter fish migration routes and repeated passage through turbines during tide-related movements will cause significant mortality to both fish and marine mammals. Existing knowledge for fish passage design in this environment is inadequate for development of sound mitigation measures.","","","Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans, St. Andrews, New Brunswick","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fisheries; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 26-35","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: FISHD","10.1577/1548-8446(1986)011<0026:PIOLTP>2.0.CO;2","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6821416","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6821416","","Fisheries; (United States)","","11:4"
