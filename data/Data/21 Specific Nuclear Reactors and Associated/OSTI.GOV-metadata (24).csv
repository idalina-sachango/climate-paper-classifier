The present study has the objective to estimate the effect of whole core configuration as well as burnup effects to the reactor core profile by adopting two dimensional model of fuel core management. About more than 40 months of cycle period has been employed for one cycle fuel irradiation of three batches fuel system for large water cooled thorium reactors. All position of fuel arrangement contributes to the total core conversion ratio which gives conversion ratio less than unity of at the BOC and it contributes to higher than unity (1.01) at the EOC after some irradiation process. Inner part and central part give the important part of breeding contribution with increasing burnup process, while criticality is reduced with increasing the irradiation time. Feasibility of breeding capability of water-cooled thorium reactors for whole core fuel arrangement has confirmed from the obtained conversion ratio which shows higher than unity. Whole core analysis on evaluating reactivity change which is caused by the change of voided condition has been employed for conservative assumption that 100% coolant and moderator are voided. It obtained always a negative void reactivity coefficient during reactor operation which shows relatively more negative void coefficient at BOC (fresh fuel composition), and it becomes less negative void coefficient with increasing the operation time. Negative value of void reactivity coefficient shows the reactor has good safety properties in relation to the reactivity profile which is the main parameter in term of criticality safety analysis. Therefore, this evaluation has confirmed that breeding condition and negative coefficient can be obtained simultaneously for water-cooled thorium reactor obtains based on the whole core fuel arrangement.","","","","","","United States","2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1325; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 4.

The objective of this research is to get optimal design parameters of such type reactors. The parameters of nuclear design including the critical condition, conversion ratio, and burn-up level were compared. These parameters are calculated by variation in the fuel fraction 47.5% up to 70%. Two dimensional full core multi groups diffusion calculations was performed by CITATION code. Group constant preparations are performed by using SRAC code system with JENDL-3.2 nuclear data library. In this design the reactor cores with cylindrical cell two dimensional R-Z core models are subdivided into several parts with the same volume in the axial directions. The placement of fuel in core arranged so that the result of plutonium from natural uranium can be utilized optimally for 10 years reactor operation. Modified CANDLE burn-up was established successfully in a core radial width 1.4 m. Total thermal power output for reference core is 550 MW. Study on the effect of fuel to coolant ratio shows that effective multiplication factor (k{sub eff}) is in almost linear relations with the change of the fuel volume to coolant ratio.","","","","","","United States","2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1325; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 4.

The simulation was performed using FI-ITB safety code which has been developed in ITB. The simulation begins with steady state calculation of neutron flux, power distribution and temperature distribution across the core, hot pool and cool pool, and also steam generator. When the accident is started due to the loss of pumping power the power distribution and the temperature distribution of core, hot pool and cool pool, and steam generator change. Then the feedback reactivity calculation is conducted, followed by kinetic calculation. The process is repeated until the optimum power distribution is achieved. The results show that the SPINNOR reactor has inherent safety capability against this accident.","","","","","","United States","2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1325; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 4.

According to previous monitoring, tritium was detected with the concentration of 8.236{+-}0.677 kBq/L and 1.704{+-}0.046 Bq/L in the primary cooling water and in reactor hall air, respectively. The tritium in reactor hall air chronically can be inhaled by the workers. In this research, tritium content in radiation workers' urine was determined to estimate the internal radiation doses received by the workers. About 50-100 mL of urine samples were collected from 48 PTNBR workers that is classified as 24 radiation workers and 24 administration staffs as a control. Urine samples of 25 mL were then prepared by active charcoal and KMnO{sub 4} addition and followed with complete distillation. The 2 mL of distillate was added with 13 mL scintillator, shaked vigorously and remained in cool and dark condition for about 24 hours. The tritium in the samples was then measured using liquid scintillation counter (LSC) for 1 hour. From the measurement results it was obtained that the tritium concentration in the urine of radiation workers were in the range of not detected and 5.191 Bq/mL, whereas in the administration staffs the concentration were between not detected and 4.607 Bq/mL. Internally radiation doses were calculated using the tritium concentration data, and it was found the averages about 0.602 {mu}Sv/year and 0.532 {mu}Sv/year for radiation workers and administration staffs, respectively. The doses received by the workers were lower than that of the permissible doses from tritium, i.e. 40 {mu}Sv/year.","","","","","","United States","2010-12-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1325; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 4.

It is important that the reactor before the explosion was at maximal xenon poisoning, and its reactivity, apparently, was not destroyed by the explosion. The reactivity release due to decay of Xe-235 on the second day after the explosion led to a reactor power of 80-110 MW. Owing to this power, the chemical reactions of reduction of uranium, plutonium, and other metals at a temperature of about 2000 Degree-Sign C occurred in the core. The yield of fission products thus sharply increased. Uranium and other metals flew down in the bottom water communications and rooms. After reduction of the uranium and its separation from the graphite, the chain reaction stopped, the temperature of the core decreased, and the activity yield stopped.","","","","","","United States","2010-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physics of Atomic Nuclei; Journal Volume: 73; Journal Issue: 14; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2296-2300","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-7788; CODEN: PANUEO; TRN: US12K2256116535","10.1134/S1063778810140073","","2013-03-21T00:00:00Z","22028269","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22028269","","Physics of Atomic Nuclei","14","73"

It is shown that the use of recycled uranium for manufacturing export nuclear fuel makes transfer of nuclear material removed from the fuel assemblies for weapons purposes difficult because of the presence of isotope {sup 232}U, whose content increases when one attempts to enrich uranium extracted from fresh fuel. In combination with restricted access to technologies for isotope separation by means of establishing international centers for uranium enrichment, this technical measure can significantly reduce the risk of proliferation associated with export deliveries of fuel made of low-enriched uranium. The assessment of a maximum level of contamination of nuclear material being transferred by isotope {sup 232}U for the given isotope composition of the initial fuel is obtained.

However, the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States today is unsustainable. As stated in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the U.S. Department of Energy is responsible for disposing of spent nuclear fuel generated by commercial nuclear power plants operating in a “once-through” fuel cycle in the deep geologic repository located at Yucca Mountain. However, unyielding political opposition to the site has hindered the commissioning process to the extant that the current administration has recently declared the unsuitability of the Yucca Mountain site. In light of this the DOE is exploring other options, including closing the fuel cycle through recycling and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The possibility of closing the fuel cycle is receiving special attention because of its ability to minimize the final high level waste (HLW) package as well as recover additional energy value from the original fuel. The technology is, however, still very controversial because of the increased cost and proliferation risk it can present. To lend perspective on the closed fuel cycle alternative, this presents the arguments for and against closing the fuel cycle with respect to sustainability, proliferation risk, commercial viability, waste management, and energy security.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Knowledge of the flow phenomena involved along with the quality and mass flow rate of the discharging stream(s) is necessary to adequately predict the different phenomena associated with the process. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) was used to provide detailed measurements of the flow patterns involving distributions of mean velocity, vorticity field, and flow structure. The experimental investigation was carried out to simulate two-phase discharge from a stratified region through branches located on a quarter-circular wall configuration exposed to a stratified gas-liquid environment. The quarter-circular test section is in close dimensional resemblance with that of a CANDU header-feeder system, with branches mounted at orientation angles of zero, 45 and 90 degrees from the horizontal. The experimental data for the phase development (mean velocity, flow structure, etc.) was collected during dual discharge through the horizontal branch and the 45 or 90 branch from an air-water stratified region over two selected Froude numbers in the horizontal branch while maintaining the Froude number in the other branch constant. These measurements were used to describe the effect of outlet flow conditions on phase redistribution in headers and understand the entrainment phenomena.

The effects of the heat flux, thermo-physical properties, buoyancy and thermal acceleration on the convection heat transfer were analyzed. The experimental results show that for high inlet Reynolds numbers (e.g. Re = 9000) and high heat fluxes, a significant local deterioration and recovery of the heat transfer was found for upward flows but not for downward flows. Comparison of the experimental data for inlet Reynolds numbers from 3800 to 20,000 with some well-known empirical correlations showed large differences especially when the heat transfer deteriorates and then recovers when the effect of buoyancy is significant. The experimental data was used to develop modified local turbulent Nusselt number correlations for supercritical CO{sub 2} flowing in vertical small circular tubes.

In case of heavy water moderator nuclear reactors, the decay heat of a fuel bundle enclosed in the pressure tube and outer concentric calandria tube can be transferred to the moderator. Radiation heat transfer plays a significant role in removal of decay heat from the fuel rods to the moderator, which is available outside the calandria tube. A single heater rod test facility is designed and fabricated as a part of preliminary investigations. The objective is to anticipate the capability of moderator to remove decay heat, from the reactor core, generated after shut down. The present paper focuses mainly on the role of moderator in removal of decay heat, for situation with air alone in the annular gap of pressure tube and calandria tube. It is seen that the naturally aspirated air is capable of removing the heat generated in the system compared to the standstill air or stagnant water situations. It is also seen that the flowing moderator is capable of removing a greater fraction of heat generated by the heater rod compared to a stagnant pool of boiling moderator.

To this end, a U-7 wt.% Mo alloy research reactor dispersion fuel plate with Al-2 wt.% Si matrix was destructively examined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy to characterize the developed microstructure after fabrication. Of particular interest for this study was how the Si that was added to the fuel matrix partitioned between the various fuel plate phases during fabrication. Si was added to the matrix so that the microstructure that developed during fuel fabrication would exhibit good irradiation behavior. SEM analysis was used to identify the representative microstructure, the compositions of the various phases, and the partitioning behavior of the fuel and matrix constituents. TEM analysis was employed to definitively identify the phases in the U-7Mo alloy and the phases that formed due to diffusional interactions between the fuel particles and matrix during fuel plate fabrication. The TEM results are the first reported for an as-fabricated U-7 wt.% Mo dispersion fuel plate with an Al alloy matrix. SEM results showed that a significant portion of the original {gamma}-(U-Mo) fuel particles had transformed to a lamellar microstructure, comprised of {alpha}-U and either {gamma} or {gamma}' phases, and the fuel/matrix interaction layers were enriched in Si. TEM analysis identified an ordered fcc (U-Mo)(Al-Si){sub 3} type of phase, which formed at the decomposed U-7Mo/matrix interface and extended into the lamellar microstructure. Some regions of the U-7Mo particles retained the single-phase {gamma}-(U-Mo). Small precipitate phases were observed in the fuel meat matrix that contained Fe, Al, and Si. The Si that is added to the matrix of a U-Mo dispersion fuel plate to improve irradiation performance appears to result in the creation of a Si-rich (U-Mo)(Al-Si){sub 3} type of fuel/matrix interaction layer during fabrication that appears to exhibit favorable behavior during irradiation compared to the behavior of the layers that form in U-Mo dispersion fuel plates without Si in the matrix. - Research Highlights: {yields}Si seems to positively affect the microstructure of an as-fabricated fuel plate. {yields}Si modifications to the fuel plate exhibit favorable performance during irradiation. {yields}Si interdiffuses faster than Al.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matchar.2010.07.010","","","","United States","2010-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Materials Characterization; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1157-1166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1044-5803; CODEN: MACHEX; PII: S1044-5803(10)00242-1; TRN: US10R2918025553","10.1016/J.MATCHAR.2010.07.010","","2013-04-12T00:00:00Z","22066238","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22066238","","Materials Characterization","11","61"

While some in the international community remain apprehensive, the advantages of multinational fuel cycle facilities are becoming increasingly apparent, with states on both sides of the supply chain able to garner the security and financial benefits of such facilities. Proliferation risk is minimized by eliminating the need of states to establish indigenous fuel production capabilities and the concept's structure provides an additional internationally monitored barrier against the misuse or diversion of nuclear materials.

Likewise, domestic safeguards and nuclear security are essential to combating theft, sabotage, and nuclear terrorism by non-State actors. While current approaches to safeguarding and protecting the nuclear fuel cycle have been very successful, there is significant, active interest to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards and security, particularly in light of the anticipated growth of nuclear energy and the increase in the global threat environment. This article will address two recent developments called Safeguards-by-Design and Security-by-Design, which are receiving increasing broad international attention and support. Expected benefits include facilities that are inherently more economical to effectively safeguard and protect. However, the technical measures of safeguards and security alone are not enough - they must continue to be broadly supported by dynamic and adaptive nonproliferation and security regimes.

The novel manner of visualizing the results allowed characterizing the facility at any time and position which helped to thoroughly understand the instability mechanisms. Different modes were observed for each configuration. In the case of having two-parallel channels, four different behaviors have been observed: stable flow circulation, periodic high subcooling oscillations, a-periodical oscillations and out-of-phase periodical oscillations. In addition, stability maps were constructed in order to clarify the region in which each mode is dominant. The results obtained from both the one and two-parallel channels configurations are thus analyzed and compared. As a result, some similarities have been observed between the intermittent flow oscillations found in the single channel experiments and the high subcooling oscillations found in the two-parallel channels experiments. Moreover, similarities have also been found between the sinusoidal flow oscillations existing in the single channel experiments and the out-of-phase oscillations from the two-parallel channels experiments. The experiments presented in this work can be used to benchmark numerical codes and modeling techniques developed to study the start-up of natural circulation BWRs.

The Monte Carlo simulation results are compared with the ICE-Experimental measurements for burnup up to 30 GWD/t. The comparison shows the good capabilities of the MCNPX computer code package for predicting the depletion of the uranium fuel and the buildup of the plutonium isotopes in a PWR thermal reactor. The Monte Carlo simulation results show also good agreements with the experimental data for calculating several long-lived and stable fission products. However, for the americium and curium actinides, it is difficult to judge the predication capabilities for these actinides due to the large uncertainties in the ICE-Experimental data. In the MCNPX numerical simulations, a pin cell model is utilized to simulate the fuel lattice of the nuclear power reactor. Temperature dependent libraries based on JEFF3.1 nuclear data files are utilized for the calculations.

To capture nuclear process heat, and transport it to a distant industrial facility requires a high temperature system of heat exchangers, pumps and/or compressors. The heat transfer system is particularly challenging not only due to the elevated temperatures (up to approx.1300 K) and industrial scale power transport (=50MW), but also due to a potentially large separation distance between the nuclear and industrial plants (100+m) dictated by safety and licensing mandates. The work reported here is the preliminary analysis of two-phase thermosyphon heat transfer performance with alkali metals. A thermosyphon is a thermal device for transporting heat from one point to another with quite extraordinary properties. In contrast to single-phased forced convective heat transfer via ‘pumping a fluid’, a thermosyphon (also called a wickless heat pipe) transfers heat through the vaporization/condensing process. The condensate is further returned to the hot source by gravity, i.e., without any requirement of pumps or compressors. With this mode of heat transfer, the thermosyphon has the capability to transport heat at high rates over appreciable distances, virtually isothermally and without any requirement for external pumping devices. Two-phase heat transfer by a thermosyphon has the advantage of high enthalpy transport that includes the sensible heat of the liquid, the latent heat of vaporization, and vapor superheat. In contrast, single-phase forced convection transports only the sensible heat of the fluid. Additionally, vapor-phase velocities within a thermosyphon are much greater than single-phase liquid velocities within a forced convective loop. Thermosyphon performance can be limited by the sonic limit (choking) of vapor flow and/or by condensate entrainment. Proper thermosyphon requires analysis of both.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Preservation of FFTF Data Related to Passive Safety Testing","Wootan, David W; Butner, R Scott; Omberg, Ronald P; Makenas, Bruce J; Nielsen, Deborah L","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BOILING POINTS; COMPUTER CODES; DESIGN; FUEL CYCLE; HEAT TRANSFER; KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION; LIQUID METALS; NATURAL CONVECTION; NUCLEAR POWER; PRESERVATION; SAFETY; SAFETY ANALYSIS; SAFETY MARGINS; SOURCE TERMS; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; TESTING; FFTF; liquid metal reactor; data preservation; passive safety testing","One of the goals of the Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program (FCRD) is to preserve the knowledge that has been gained in the United States on Liquid Metal Reactors (LMR). A key area deserving special attention for preservation is the data relating to passive safety testing that was conducted in FFTF and EBR-II during the 1980’s. Accidents at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl Station and Unit 2 at Three Mile Island changed the safety paradigm of the nuclear power industry. New emphasis was placed on assured safety based on intrinsic plant characteristics that protect not only the public, but the significant investment in the plant as well. Plants designated to perform in this manner are considered to be passively safe since no active sensor/alarm system or human intervention is required to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown condition. The liquid metal reactor (LMR) has several key characteristics needed for a passively safe reactor: reactor coolant with superior heat transfer capability and very high boiling point, low (atmospheric) system pressures, and reliable negative reactivity feedback. The credibility of the design for a passively safe LMR rests on two issues: the validity of analytic methods used to predict passive safety performance and the availability of relevant test data to calibrate design tools. Safety analysis methods used to analyze LMRs under the old safety paradigm were focused on calculating the source term for the Core Disruptive Accident. Passive safety design requires refined analysis methods for transient events because treatment of the detailed reactivity feedbacks is important in predicting the response of the reactor. Similarly, analytic tools should be calibrated against actual test experience in existing LMR facilities. The principal objectives of the combined FFTF natural circulation and Passive Safety Testing program were: 1) to verify natural circulation as a reliable means to safely remove decay heat, 2) to extend passive safety experience to a large-size LMR and obtain data for validating design analysis computer codes, and 3) to develop and test passive safety enhancements that might be used for future LMRs. These tests were designed to provide data sufficient to allow separation of fuel temperature effects from structural temperature effects. The data developed through this testing program were used to verify the predictive capability of passive safety analysis methods as well as provide a data base for calibrating design tools such as the SASSYS/SAS4A codes. These tests were instrumental in improving understanding of reactivity feedback mechanisms in LMRs and demonstrating passive safety margins available in an LMR. Knowledge preservation at the FFTF is focused on the areas of design, construction, startup, and operation of the reactor. This information may be of potential use for international exchanges with other LMR programs around the world. This information provides the basis for creating benchmarks for validating and testing large scale computer programs. All information preserved to date is now being stored and categorized consistent with the IAEA international standardized taxonomy. The test results information exists in several different formats depending upon the final stage of the test evaluation. Over 100 documents relevant to passive safety testing have been identified and are being recovered, scanned, and catalogued. Attempts to recover plant data tapes are also in progress. Documents related to passive safety testing are now being categorized consistent with internationally agreed upon IAEA standards. Documents are being converted to electronic format compatible with a general search engine being developed by INL. The data from the FFTF passive safety tests provides experimental verification of structural reactivity effects that should be very useful to innovative designers seeking to optimize passive safety in the design of new LMRs.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, boiling natural circulation system poses many challenges to designer due to occurrence of various kinds of instabilities such as excursive instability, density wave oscillations, flow pattern transition instability, geysering and metastable states in parallel channels. This problem assumes greater significance particularly at low-pressures i.e. during startup, where there is great difference in the properties of two phases. In light of this, a parallel channel loop has been designed and installed that has a geometrical resemblance to the pressure-tube-type boiling-water-reactor, to investigate into the behavior of boiling natural circulation. The loop comprises of four identical parallel channels connected between two common plenums i.e. steam drum and header. The recirculation path is provided by a single downcomer connected between steam drum and header. Experiments have been conducted over a wide range of power and pressures (1-10 bar). Two distinct unstable zones are observed with respect to power i.e. corresponding to low power (Type-I) and high power (Type-II) with a stable zone at intermediate powers. The nature of oscillations in terms of their amplitude and frequency and their evolution for Type-I and Type-II instabilities are studied with respect to the effect of heater power and pressure. This paper discusses the evolution of unstable and stable behavior along with the nature of flow oscillation in the channels and the effect of pressure on it.

We examine carefully the role this damping plays and provide two explicit, nonconstant forms for the damping to be used with mass ratios further from one.

The interstitial gaps are an inherent presence in the reactor core because of tolerances in manufacturing the blocks and the inexact nature of their installation. Furthermore, the geometry of the graphite blocks changes over the lifetime of the reactor because of thermal expansion and irradiation damage. The occurrence of hot spots in the core and lower plenum and hot streaking in the lower plenum (regions of very hot gas flow) will be affected by the bypass flow. In the present study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations of a typical prismatic VHTR are conducted to understand better the bypass flow phenomenon and establish the evaluation method in the reactor core using commercial CFD code FLUENT. Parametric calculations changing several factors in a on-twelfth sector of a fuel column are performed. The simulations show the impact of each factor on bypass flow and the flow and temperature distributions in the prismatic core. The factors inlcude inter-column gap-width, turbulence model, axial heat generation profile and geometry change from irradiation-induced shrinkage in the graphite block region. It is shown that bypass flow provides a significant cooling effect on the prismatic block and that the maximum fuel and coolant channel outlet temperatures increase with an increase in gap-width, especially when a peak radial factor is applied to the total heat generation rate. Also, the presence of bypass flow causes a large lateral temperature gradient in the block that may have repurcussions on the structural integrity of the block and on the neutronics. These results indicate that bypass flow has a significant effect on hot spots in the core and on the temperature of jets flowing from the core into the lower plenum.","","","Idaho National Lab.

A nondestructive assay technology that could provide direct measurement of fissile mass, particularly for the plutonium (Pu) isotopes, and improve upon the uncertainty of today’s confirmatory methods is needed. Lead slowing-down spectroscopy (LSDS) has been studied for the spent fuel application previously, but the nonlinear effects of assembly self shielding (of the interrogating neutron population) have led to discouraging assay accuracy for realistic pressurized water reactor fuels. In this paper, we describe the development of time-spectral analysis algorithms for LSDS intended to overcome these self-shielding effects. The algorithm incorporates the tabulated energy-dependent cross sections from key fissile and absorbing isotopes, but leaves their mass as free variables. Multi-parameter regression analysis is then used to directly calculate not only the mass of fissile isotopes in the fuel assembly (e.g., Pu-239, U-235, and Pu-241), but also the mass of key absorbing isotopes such as Pu-240 and U-238. Modeling-based assay results using a first-order self-shielding relationship indicate that LSDS has the potential to directly measure fissile isotopes with less than 5% average relative error, over a wide fuel burnup range. Shortcomings in the first-order self-shielding model and methods to improve the formulation are described.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper QUADRISO particles are proposed to manage the initial excess reactivity of high temperature reactors. The QUADRISO concept synergistically couples the decrease of the burnable poison with the decrease of the fissile materials at the fuel particle level. This mechanism is set up by introducing a burnable poison layer around the fuel kernel in ordinary TRISO particles or by mixing the burnable poison with any of the TRISO coated layers. At the beginning of life, the initial excess reactivity is small because some neutrons are absorbed in the burnable poison and they are prevented from entering the fuel kernel. At the end of life, when the absorber is almost depleted, more neutrons stream into the fuel kernel of QUADRISO particles causing fission reactions. The mechanism has been applied to a prismatic high temperature reactor with europium or erbium burnable absorbers, showing a significant reduction in the initial excess reactivity of the core.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) is among six types of Generation IV Nuclear Power Plants. GFR with its hard neuron spectrum is superior for closed fuel cycle, and its ability to be operated in high temperature (850° C) makes various options of utilizations become possible. To obtain the capability of consuming natural uranium as fuel cycle input, modified CANDLE burn‐up scheme[1–6] is adopted this GFR system by dividing the core into 10 parts of equal volume axially. Due to the limitation of thermal hydraulic aspects, the average power density of the proposed design is selected about 70 W/cc. As an optimization results, a design of 1000 MWt reactors which can be operated 10 years without refueling and fuel shuffling and just need natural uranium as fuel cycle input is discussed.

Beside that, uranium and plutonium oxide (mixed oxide, MOX) and minor actinides have been employed as a new fuel type of HTTR. Utilization of plutonium and minor actinide is one of the support system to non-proliferation issue in the nuclear development. The enrichment for uranium oxide has been varied of 6-20% with plutonium and minor actinides concentration of 10%. In this study, burnup period is 1100 days. The reactor cell calculation was performed by using SRAC 2002 code, with nuclear data library was derived from JENDL3.2. Reactor core calculation was done by using CITATION module.

Its common problem is to find an optimum arrangement of fuel assemblies inside the reactor core. Main objective for this activity is to reduce the cost of generating electricity, which can be done by altering several physical properties of the nuclear reactor without violating any of the constraints imposed by operational and safety considerations. This research try to address the problem of nuclear fuel arrangement problem, which is, leads to the multi-objective optimization problem. However, the calculation of the reactor core physical properties itself is a heavy computation, which became obstacle in solving the optimization problem by using genetic algorithm optimization.This research tends to address that problem by using the emerging General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) techniques implemented by C language for CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel programming. By using this parallel programming technique, we develop parallelized nuclear reactor fitness calculation, which is involving numerical finite difference computation. This paper describes current prototype of the parallel algorithm code we have developed on CUDA, that performs one hundreds finite difference calculation for nuclear reactor fitness evaluation in parallel by using GPU G9 Hardware Series developed by NVIDIA.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1244; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2009: 2. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering 2009, Bandung (Indonesia), 3-4 Nov 2009; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3462749; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 121-126","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B6989003641","10.1063/1.3462749","","2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","21410480","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410480","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1244"

The reactor cores are subdivided into several parts with the same volume in the axial directions. The natural uranium is initially put in region 1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn-up it is shifted to region 2, and 10 years after that it is shifted to region 3. This concept is applied to all regions, i.e. shifted the core of I'th region into I+1 region after the end of 10 years burn-up cycle. The first region 1 is filled by fresh natural uranium fuel.

Such actions are considered in modernization of the old system, improving the core cooling system and safety evaluations. Due to the complexity of the process and the difficulty in putting the apparatus in the reactor core, analytical and experimental study on the determination of flow and temperature distribution in the whole coolant channel are difficult to be done. In the present work, a numerical study of flow and temperature distribution in the coolant channel of TRIGA 2000 has been carried out using CFD package. For this study, simulations were carried out on 3-D tested model. The model consists of the reactor tank, thermal and thermalizing column, reflector, rotary specimen rack, chimney, fuel element, primary pipe, diffuser, beam tube and a part of the core are constructed by 1.50 million unstructured tetrahedral cell elements. The results show that for the initial condition (116 fuel elements in the core) and for the inlet temperature of 24 deg. C and the primary velocity of 5.6 m/s, there no boiling phenomena occur in the coolant channel. Due to this result, it is now possible to improve the core cooling system of TRIGA 2000 reactor. Meanwhile, forced flow from the diffuser system only affected the flow pattern in the outside of chimney and put on a small effect to the fluid flow's velocity in the inside of chimney.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1244; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2009: 2. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering 2009, Bandung (Indonesia), 3-4 Nov 2009; Other Information: DOI:; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 231-232","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B7000003648","10.1063/1.4757164","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","21410487","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410487","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1244"

Analysis was done on the operating temperature between 177 to 343 deg. C and the operating pressure of 16 MPa (160 Bar). The stagnant and transient condition with two kinds of stratification model has been evaluated by the two dimensional finite elements method using the ANSYS program. Evaluation of fatigue resistance is developed based on the maximum local stress using the ASME standard Code formula. Maximum stress of 427 MPa occurred at the upper side of the top half of hot fluid pipe stratification model in the transient case condition. The evaluation of the fatigue resistance is performed on 500 operating cycles in the life time of 40 years and giving the usage value of 0,64 which met to the design requirement for class 1 of nuclear component.

For this reactor design, a suitable fuel-loading scheme is the Peu a Peu (little by little) fueling scheme. In the Peu a Peu modus, there is no unloading device; as such, the fuels are never discharged and remain at the bottom of the core during reactor operation. This means that the burnup cycle and reactivity is controlled by the addition of fuel. The objectives of the the present study were to find a means of carrying out the exact calculations needed to analyze the Peu a Peu fuel-loading scheme and to optimize the fuel composition, and fuel-loading scheme to achieve better burnup characteristics. The Monte Carlo method is used to perform calculations with high accuracy. Before the calculation of the whole core, the analysis for the infinite geometry was performed. The power generated per mass consumed for each combination of the uranium enrichment and packing fraction was analyzed from the parametric survey.

The basic concept is that central region of the reactor core is filled with fertile (blanket) material. During the reactor operation fissile material accumulates in this central region, which helps to compensate fissile material loss in the peripheral core region and also contributes to negative coolant loss reactivity effect. A concept of high fuel volume fraction in the core is applied to achieve smaller size of a critical reactor. In this paper we consider to add Np-237 to the fuel to enhance non proliferation characteristics of the systems. The effect of Np-237 amount variation is discussed.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1244; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2009: 2. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering 2009, Bandung (Indonesia), 3-4 Nov 2009; Other Information: DOI:; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 45-54","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B7017003665","10.1063/1.4757156","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","21410504","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410504","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1244"

Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) is among six types of Generation IV Nuclear Power Plants. GFR with its hard neuron spectrum is superior for closed fuel cycle, and its ability to be operated in high temperature (850 deg. C) makes various options of utilizations become possible. To obtain the capability of consuming natural uranium as fuel cycle input, modified CANDLE burn-up scheme[1-6] is adopted this GFR system by dividing the core into 10 parts of equal volume axially. Due to the limitation of thermal hydraulic aspects, the average power density of the proposed design is selected about 70 W/cc. As an optimization results, a design of 1000 MWt reactors which can be operated 10 years without refueling and fuel shuffling and just need natural uranium as fuel cycle input is discussed. The average discharge burn-up is about 280 GWd/ton HM. Enough margin for criticality was obtained for this reactor.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1244; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2009: 2. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering 2009, Bandung (Indonesia), 3-4 Nov 2009; Other Information: DOI:; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 62-69","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B7019003667","10.1063/1.4757158","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","21410506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410506","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1244"

Uranium and plutonium have been used for 'new fuel' resources from LWR spent fuel as MOX fuel type which is loaded into thermal reactor or fast reactor types. Other actinides from the spent fuel such as neptunium, americium and curium as minor actinide (MA) are considered to be loaded into the reactors for specific purposes, recently. Those purposes such as for increasing protected plutonium production and breeding capability for protected plutonium as well as in the same time those amount of MA can be reduced to a small quantity as a burner or transmutation purpose. Some investigations and scientific approaches are performed in order to increase a material ''barrier'' in plutonium isotope composition by increasing the even mass number of plutonium isotope such as Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242 as plutonium protected composition. Higher material barrier which related to intrinsic properties of plutonium isotopes with even mass number (Pu-238, Pu-240 and Pu-242), are recognized because of their intense decay heat (DH) and high spontaneous fission neutron (SFN) rates. Those even number mass of plutonium isotope contribute to some criteria of plutonium characterization which will be adopted for present study such as IAEA, Pellaud and Kessler criteria (IAEA, 1972; Pellaud, 2002; and Kessler, 2007). The present paper intends to evaluate the breeding capability as a fuel sustainability index of the reactors and to analyze the composition of protected plutonium production of large power reactor based on the FaCT FBR as reference (Ohki, et al., 2008). Three dimensional FBR core configuration has been adopted which is based on the core optimization calculation of SRAC-CITATION code as reactor core analysis and JENDL-3.3 is adopted for nuclear data library. Some MA doping materials are loaded into the blanket regions which can be considered as breeding region for protected plutonium production. Breeding capability of the reactor can be increased effectively by increasing MA doping rate while criticality condition of the reactor is reduced by doping MA. Adopting MA cycle is also effective to increase the isotopic Pu-238 production in plutonium vector composition for denaturing purpose of plutonium.","","","","","","United States","2010-06-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1244; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: ICANSE 2009: 2. international conference on advances in nuclear science and engineering 2009, Bandung (Indonesia), 3-4 Nov 2009; Other Information: DOI:; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 91-102","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10B7022003670","10.1063/1.4757161","","2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","21410509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21410509","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1244"

It reduces neptunium and plutonium, and the resultant hydrophilic complexes are separated from uranium by extraction with tributyl phosphate (TBP) in a hydrocarbon diluent. AHA undergoes hydrolysis to acetic acid which will impede the recycling of nitric acid. During recent discussions of the UREX process, it has been proposed to replace AHA by formohydroxamic acid (FHA). FHA will undergo hydrolysis to formic acid which is volatile, thus allowing the recycling of nitric acid. The reported reduction potentials of AHA and pertechnetate (TcO{sub 4}{sup -}) indicated that it may be possible for AHA to reduce technetium, altering its fate in the fuel cycle. At UNLV, it has been demonstrated that TcO{sub 4}{sup -} undergoes reductive nitrosylation by AHA under a variety of conditions. The resulting divalent technetium is complexed by AHA to form the pseudo-octahedral trans-aquonitrosyl (diacetohydroxamic)-technetium(II) complex ([Tc{sup II}(NO)(AHA){sub 2}H{sub 2}O]{sup +}). In this paper, we are reporting the synthesis of FHA and its complex formation with technetium along with the characterization of FHA crystals achieved by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the complexation of FHA with Tc and the results were compared with previous data on AHA. The first experiment involved the elution of Tc from a Reillex HP anion exchange resin, and the second one monitored the complexation of technetium with FHA by UV-visible spectrophotometry.","","","Idaho National Lab.

"Asperity characteristics of the Olami-Feder-Christensen model of earthquakes","Kawamura, Hikaru; Yamamoto, Takumi; Kotani, Takeshi; Yoshino, Hajime","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; EARTHQUAKES; EPICENTERS; PERIODICITY; RUPTURES; STRESSES; FAILURES; SEISMIC EVENTS; SIMULATION; VARIATIONS","Properties of the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model of earthquakes are studied by numerical simulations. The previous study indicated that the model exhibited 'asperity'-like phenomena, i.e., the same region ruptures many times near periodically [T. Kotani et al., Phys. Rev. E 77, 010102(R) (2008)]. Such periodic or characteristic features apparently coexist with power-law-like critical features, e.g., the Gutenberg-Richter law observed in the size distribution. In order to clarify the origin and the nature of the asperity-like phenomena, we investigate here the properties of the OFC model with emphasis on its stress distribution. It is found that the asperity formation is accompanied by self-organization of the highly concentrated stress state. Such stress organization naturally provides the mechanism underlying our observation that a series of asperity events repeat with a common epicenter site and with a common period solely determined by the transmission parameter of the model. Asperity events tend to cluster both in time and in space.","","","","","","United States","2010-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review.

"Characterizing Solids in Residual Wastes from Single-Shell Tanks at the Hanford Site.","Krupka, Kenneth M; Cantrell, Kirk J; Schaef, Herbert T; Arey, Bruce W; Heald, Steve M; Deutsch, William J; Lindberg, Michael J","12 MANAGEMENT OF RADIOACTIVE WASTES, AND NON-RADIOACTIVE WASTES FROM NUCLEAR FACILITIES; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS; CEMENTS; COATINGS; DAWSONITE; DISSOLUTION; ELECTRONS; FLUIDS; GIBBSITE; GOETHITE; HEMATITE; IRON; PARTICLES; SOLIDS; STORAGE; SURFACE COATING; TANKS; TRANSITION ELEMENTS; UNDERGROUND; WASTE RETRIEVAL; WASTES; X-RAY DIFFRACTION; X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY; Hanford; sludge; saltcake; tank waste; S-112; C-103; C-106; C-202; C-203; x-ray diffraction; scanning electron microscopy","Solid-phase characterization methods have been used in an ongoing study of residual wastes (i.e., waste remaining after final retrieval operations) from underground single-shell storage tanks 241-C-103, 241 C 106, 241-C-202, 241-C-203, and 241-S-112 at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hanford Site in Washington State. The results of studies completed to date show variability in the compositions of those residual wastes and the compositions, morphologies, and crystallinities of the individual phases that make up these wastes. These differences undoubtedly result from the various waste types stored and transferred into and out of each tank and the different sluicing and retrieval operations used for waste retrieval. The studies indicate that these residual wastes are chemically-complex assemblages of crystalline and amorphous solids that contain contaminants as discrete phases and/or coprecipitated within oxide/hydroxide phases. Depending on the specific tank, various solids (e.g., gibbsite; böhmite; dawsonite; cancrinite; Fe oxides/hydroxides such as hematite, goethite, and maghemite; rhodochrosite; lindbergite; whewellite; nitratine; and numerous amorphous or poorly crystalline phases) have been identified by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in residual wastes studied to date. The studies also show that contact of residual wastes with Ca(OH)2- and CaCO3-saturated aqueous solutions, which were used as surrogates for the compositions of pore-fluid leachants derived from young and aged cements, respectively, may alter the composition of solid phases present in the contacted wastes. Iron oxides/hydroxides have been identified in all residual wastes studied to date. They occur in these wastes as discrete particles, particles intergrown within a matrix of other phases, and surface coatings on other particles or particle aggregates. These Fe oxides/hydroxides typically contain trace concentrations of other transition metals, such Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, and/or U. Recent analyses of residual waste from 241-C-103 have revealed the presence of Tc-containing Fe oxide/hydroxide particles, which is believed to be the first direct evidence of Tc in solid phases in actual samples of Hanford pre-final retrieval tank waste or post-final retrieval residual waste. The presence of mineralized coatings, such as Fe oxides/hydroxides or reaction products precipitated from contact with cement pore fluids, on contaminant-containing particles could decrease their rate of dissolution, thereby delaying the release of contaminants until the coatings dissolve sufficiently to expose the underlying matrix to infiltrating pore fluids. Certain key cross-cutting geochemical processes and solid phase characteristics important to contaminant waste release are becoming evident, now that residual wastes have been studied from several single-shell tanks. As more residual tank wastes are characterized in terms of composition and contaminant release, it is anticipated that common characteristics with respect to the type of wastes stored in the tanks will become evident. This may allow the grouping of tanks into general categories with certain common chemical features and contaminant release characteristics - an important goal because complete characterization of residual wastes from all 149 single-shell storage tanks is not practical. Additionally, information garnered from residual waste characterization activities can be used to optimize future waste retrieval operations.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

FDA's regulation of oncology drugs has evolved from the practices set forth in Arnold Lehman's seminal work published in the 1950s through the current drafting of a new International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) safety guidance for anti-cancer drug nonclinical evaluations. The ICH combines the efforts of the regulatory authorities of Europe, Japan, and the United States and the pharmaceutical industry from these three regions to streamline the scientific and technical aspects of drug development. The recent development of new oncology drug classes with novel mechanisms of action has improved survival rates for some cancers but also brings new challenges for safety evaluation. Here we present the legacy of Lehman and colleagues in the context of past and present oncology drug development practices and focus on some of the current issues at the center of an evolving harmonization process that will generate a new safety guidance for oncology drugs, ICH S9. The purpose of this new guidance will be to facilitate oncology drug development on a global scale by standardizing regional safety requirements.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.020","","","","United States","2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology; Journal Volume: 243; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.020; PII: S0041-008X(09)00527-4; Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 125-133","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0041-008X; TXAPA9; TRN: US10R1714075775","10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.020","","2010-10-28T00:00:00Z","21344873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21344873","","Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","2","243"

Safety evaluation of the products is carried out by a qualified safety assessor who needs to consider potential exposure scenarios next to the physicochemical and toxicological profiles of all composing ingredients. Whereas, until recently, the tools to determine the toxicological profile of cosmetic ingredients mainly consisted of animal experiments, they have now been narrowed down substantially by the legally imposed animal testing ban on cosmetic ingredients, taken up in the Cosmetic Products Directive (76/768/EEC). This Directive, however, is not a stand-alone piece of European legislation, since as well directly as indirectly it is influenced by a complex web of related legislations. Vertical legislations deal with different categories of chemicals, including dangerous substances, biocides, plant protection products, food additives, medicinal products, and of course also cosmetics. Horizontal legislative texts, on the contrary, cover more general fields such as protection of experimental animals, consumer product safety, misleading of consumers, specific provisions for aerosols, and others. Experience has learnt that having a general overview of these related legislations is necessary to understand their impact on the cosmetic world in general terms and on cosmetic safety evaluation in particular. This goes for a variety of concerned parties, including national and European regulators/agencies, contract laboratories, raw material suppliers, cosmetic companies, research and educational centers. They all deal with a number of aspects important for the quality and toxicity of cosmetics and their ingredients. This review summarises the most relevant points of the legislative texts of different types of product categories and emphasises their impact on the safety evaluation of cosmetics.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2009.12.007","Elsevier Inc.

The presentation is sustained by historical arguments. In this frame, it is very important to start with the achievements of the first nuclear systems, for instant those with natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator, following in time through the history until the New Generation Nuclear Power Reactors.Starting with 1940, the accelerated development of the industry has implied the increase of the global demand for energy. In this respect, the nuclear energy could play an important role, being essentially an unlimited source of energy. However, the nuclear option faces the challenges of increasingly demanding safety requirements, economic competitiveness and public acceptance. Worldwide, a significant amount of experience has been accumulated during development, licensing, construction, and operation of nuclear power reactors. The experience gained is a strong basis for further improvements. Actually, the nuclear programs of many countries are addressing the development of advanced reactors, which are intended to have better economics, higher reliability, improved safety, and proliferation-resistant characteristics in order to overcome the current concerns about nuclear power. Advanced reactors, now under development, may help to meet the demand for energy power of both developed and developing countries as well as for district heating, desalination and for process heat.The paper gives historical examples that illustrate the steps pursued from first research nuclear reactors to present advanced power reactors. Emphasis was laid upon the fact that the progress is due to the great discoveries of the nuclear scientists using the technological transfer.","","","","","","United States","2010-01-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1203; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 7. international conference of the Balkan Physical Union, Alexandroupolis (Greece), 9-13 Sep 2009; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3322384; (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1418-1423","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US10F9150101898","10.1063/1.3322384","","2010-12-30T00:00:00Z","21371444","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21371444","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1203"

Taking in to account the radioprotection problems, the only realistic solution seems to be the indirect cycle, where the energy transfer should be performed by a heat exchanger that must work at very high speed of the fluid. The heat exchanger will replace the classical burning room. We had performed a more precise theoretical study for the nuclear jet engine regarding the performances of the nuclear reactor, of the heat exchanger and of the jet engine. It was taken in to account that in the moment when the burning room is replaced by a heat exchanger, a new model for gasodynamic process from the engine must be performed.

"So how much will it cost to build a nuke?","","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COST ESTIMATION; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; POWER REACTORS; FORECASTING","Trying to get a better understanding of the different estimates of the cost of nuclear power, Prof. Francois Leveque of Mines ParisTech and Marcelo Saguan of Microeconomix examined seven studies published since 2000. They examined levelized cost, which captures the cost of electricity generation from nuclear reactors over the entire life cycle, including initial investment costs, operations and maintenance costs, cost of fuel, cost of capital, and decommissioning. The results, in 2007 euro/MWh, vary from 18 to 80. Making matters worse, more recent studies show an upward trend: the average value for studies published in 2003--05 is about 43 euro/MWh, while those published in 2007--09 average 63 euro2007/MWh. One reason for the different results is different assumptions about the main cost drivers and how they may vary over time. With the advent of third-generation nuclear reactors, numbers in the range of $1,000/kW (approx. 750 euro/kW) were being tossed around, suggesting a $1 billion investment for a 1,000 MW plant. A 2003 MIT study assumed an overnight cost of 1,750 euro/kW, with later studies raising the numbers to 3,000 euro/kW (approx. US$ 4,500). In 2008, Progress Energy Florida put the price tag for 2 new reactors it is planning to build on the Gulf Coast of Florida at $14 billion with another $3 billion for transmission and related expenses. Likewise, Florida Power & Light figures it would cost $20 billion for 2 new reactors at its Turkey Point site in Florida. These higher cost estimates and significant uncertainties about the true costs pose serious challenges to the competitiveness of nuclear power.","","Available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2010.01.003","","","","United States","2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Elsevier Ltd.

"Projections of U. S. GHG Reductions from Nuclear Power New Capacity Based on Historic Levels of Investment","Besmann, Theodore M","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; CAPACITY; CAPITAL; CAPITALIZED COST; CONSTRUCTION; EXPENDITURES; GREENHOUSE GASES; NUCLEAR ENERGY; NUCLEAR POWER; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; OPERATING LICENSES; PRODUCTION","Historical rates of capital investment in nuclear plant construction was used as a guide to estimate the rate of future capacity introduction. The magnitude of nuclear capacity was then used to determine the effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electrical production in the U.S. to 2050. Total capital investment in nuclear power plant construction for every U.S. nuclear unit from 1964 to 1990 were obtained and the total investment and divided by their construction period to provide a value for possible rate of investment. The total linear rate of capital expenditure over the entire period was determined as well as that for the period of peak construction from 1973 to 1985, $11.5 billion/y and $17.9 billion/y, respectively in 2004$. These were used with a variety of capital cost estimates for nuclear construction to obtain several scenarios for nuclear capacity additions. Total nuclear generation out to 2050 was calculated assuming current plants would be constrained by 60-year operating licenses (i.e., a single 20-year life extension). The effect on nuclear generating capacity was projected and the resultant impact on GHG emissions determined assuming nuclear would directly replace coal-fired generation. It was concluded that actually reductions in emissions would not be experienced until 2038, yet growth in emissions from electrical production would be slowed up through that point. Nuclear energy, therefore cannot have a dramatic short-term effect on emissions, as likely cannot any energy producing technology due to the significant time to introduce large-scale changes. Nuclear power, however, can have a major longer term impact on emissions, particularly under more favorable cost and investment conditions.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Specific precipitates that were evaluated included aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) and sodium aluminum silicate (SAS) prepared according to the procedures in WCAP-16530-NP, along with precipitates formed from injecting chemicals into the test loop according to the procedure used by one sump strainer test vendor for U.S. pressurized water reactors. The settling rates of the surrogate precipitates are strongly dependent on their particle size and are reasonably consistent with those expected from Stokes Law or colloid aggregation models. Head loss tests showed that AlOOH and SAS surrogates are quite effective in increasing the head loss across a perforated pump inlet strainer that has an accumulated fibrous debris bed. The characteristics of aluminum hydroxide precipitate using sodium aluminate were dependent on whether it was formed in high-purity or ordinary tap water and whether excess silicate was present or not.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Alloy 617, a candidate for use in heat exchangers, derives its strength from both solid solution strengthening and the precipitation of carbide particles. However, during creep, carbides that are supposed to retard grain boundary motion are found to dissolve and re-precipitate on boundaries in tension. To quantify the redistribution, we have used electron backscatter diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy to analyze the microstructure of 617 after creep testing at 900 and 1000°C. The data were analyzed with respect to location of the carbides (e.g., intergranular vs. intragranular), grain boundary character, and precipitate type (i.e., Cr-rich or Mo-rich). We find that grain boundary character is the most important factor in carbide distribution; some evidence of preferential distribution to boundaries in tension is also observed at higher applied stresses. Finally, the results suggest that the observed redistribution is due to the migration of carbides to the boundaries and not the migration of boundaries to the precipitates.","","","Idaho National Lab.

An important radioecological task associated with the late phase of the accident is to evaluate the dynamics of radionuclide mobility in soils. Identification of the variability (or invariability) in the radionuclide transfer parameters makes it possible to (1) accurately predict migration patterns and biological availability of radionuclides and (2) evaluate long-term exposure trends for the population who may reoccupy the remediated abandoned areas. In 1986-1987, a number of experimental plots were established within various tracts of the fallout plume to assist with the determination of the long-term dynamics of radionuclide vertical migration in the soils. The transfer parameters for {sup 137}Cs, {sup 90}Sr, and {sup 239,240}Pu in the soil profile, as well as their ecological half-time of the radionuclide residence (T{sub 1/2}{sup ecol}) values in the upper 5-cm thick soil layers of different grasslands were estimated at various times since the accident. Migration characteristics in the grassland soils tend to decrease as follows: {sup 90}Sr > {sup 137}Cs {ge} {sup 239,240}Pu. It was found that the {sup 137}Cs absolute T{sub 1/2}{sup ecol} values are 3-7 times higher than its radioactive decay half-life value. Therefore, changes in the exposure dose resulting from the soil deposited {sup 137}Cs now depend only on its radioactive decay. The {sup 90}Sr T{sub 1/2}{sup ecol} values for the 21st year after the fallout tend to decrease, indicating an intensification of its migration capabilities. This trend appears consistent with a pool of mobile {sup 90}Sr forms that grows over time due to destruction of the fuel particles.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-11-19T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environ.

In order to assess the feasibility of remediation following such an event, several issues would have to be considered, including the levels and characteristics of the radioactive contamination, the availability of the required resources to accomplish decontamination, and the planned future use of the city's structures and buildings. Presently little is known about the distribution, redistribution, and migration of radionuclides in an urban environment. However, Pripyat, a city substantially contaminated by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, may provide some answers. The main objective of this study was to determine the radionuclide distribution on a Pripyat multi-story building, which had not been previously decontaminated and therefore could reflect the initial fallout and its further natural redistribution on external surfaces. The 7-story building selected was surveyed from the ground floor to the roof on horizontal and vertical surfaces along seven ground-to-roof transections. Some of the results from this study indicate that the upper floors of the building had higher contamination levels than the lower floors. The authors consequently recommend that existing decontamination procedures for tall structures be re-examined and modified accordingly.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-11-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Health Physics","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2009-00762","DE-AC09-08SR22470","Journal ID: ISSN 0017-9078; HLTPAO; TRN: US0904632","","","2010-12-30T00:00:00Z","968324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/968324","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/968324","Health Physics","",""

Such conditions favor flashing-induced instabilities due to the large hydrostatic pressure drop induced by the tall chimney. Moreover, in novel NC-BWR designs the steam separation is performed in the steam separators which create large pressure drops at the chimney outlet, which effect on stability has not been investigated yet. In this work, flashing-induced oscillations occurring in a tall, bottom heated channel are numerically investigated by using a simple linear model with three regions and an accurate implementation for estimating the water properties. The model is used to investigate flashing-induced instabilities in a channel for different values of the core inlet friction value. The results are compared with experiments obtained by using the CIRCUS facility at the same conditions, showing a good agreement. In addition, the experiments on flashing-induced instabilities are presented in a novel manner allowing visualizing new details of the phenomenon numerical stability investigations on the effect of the friction distribution are also done. It is found that by increasing the total restriction in the channel the system is destabilized. In addition, the chimney outlet restriction has a stronger destabilizing effect than the core inlet restriction. A stable two-phase region is observed prior to the instabilities in the experiments and the numerical simulations which may help to pressurize the vessel of NC-BWRs and thus reducing the effects of flashing instabilities during start-up.

This can be seen in reactor analysis where analysts are interested in coupled flow, heat transfer and neutronics, and in fuel performance simulation where analysts are interested in thermomechanics with contact coupled to species transport and chemistry. These more ambitious simulations usually motivate some level of parallel computing. Many of the coupling efforts to date utilize simple 'code coupling' or first-order operator splitting, often referred to as loose coupling. While these approaches can produce answers, they usually leave questions of accuracy and stability unanswered. Additionally, the different physics often reside on separate grids which are coupled via simple interpolation, again leaving open questions of stability and accuracy. Utilizing state of the art mathematics and software development techniques we are deploying next generation tools for nuclear engineering applications. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method combined with physics-based preconditioning provide the underlying mathematical structure for our tools. JFNK is understood to be a modern multiphysics algorithm, but we are also utilizing its unique properties as a scale bridging algorithm. To facilitate rapid development of multiphysics applications we have developed the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).

The current study was undertaken in order to determine accurately the dissociation constants of the relevant amines at Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) operating conditions and to investigate the effect of sorption of two of these amines (morpholine and dimethylamine) by magnetite. The acid-dissociation equilibria of morpholine (MOR), dimethylamine (DMA) and ethanolamine (ETA) were measured potentiometrically with a hydrogen-electrode concentration cell (HECC) from 0 to 290 C in sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaTr) solutions at ionic strengths up to 1 mol {center_dot} kg{sup -1}. Magnetite surface titrations were performed at an ionic strength of 0.03 mol {center_dot} kg{sup -1} (NaTr medium) in the presence or absence of morpholine and dimethylamine buffers over a wide range of pH and total amine concentrations at 150-250 C.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Investigation of alternative layouts for the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle for a sodium-cooled fast reactor.","Moisseytsev, A; Sienicki, J J","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AVAILABILITY; BRAYTON CYCLE; BURNERS; CAPITALIZED COST; CARBON DIOXIDE; CLIMATES; COMPRESSION; COMPRESSORS; CRITICAL TEMPERATURE; DESIGN; EFFICIENCY; FAST REACTORS; HEAT EXCHANGERS; HEAT SINKS; PERFORMANCE; TEST REACTORS; TURBINES","Analyses of supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO{sub 2}) Brayton cycle performance have largely settled on the recompression supercritical cycle (or Feher cycle) incorporating a flow split between the main compressor downstream of heat rejection, a recompressing compressor providing direct compression without heat rejection, and high and low temperature recuperators to raise the effectiveness of recuperation and the cycle efficiency. Alternative cycle layouts have been previously examined by Angelino (Politecnico, Milan), by MIT (Dostal, Hejzlar, and Driscoll), and possibly others but not for sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) operating at relatively low core outlet temperature. Thus, the present authors could not be sure that the recompression cycle is an optimal arrangement for application to the SFR. To ensure that an advantageous alternative layout has not been overlooked, several alternative cycle layouts have been investigated for a S-CO{sub 2} Brayton cycle coupled to the Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) SFR preconceptual design having a 510 C core outlet temperature and a 470 C turbine inlet temperature to determine if they provide any benefit in cycle performance (e.g., enhanced cycle efficiency). No such benefits were identified, consistent with the previous examinations, such that attention was devoted to optimizing the recompression supercritical cycle. The effects of optimizing the cycle minimum temperature and pressure are investigated including minimum temperatures and/or pressures below the critical values. It is found that improvements in the cycle efficiency of 1% or greater relative to previous analyses which arbitrarily fixed the minimum temperature and pressure can be realized through an optimal choice of the combination of the minimum cycle temperature and pressure (e.g., for a fixed minimum temperature there is an optimal minimum pressure). However, this leads to a requirement for a larger cooler for heat rejection which may impact the tradeoff between efficiency and capital cost. In addition, for minimum temperatures below the critical temperature, a lower heat sink temperature is required the availability of which is dependent upon the climate at the specific plant site.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Between 1983 and 1992, the SMF was used in support of the Department of Energy (DOE)-funded Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) Materials Open Test Assembly (MOTA) program. In this program, metallurgical specimens were irradiated in FFTF and then sent to SMF for processing and storage in two cabinets. This effort was abruptly ended in early 1990s due to programmatic shifts within the DOE, leaving many specimens unexamined. In recent years, these specimens have become of high value to new DOE programs. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was tasked with retrieving specimens from one of the cabinets in support of fuel clad and duct development for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. Cesium contamination of the cell and failure of the overhead crane system utilized for opening the cabinets prevented PNNL from using the built-in hot cell equipment to gain access to the cabinets. PNNL designed and tested a lifting device to fit through a standard 10 inch diameter mechanical manipulator port in the SMF South Cell wall. The tool was successfully deployed in June 2008 with the support of Washington Closure Hanford.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"ENERGY EFFICIENCY LIMITS FOR A RECUPERATIVE BAYONET SULFURIC ACID DECOMPOSITION REACTOR FOR SULFUR CYCLE THERMOCHEMICAL HYDROGEN PRODUCTION","Gorensek, M; Edwards, T","08 HYDROGEN; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BENCHMARKS; COOLANTS; DESIGN; ELECTROLYSIS; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; GAS COOLED REACTORS; HEAT SOURCES; HEATING; HYDROGEN; HYDROGEN PRODUCTION; NUCLEAR POWER; SULFUR CYCLE; SULFURIC ACID; TARGETS","A recuperative bayonet reactor design for the high-temperature sulfuric acid decomposition step in sulfur-based thermochemical hydrogen cycles was evaluated using pinch analysis in conjunction with statistical methods. The objective was to establish the minimum energy requirement. Taking hydrogen production via alkaline electrolysis with nuclear power as the benchmark, the acid decomposition step can consume no more than 450 kJ/mol SO{sub 2} for sulfur cycles to be competitive. The lowest value of the minimum heating target, 320.9 kJ/mol SO{sub 2}, was found at the highest pressure (90 bar) and peak process temperature (900 C) considered, and at a feed concentration of 42.5 mol% H{sub 2}SO{sub 4}. This should be low enough for a practical water-splitting process, even including the additional energy required to concentrate the acid feed. Lower temperatures consistently gave higher minimum heating targets. The lowest peak process temperature that could meet the 450-kJ/mol SO{sub 2} benchmark was 750 C. If the decomposition reactor were to be heated indirectly by an advanced gas-cooled reactor heat source (50 C temperature difference between primary and secondary coolants, 25 C minimum temperature difference between the secondary coolant and the process), then sulfur cycles using this concept could be competitive with alkaline electrolysis provided the primary heat source temperature is at least 825 C. The bayonet design will not be practical if the (primary heat source) reactor outlet temperature is below 825 C.","","available","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2009-06-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","","Medium: ED","","SRNL-STI-2009-00136","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US1101437","10.1021/ie900310r","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","1009386","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1009386","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1009386","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry","",""

The reactor subunits are to be emplaced directly into the lunar regolith utilizing the regolith not just for shielding but as the reflector material to increase the neutron economy of the system. While a single subunit cannot achieve criticality by itself, coordinated placement of additional subunits will provide a critical reactor system for lunar surface power generation. A lunar regolith clustered-reactor system promotes reliability, safety, and ease of manufacture and testing at the cost of a slight increase in launch mass per rated power level and an overall reduction in neutron economy when compared to a single-reactor system. Additional subunits may be launched with future missions to increase the cluster size and power according to desired lunar base power demand and lifetime. The results address the potential uncertainties associated with the lunar regolith material and emplacement of the subunit systems. Physical distance between subunits within the clustered emplacement exhibits the most significant feedback regarding changes in overall system reactivity. Narrow, deep holes will be the most effective in reducing axial neutron leakage from the core. The variation in iron concentration in the lunar regolith can directly influence the overall system reactivity although its effects are less than the more dominant factors of subunit emplacement.","","","Idaho National Lab.

The much-discussed power-law segment often arises as a crossover between these two. We explain the variation of the distribution with region size and show that it is not universal.","","","","","","United States","2009-04-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physical Review Letters; Journal Volume: 102; Journal Issue: 16; Other Information: DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.168501; (c) 2009 The American Physical Society; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 168501-168501.4","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0031-9007; PRLTAO; TRN: US10A4498060185","10.1103/PHYSREVLETT.102.168501","","2010-08-02T00:00:00Z","21316651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21316651","","Physical Review Letters","16","102"

However, the effects of light water reactor (LWR) coolant environments were not explicitly considered in the development of the design curves. The existing fatigue-strain-versus-life ({var_epsilon}-N) data indicate potentially significant effects of LWR coolant environments on the fatigue resistance of pressure vessel and piping steels. Under certain environmental and loading conditions, fatigue lives in water relative to those in air can be a factor of 15 lower for austenitic stainless steels and a factor of {approx}30 lower for carbon and low-alloy steels. This paper reviews the current technical basis for the understanding of the fatigue of piping and pressure vessel steels in LWR environments. The existing fatigue {var_epsilon}-N data have been evaluated to identify the various material, environmental, and loading parameters that influence fatigue crack initiation and to establish the effects of key parameters on the fatigue life of these steels. Statistical models are presented for estimating fatigue life as a function of material, loading, and environmental conditions. An environmental fatigue correction factor for incorporating the effects of LWR environments into ASME Code fatigue evaluations is described. This paper also presents a critical review of the ASME Code fatigue design margins of 2 on stress (or strain) and 20 on life and assesses the possible conservatism in the current choice of design margins.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In particular, for this new generation of reactors, severe accidents are taken into account beyond the standard design basis accidents. Today, Areva's EPR meets all so-called 'generation III' safety requirements and was licensed by several nuclear safety authorities in the world.

The main objectives of the study are: 1) to establish a starting concept for the CBCL components specifications, and 2) to build a demonstrative simulator of CBCL. This preliminary design study is been developed around the NOELLE 60290 turbo machine. The actual nuclear reactor study is being conducted independently. Because of that, a conventional heat source is being used for the CBCL, in this preliminary design phase. This paper describes details of the CBCL mechanical design and the steady state simulator of the CBCL operating with NOELLE 60290 turbo machine. In principle, several gases are being considered as working fluid, as for instance: air, helium, nitrogen, CO2 and gas mixtures such as helium and xenon. However, for this first application pure helium will be used as working fluid. Simplified models of heat and mass transfer were developed to simulate thermal components. A new graphical interface was developed for the simulator to display the thermal process variables in steady state and to keep track of the modifications being implemented at the NOELLE 60290 turbo machine in order to build the CBCL. A set of new results are being produced. These new results help to establish the hot and cold source geometry allowing for price estimating costs for building the actual device. These fresh new results will be presented and discussed.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1103; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: SPESIF-2009: International technical forum on space, propulsion and energy sciences, Huntsville, AL (United States), 24-26 Feb 2009; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3115556; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 486-491","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US09A6481039376","10.1063/1.3115556","","2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","21293381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21293381","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1103"

The heat pipe is designed to be embedded in a composite radiator panel to spread waste heat delivered by a circulating pumped loop. The major challenge was managing the fluid inventory to balance the conflicting requirements of power capacity and freeze-thaw tolerance. A unique hybrid wick was designed to achieve the required thermal performance and yet store all the working fluid during idle periods in a freeze-thaw tolerant fashion. A non-condensable gas charge was used to boost power capacity at lower operating temperatures. Eighteen prototypes will be built and tested.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1103; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: SPESIF-2009: International technical forum on space, propulsion and energy sciences, Huntsville, AL (United States), 24-26 Feb 2009; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3115560; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51-56","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US09A6483039378","10.1063/1.3115560","","2013-05-13T00:00:00Z","21293383","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21293383","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1103"

The positron beam line is installed in a beam port that has a 30-cmx30-cm cross sectional view of the core. The positrons are created in a tungsten converter/moderator by pair-production using gamma rays produced in the reactor core and by neutron capture reactions in cadmium cladding surrounding the tungsten. Upon moderation, slow ({approx}3 eV) positrons that are emitted from the moderator are electrostatically extracted, focused and magnetically guided until they exit the reactor biological shield with 1-keV energy, approximately 3-cm beam diameter and an intensity exceeding 6x10{sup 8} positrons per second. A magnetic beam switch and transport system has been installed and tested that directs the beam into one of two spectrometers. The spectrometers are designed to implement state-of-the-art PALS and DBS techniques to perform positron and positronium annihilation studies of nanophases in matter.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1099; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: CAARI 2008: 12. international conference on application of accelerators in research and industry, Fort Worth, TX (United States), 10-15 Aug 2008; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3120175; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 862-865","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US09A6722037037","10.1063/1.3120175","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21289669","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21289669","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1099"

Although ZPPR is no longer operated as an active research reactor, its infrastructure (radiation shielding, safety systems, physical safeguards) and special nuclear material (SNM) inventory (variably enriched uranium and plutonium fuels available in metallic, oxide, alloy, and other forms) still make the facility a unique national resource for research and development activities involving the use of SNM. Recently INL has utilized this resource to serve as a test and evaluation facility for active interrogation research and development. This facility is currently hosting scoping experiments using neutron and x-ray radiation sources to characterize SNM active interrogation signatures and to develop tools and techniques to detect and identify shielded SNM. This paper presents an overview of the facility's infrastructure and assets and describes recent active interrogation experiments that have taken place using high-energy x-ray sources and compact electronic neutron generators.","","","","","","United States","2009-03-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1099; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: CAARI 2008: 12. international conference on application of accelerators in research and industry, Fort Worth, TX (United States), 10-15 Aug 2008; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3120120; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 647-651","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US09A6668036983","10.1063/1.3120120","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21289615","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21289615","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","1099"

ABR is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that is used to consume transuranic elements resulting from the reprocessing of light water reactor spent nuclear fuel. ABR-1000 [1000 MW(thermal)] is a fast reactor concept created at Argonne National Laboratory to be used as a reference concept for various future trade-offs. ABR-1000 meets the GNEP goals although it uses what is considered base sodium fast reactor technology for its systems and components. One of the considerations of any fast reactor plant concept is the ability to perform fuel-handling operations with new and spent fast reactor fuel. The transmutation fuel proposed as the ABR fuel has a very little experience base, and thus, this paper investigates a fuel-handling concept and potential issues of handling fast reactor fuel containing minor actinides. In this study, two thermal analyses supporting a conceptual design study on the ABR-1000 fuel-handling system were carried out. One analysis investigated passive dry spent fuel storage, and the other analysis investigated a fresh fuel shipping cask. Passive dry storage can be made suitable for the ABR-1000 spent fuel storage with sodium-bonded metal fuel. The thermal analysis shows that spent fast reactor fuel with a decay heat of 2 kW or less can be stored passively in a helium atmosphere. The 2-kW value seems to be a reasonable and practical level, and a combination of reasonably-sized in-sodium storage followed by passive dry storage could be a candidate for spent fuel storage for the next-generation sodium-cooled reactor with sodium-bonded metal fuel. Requirements for the shipping casks for minor actinide-bearing fuel with a high decay heat level are also discussed in this paper. The shipping cask for fresh sodium-cooled-reactor fuel should be a dry type to reduce the reaction between residual moisture on fresh fuel and the sodium coolant. The cladding temperature requirement is maintained below the creep temperature limit to avoid any damage before core installation. The thermal analysis shows that a helium gas-filled cask can accommodate ABR-1000 fresh minor actinide-bearing fuel with 700-W decay heat. The above analysis results revealed the overall requirement for minor actinide-bearing metal fuel handling. The information is thought to be helpful in the design of the ABR-1000 and future sodium-cooled-reactor fuel-handling system.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The advanced burner reactor (ABR) is a fast reactor concept which supports the GNEP fuel cycle system. Since the integral fast reactor (IFR) and advanced liquid-metal reactor (ALMR) projects were terminated in 1994, there has been no major development on sodium-cooled fast reactors in the United States. Therefore, in support of the GNEP fast reactor program, the history of sodium-cooled reactor development was reviewed to support the initiation of this technology within the United States and to gain an understanding of the technology gaps that may still remain for sodium fast reactor technology. The fuel-handling system is a key element of any fast reactor design. The major functions of this system are to receive, test, store, and then load fresh fuel into the core; unload from the core; then clean, test, store, and ship spent fuel. Major requirements are that the system must be reliable and relatively easy to maintain. In addition, the system should be designed so that it does not adversely impact plant economics from the viewpoints of capital investment or plant operations. In this gap analysis, information on fuel-handling operating experiences in the following reactor plants was carefully reviewed: EBR-I, SRE, HNPF, Fermi, SEFOR, FFTF, CRBR, EBR-II, DFR, PFR, Rapsodie, Phenix, Superphenix, KNK, SNR-300, Joyo, and Monju. The results of this evaluation indicate that a standardized fuel-handling system for a commercial fast reactor is yet to be established. However, in the past sodium-cooled reactor plants, most major fuel-handling components-such as the rotatable plug, in-vessel fuel-handling machine, ex-vessel fuel transportation cask, ex-vessel sodium-cooled storage, and cleaning stations-have accumulated satisfactory construction and operation experiences. In addition, two special issues for future development are described in this report: large capacity interim storage and transuranic-bearing fuel handling.","","","Argonne National Lab.

A prismatic thermal High Temperature Gas Reactor (HTGR) and the novel concept of quadruple isotropic (QUADRISO) coated particles, designed at the Argonne National Laboratory, have been used for the study. In absorbing QUADRISO particles, a burnable poison layer surrounds the central fuel kernel to flatten the reactivity curve as a function of time. At the beginning of life, the fuel in the QUADRISO particles is hidden from neutrons, since they get absorbed in the burnable poison before they reach the fuel kernel. Only when the burnable poison depletes, neutrons start streaming into the fuel kernel inducing fission reactions and compensating the fuel depletion of ordinary TRISO particles. In fertile QUADRISO particles, the absorber layer is replaced by natural thorium with the purpose of flattening the excess of reactivity by the thorium resonances and producing {sup 233}U. The above configuration has been compared with a configuration where fissile (neptunium-plutonium oxide from Light Water Reactors irradiated fuel) and fertile (natural thorium oxide) fuels are homogeneously mixed in the kernel of ordinary TRISO particles. For the {sup 233}U utilization, the core has been equipped with europium oxide absorbing QUADRISO particles.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The guides have curved-straight arrangements in the horizontal plane, employing horizontally or vertically defocusing and focusing sections in some cases to improve transmission efficiency or for beam reshaping. The horizontally curved sections eliminate direct lines of sight between the source and the experimental stations, and the outer (concave) surfaces generally have higher critical angles than the inner (convex) surfaces. These features result in well-filtered cold neutron beams with no intensity losses at shorter wavelengths with respect to curved guides having the higher critical angle coatings on both surfaces. For all guides the critical angle of the outer coating of the curved section is selected to achieve a desirable characteristic wavelength, consistent with the instrument requirements. On guides where the scattering-plane beam divergence must be strictly limited, the inner radial coatings of the curved sections and the side coatings and lengths of the final straight sections are chosen to produce the desired beam divergence while the outer radial coating is selected so as to obtain a spatial-angular uniformity of the transmitted beam that is not achievable using a curved guide alone. The long-wavelength transmission of such guides tends to exceed that of equivalent straight guides using crystal filters.","","","","","","United States","2009-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Review of Scientific Instruments; Journal Volume: 80; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.3077144; (c) 2009 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 023101-023101.10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0034-6748; RSINAK; TRN: US09A6289016237","10.1063/1.3077144","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21266747","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21266747","","Review of Scientific Instruments","2","80"

The United States is currently implementing license extensions of 20 years on many plants, and consideration is now being given to the concept of ""life-beyond-60"", license extension from 60 to 80 years and potentially longer. In almost all countries with NPPs, authorities are looking at some form of license renewal program. In support of NPP license renewal over the past decade, various national and international programs have been initiated. This paper discusses stressor-based prognostics and its role as part of emerging trends in Proactive Management of Materials Degradation (PMMD) applied to nuclear power plant structures, systems and components (SSC). The paper concisely explains the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) program in PMMD, the basic principles of PMMD and its relationship to advanced diagnostics and prognostics. It then provides an assessment of the state of maturity for diagnostic and prognostic technologies, including NDE and related technologies for damage assessment, and the current trend to move from condition-based maintenance to on-line monitoring for advanced diagnostics and stressor-based prognostics. This development in technology requires advances in sensors; better understanding of what and how to measure within a nuclear power plant; enhanced data interrogation, communication and integration; new prediction models for damage/aging evolution; system integration for real-world deployments and quantification of uncertainties in what are inherently ill-posed problems. Stressor-based analysis is based upon understanding which stressor characteristics (e.g., pressure transients) provide a percussive indication that can be used for mapping subsequent damage due to a specific degradation mechanism. The resulting physical damage and the associated decrease in asset performance start with the application of a stressor to the component. The design engineer sets the desired operational stressor intensity level so that the degradation in the physical state of the component occurs slowly enough for the equipment to last for its required design life. In general, when the design limit of a stressor is exceeded (during operation), the component life expectancy starts to shorten. Conversely, careful control of operational parameters can enable extension of component life beyond that normally expected. For systems which were conservatively designed (such as nuclear power plants), the premise of the prognostic methodology is that a relationship can be derived that will allow a much more accurate projection of the remaining useful life. This is achieved by focusing on trending the stressor characterics rather than trending a performance metric. In this trend analysis example, the slope of the trended parameter is thought to give a measure of the degradation rate of the component performance. This is assumed to be a function of the rate of decline in the physical integrity of the equipment. Experience from measurements has shown this assumption to be true if one accounts for the nonlinearity which can occur between physical attributes and their effects on performance.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Quasi-reflected interface conditions are formulated to partially decouple periodic lattice effects from global flux gradients. The starting point is the finite subelement form of the variational nodal code VARIANT that eliminates fuel-coolant homogenization through the use of heterogeneous nodes. The interface spherical harmonics expansions that couple pin-cell-sized nodes are divided into low-order and high-order terms, and reflected interface conditions are applied to the high-order terms. Combined with an integral transport method within the node, the new approach dramatically reduces both the formation time and the dimensions of the nodal response matrices and leads to sharply reduced memory requirements and computational time. The method is applied to the two-dimensional C5G7 problem, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency pressurized water reactor benchmark containing mixed oxide (MOX) and UO{sub 2} fuel assemblies, as well as to a three-dimensional MOX fuel assembly. Results indicate the new approach results in very little loss of accuracy relative to the corresponding full spherical harmonics expansions while reducing computational times by well over an order of magnitude.","","","Argonne National Lab.

For the High Average Power Laser (HAPL) inertial fusion power program, dielectric mirrors are being considered for reflecting the laser beam through the reactor structure. This paper discusses the neutron exposure expected in the HAPL dielectric mirrors and an experimental program comprised of fabrication of advanced dielectric mirrors and testing of these mirrors exposed to prototypical irradiation environment. The specific purpose of the fabrication program was to screen mirror types for their irradiation performance. Specifically, three dielectric mirror types were fabricated to reflect at the KrF laser wavelength of 248 nm and these mirrors irradiated at ~ 175 C in the dose range of 0.001 to 0.1 x 1025 n/m2 (E>0.1 MeV.) The neutron dose range spans the HAPL fluences expected based on calculations from with a recently developed 3-D Monte Carlo code. Mirror reflectivity was measured on as-irradiated and on 300 and 400 C vacuum annealed mirrors. The best performing mirror overall, the alumina/silica multilayer mirror, did not appear to have degraded reflectivity in the as-irradiated or the as-irradiated and annealed conditions. For the highest dose, annealed condition degradation was observed in the hafnia silica mirror. Additionally, laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) was measured on the best performing mirror (the alumina/silica mirror) with a resulting threshold of > 1 J/cm2, and little effect of the neutron irradiation. These findings are somewhat in contradiction to earlier work on dielectric mirrors, which suggested poor performance of dielectric mirrors at an order of magnitude lower neutron dose. In conclusion, the current findings, while preliminary, suggest the possibility for using dielectric mirrors to much high dose levels.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Most of the reviewed data were produced in connection with the international research effort supporting High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) projects in the 1970s and 1980s. Topics considered included microstructural changes, hardness, tensile properties, toughness, creep-rupture, fatigue, and crack growth. It became clear that, for the long-time, very high temperature conditions of the Gen IV reactors, a significant effort would be needed to fully understand and characterize property changes. Several topics for further research were recommended.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, irradiation-performance data for these alloys is either limited or non-existent. A review is presented of the irradiation-performance of a group of Ni-base alloys based upon data from fast breeder reactor programs conducted in the 1975 1985 timeframe with emphasis on the mechanisms involved in the loss of high temperature ductility and the breakdown in swelling resistance with increasing neutron dose. The implications of these data for the performance of the Gen IV Ni-base alloys are discussed and possible pathways to mitigate the effects of irradiation on alloy performance are outlined. A radical approach to designing radiation damage-resistant Ni alloys based upon recent advances in mechanical alloying is also described.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Pu recycling as fuel, and transmutation of Minor Actinides (MA: Np, Am, and in some concepts also Cm) in reactors and/or MA burners are the steps considered to achieve this goal. U-free compounds are considered as matrices for Pu, MA burning. In some cases, these matrices are envisaged also for the conditioning and immobilization of radionuclides in final disposal concepts. The list of properties of a good inert matrix includes good chemical compatibility with the actinides, easy and economical processes of fabrication and, if required, reprocessing, and good thermo-mechanical performance in-pile, in terms of thermal transport, swelling and high temperature stability. In addition, the material must retain the good properties under the cumulative effect of radiation damage, and fission product accumulation. Since good radiation resistance materials usually exhibit poor thermal transport, in some concepts the actinides are stabilized in a host phase (e.g. zirconia) dispersed in a high thermal conductivity matrix (either ceramic or metallic).","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

For the estimation of an effective dose from natural sources were used measurements of dosimetric and gamma spectrometric characteristics of photon fields, (performed in the area of NPP Temelin since year 2000) and data from the Czech Republic radiometric chart, including the results from radon volume activity measurements in dwellings. For gamma spectrometric measurements in situ were selected two methodologies and for measurement were used corresponding types of equipment (Tesla NB3201 and spectrometer NaI(TI) 3''x3'') at selected locations within the monitored area: i) determination of air kerma rate (through direct measurement and by calculationfrom spectrometric data); ii) measurement of photon spectra by an scintillating spectrometer. For a dose assessment from artificial sources resulting from past or present operation of NPP Temelin, were used records from all so far performed laboratory and field measurements of NPP releases, food baskets and also results of a 6 year ecosystem monitoring in the surrounding area of NPP Temelin. The ecosystem monitoring is based on studying the contamination of the following bioindicators: forest humus, Pine bark, Schreber's Moss, the Bay Bolete (mushroom) and forest berries. Each year 220 samples are collected and mass activity (Bq/kg) for eventual contaminants is determined using laboratory gamma spectroscopy. For measurements is used a coaxial HPGe detector, with samples in the geometry of 'Marinelli' container. For evaluation of the laboratory results obtained is used trend analysis. The above described monitoring has been performed from the year 2000 until now (the year 2000 is pre-operational). In all measured laboratory spectra, of all analyzed samples, were not identified any non-natural radionuclides, with the exception of {sup 137}Cs, for which maesured activities correspond, within allowed measurement error, to the conditions before the start of NPP Temelin operation.","","","","","","United States","2008-08-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 1034; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: NRE-VIII: 8.

The method proposed is based on the developing of computing models for accountancy of the mobile tritium inventory in the separation processes, of the stored tritium and of the trapped tritium inventory in the structure of the process system components. The configuration of the detritiation process is a combination of isotope catalytic exchange between water and hydrogen (LPCE) and the cryogenic distillation of hydrogen isotopes (CD). The computing model for tritium inventory in the LPCE process and the CD process will be developed basing on mass transfer coefficients in catalytic isotope exchange reactions and in dual-phase system (liquid-vapour) of hydrogen isotopes distillation process. Accounting of tritium inventory stored in metallic hydride will be based on in-bed calorimetry. Estimation of the trapped tritium inventory can be made by subtraction of the mobile and stored tritium inventories from the global tritium inventory of the plant area. Determinations of the global tritium inventory of the plant area will be made on a regular basis by measuring any tritium quantity entering or leaving the plant area. This methodology is intended to be applied to the Heavy Water Detritiation Pilot Plant from ICIT Rm. Valcea (Romania) and to the Cernavoda Tritium Removal Facility (which will be built in the next 5-7 years).

The station operates a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) to reduce and maintain low tritium levels in the Moderator and Heat Transport heavy water systems of Ontario's CANDU fleet by extracting, concentrating, immobilizing and storing as a metal tritide. Minimizing tritium releases to the environment is of paramount importance to ensure that dose to the public is as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and to maintain credibility with the Public. Tritium is removed from the Cryogenic Distillation System to the Tritium Immobilization System (TIS) glove box via a transfer line that is protected by a rupture disc and relief valve. An overpressure event in 2003 had caused the rupture disc to blow, resulting in the release of a significant quantity of elemental tritium into the relief valve discharge line, which ties into the contaminated exhaust system. As a result of a few similar events occurring over a number of years of TRF operation, the released elemental tritium would have been converted to tritium oxide in the presence of a stagnant moist air environment in the stainless steel discharge line. A significant amount of tritium oxide hold-up in the discharge line was anticipated. To minimize any further releases to the environment, a Bubbler System was designed to remove and recover the tritium from the discharge line. This paper summarizes the results of several Bubbler recovery runs that were made over a period of a month. Approximately 3500 Ci of tritium oxide and 230 Ci of elemental tritium were removed and collected. The tritium contained in the water produced from the Bubbler system was later safely recovered in the station's downgraded D{sub 2}O clean-up and recovery system.

The station has been operating a Tritium Removal Facility (TRF) and a D{sub 2}O station Upgrading Plant (SUP) since 1989. Both facilities were designed with a Distributed Control System (DCS) and programmable logic controllers (PLC) for process control. This control system was replaced with a DCS only, in 1998. A dynamic plant simulator was developed for the Darlington TRF (DTRF) and the SUP, as part of the computer control system replacement. The simulator was used to test the new software, required to eliminate the PLCs. The simulator is now used for operator training and testing of process control software changes prior to field installation. Dynamic simulation will be essential for the ITER isotope separation system, where the process is more dynamic than the relatively steady-state DTRF process. This paper describes the development and application of the DTRF and SUP dynamic simulator, its benefits, architecture, and the operational experience with the simulator.

The experimental system for developing an effective tritium recovery technique was developed and tritium recovery experiments using Ar gas or Ar gas with 10-10000 ppm oxygen gas were performed using D{sub 2} gas instead of tritium gas. It was found that deuterium permeation through two membranes decreased by installing the double pipe concept with Ar gas. By introducing Ar gas with 10000 ppm oxygen gas, the concentration of deuterium permeation through two membranes decreased by more than 1/200, compared with the one pipe concept, indicating that most of the deuterium was scavenged by Ar gas or reacted with oxygen to form a hydroxide. However, most of the hydroxide was trapped at the surface of the membranes because of the short duration of the experiment.

This type of reactor is attractive because it offers higher thermal efficiency and lower reactivity with the primary coolant. This program consists of two activities; development of tritium permeation barriers in the heat exchanger tubes and development of tritium removal method from the SC-CO{sub 2}. For permeation reduction, a glassy coating was developed as the tritium permeation barrier for the SC-CO{sub 2} system. Experimental results showed the physical and chemical integrity of the coating for 100 hours soaking in the SC-CO{sub 2}. Significant permeation reduction of 1/20 to 1/60 are obtained. But, further permeation reduction is desired through a new coating technique development, since the permeation reduction at lower temperatures is small.

Recently, a study on the tritium handling system for recovery of the tritium collected from the WTRF was started. Some tritium would enter the steel of the container walls and subsequently decay to helium. This helium can deteriorate the mechanical properties of the material of the tritium handling system. To evaluate the tritium and helium inventory in the stainless steel wall of this system, the time-dependent diffusion equation was developed, solved and the results are presented in this paper. These results were compared to previous work that evaluated the tritium inventory in the stainless steel wall of 50-L tritium containers. Tritium and helium concentration profiles and the corresponding inventories were evaluated with respect to the various parameters such as exposure time, temperature, and partial pressure. After 24 years, the helium inventory in the wall of the tritium handling system exceeds the tritium inventory.

Full energy chains were considered because accidents can take place at every stage of the chain. Comparative analyses for the years 1969-2000 included a total of 1870 severe ({&gt;=} 5 fatalities) accidents, amounting to 81,258 fatalities. Although 79.1% of all accidents and 88.9% of associated fatalities occurred in less developed, non-OECD countries, industrialized OECD countries dominated insured losses (78.0%), reflecting their substantially higher insurance density and stricter safety regulations. Aggregated indicators and frequency-consequence (F-N) curves showed that energy-related accident risks in non-OECD countries are distinctly higher than in OECD countries. Hydropower in non-OECD countries and upstream stages within fossil energy chains are most accident-prone. Expected fatality rates are lowest for Western hydropower and nuclear power plants; however, the maximum credible consequences can be very large. Total economic damages due to severe accidents are substantial, but small when compared with natural disasters. Similarly, external costs associated with severe accidents are generally much smaller than monetized damages caused by air pollution.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Human and Ecological Risk Assessment; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 947-973","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1080-7039; HERAFR; TRN: 090200266","10.1080/10807030802387556","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","21126129","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126129","","Human and Ecological Risk Assessment","5","14"

The reason is the excess of gamma rays in the neutron beam. To improve radiation performances of the NR system, a stainless steal hollow conical cylinder is introduced at the bottom of the facility beam port, this filter reduce gamma infiltration through the edges of the NR structure without disturbing neutron beam arriving from the in pool divergent collimator. First results confirm our prediction; a gamma rays diminution and a relatively stable neutron flux at the point object are confirmed, consequently the n/{gamma} ratio reaches a value of 2.104 n/cm{sup 2} mR. Radiograms obtained by using the direct exposure method reveal the feasibility of the technique in the new NR configuration facility, but a weak resolution and contrast of the image is observed. In this paper, we describe a procedure to improve the image quality obtained by direct exposure technique. The process consists of using digitized images obtained by several exposure techniques (NR, gamma radiography or X radiography) for a comparison study and then better image definition can be attained.","","","","","","United States","2008-03-17T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 989; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on neutron and X-ray scattering 2007, Serpong and Bandung (Indonesia), 23-31 Jul 2007; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2906061; (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 187-189","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B1554017503","10.1063/1.2906061","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21136849","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21136849","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","989"

The library, released by the U.S. Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in December 2006, contains data primarily for reactions with incident neutrons, protons, and photons on almost 400 isotopes. The new evaluations are based on both experimental data and nuclear reaction theory predictions. The principal advances over the previous ENDF/B-VI library are the following: (1) New cross sections for U, Pu, Th, Np and Am actinide isotopes, with improved performance in integral validation criticality and neutron transmission benchmark tests; (2) More precise standard cross sections for neutron reactions on H, {sup 6}Li, {sup 10}B, Au and for {sup 235,238}U fission, developed by a collaboration with the IAEA and the OECD/NEA Working Party on Evaluation Cooperation (WPEC); (3) Improved thermal neutron scattering; (4) An extensive set of neutron cross sections on fission products developed through a WPEC collaboration; (5) A large suite of photonuclear reactions; (6) Extension of many neutron- and proton-induced reactions up to an energy of 150 MeV; (7) Many new light nucleus neutron and proton reactions; (8) Post-fission beta-delayed photon decay spectra; (9) New radioactive decay data; and (10) New methods developed to provide uncertainties and covariances, together with covariance evaluations for some sample cases. The paper provides an overview of this library, consisting of 14 sublibraries in the same, ENDF-6 format, as the earlier ENDF/B-VI library. We describe each of the 14 sublibraries, focusing on neutron reactions. Extensive validation, using radiation transport codes to simulate measured critical assemblies, show major improvements: (a) The long-standing underprediction of low enriched U thermal assemblies is removed; (b) The {sup 238}U, {sup 208}Pb, and {sup 9}Be reflector biases in fast systems are largely removed; (c) ENDF/B-VI.8 good agreement for simulations of highly enriched uranium assemblies is preserved; (d) The underprediction of fast criticality of {sup 233,235}U and {sup 239}Pu assemblies is removed; and (e) The intermediate spectrum critical assemblies are predicted more accurately.

These scenarios were shown to be risk-dominant in PWRs. The major insights gained from a set of experiments into such aerodynamics are summarized in this paper. A scaled-down mock-up with representative dimensions of a real SG was built. Two-dimensional (2D) PIV technique was used to characterize the flow field in the space between the breach and the neighbor tubes in the gas flow range investigated (Re{sub D} = 0.8-2.7 x 10{sup 5}). Pitot tube measurements and CFD simulations were used to discuss and complement PIV data. The results, reported mainly in terms of velocity and turbulent intensity profiles, show that jet penetration and gas entrainment are considerably enhanced when increasing Re{sub D}. The presence of tubes was observed to distort the jet shape and to foster gas entrainment with respect to a jet expansion free of tubes. Turbulence intensity level close to the breach increases linearly with Re{sub D}. Account of this information into aerosol modeling will enhance predictive capability of inertial impaction and turbulent deposition equations.

Sensitivity analyses are described that cover a wide spectrum of conditions affecting outcomes of the postulated accident sequences, for both prismatic and pebble-bed core designs. The major factors affecting potential core damage are the size and location of primary system leaks, flow path resistances, the core temperature distribution, and the long-term availability of oxygen in the incoming gas from a confinement building. Typically, all the incoming oxygen entering the core area is consumed within the reactor vessel, so it is more a matter of where, not whether, oxidation occurs. An air ingress model with example scenarios and means for mitigating damage are described. Representative designs of modular HTGRs included here are a 400-MW(th) pebble-bed reactor (PBR), and a 600-MW(th) prismatic-core modular reactor (PMR) design such as the gas-turbine modular helium reactor (GT-MHR).","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The use of PCA allows the reduction of the 9-dimensional data (isotopic concentrations) into a 3-dimensional approximation, giving a visual representation of the changes in nuclear fuel composition with burnup. Real-world variation in the concentrations of {sup 234}U and {sup 236}U in the fresh (unirradiated) fuel was accounted for. The effects of reprocessing were also simulated. The results suggest that, 15 even after reprocessing, Pu isotopes can be used to determine both the type of reactor and the initial fuel composition with good discrimination. Finally, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PSLDA) was investigated as a substitute for PCA.

It opens by an easily understood introduction to nuclear fission energy physics, starting with some history, including the achievements of the Kharkov nuclear physics school. Attention has been given to the development of fission theory, the Strutinsky theory, and the possible use of “nonstandard” fissile elements. The evolution of the design of nuclear reactors, including the merits and demerits of various structures used worldwide, is given in detail. A detailed description of nuclear power plants operating in Ukraine and their (large!) contribution to Ukraine’s total electricity production as compared with other countries is presented. A comparative evaluation of different energy sources influencing environment contamination and the pollution caused by the Chernobyl accident are presented. The lessons of the Chernobyl accident are summarized, including the features of the shelter (“Sarkofag”) covering the remaining of the power plant fourth block and some examples of calculations of the radioactive evolution of the station’s fuel-containing mass (by authors of the present review). The evolution of traditional nuclear reactors designs set forth under the separate heading of next-generation reactors including new projects such as subcritical assemblies controlled by an external beam of particles (neutrons and protons). The Feoktistov reactor operation and the possibility of its realization are discussed among the new ideas.","","Available from http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1134/S1063779607060056","","","","United States","2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physics of Particles and Nuclei; Journal Volume: 38; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 795-826","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-7796; TRN: US19N0066014890","10.1134/S1063779607060056","","2021-03-31T00:00:00Z","22974848","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22974848","","Physics of Particles and Nuclei","6","38"

In the course of remediation activities, large volumes of radioactive waste were generated and placed in temporary near surface waste-storage and disposal facilities. Trench and landfill type facilities were created from 1986 to 1987 in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone at distances 0.5 to 15 km from the NPP site. This large number of facilities was established without proper design documentation, engineered barriers, or hydrogeological investigations and they do not meet contemporary waste-safety requirements. Immediately following the accident, a Shelter was constructed over the destroyed reactor; in addition to uncertainties in stability at the time of its construction, structural elements of the Shelter have degraded as a result of corrosion. The main potential hazard of the Shelter is a possible collapse of its top structures and release of radioactive dust into the environment. A New Safe Confinement (NSC) with a 100-years service life is planned to be built as a cover over the existing Shelter as a longer-term solution. The construction of the NSC will enable the dismantlement of the current Shelter, removal of highly radioactive, fuel-containing materials from Unit 4, and eventual decommissioning of the damaged reactor. More radioactive waste will be generated during NSC construction, possible Shelter dismantling, removal of fuel containing materials, and decommissioning of Unit 4. The future development of the Exclusion Zone depends on the future strategy for converting Unit 4 into an ecologically safe system, i.e., the development of the NSC, the dismantlement of the current Shelter, removal of fuel containing material, and eventual decommissioning of the accident site. To date, a broadly accepted strategy for radioactive waste management at the reactor site and in the Exclusion Zone, and especially for high-level and long-lived waste, has not been developed.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Study results indicate that radionuclide concentrations in the Pripyat and Dnieper rivers were well above the drinking water limits immediately after the Chernobyl accident, but have decreased significantly in subsequent years due to flashing, burying, and decay. Because high concentrations of 90Sr and 137Cs, the major radionuclides affecting human health through aquatic pathways, are associated with flooding, an earthen dike was constructed along the Pripyat River in its most contaminated floodplain. The dike was successful in reducing the 90Sr influx to the river by half. A 100-m-high movable dome called the New Safe Confinement is planned to cover the Chernobyl Shelter (formally called the sarcophagus) that was erected shortly after the accident. The NSC will reduce radionuclide contamination further in these rivers and nearby groundwater; however, even if the Chernobyl Shelter collapses before the NSC is built, the resulting peak concentrations of 90Sr and 137Cs in the Dnieper River would still be below the drinking water limits.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The present paper describes the freezing behavior of molten metal during interaction with a structure with a view to the safety of LMRs. In this study, Wood's metal (melting point 78.8 C) was used as a simulant melt, while stainless steel and copper were used as freezing structures. A series of simulation experiments was conducted to study the freezing behavior of Wood's metal during pouring on to the freezing structures immersed in a coolant. In the experiments, simulant melt was poured into a stainless steel tube and finally ejected into a coolant through a nozzle so as to observe the freezing behavior of the molten metal. The penetration length and width were measured in the air cooled experiments, whereas penetration length and the proportion of adhering frozen metal were measured in water coolant experiment. The melt flow and distribution were observed in both types of experiment using a high-speed video camera. Distinct freezing modes were observed in the water coolant experiments, whereas only one freezing mode with a longer melt penetration was found in air coolant experiments. The present result will be utilized to create a relevant database for the verification of reactor safety analysis codes.

All three types have all been demonstrated capable of fuel utilization at or above 200 GWd/MTHM. To varying degrees, life-limiting phenomena for each type have been identified and investigated, and there are no disqualifying safety-related fuel behaviors. All three fuel types appear capable of meeting SFR fuel requirements, with reliability of MOX and metal fuel well established. Improvements in irradiation performance of cladding and duct alloys has been a key development in moving these fuel designs toward higher-burnup potential. Selection of one fuel system over another will depend on circumstances particular to the application and on issues other than fuel performance, such as fabrication cost or overall system safety performance.","","","Idaho National Lab.

T.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS","Concepts for the next generation of nuclear power reactors designed to meet increasing world-wide demand for energy include water-cooled, gas-cooled, and liquid-metal-cooled reactors. Reactor conditions for several designs offer challenges for engineers and designers concerning which structural and cladding materials to use. Depending on operating conditions, some of the designs favor the use of elevated-temperature high-chromium ferritic/martensitic steels for in-core and out-of core applications. This class of commercial steels has been investigated in previous work on international fast reactor and fusion reactor research programs. More recently, international fusion reactor research programs have developed and tested elevated-temperature reduced-activation steels. Steels from these fission and fusion programs will provide reference materials for future fission applications. In addition, new elevated-temperature steels have been developed in recent years for conventional power systems that also need to be considered for the next generation of nuclear reactors.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Virtually all of the ethanol used for transportation has been produced from corn. During the period of fuel ethanol growth, corn farming productivity has increased dramatically, and energy use in ethanol plants has been reduced by almost by half. The majority of corn ethanol plants are powered by natural gas. However, as natural gas prices have skyrocketed over the last several years, efforts have been made to further reduce the energy used in ethanol plants or to switch from natural gas to other fuels, such as coal and wood chips. In this paper, we examine nine corn ethanol plant types--categorized according to the type of process fuels employed, use of combined heat and power, and production of wet distiller grains and solubles. We found that these ethanol plant types can have distinctly different energy and greenhouse gas emission effects on a full fuel-cycle basis. In particular, greenhouse gas emission impacts can vary significantly--from a 3% increase if coal is the process fuel to a 52% reduction if wood chips are used. Our results show that, in order to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission benefits, researchers need to closely examine and differentiate among the types of plants used to produce corn ethanol so that corn ethanol production would move towards a more sustainable path.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The material was removed from areas adjacent to cracks that were observed after ~20 years of operation. Using the plant operational history and a variety of measurements of various radioisotopes or non-radioactive transmutation products produced by irradiation, it was possible to determine the integrated flux spectra experienced by the cracked region and to specify the accumulated displacement dose. Dose estimates on two separate specimens adjacent to the cracks were found to average 1.5 ± 0.2 dpa, possibly reflecting some uncertainty in measurement but more likely suggesting a small gradient in neutron flux-spectra within the section from which the various analysis specimens were cut. This report demonstrates that it is possible to examine defective components lying outside of the core region and where neutron flux-spectra are not well known, and to use the induced transmutation products to determine the neutron exposure with some confidence by using the examined specimen as its own dosimeter.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An envisioned lunar outpost will provide living quarters for initially 5- 10 astronauts for up to 2 weeks, and latter for science experiments, and recovery of mineral and indigenous resources for the day-to-day operation and production of propellant. These activities would require electrical and thermal powers in the order of 10's - 100's of kilowatts 24/7. Potential power options include photovoltaic, requiring massive batteries or fuel cells for energy storage during the long nights on the moon, and nuclear reactor power systems, which are much more compact and operate independent of the sun. This paper examines the benefit of using the lunar regolith as a supplemental neutron reflector on decreasing the launch mass of the Sectored Compact Reactor (SCoRe-S), developed at the Institute for Space and Nuclear Power Studies. In addition to providing at least $2.00 of hot-clean excess reactivity at the beginning of life, various SCoRe-S concepts investigated in this paper are at least $1.00 sub-critical when shutdown, and when the bare reactor cores are submerged in wet sand and flooded with seawater, following a launch abort accident. Design calculations performed using MCNP5 confirmed that using lunar regolith as supplementary reflector reduces the launch mass of the SCoRe-S cores by {approx} 34% - 35%, or 150 - 200 kg, while satisfying the above reactivity requirements.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 880; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International forum-STAIF 2007: 11. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 24. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 5. conference on human/robotic technology and the vision for space exploration; 5. symposium on space colonization; 4. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 11-15 Feb 2007; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2437453; (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 167-176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US07B0483071537","10.1063/1.2437453","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21054537","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21054537","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","880"

They also may hold evidence of past life on Mars, including microbes, microfossils and biological chemicals. The objective of this paper is to describe a probe that can provide access to the data locked in the Polar Caps. The MICE (Mars Ice Cap Explorer) system would explore the Polar Cap interiors using mobile probes powered by compact, lightweight nuclear reactors. The probes would travel 100's of meters per day along melt channels in the ice sheets created by hot water jets from the 500 kW(th) nuclear reactors, ascending and descending, either vertically or at an angle to the vertical, reaching bedrock at kilometers beneath the surface. The powerful reactor will be necessary to provide sufficient hot water at high velocity to penetrate the extensive horizontal dust/sand layers that separate layers of ice in the Mars Ice Caps. MICE reactors can operate at 500 kW(th) for more than 4 years, and much longer in practice, since power level will be much lower when the probes are investigating locations in detail at low or zero speed. Multiple probes, e.g. six, would be deployed in an interactive network, continuously communicating by RF and acoustic signals with each other and with the surface lander spacecraft. In turn, the lander would continuously communicate in real time, subject to speed of light delays, with scientists on Earth to transmit data and receive instructions for the MICE probes. Samples collected by the probes could be brought to the lander, for return to the Earth at the end of the mission.","","","","","","United States","2007-01-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 880; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International forum-STAIF 2007: 11. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 24. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 5. conference on human/robotic technology and the vision for space exploration; 5. symposium on space colonization; 4. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 11-15 Feb 2007; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2437529; (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 878-887","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US07B0508071562","10.1063/1.2437529","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21054562","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21054562","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","880"

The objective of this work is to provide information to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the utility, effectiveness and limitation of NDT techniques as related to inservice testing of primary system piping components in pressurized water reactors. We examined cast stainless steel pipe specimens containing thermal and mechanical fatigue cracks located close to the weld roots and having inner and outer diameter surface geometrical conditions that simulate several water reactor primary piping configurations. In addition, segments of vintage centrifugally cast piping were examined to characterize the inherent acoustic noise and scattering caused by grain structures and to determine the consistency of ultrasonic responses when propagating through differing microstructures. Advanced ultrasonic phased array techniques were applied from the outside surface of these specimens using automated scanning devices and water coupling. The phased array approach was implemented with a modified instrument operating at low frequencies, and composite volumetric images of the specimens were generated. Results from laboratory studies for assessing crack detection effectiveness in cast stainless steel as a function of frequency are discussed in this paper.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Six parameters {Cu, Ni, P, neutron fluence, irradiation time, and irradiation temperature {are used in the embrittlement prediction models. The results indicate that this new embrittlement predictor achieved reductions of about 49.5% and 52% in the uncertainties for plate and weld data, respectively, for pressurized water reactor and boiling water reactor data, compared with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulatory Guide 1.99, Rev. 2.

For this objective it was important to assure that the observed differences in void swelling were not strongly influenced by variations in helium/dpa ratio. The two major contributions to helium production arise from the nickel and boron content of the steel. However, the boron content was unspecified and therefore unknown, but it was determined from an unirradiated archive duct by converting a well-defined fraction to helium and then measuring the helium content using isotopic dilution mass spectrometry. The same technique was used to measure the total helium in the irradiated duct specimens. After separating the boron contribution from the total measured helium it was possible to determine the contribution from various fast and thermal neutron interactions with the other major elements in the steel and compare the helium generation with predicted values. One important conclusion of the study is that the range of He/dpa ratios over the five subassemblies was not very large, allowing the observed changes in swelling to be attributed primarily to variations in displacement rate and temperature.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Texture and stress are not independent of each other and in the general case should be analyzed together. Complications arise because geological samples are generally composed of several phases (minerals) whose elastic constants may be significantly different. Nevertheless, modern neutron diffractometers such as SKAT and EPSILON-MDS at the fast pulsed reactor IBR-2 at the FLNP of the JINR make it possible to obtain the needed diffraction patterns. This was shown especially for texture measurements on samples with quartz as the main component as well as for mica, feldspar, amphibole, and several other minerals. In order to extend strain measurements beyond samples composed of quartz, dolomite, and/or anhydrite to such frequently occurring minerals as feldspars and mica it would be necessary on the one hand to use Rietveld refinement with corrections due to texture and anisotropic peak broadening. With an increase in the number of mineral phases suitable for these diffractometers, it is in general necessary to improve the experimental conditions for SKAT and EPSILON-MDS, especially to significantly raise the flux of incident neutrons on the sample.","","Available from http://link.springer.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1134/S1063779606070033","","","","United States","2006-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Physics of Particles and Nuclei; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) S45-S68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1063-7796; TRN: US19N0033014862","10.1134/S1063779606070033","","2021-03-31T00:00:00Z","22974820","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22974820","","Physics of Particles and Nuclei","1","37"

The apparatus enables fast isotopic transient kinetic analysis (ITKA) to be performed in which both the gaseous and adsorbed species inside the catalytic reactor are monitored simultaneously with rapid-scan transmission FTIR, and its gaseous effluent can be monitored by mass spectroscopy during rapidly switching of reagent gas streams. This enables a more powerful version of the well-known steady-state isotopic kinetic analysis (SSITKA) technique in which the vibrational spectra of the gas phase and adsorbed species are also probed: FTIR-SSITKA. Unique reactor characteristics include tungsten construction, liquid nitrogen cooling or heating ({approx}200-700 K), fast reactor disassembly and reassembly, and catalyst loading in a common volume. The FTIR data acquisition rate of this apparatus (3 Hz) is 10-fold faster than previously reported instruments. A 95% signal decay time of {approx}3 seconds for gas switching was measured. Very good temperature reproducibility and uniformity (&lt; ?3K) was observed by in-situ rotational temperature analysis, which allows accurate calibration of the reactor thermocouple to the reactor gas temperature. Finally, FTIR-SSITKA capabilities are demonstrated for CO2 isotope switching over a ?-alumina sample at 75 C, which reveal an adsorbed carbonate species with an average surface residence time of ?=148?5 seconds and a coverage of {approx}2.5x1015 molecules cm-2.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To better understand the complex ring structure of this planet, a conceptual Saturn Ring Observer (SRO) mission is presented that would spend one year in close proximity to Saturn's A and B rings, and perform detailed observations and measurements of the ring particles and electric and magnetic fields. The primary objective of the mission would be to understand ring dynamics, including the microphysics of individual particles and small scale (meters to a few kilometers) phenomena such as particle agglomeration behavior. This would be accomplished by multispectral imaging of the rings at multiple key locations within the A and B rings, and by ring-particle imaging at an unprecedented resolution of 0.5 cm/pixel. The SRO spacecraft would use a Venus-Earth-Earth-Jupiter Gravity Assist (VEEJGA) and be aerocaptured into Saturn orbit using an advanced aeroshell design to minimize propellant mass. Once in orbit, the SRO would stand off from the ring plane 1 to 1.4 km using chemical thrusters to provide short propulsive maneuvers four times per revolution, effectively causing the SRO vehicle to 'hop' above the ring plane. The conceptual SRO spacecraft would be enabled by the use of a new generation of multi-mission Radioisotope Power Systems (RPSs) currently being developed by NASA and DOE. These RPSs include the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) and Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG). The RPSs would generate all necessary electrical power ({&gt;=}330 We at beginning of life) during the 10-year cruise and 1-year science mission ({approx}11 years total). The RPS heat would be used to maintain the vehicle's operating and survival temperatures, minimizing the need for electrical heaters. Such a mission could potentially launch in the 2015-2020 timeframe, with operations at Saturn commencing in approximately 2030.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169191; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 155-162","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3592100067","10.1063/1.2169191","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20797978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797978","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

Successful in-situ resources utilization (ISRU) is a key element to allow the human presence on Mars or the Moon. In fact a Mars ISRU mission is planned in the Aurora Program, the European program for the exploration of the solar system. Orpheus mission is a technological demonstrator whose purpose is to show the advantages of an In Situ Propellant Production (ISPP). Main task of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a nuclear ISPP plant. The mission designed has been sized to launch back form Mars an eventual manned module. The ISPP mission requires two different: the ISPP power plant module and the nuclear reactor module. Both modules reach the escape orbit thanks to the launcher upper stage, after a 200 days cruising phase the Martian atmosphere is reached thanks to small DV propelled manoeuvres, aerobreaking and soft landing. During its operational life the ISPP plant produces. The propellant is produced in one synodic year. 35000 kg of Ethylene are produced at the Martian equator. The resulting systems appear feasible and of a size comparable to other ISRU mission designs. This mission seems challenging not only for the ISPP technology to be demonstrated, but also for the space nuclear reactor considered; Though this seems the only way to allow a permanent human presence on Mars surface.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169193; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 173-182","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3593100068","10.1063/1.2169193","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20797979","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797979","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

This paper provides the details from the 2004-2005 RASC study of a point-design that uses a high-power nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) based space transportation architecture to support a manned mission to Mars. The study assumes a high-temperature liquid-metal cooled fission reactor with a Brayton power conversion system to generate the electrical power required by magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. The architecture includes a cargo vehicle with an NEP system providing 5 MW of electrical power and a crewed vehicle with an NEP system with two reactors providing a combined total of 10 MW of electrical power. Both vehicles use a low-thrust, high-efficiency (5000 sec specific impulse) MPD system to conduct a spiral-out of the Earth gravity well, a low-thrust heliocentric trajectory, and a spiral-in at Mars with arrival late in 2033. The cargo vehicle carries two moon landers to Mars and arrives shortly before the crewed vehicle. The crewed vehicle and cargo vehicle rendezvous in Mars orbit and, over the course of the 60-day stay, the crew conducts nine-day excursions to Phobos and Deimos with the landers. The crewed vehicle then spirals out of Martian orbit and returns via a low-thrust trajectory to conduct an Earth flyby. The crew separates from the vehicle prior to Earth flyby and aerobrakes for a direct-entry landing.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169198; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 222-229","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3594100069","10.1063/1.2169198","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20797980","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797980","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

At present, the nuclear-power source is an assembly of modular heat sources called the general purpose heat source (GPHS) modules. Each module comprises graphite shells designed to protect iridium-alloy clads which serve as the primary containment shells for the radioactive, heat-producing material. In the course of launching the space vehicle to perform its mission the nuclear heat source may be exposed to severe accident environments. One particular environment is a primary impact event where individual GPHS modules impact hard surfaces at speeds in the range of 50 meters per second or more. Tests have shown that some clads may be breached in particularly severe impacts and release a small fraction of their contents. This paper presents an empirical model for predicting essential ingredients for assessing the risk associated with primary impact events. The ingredients include: clad failure probability, release fraction of clad contents, characterization of the released material in terms of particle-size distribution and a means to estimate uncertainty in the prediction process. The empirical model focuses on the deformation of the clads and their capability to withstand deformation without breaching, measured by ductility. The basic criterion used to estimate all ingredients is called 'negative margin'. The procedure for estimating risk factors entails calculation of clad distortion by, e.g. hydrocode simulation, and high-strain-rate ductility of the iridium alloy. Negative margin is a linear combination of distortion and ductility. Regression equations derived from test data are used to calculate the clad failure probability and the fractional activity release as functions of negative margin. The mass-based particle-size distribution is calculated as a function of release fraction. Cumulative uncertainty in this computing process is evaluated using sequential uncertainties in each step implicit in the regression analyses. The overall process is well suited to the Monte Carlo method of risk assessment. The outcome of each history in which clad failure is predicted is a mass fraction of particles in each group. The group-wise source terms are then used to estimate individual and population doses.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169199; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 230-243","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3595100070","10.1063/1.2169199","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20797981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797981","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

Very small nuclear energy sources were used to provide heat on the Mars Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity rovers. Research has been performed at NASA MSFC to help assess potential issues associated with surface nuclear energy sources, and to generate data that could be useful to a future program.

This means no single point of failure since each heat pipe and cylindrical converter is a separate power system and if one fails it will not affect the others. The heat pipe array in the solid core is designed so that if an isolated heat pipe or even two adjacent heat pipes fail, the remaining heat pipes will still transport the core heat without undue overheating of the uranium nitride fuel. The primary emphasis in this paper is on simplicity, reliability and fabricability of such a space nuclear power source. The core and heat pipes are made of Niobium 1% Zirconium alloy (Nb1Zr), with rhenium lined fuel tubes, bonded together by hot isostatic pressure (HIPing) and with sodium as the heat pipe working fluid, can be operated up to 1250K. The cylindrical thermoelectric converter is made by depositing the constituents of the converter around a Nb1%Zr tube and encasing it in a Nb 1% Zr alloy tube and HIPing the structure to get final bonding and to produce residual compressive stresses in all brittle materials in the converter. A radiator heat pipe filled with potassium that operates at 850K is bonded to the outside of the cylindrical converter for cooling. The solid core heat pipe and cylindrical converter are mated by welding during the final assembly. A solid core reactor with 150 heat pipes with a 0.650-inch (1.65 cm) ID and a 30-inch (76.2 cm) length with an output of 8 Watts per square inch as demonstrated by the SP100 PD2 cell tests will produce about 80 KW of electrical power. An advanced solid core reactor made with molybdenum 47% rhenium alloy, with lithium heat pipes and the PD2 theoretical output of 11 watts per square inch or advanced higher temperature converter to operate at 1350K could produce a greater output of approximately 100KW.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169223; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 456-464","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3613100088","10.1063/1.2169223","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20797999","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797999","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"
"High Power Electric Propulsion System for NEP: Propulsion and Trajectory Options","Koppel, Christophe R; Duchemin, Olivier; Valentian, Dominique","72 PHYSICS OF ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND FIELDS; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; DESIGN; EFFICIENCY; ELECTRIC POWER; ION THRUSTERS; MASS; PERFORMANCE; POWER GENERATION; PROPULSION; PROPULSION SYSTEMS; PULSES; REACTORS; SPACE SHUTTLES; TRAJECTORIES; XENON","Recent US initiatives in Nuclear Propulsion lend themselves naturally to raising the question of the assessment of various options and particularly to propose the High Power Electric Propulsion Subsystem (HPEPS) for the Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). The purpose of this paper is to present the guidelines for the HPEPS with respect to the mission to Mars, for automatic probes as well as for manned missions. Among the various options, the technological options and the trajectory options are pointed out. The consequences of the increase of the electrical power of a thruster are first an increase of the thrust itself, but also, as a general rule, an increase of the thruster performance due to its higher efficiency, particularly its specific impulse increase. The drawback is as a first parameter, the increase of the thruster's size, hence the so-called 'thrust density' shall be high enough or shall be drastically increased for ions thrusters. Due to the large mass of gas needed to perform the foreseen missions, the classical xenon rare gas is no more in competition, the total world production being limited to 20 -40 tons per year. Thus, the right selection of the propellant feeding the thruster is of prime importance. When choosing a propellant with lower molecular mass, the consequences at thruster level are an increase once more of the specific impulse, but at system level the dead mass may increase too, mainly because the increase of the mass of the propellant system tanks. Other alternatives, in rupture with respect to the current technologies, are presented in order to make the whole system more attractive. The paper presents a discussion on the thruster specific impulse increase that is sometime considered an increase of the main system performances parameter, but that induces for all electric propulsion systems drawbacks in the system power and mass design that are proportional to the thruster specific power increase (kW/N). The electric thruster specific impulse shall be optimized w.r.t. the mission. The trajectories taken into account in the paper are constrained by the allowable duration of the travel and the launcher size. The multi-arcs trajectories to Mars (using an optimized combination of chemical and Electric propulsion) are presented in detail. The compatibility with NEP systems that implies orbiting a sizeable nuclear reactor and a power generation system capable of converting thermal into electric power, with minimum mass and volumes fitting in with Ariane 5 or the Space Shuttle bay, is assessed.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169226; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 484-493","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3615100090","10.1063/1.2169226","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798001","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798001","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The hydrogen propellant is to be stored in liquid state for periods up to 18 months. To prevent boil-off of the liquid hydrogen, a system of passive and active components are needed to prevent heat from entering the tanks and to remove any heat that does. This report describes the design of the system components used for the BNTR Crew Transfer Vehicle and the thermal analysis performed. The results show that Zero Boil-Off (ZBO) can be achieved with the electrical power allocated for the ZBO system.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169227; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 494-501","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3616100091","10.1063/1.2169227","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20798002","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798002","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

A tremendous effort was undertaken during the 1960's and 1970's to develop and test NERVA derived Nuclear Thermal Rockets in the 111.2 KN to 1112 KN pound thrust class. NASA GRC is leveraging this past NTR investment in their vehicle concepts and mission analysis studies, and has been evaluating NERVA derived engines in the 66.7 KN to the 111.2 KN thrust range. The liquid hydrogen propellant feed system, including the turbopumps, is an essential component of the overall operation of this system. The NASA GRC team is evaluating numerous propellant feed system designs with both single and twin turbopumps. The Nuclear Engine System Simulation code is being exercised to analyze thermodynamic cycle points for these selected concepts. This paper will present propellant feed system concepts and the corresponding thermodynamic cycle points for 66.7 KN and 111.2 KN thrust NTR engine systems. A pump out condition for a twin turbopump concept will also be evaluated, and the NESS code will be assessed against the Small Nuclear Rocket Engine preliminary thermodynamic data.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169228; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 502-513","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3617100092","10.1063/1.2169228","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20798003","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798003","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

These engines are capable of providing high thrust at specific impulses at least twice that of today's best chemical engines. The performance constraints on these engines are mainly the result of temperature limitations on the fuel coupled with a limited ability to withstand chemical attack by the hot hydrogen propellant. To operate at maximum efficiency, fuel forms are desired which can withstand the extremely hot, hostile environment characteristic of NTR operation for at least several hours. The simulation of such an environment would require an experimental device which could simultaneously approximate the power, flow, and temperature conditions which a nuclear fuel element (or partial element) would encounter during NTR operation. Such a simulation would allow detailed studies of the fuel behavior and hydrogen flow characteristics under reactor like conditions to be performed. The goal of these simulations would be directed toward expanding the performance envelope of NTR engines over that which was demonstrated during the Rover and NERVA nuclear rocket programs of the 1970's. Current planning calls for such a simulator to be constructed at the Marshall Space Flight Center over the coming year, and it is anticipated that it will be used in the future to evaluate a wide variety of fuel element designs and the materials of which they are constructed. This present work addresses the initial experimental objectives of the NTR simulator with regard to reproducing the fuel degradation patterns previously observed during the NERVA testing.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169231; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 531-536","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3620100095","10.1063/1.2169231","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20798006","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798006","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The CBC engines operate at turbine inlet and exit temperatures of 1144 K and 952 K. They have a net efficiency of 19.4% and each provides 30.5 kWe of net electrical power to the load. A He-Xe gas mixture serves as the turbine working fluid and cools the reactor core, entering at 904 K and exiting at 1149 K. Each CBC loop is coupled to a reactor sector, which is neutronically and thermally coupled, but hydraulically decoupled to the other two sectors, and to a NaK-78 secondary loop with two water heat pipes radiator panels. The segmented panels each consist of a forward fixed segment and two rear deployable segments, operating hydraulically in parallel. The deployed radiator has an effective surface area of 203 m2, and when the rear segments are folded, the stowed power system fits in the launch bay of the DELTA-IV Heavy launch vehicle. For enhanced reliability, the water heat pipes operate below 50% of their wicking limit; the sonic limit is not a concern because of the water, high vapor pressure at the temperatures of interest (384 - 491 K). The rejected power by the radiator peaks when the ratio of the lengths of evaporator sections of the longest and shortest heat pipes is the same as that of the major and minor widths of the segments. The shortest and hottest heat pipes in the rear segments operate at 491 K and 2.24 MPa, and each rejects 154 W. The longest heat pipes operate cooler (427 K and 0.52 MPa) and because they are 69% longer, reject more power (200 W each). The longest and hottest heat pipes in the forward segments reject the largest power (320 W each) while operating at {approx} 46% of capillary limit. The vapor temperature and pressure in these heat pipes are 485 K and 1.97 MPa. By contrast, the shortest water heat pipes in the forward segments operate much cooler (427 K and 0.52 MPa), and reject a much lower power of 45 W each. The radiator with six fixed and 12 rear deployable segments rejects a total of 324 kWth, weights 994 kg and has an average specific power of 326 Wth/kg and a specific mass of 5.88 kg/m2.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169253; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 716-729","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3627100102","10.1063/1.2169253","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20798013","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798013","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

This paper developed redundant and light-weight bellows-type accumulators with and without a mechanical spring, and compared the operating condition and mass of the accumulators for different types of liquid metal working fluids and operating temperatures: potassium, NaK-78, sodium and lithium loops of a total capacity of 50 liters and nominal operating temperatures of 840 K, 860 K, 950 K and 1340 K, respectively. The effects of using a mechanical spring and different structural materials on the design, operation and mass of the accumulators are also investigated. The structure materials considered include SS-316, Hastelloy-X, C-103 and Mo-14Re. The accumulator without a mechanical spring weighs 23 kg and 40 kg for a coolant subcooling of 50 K and 100 K, respectively, following a loss of the fill gas.

However, the space environment is a vacuum environment, typically 10-8 Torr pressure, therefore in proposed missions to the lunar surface, power plants would have to rely on radiative cooling to remove waste heat. Also, the Martian surface has a very tenuous atmosphere (e.g. {approx}5 Torr CO2), therefore, the main heat transfer method on the Martian surface is also radiative. Because of the lack of atmosphere on the Moon and the tenuous atmosphere on Mars, surface power systems on both the Lunar and Martian surface must rely heavily on radiative heat transfer. Because of the large temperature swings on both the lunar and the Martian surfaces, trying to radiate heat is inefficient. In order to increase power system efficiency, an effort is underway to test various combinations of materials with high emissivities to demonstrate their ability to survive these degrading atmospheres to maintain a constant radiator temperature improving surface power plant efficiency. An important part of this effort is the development of a unique capability that would allow the determination of a materials emissivity at high temperatures. A description of the test capability as well as initial data is presented.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169182; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 74-80","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3629100104","10.1063/1.2169182","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798015","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798015","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The completed US DOE NERI Direct Energy Conversion (DEC) Power Production project indicates that viable DEC systems are possible. The US DOE NERI DEC Proof of Principle project began in October of 2002 with the goal to demonstrate performance principles of DEC systems. One of the emerging DEC concepts is represented by fission fragment magnetic collimator reactors (FFMCR). Safety, simplicity, and high conversion efficiency are the unique advantages offered by these systems. In the FFMCR, the basic energy source is the kinetic energy of fission fragments. Following escape from thin fuel layers, they are captured on magnetic field lines and are directed out of the core and through magnetic collimators to produce electricity and thrust. The exiting flow of energetic fission fragments has a very high specific impulse that allows efficient planetary surface power and interstellar propulsion without carrying any conventional propellant onboard. The objective of this work was to determine technological feasibility of the concept. This objective was accomplished by producing the FFMCR design and by analysis of its performance characteristics. The paper presents the FFMCR concept, describes its development to a technologically feasible level and discusses obtained results. Performed studies offer efficiencies up to 90% and velocities approaching speed of light as potentially achievable. The unmanned 10-tons probe with 1000 MW FFMCR propulsion unit would attain mission velocity of about 2% of the speed of light. If the unit is designed for 4000 MW, then in 10 years the unmanned 10-tons probe would attain mission velocity of about 10% of the speed of light.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169262; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 803-810","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3636100111","10.1063/1.2169262","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798022","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798022","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The integrated analysis will require that self-consistent neutronic/thermal-hydraulic/stress analyses be carried out. The major code packages used in this analysis are MCNP, RELAP, and ANSYS. Results from this analysis indicate that nuclear data will have to be re-generated to cover the wide temperature range, zone loading will be necessary to avoid entering the liquidus region for the fuel, and the effectiveness of the ZrC insulator will have implications for bi-modal applications. These results suggest a path forward in the development of a viable NTP system based on a NERVA reactor should initially concentrate on fuel and structural materials and associated coating development. A series of safety related criticality determinations were carried out addressing water immersion following a launch incident.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169269; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 870-878","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3637100112","10.1063/1.2169269","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20798023","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798023","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The MITEE (MInature ReacTor EnginE) reactor uses hydrogeneous moderator, such as solid lithium-7 hydride, and high temperature cermet tungsten/UO2 nuclear fuel. The reactor is configured as a modular pressure tube assembly, with each pressure tube containing an outer annual shell of moderator with an inner annular region of W/UO2 cermet fuel sheets. H2 propellant flows radially inwards through the moderator and fuel regions, exiting at {approx}3000 K into a central channel that leads to a nozzle at the end of the pressure tube. Power density in the fuel region is 10 to 20 megawatts per liter, depending on design, producing a thrust output on the order of 15,000 Newtons and an Isp of {approx}1000 seconds. 3D Monte Carlo neutronic analyses are described for MITEE reactors utilizing various fissile fuel options (U-235, U-233, and Am242m) and moderators (7LiH and BeH2). Reactor mass ranges from a maximum of 100 kg for the 7LiH/U-235 option to a minimum of 28 kg for the BeH2/Am-242 m option. Pure thrust only and bi-modal (thrust plus electric power generation) MITEE designs are described. Potential unique robotic science missions enabled by the MITEE engine are described, including landing on Europa and exploring the ice sheet interior with return of samples to Earth, hopping to and exploring multiple sites on Mars, unlimited ramjet flight in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune and landing on, and sample return from Pluto.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169270; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 879-888","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3638100113","10.1063/1.2169270","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798024","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798024","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

Setting the initial requirements is extremely important since they govern the choices that determine the final design. In addition, the choice of reactor and its operating conditions depends on details of the energy conversion and heat rejection systems, which must be studied in tandem. Refractory materials are not suitable for the primary pressure boundary for the reactor due to their susceptibility to chemical attack from particles of regolith on the Moon and Mars or by the carbon dioxide atmosphere on Mars. High nickel superalloys would be acceptable in these environments, but their limited creep strength at elevated temperatures limits reactor outlet temperature to about 1150 K or less. This temperature restriction results in the mass of a gas cooled reactor coupled to a Brayton power conversion system being somewhat lighter than that of a liquid metal-cooled reactors coupled to a Brayton power conversion system. The mass of a liquid metal-cooled reactor coupled to an advanced Stirling power conversion system would be in between that of the gas and liquid metal cooled systems which use Brayton power conversion.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169274; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 920-931","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3640100115","10.1063/1.2169274","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798026","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798026","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

In a non-nuclear test bed, electric heaters are used to simulate the heat from nuclear fuel. Standard testing allows one to fully assess thermal, heat transfer, and stress related attributes of a given system, but fails to demonstrate the dynamic response that would be present in an integrated, fueled reactor system. The integration of thermal hydraulic hardware tests with simulated neutronic response provides a bridge between electrically heated testing and fueled nuclear testing. By implementing a neutronic response model to simulate the dynamic response that would be expected in a fueled reactor system, one can better understand system integration issues, characterize integrated system response times and response characteristics, and assess potential design improvements at a relatively small fiscal investment. Initial system dynamic response testing was demonstrated on the integrated SAFE-100a heat pipe (HP) cooled, electrically heated reactor and heat exchanger hardware, utilizing a one-group solution to the point kinetics equations to simulate the expected neutronic response of the system. Reactivity feedback calculations were then based on a bulk reactivity feedback coefficient and measured average core temperature. This paper presents preliminary results from similar dynamic testing of a direct drive gas cooled reactor system (DDG), demonstrating the applicability of the testing methodology to any reactor type and demonstrating the variation in system response characteristics in different reactor concepts. Although the HP and DDG designs both utilize a fast spectrum reactor, the method of cooling the reactor differs significantly, leading to a variable system response that can be demonstrated and assessed in a non-nuclear test facility. Planned system upgrades to allow implementation of higher fidelity dynamic testing are also discussed. Proposed DDG testing will utilize a higher fidelity point kinetics model to control core power transients, and reactivity feedback will be based on localized feedback coefficients and several independent temperature measurements taken within the core block. This paper presents preliminary test results and discusses the methodology that will be implemented in follow-on DDG testing and the additional instrumentation required to implement high fidelity dynamic testing.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169217; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 396-407","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3607100082","10.1063/1.2169217","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20797993","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797993","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has several facilities that could be adapted to support a ground test. This paper focuses on the feasibility of ground testing at the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II) facility and using other INL existing infrastructure to support such a test. This brief study concludes that the INL EBR-II facility and supporting infrastructure are a viable option for ground testing the surface power system. It provides features and attributes that offer advantages to locating and performing ground testing at this site, and it could support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration schedules for human exploration of the Moon. This study used the initial concept examined by the U.S. Department of Energy Inter-laboratory Design and Analysis Support Team for surface power, a low-temperature, liquid-metal, three-loop Brayton power system. With some facility modification, the EBR-II can safely house a test chamber and perform long-term testing of the space reactor power system. The INL infrastructure is available to receive and provide bonded storage for special nuclear materials. Facilities adjacent to EBR-II can provide the clean room environment needed to assemble and store the test article assembly, disassemble the power system at the conclusion of testing, and perform posttest examination. Capability for waste disposal is also available at the INL.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169219; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 418-425","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3609100084","10.1063/1.2169219","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20797995","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20797995","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

Among all the interacting parts, three components stand out: they are pumps and turbines (turbopumps), and the thrust chamber. To obtain an understanding of the overall rocket propulsion system characteristics, one starts from analyzing the interactions among these three components. It is therefore of utmost importance to be able to satisfactorily characterize the turbopump, level by level, at all phases of a vehicle design cycle. Here at the NASA Glenn Research Center, as the starting phase of a rocket engine design, specifically a Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engine design, we adopted the approach of using a high level system cycle analysis code (NESS) to obtain an initial analysis of the operational characteristics of a turbopump required in the propulsion system. A set of turbopump design codes (PumpDes and TurbDes) were then executed to obtain sizing and performance parameters of the turbopump that were consistent with the mission requirements. A set of turbopump analyses codes (PUMPA and TURBA) were applied to obtain the full performance map for each of the turbopump components; a two dimensional layout of the turbopump based on these mean line analyses was also generated. Adequacy of the turbopump conceptual design will later be determined by further analyses and evaluation. In this paper, descriptions and discussions of the aforementioned approach are provided and future outlooks are discussed.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169230; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 522-530","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3619100094","10.1063/1.2169230","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798005","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798005","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

The computational methodology is based on a multidimensional, finite-volume, turbulent, chemically reacting, thermally radiating, unstructured-grid, and pressure-based formulation. The multiphysics invoked in this study include hydrogen dissociation kinetics and thermodynamics, turbulent flow, convective, and thermal radiative heat transfers. The goals of the design analyses are to maintain maximum hot-hydrogen jet impingement energy and to minimize chamber wall heating. The results of analyses on three test fixture configurations and the rationale for final selection are presented. The interrogation of physics revealed that reactions of hydrogen dissociation and recombination are highly correlated with local temperature and are necessary for accurate prediction of the hot-hydrogen jet temperature.","","","","","","United States","2006-01-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 813; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 10. conference on thermophysics applications in microgravity; 23. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; 4. conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 4. symposium on space colonization; 3. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 12-16 Feb 2006; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.2169232; (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 537-544","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06B3621100096","10.1063/1.2169232","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20798007","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20798007","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","813"

This system can eliminate problems associated with wind intermittency and provide a source of electrical energy functionally equivalent to a large fossil or nuclear power plant. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) can be economically deployed in the Midwestern US, an area with significant low-cost wind resources. CAES systems require a combustible fuel, typically natural gas, which results in fuel price risk and greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing natural gas with synfuel derived from biomass gasification eliminates the use of fossil fuels, virtually eliminating net CO{sub 2} emissions from the system. In addition, by deriving energy completely from farm sources, this type of system may reduce some opposition to long distance transmission lines in rural areas, which may be an obstacle to large-scale wind deployment.","","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

"Safety Investigation of Liquid-Metal-Cooled Nuclear Systems with Heat Exchanger in the Risers of Simple Flow-Path Pool Design","Carlsson, Johan; Wider, Hartmut U","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; COOLANTS; DESIGN; FLUID MECHANICS; HEAT EXCHANGERS; HEAT SINKS; HEIGHT; LIQUID METAL COOLED REACTORS; LIQUID METALS; NATURAL CONVECTION; PEAKS; PONDS; REACTOR ACCIDENTS; REACTOR VESSELS; SAFETY; THERMAL REACTORS; WALLS","Safety investigations were performed on 600- and 1426-MW(thermal) liquid-metal-cooled reactors with the heat exchangers (HXs) located in the risers of simple flow-path pool designs. This includes both critical reactors and accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) using liquid-metal coolants. For the 600-MW(thermal) ADS, the safety implications were examined for vessel sizes of two heights (11 and 15 m) and two diameters (6 and 10 m). Then, the reference design of 11-m height and 6-m diameter was compared with a similar design, but with the HXs located in the downcomers. The transients investigated were total-loss-of-power (TLOP), unprotected-loss-of-flow (ULOF), protected-loss-of-flow, and unprotected loss-of-heat-sink accidents. The 600-MW(thermal) ADS of 11-m height and 6-m diameter peaks at 1041 K after 29 h during a TLOP accident. If the diameter is increased to 10 m, it will peak after 55 h at a 178 K lower temperature thanks to its larger thermal inertia. The difference between locating the HXs in the risers and the downcomers is insignificant for this accident type. With the HXs in the risers, the temperature peaks at 1045 K after 28 h. During a ULOF accident in an ADS at full power, the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 1010 K, which is 337 K above the nominal outlet temperature. When the vessel height is increased to 15 m, the natural convection is improved, and the core outlet temperature stabilizes at 911 K. A Pb-cooled 1426-MW(thermal) reactor of 11-m height and 12-m diameter is also shown to be sufficiently coolable during a TLOP accident; i.e., it peaks at 1093 K after 49 h. In a pool-type design with a simple flow path, the use of HXs in the risers and flaps at their inlets that prevent a flow reversal will have significant safety advantages in case of HX tube failures. Steam or gas bubbles exiting from the secondary circuit cannot be dragged into the core region by the liquid-metal coolant. Instead, they would rise with the coolant and exit through the free surface. Another important effect from placing the HXs in the risers is the fact that the reactor vessel wall will be cooler during normal operation and during all accidents in which the HXs still operate. This is because the coolant passes through the HXs before it reaches the vessel wall. The idea to place the HXs in the risers of a simple flow-path design is protected by European patent No. 04 103 634.4. The computational fluid dynamics code STAR-CD was used in all calculations.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 314-323","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1100013587","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840330","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840330","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

It is a fast neutron spectrum reactor cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic using natural circulation. One of the unique features of the ENHS is that the fission-generated heat is transferred from the primary coolant to the secondary coolant through rectangular intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) channels. The decay heat is removed by the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system (RVACS).Events of protected loss of heat sink (PLOHS) and unprotected transient overpower (UTOP) have been analyzed for the ENHS using the CERES transient simulation code for liquid-metal-cooled reactors.It is found that the ENHS core is sufficiently cooled by the RVACS under the PLOHS condition. The core flow rate is affected by the growth and disappearance of temperature stratification in the primary plenum. It is also found that even under the inconceivable UTOP event considered, the ENHS reactor core is not catastrophically damaged. This is due to negative reactivity feedback from the radial expansion of the core, the grid plate, and the Doppler effect. The use of high-performance ferritic steel instead of HT-9 and proper design of the reactor control system could provide large safety margins against cladding damage.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 324-338","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1101013588","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840331","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840331","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

Adopting a transuranic composition with 40% plutonium in the initial load, transmutation rates of higher actinides (americium and curium) equal to 265 to 285 kg/GW(thermal).yr are obtained. The smallest reactivity swing is provided by the magnesium oxide-based cercer fuel. The cercer cores, however, exhibit large coolant void worths, which is of concern in the case of gas bubble introduction into the core. Nitride and cermet cores are more stable with respect to void formation. The poorer neutron economy of the molybdenum-based cermet makes it difficult, however, to accommodate an inert matrix volume fraction exceeding 50%, a lower limit for fabricability. Higher plutonium fraction is thus required for the cermet, which would lead to lower actinide burning rates. The nitride core yields high actinide burning rates, low void worths, and acceptable reactivity losses.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 367-381","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1104013591","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840334","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840334","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

The Chinshan NPP severe accident management guidelines (SAMGs) were developed based on the BWR Owners Group Emergency Procedure Guidelines/Severe Accident Guidelines and were developed at the end of 2003. The MAAP4 code has been used as a tool to validate the SAMG strategies. The development process and characteristics of the Chinshan SAMGs are described. The T{sub 5}U{sub t}X{sub C} sequence, the highest core damage frequency in the probabilistic risk assessment insight of the Chinshan NPP, is cited as a reference case for SAMG validation. Not all safety injection systems are operated in the T{sub 5}U{sub t}X{sub C} sequence. The severe accident progression is simulated, and the entry condition of the SAMGs is described. Then, the T{sub 5}U{sub t}X{sub C} sequence is simulated with reactor pressure vessel (RPV) depressurization. Mitigation actions based on the Chinshan NPP SAMGs are then applied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SAMGs. Sensitivity studies on RPV depressurization with the reactor water level and minimum RPV injection flow rate are also investigated in this study. Based on MAAP4 calculation and the default values of the parameters calculating the severe accident phenomena, the result shows that RPV depressurization before the reactor water level reaches one-fourth of the core water level can prevent the core from damage in the T{sub 5}U{sub t}X{sub C} sequence. The flow rate of two control rod drive pumps is enough to maintain the reactor water level above the top of active fuel and cool down the core in the T{sub 5}U{sub t}X{sub C} sequence without operator action.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 253-265","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1095013582","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840325","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840325","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

Hydrogen production from natural gas is a promising method in an early stage of hydrogen society, though hydrogen production with water splitting without carbon dioxide emission is the final goal. Steam methane reforming is a well-known method for producing hydrogen from natural gas. A hydrogen separation membrane makes the reforming temperature much lower than that of the equilibrium condition, and a sodium-cooled fast reactor, which supplies heat at {approx}500 deg. C, can be used as a heat source for hydrogen production.In this study, a hydrogen production plant with the membrane reforming method using a sodium-cooled reactor as a thermal source has been designed, and its economic potential is roughly evaluated. The hydrogen production cost is estimated to be about $1.67/kg, achieving the economic target of $1.7/kg. The construction cost is largely shared by the reformers' cost, and it can be decreased using a more efficient hydrogen separation membrane. This shows that steam methane reforming hydrogen production with a sodium-cooled reactor has high economical potential.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 266-272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1096013583","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840326","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840326","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

The code has been formulated by implementing various physical assumptions to simplify the complex SWR phenomena, and it adopts the long-term mass and energy transfer (LMET) model developed in the present study. The LMET model is based on the hypothesis that the system transient can be described by the pressure and temperature transient of the cover gas space, and it can be applied only to the reaction period characterized by bulk motion. To evaluate the feasibility of the physical model and its assumptions, a scale-down mock-up test was carried out, and it was demonstrated that the numerical simulation using the LMET model adequately replicates the overall phenomena of the experiment with reasonable understanding. Based on the findings, as a numerical example, the long-term system transient responses during the SWR event of the Korea Advanced LIquid MEtal Reactor (KALIMER) were investigated, and it was found that the long-term dynamic responses are strongly dependent on the design parameters and operational strategies. As a result, the numerical simulation method developed in the present study is practicable; furthermore, the SELPSTA code is useful to resolve the risk for the SWR event.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 286-301","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1098013585","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840328","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840328","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

In a station blackout accident, tube integrity could be threatened by creep rupture, particularly if cracks are present in the tube walls. Methods are developed herein to improve assessment capabilities for SGTR by using the severe-accident code MELCOR. Best-estimate assumptions based on recent research and computational fluid dynamics calculations are applied in the MELCOR analysis to simulate two-dimensional natural circulation and to determine the relative creep-rupture timing in the reactor coolant pressure boundary components. A new method is developed to estimate the steam generator (SG) hottest tube wall temperature and the tube critical crack size for the SG tubes to fail first. The critical crack size for SG tubes to fail first is estimated to be 20% of the wall thickness larger than by a previous analysis. Sensitivity studies show that the failure sequence would change if some assumptions are modified. In particular, the uncertainty in the countercurrent flow limit model could reverse the failure sequence of the SG tubes and surge line.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 302-313","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1099013586","10.13182/NT05-5","","2016-04-14T00:00:00Z","20840329","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840329","","Nuclear Technology","3","152"

The impact of higher pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel burnup is examined in this paper from the perspective of its impact on spent-fuel radioactivity, decay heat, and plutonium content. The necessary fresh fuel enrichments to achieve high burnup in PWRs with the same three-batch operation scheme are first computed; then, characteristics of the spent fuel are determined. The increase in decay heat with burnup is found to be generally less than linear. Although each high-burnup fuel assembly would be hotter and more radioactive, the total decay heat to be removed or accommodated in storage is less for the same electricity production. If the time window before 150 yr after discharge can be excluded from impacting a repository, significant savings in its capacity can be realized with high-burnup fuel. The high-burnup fuel is more proliferation resistant because of reduced total plutonium production per kilowatt hour and because of higher content of less desirable plutonium isotopes, such as {sup 238}Pu. The fuel cycle cost can be slightly reduced by increasing burnup until it reaches a shallow minimum near 70 MWd/kg. Higher burnups would require one-time changes to the limits on enrichments that can be handled in most commercial fuel fabrication facilities. Changing the waste fee to base it on the amount of radioactivity in the spent fuel would enhance the economic benefit of high burnup.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 261-273","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0450109970","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808478","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808478","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","151"
"Limiting Factors for External Reactor Vessel Cooling","Cheung, F B","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BOILING; COOLING; CRITICAL HEAT FLUX; DESIGN; INSTABILITY; LIQUIDS; NATURAL CONVECTION; POROUS MATERIALS; POWER REACTORS; REACTOR VESSELS; STEAM; SURFACES; TWO-PHASE FLOW; VAPORS","The method of external reactor vessel cooling (ERVC) that involves flooding of the reactor cavity during a severe accident has been considered a viable means for in-vessel retention (IVR). For high-power reactors, however, there are some limiting factors that might adversely affect the feasibility of using ERVC as a means for IVR. In this paper, the key limiting factors for ERVC have been identified and critically discussed. These factors include the choking limit for steam venting (CLSV) through the bottleneck of the vessel/insulation structure, the critical heat flux (CHF) for downward-facing boiling on the vessel outer surface, and the two-phase flow instabilities in the natural circulation loop within the flooded cavity. To enhance ERVC, it is necessary to eliminate or relax these limiting factors. Accordingly, methods to enhance ERVC and thus improve margins for IVR have been proposed and demonstrated, using the APR1400 as an example. The strategy is based on using two distinctly different methods to enhance ERVC. One involves the use of an enhanced vessel/insulation design to facilitate steam venting through the bottleneck of the annular channel. The other involves the use of an appropriate vessel coating to promote downward-facing boiling. It is found that the use of an enhanced vessel/insulation design with bottleneck enlargement could greatly facilitate the process of steam venting through the bottleneck region as well as streamline the resulting two-phase motions in the annular channel. By selecting a suitable enhanced vessel/insulation design, not only the CLSV but also the CHF limits could be significantly increased. In addition, the problem associated with two-phase flow instabilities and flow-induced mechanical vibration could be minimized. It is also found that the use of vessel coatings made of microporous metallic layers could greatly facilitate downward-facing boiling on the vessel outer surface. With vessel coatings, the local CHF limits at different angular locations of the vessel outer surface could be enhanced by {approx}1.2 to 2 times the CHF compared with a plain vessel without coatings. The CHF enhancement could be attributed to the structure of the porous coating itself and the capillary action it induced. The matrix of cavities and voids within the coating effectively trap vapor, which serve as active nucleation sites. These sites in turn are fed with liquid flowing through the interconnected channels. The pores on the surface of the porous coating serve as flow inlets for liquid supply to the heating surface, leading to appreciable enhancement in downward-facing boiling heat transfer and the local CHF limits. Results of the present study suggest that by utilizing an enhanced vessel/insulation design with vessel coating, it is possible to significantly enhance the CLSV and the CHF limits as well as minimize the two-phase flow instability problems, thus substantially increasing the margin for IVR.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 145-161","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1087013574","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840317","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840317","","Nuclear Technology","2","152"

A U.S.-Korean International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative project has been initiated to explore design enhancements that could increase the margin for IVR for advanced reactors with higher power levels [up to 1500 MW(electric)]. As part of this effort, an enhanced in-vessel core catcher is being designed and evaluated. To reduce cost and simplify manufacture and installation, this new core catcher design consists of several interlocking sections that are machined to fit together when inserted into the lower head. If needed, the core catcher can be manufactured with holes to accommodate lower head penetrations. Each section of the core catcher consists of two material layers with an option to add a third layer (if deemed necessary). The first is a base material that has the capability to support and contain the mass of core materials that may relocate during a severe accident; the second is an oxide coating on top of the base material, which resists interactions with high-temperature core materials; and the third is an optional coating on the bottom side of the base material to protect it from oxidation during the lifetime of the reactor. This paper summarizes results from the in-vessel core catcher design and evaluation efforts, focusing on recently obtained results from materials interaction tests and prototypic testing activities.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 170-182","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1089013576","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840319","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840319","","Nuclear Technology","2","152"

Provided adequate qualification, these numerical tools are an efficient means to determine hydraulics in the given design and to perform sensitivities for optimization of new designs. Experiments always play their role, first for qualification and then for validation at the last stage of the design. The design of the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR), jointly developed by Framatome ANP, Electricite de France (EDF), and the German utilities, is based on both hydraulics calculations and experiments handled in a complementary approach.This paper describes the collective effort launched by Framatome ANP and EDF on hydraulics calculations for the RPV of the EPR. It concerns three-dimensional calculations of RPV inlets, including the cold legs, the RPV downcomer and lower plenum, and the RPV upper plenum up to and including the hot legs. It covers normal operating conditions but also accidental conditions such as pressurized thermal shock in a small-break loss-of-coolant accident.

A compact reactor vessel and a column-type upper inner structure with a radial slit for an arm of a fuel-handling machine (FHM) are adopted. Dipped plates are set in the reactor vessel below the free surface to prevent gas entrainment. We performed a one-tenth-scaled model water experiment for the upper plenum of the reactor vessel. Gas entrainment was not observed in the experiment under the same velocity condition as the reactor. Three vortex cavitations were observed near the hot-leg inlet. A vertical rib on the reactor vessel wall was set to restrict the rotating flow near the hot leg. The vortex cavitation between the reactor vessel wall and the hot leg was suppressed by the rib under the same cavitation factor condition as in the reactor. The cylindrical plug was installed through the hole in the dipped plates for the FHM to reduce the flow toward the free surface. It was effective when the plug was submerged into the middle height in the upper plenum. This combination of two components had a possibility to optimize the flow in the compact reactor vessel.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 210-222","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1092013579","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840322","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840322","","Nuclear Technology","2","152"

The primary objective of the present study was to find the distribution of the amplitude of temperature fluctuation in the hot pool of KALIMER. The computations were performed using the CFX-4 code with the differential stress and flux turbulence model and the Van Leer convection scheme. Two cases with different outlet velocity of the control rod fuel assemblies are considered. The distributions of the velocity vector, temperature, and temperature fluctuation were obtained from the calculation. In order to quantitatively understand the amplitude of temperature fluctuation at the bottom wall of the upper internal structure (UIS), the amplitude of the fluctuation of temperature in the radial and angular directions was investigated. The amplitude of temperature fluctuation at the UIS bottom plate was largely dependent on the magnitude of the outlet velocity of the control rod fuel assemblies. From the calculated results, it was found that the largest temperature fluctuation occurred at the radial edge of the UIS bottom in the KALIMER design. Since thermal striping is dependent on the amplitude of temperature fluctuations and frequency, the region of the UIS bottom edge needs to be analyzed with a detailed unsteady calculation.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 223-238","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1093013580","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840323","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840323","","Nuclear Technology","2","152"

Some new methods are likely to be three dimensional. Coupling is expected between system codes, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modules, and cascades of computations at scales ranging from the macro- or system scale to the micro- or turbulence scales, with the various levels continuously exchanging information back and forth. The ISP-42/PANDA and the international SETH project provide opportunities for testing applications of single-phase CFD methods to LWR safety problems. Although industrial single-phase CFD applications are commonplace, computational multifluid dynamics is still under development. However, first applications are appearing; the state of the art and its potential uses are discussed. The case study of condensation of steam/air mixtures injected from a downward-facing vent into a pool of water is a perfect illustration of a simulation cascade: At the top of the hierarchy of scales, system behavior can be modeled with a system code; at the central level, the volume-of-fluid method can be applied to predict large-scale bubbling behavior; at the bottom of the cascade, direct-contact condensation can be treated with direct numerical simulation, in which turbulent flow (in both the gas and the liquid), interfacial dynamics, and heat/mass transfer are directly simulated without resorting to models.","","","","","","United States","2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 239-251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1094013581","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840324","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840324","","Nuclear Technology","2","152"

Its computational efficiency is compared with a single-grid biconjugate gradient stabilized (BICGSTAB) iteration scheme in popular use in terms of 3-D 4N/A nonlinear analytical nodal method solutions to Nuclear Energy Agency Committee on Reactor Physics pressurized water reactor rod ejection benchmark problems. It is shown that in computational efficiency, the 3GCS excels the BICGSTAB iteration method using preconditioners such as Jacobi, incomplete lower and upper (ILU), and 3-D block incomplete lower and upper (BILU3D) preconditioners. It is also shown that coarse-grid residual equations based on the 3-D 1N/A grid structure can predict temporal truncation errors as accurately as the 3-D 4N/A fine-grid residual equation but with considerably less overhead computing time for variable time-step size control calculations by a step doubling method. In addition, incorporation of preconditioners into the 3GCS is shown to enhance further efficiency of the nonpreconditioned 3GCS. From these results, it is concluded that the temporal adaptive 3GCS employing coarse-grid residual equations for temporal step-size control as well as the preconditioner like the BILU3D can provide a very efficient iterative solution scheme for transient nonlinear nodal calculations.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 212-223","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0446109966","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808474","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808474","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","151"

The analyses reveal that for this peculiar problem, there is a need to convert all the computer codes to DOUBLE-PRECISION as well as to increase to seven the number of digits of the ANISN library generated by XSDRNPM. Contrary to the traditional diffusion theory codes, TORT k{sub eff} results are very sensitive to the number of both fine and broad groups.

The data include the axial redistributions of flow rates of both phases and void fraction in the respective subchannels. By fitting the above data with the Lahey and Moody void settling model, we have determined a void diffusion coefficient in their model. It is found that the void diffusion coefficient for slug, churn, and annular flows could be well correlated in terms of a turbulent Peclet number developed in our previous study. Furthermore, a subchannel analysis code based on a two-fluid model proposed in our previous study is examined against the present data. In the code, the void settling model is incorporated with usual conservation equations of mass and momentum. From the examination, it is found that the subchannel analysis code can predict well the data on subchannel flow and void fraction for the 2 x 3 rod channel if appropriate correlations are adopted to evaluate wall and interfacial friction forces needed in the two-fluid model.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 23-37","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1079013566","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840309","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840309","","Nuclear Technology","1","152"

However, some boiling water reactors' AOO events result in immediate scram or suppression of the reactor power due to an increase in the reactor coolant void fraction. Recent studies show that a short duration of dryout inside the fuel assembly only leads to a small rise in the fuel-cladding temperature and thus does not pose a threat to fuel integrity. Many tests on BT and an improved comprehension of its mechanism have led to the development of a methodology to appropriately assess the fuel-cladding temperature after BT has been reached. The Standards Committee of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan has therefore proposed a cladding temperature criterion after BT. Applying the post-BT standard enables the value of the operating limit minimum critical power ratio (OLMCPR) to be decreased by allowing for a short duration of dryout. We calculated the fuel-cladding temperature and dryout duration in the load rejection condition without a bypass event. The calculated results show that both the fuel-cladding temperature and dryout duration meet the post-BT standard in the case of a small OLMCPR, which is determined by the loss of feedwater heating. This enables a more efficient reactor core to be designed by applying the post-BT standard to licensing analysis. The possibility of applying a post-BT standard is demonstrated from the results of this work.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 105-117","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1084013571","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840314","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840314","","Nuclear Technology","1","152"

A model of interfacial friction based on an interfacial sublayer concept and three interfacial heat transfer models - namely, a model based on the small eddies-controlled surface renewal concept, a model based on the asymptotic behavior of the eddy viscosity, and a model based on the interfacial sublayer concept - are implemented into a preliminary version of the NEPTUNE code based on the 3-D module of the CATHARE code. As a first step, the models are evaluated by comparison of calculated profiles of velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent shear stress with data in a turbulent air-water stratified flow in a rectangular channel and with data for a water jet impacting the free surface of a water pool. Then, a turbulent steam-water stratified flow with condensation is calculated, and some first conclusions are drawn on the interfacial heat transfer modeling and on the applicability of the model to PTS investigations.","","","","","","United States","2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 152; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 129-142","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1086013573","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840316","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840316","","Nuclear Technology","1","152"
"Plutonium Multirecycling in Standard PWRs Loaded with Evolutionary Fuels","Youinou, Gilles; Vasile, Alfredo","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AUGMENTATION; CERIUM OXIDES; ELECTRICITY; ENRICHMENT; FAST REACTORS; FUEL RODS; HEAVY METALS; INVENTORIES; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; PERFORMANCE; PLUTONIUM; PLUTONIUM OXIDES; POWER GENERATION; PWR TYPE REACTORS; THERMAL NEUTRONS; URANIUM 235; URANIUM DIOXIDE; VOID COEFFICIENT","If it becomes necessary to stabilize the Pu inventory before the advent of Gen IV fast reactors, then it must be multirecycled in thermal neutron reactors like pressurized water reactors (PWRs). However, because of the neutron physics characteristics of Pu, it is difficult to multirecycle it in mixed-oxide (MOX)-fueled PWRs. Indeed, since there are fewer and fewer fissile isotopes in Pu, it is necessary to compensate by increasing its content, causing it to quickly reach values where the void coefficient is positive (above 12% Pu). To avoid this, Pu must be used together with enriched U so that its degradation is compensated by an increase of {sup 235}U enrichment. Two possibilities of mixing Pu and enriched U in the same assembly are presented (homogeneously and heterogeneously). In the first, called MOX-UE, all the fuel rods are made of PuO{sub 2}-U{sub enriched}O{sub 2}, whereas the second, called CORAIL, contains approximately one-third of standard MOX rods (PuO{sub 2}-U{sub tail}O{sub 2}) and two-thirds of UO{sub 2} rods. A variant of the CORAIL concept in which the MOX rods are substituted with inert matrix fuel rods (PuO{sub 2}-CeO{sub 2}) was also studied. These assemblies allow Pu to be multirecycled in standard PWRs, thus stabilizing the Pu inventory between 200 and 400 t heavy metal (for a nuclear electricity production of 400 TW.h(electric)/yr, i.e., typical of a country such as France). The number of reactors loaded with Pu depends on the performances of each concept in terms of Pu burning, and it represents between 80% (CORAIL with the MOX rods) and 30% (MOX-UE with 12% Pu) of the total power. There is only a small difference regarding the needs in natural U between the Pu monorecycling option and the different Pu multirecycling options. Hence, it appears that saving U should not be offered as an incentive for multirecycling Pu in PWRs.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 25-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0431109951","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808459","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808459","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","151"

Specifically, the adjoint sensitivity model corresponding to the heat structure models in RELAP5/MOD3.2 is derived and subsequently augmented to the two-fluid adjoint sensitivity model (ASM-REL/TF). The end product, called ASM-REL/TFH, comprises the complete adjoint sensitivity model for the coupled fluid dynamics/heat structure packages of the large-scale simulation code RELAP5/MOD3.2. The ASM-REL/TFH model is validated by computing sensitivities to the initial conditions for various time-dependent temperatures in the test bundle of the Quench-04 reactor safety experiment. This experiment simulates the reflooding with water of uncovered, degraded fuel rods, clad with material (Zircaloy-4) that has the same composition and size as that used in typical pressurized water reactors. The most important response for the Quench-04 experiment is the time evolution of the cladding temperature of heated fuel rods. The ASM-REL/TFH model is subsequently used to perform an illustrative sensitivity analysis of this and other time-dependent temperatures within the bundle. The results computed by using the augmented adjoint sensitivity system, ASM-REL/TFH, highlight the reliability, efficiency, and usefulness of the adjoint sensitivity analysis procedure for computing time-dependent sensitivities.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0434109954","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808462","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808462","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","151"

Interest has been shifted to the so-called hybrid reactors [accelerator-driven systems (ADS)] as an alternative technology for power generation and transmutation, thus requiring precise knowledge about nuclear structure and nuclear reaction characteristics. Research groups from Instituto de Fisica, Universidade de Sao Paulo and Brazilian Center for Research in Physics made a joint effort to develop a computer program, CRISP, to calculate the intranuclear cascade proprieties and the nuclear evaporation process, present in all nuclear reactions with energies above a few tens of mega-electron-volts, using Monte Carlo techniques. Some reaction channels were included in these programs, resulting in a more realistic representation of the processes involved, aiming at reactor physics studies and academic studies about hadron and meson properties in nuclear matter. Some results obtained with this code and a comparison with experimental data are presented. Although all these results are preliminary, they are very consistent with the available experimental data. Since the applicability of the CRISP package has a wide range of options, especially in ADS, some results describing the effectiveness of the code were achieved.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 82-87","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0435109955","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808463","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808463","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","151"

To parameterize azimuthal asymmetry in core loading, an amplification factor F is introduced into the model to vary azimuthal mode feedback coefficients. Bifurcation analysis code BIFDD and numerical integration are used to analyze the reduced-order model composed of 22 modified ordinary differential equations. Results are presented for effects of azimuthal asymmetry (as parameterized by the amplification parameter F) on characteristics of oscillations. Analysis of eigenvectors corresponding to the two pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues with the largest and second largest real parts suggests that one of these pairs is responsible for in-phase oscillations and the other for the out-of-phase oscillations.For a uniform core without azimuthal asymmetry (F = 1), as a bifurcation parameter (total pressure drop) is varied, the pair of eigenvalues corresponding to the fundamental mode first cross the imaginary axis, thus making the system unstable and leading to in-phase oscillations. However, for azimuthally asymmetric cores (corresponding to large values of F) and small inlet subcooling, the pair of eigenvalues corresponding to the first azimuthal mode, whose real part is the second largest for F = 1 case, approach the vertical axis faster (as a bifurcation parameter is varied) than those corresponding to the fundamental mode, thus becoming the dominant pair of eigenvalues. This leads to out-of-phase oscillations. Results of bifurcation analyses show that both sub- and supercritical bifurcation can occur for large as well as small azimuthal asymmetry, depending on values of other operating parameters. Changes in characteristics of oscillations (in-phase or out-of-phase; super- or subcritical bifurcation), therefore, result along the stability boundary. Numerical integrations confirm the results of stability and bifurcation analyses.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 95-113","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0437109957","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808465","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808465","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","151"

In this paper a general core layout is presented for a 2400-MW(thermal) GCFR. Two fuel elements are discussed: a TRISO-based coated particle and the innovative hollow sphere concept. Sustainability calls for recycling of all minor actinides (MAs) in the core and a breeding gain close to unity. A fuel cycle is designed allowing operation over a long period, requiring refueling with {sup 238}U only. The evolution of nuclides in the GCFR core is calculated using the SCALE system (one-dimensional and three-dimensional). Calculations were done over multiple irradiation cycles including reprocessing. The result is that it is possible to design a fuel and GCFR core with a breeding gain around unity, with recycling of all MAs from cycle to cycle. The burnup reactivity swing is small, improving safety. After several fuel batches an equilibrium core is reached. MA loading in the core remains limited, and the fuel temperature coefficient is always negative.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 221-238","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1066013553","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840296","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840296","","Nuclear Technology","3","151"

This type of reactor will be able to open new frontiers of research for Generation IV reactors, the Space Propulsion Program, and the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative. With the confluence of these three programs' fast-spectrum testing needs, we set out to conceptualize a new system by looking at previous successful reactor concepts. This paper presents a new concept for a fast-spectrum test reactor that is horizontal in orientation, with individual pressure tubes running the entire length of the scattering-medium tank filled with a liquid heavy metal. This approach for a test reactor will provide more flexibility in refueling, sample removal, and ability to completely reconfigure the core to meet different users' requirements. Full core neutronic analysis of more than 14 combinations showed that a large hexagonal steam-cooled U-10Zr fuel, with a core power of 267 MW(thermal), produced a fast flux (&gt;0.1 MeV) of 1.3 x 10{sup 15} n/cm{sup 2}.s averaged over the whole length of the irradiation channel. A depletion run with an initial enrichment of 20 wt% {sup 235}U had a flat reactivity curve for the first 180 days of cycle due to in-core breeding. Although considerable neutronic optimization and a thermal-hydraulic analysis remain to be performed, it appears that a reactor core with this innovative geometry could meet future fast flux testing needs.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 239-249","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1067013554","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840297","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840297","","Nuclear Technology","3","151"

The methodology to analyze BWR signals includes the following: (a) the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, (b) decomposition using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and (c) application of multiresolution analysis (MRA) using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). STFT analysis permits the study, in time, of the spectral content of analyzed signals. The CWT provides information about ruptures, discontinuities, and fractal behavior. To detect these important features in the signal, a mother wavelet has to be chosen and applied at several scales to obtain optimum results. MRA allows fast implementation of the DWT. Features like important frequencies, discontinuities, and transients can be detected with analysis at different levels of detail coefficients. The STFT was used to provide a comparison between a classic method and the wavelet-based method. The damping ratio, which is an important stability parameter, was calculated as a function of time. The transient behavior can be detected by analyzing the maximum contained in detail coefficients at different levels in the signal decomposition. This method allows analysis of both stationary signals and highly nonstationary signals in the timescale plane. This methodology has been tested with the benchmark power instability event of Laguna Verde nuclear power plant (NPP) Unit 1, which is a BWR-5 NPP.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-260","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1068013555","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840298","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840298","","Nuclear Technology","3","151"

Results for a molybdenum-based Ceramic-Metal (CerMet) fuel, a magnesia-based Ceramic-Ceramic fuel, and a zirconium-nitride-based fuel are reported. The focus is on the inherent safety aspects of core design. Accident analyses are carried out for the response to unprotected loss-of-flow and accelerator beam-overpower transients and coolant voiding scenarios. An attempt is made to establish basic design limits for the fuel and cladding. Maximum temperatures during transients are determined and compared with design limits. Reactivity effects associated with coolant void, fuel and structural expansion, and cladding relocation are investigated. Design studies encompass variations in lattice pitch and pin diameter. Critical mass studies are performed. The studies indicate favorable inherent safety features of the CerMet fuel. Major consideration is given to the potential threat of coolant voiding in accelerator-driven design proposals. Results for a transient test case study of a postulated steam generator tube rupture event leading to extensive coolant voiding are presented. The study underlines the importance of having a low coolant void reactivity value in a lead-bismuth system despite the high boiling temperature of the coolant. It was found that the power rise following a voiding transient increases dramatically near the critical state. The studies suggest that a reactivity margin of a few dollars in the voided state is sufficient to permit significant reactivity insertions.","","","","","","United States","2005-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 314-333","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1075013562","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840305","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840305","","Nuclear Technology","3","151"

The fission products could be stored at the same underground location. With graphite replacement or new cores and with the liquid fuel transferred to the new cores periodically, the power plant could operate for up to 200 yr with no transport of fissile material to the reactor or of wastes from the reactor during this period. Advantages that include utilization of an abundant fuel, inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use, together with good economics and safety features such as an underground location will diminish public concerns.

A comprehensive study was performed considering 12-, 18-, and 24-month fuel cycles over a wide range of discharge burnups. A neutronic study was performed followed by an economic evaluation. The first phase of the study limited the fuel enrichments used in the study to &lt;5 wt% {sup 235}U consistent with constraints today. The second phase extended the range of discharge burnups for 18-month cycles by using fuel enriched in excess of 5 wt%. The neutronic study used state-of-the-art reactor physics methods to accurately determine enrichment requirements. Energy requirements were consistent with today's high capacity factors (&gt;98%) and short (15-day) refueling outages. The economic evaluation method considers various component costs including uranium, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and spent-fuel storage costs as well as the effect of discounting of the revenue stream. The resulting fuel cycle costs as a function of cycle length and discharge burnup are presented and discussed. Fuel costs decline with increasing discharge burnup for all cycle lengths up to the maximum discharge burnup considered. The choice of optimum cycle length depends on assumptions for outage costs.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 109-119","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1057013544","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840287","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840287","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

The next step for BWRs in the new millennium is 24-month cycles and extended power uprates as high as 120% power. These operating conditions lead to large reload fuel batch sizes (up to 45% of the core) that result in lower batch average discharge burnups ({approx}45 GWd/tonne U).

The Studsvik Scandpower code suite was used to model a Westinghouse three-loop PWR core, and realistic loading patterns were derived. The loading patterns were optimized for minimum power peaking and maximum cycle length using engineering judgment and automated binary shuffles. Gadolinia was found to control power peaking to within current F{sub {delta}}{sub H} design limits up to 70 GWd/tonne, with only a slight deterioration thereafter. The moderator temperature coefficient, boron coefficient, and control rod worth were calculated and shown to fall within existing design limits.An economic analysis was carried out to determine the most economic discharge burnup based on fuel cycle costs only. It was found that the lowest fuel cycle costs were obtained with average discharge burnups between 70 to 75 GWd/tonne (initial enrichments between 6 to 7 wt%).The energy generated per tonne of uranium ore used was calculated and shown to peak between 40 to 60 GWd/tonne. Also, the radiotoxicity generated per GW.yr(electric) was calculated for each fuel management scheme and found to reduce considerably with burnup between 100 and 100 000 yr.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 126-132","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1059013546","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840289","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840289","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

Since fast breeder reactors are at present not available, the majority of spent fuel discharged from commercial nuclear reactors is intended for direct final disposal or designated for interim storage. An effective form of intermediate plutonium storage is recycling in thermal reactors. Recycling of the recovered plutonium in commercial light water reactors (LWRs) is currently practiced in Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland. The number of mixed-oxide (MOX) assemblies reloaded each year in a large variety of reactors demonstrates that plutonium recycling in LWRs has reached industrial maturity. The status of experience gained today at Framatome ANP confirms the reliability of the design codes and the suitability of fuel assembly and core designs. The validation database for increasing exposures of MOX fuel is being continuously expanded. This provides the basis for further extending the discharge exposures of MOX assemblies and for licensing the use of higher plutonium concentrations. Options to support the weapons plutonium reduction programs and for the development of advanced MOX assembly designs are investigated.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 159-167","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1061013548","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840291","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840291","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

The main sources of proliferation potential and radiotoxicity are the plutonium and higher actinides generated during the burnup of standard LWR fuel. A significant reduction in the quantity and quality of the generated Pu can be achieved by replacing the {sup 238}U fertile component of conventional low-enriched uranium fuel by {sup 232}Th. Thorium can also be used as a way to manage the growth of plutonium stockpiles by burning plutonium, or achieving a net-zero transuranic production, sustainable recycle scenario. This paper summarizes some of the results of recent studies of the performance of thorium-based fuels.It is concluded that the use of heterogeneous U-Th fuel provides higher neutronic potential than a homogeneous fuel. However, in the former case, the uranium portion of the fuel operates at a higher power density, and care is needed to meet the thermal margins and address the higher-burnup implications. In macroheterogeneous designs, the U-Th fuel can yield reduced spent-fuel volume, toxicity, and decay heat. The main advantage of Pu-Th oxide over mixed oxide is better void reactivity behavior even for undermoderated designs, and increased burnup of Pu.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 168-176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1062013549","10.13182/NT151-168","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20840292","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840292","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

One option is once-for-life cores having relatively low power density. These cores are fueled in the factory; there is no refueling or fuel shuffling on site. A second option is very long-life cores being made of a fissioning zone and a natural uranium blanket zone. The fissioning zone very slowly drifts toward the blanket. A third option is multirecycling of light water reactor (LWR) discharged fuel without partitioning of transuranics (TRUs) in fuel-self-sustaining reactors. LWR spent fuel could provide the initial fuel loading after extracting fission products and {approx}90% of its uranium. The makeup fuel is natural or depleted uranium. A fourth option is the high-burnup once-through fuel cycle using natural or depleted uranium feed. The initial fuel loading of this reactor is a mixture of enriched and natural uranium. The natural uranium utilization is 10 to 20 times higher than that of a once-through LWR. A fifth option is transmutation of TRUs from LWRs using critical HLM-cooled reactors; such reactors could be designed to have the same high actinide burning capability of accelerator-driven systems and have comparable safety, but at a substantially lower cost. These novel reactor designs and fuel management options are hereby reviewed.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 177-191","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1063013550","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840293","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840293","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

For pebbles fueled with different loadings of plutonium, the feasibility of a sustained fuel cycle under nominal reactor conditions was investigated by means of the reactivity and temperature coefficients of the reactor. The HTR-MODUL was found to be a very effective reactor to reduce the stockpile of first-generation plutonium. It reduces the amount of plutonium to about one-sixth of the original and reduces the risk of proliferation by denaturing the plutonium vector. For second-generation plutonium the incineration is less favorable, as the amount of plutonium is only halved.","","","","","","United States","2005-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 192-200","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1064013551","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840294","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840294","","Nuclear Technology","2","151"

It deploys highly enriched uranium, water-cooled concentric plate fuel elements, positioned inside a beryllium reflector with a complex hyperboloid arrangement of test holes. The objective of this paper is to validate the MCNP and ORIGEN-S three-dimensional (3-D) model for reactivity predictions of the entire BR2 core during reactor operation. We employ the Monte Carlo code MCNP-4C to evaluate the effective multiplication factor k{sub eff} and 3-D space-dependent specific power distribution. The one-dimensional code ORIGEN-S is used to calculate the isotopic fuel depletion versus burnup and to prepare a database with depleted fuel compositions. The approach taken is to evaluate the 3-D power distribution at each time step and along with the database to evaluate the 3-D isotopic fuel depletion at the next step and to deduce the corresponding shim rod positions of the reactor operation. The capabilities of both codes are fully exploited without constraints on the number of involved isotope depletion chains or an increase of the computational time. The reactor has a complex operation, with important shutdowns between cycles, and its reactivity is strongly influenced by poisons, mainly {sup 3}He and {sup 6}Li from the beryllium reflector, and the burnable absorbers {sup 149}Sm and {sup 10}B in the fresh UAl{sub x} fuel.

The primary concern has been the potential health effects resulting from exposure to residual radioactive materials to be released for unrestricted use. These debates have intensified in the last decade as many regulated facilities are seeking viable management decisions on the disposition of the large amounts of materials potentially containing very low levels of residual radioactivity. Such facilities include the nuclear weapons complex sites managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), commercial power plants licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other materials licensees regulated by the NRC or the Agreement States. Other facilities that generate radioactive material containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) or technologically enhanced NORM (TENORM) are also seeking to dispose of similar materials that may be radioactively contaminated. In contrast to the facilities operated by the DOE and the nuclear power plants licensed by the NRC, NORM and TENORM facilities are regulated by the individual states. Current federal laws and regulations do not specify criteria for releasing these materials that may contain residual radioactivity of either man-made or natural origin from regulatory controls. In fact, the current regulatory scheme offers no explicit provision as to permit materials being released as ''non-radioactive'', including those that are essentially free of contamination. The only method used to date with limited success has been case-by-case evaluation and approval. In addition, there is a poorly defined and inconsistent regulatory framework for regulating NORM and TENORM. Some years ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) introduced the concept of clearance, that is, controlling releases of any such materials within the regulatory domain. This paper aims to clarify clearance as an important disposition option for solid materials, establish the framework and basis of release, and discuss resolutions regarding the implementation of such a disposition option.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The effectiveness of the new flux-mapping method is examined in terms of online flux-mapping calculations with numerically simulated true flux distribution and detector signals and those with the actual core-follow data for the Wolsong CANDU PHWRs in Korea. The effects of core neutronics models as well as the detector failures and uncertainties of measured detector signals on the effectiveness of the least-squares flux-mapping calculations are also examined.The following results are obtained. The least-squares method predicts the flux distribution in better agreement with the simulated true flux distribution than the standard core neutronics calculations by the finite difference method (FDM) computer code without using the detector signals. The adoption of the nonlinear nodal method based on the unified nodal method formulation instead of the FDM results in a significant improvement in prediction accuracy of the flux-mapping calculations. The detector signals estimated from the least-squares flux-mapping calculations are much closer to the measured detector signals than those from the flux synthesis method (FSM), the current online flux-mapping method for CANDU reactors. The effect of detector failures is relatively small so that the plant can tolerate up to 25% of detector failures without seriously affecting the plant operation. The detector signal uncertainties aggravate accuracy of the flux-mapping calculations, yet the effects of signal uncertainties of the order of 1% standard deviation can be tolerable without seriously degrading the prediction accuracy of the least-squares method. The least-squares method is disadvantageous because it requires longer CPU time than the existing FSM. Considering ever-increasing computer speed and the improved operational safety margin of CANDU reactors gained by accurate flux-mapping calculations, however, it is concluded that the least-squares method presents an effective alternative to the existing flux-mapping method for CANDU reactors.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 299-309","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0422109942","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808450","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808450","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","150"

Commercial production of medical isotopes in solution reactors requires steady-state operation at {approx}200 kW. At this power regime, fuel-solution temperature increase and radiolytic-gas bubble formation introduce a negative reactivity feedback that has to be mitigated. A model based on the point reactor kinetic equations has been developed to investigate these reactivity effects.

A total of 23 papers was presented on this topic at ANFM-III. Nuclear fuel management involves making the so-called out-of-core and in-core decisions. Simply put, the out-of-core decisions address the attributes of the new (fresh) fuel that will be fabricated and the partially burnt (shuffled) fuel to reinsert into the core for additional energy production. The in-core decisions address where the fresh and burnt fuel along with burnable poisons should be located in the core. The above applies to batch refueling strategies, e.g., pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors (BWRs). For BWRs, additional in-core decisions enter to address control rod pattern paired with core flow rate as a function of burnup. It is obvious that the out-of-core and in-core decisions are coupled.The objective of nuclear fuel management is to minimize the cost of electrical energy generation subject to operational and safety constraints. Since fuel resides in the core for several cycles, a multicycle assessment is required to make nuclear fuel management decisions. For nearly four decades there has been an effort to develop automated computational capability to assist the reload core nuclear design engineer in making nuclear fuel management decisions. This development has ranged from employment of heuristic rules to utilization of mathematical optimization approaches. This overview reviews the development of nuclear fuel management optimization capabilities by first defining the problem, then describing current capabilities, and finally projecting where future capabilities need to be developed to support the needs of reload core nuclear design engineers.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-8","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1047013534","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840277","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840277","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"
"Adaptive Core Simulation Employing Discrete Inverse Theory - Part I: Theory","Abdel-Khalik, Hany S; Turinsky, Paul J","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; FORECASTING; INFORMATION; POWER DISTRIBUTION; REACTIVITY; REACTOR PHYSICS; RELIABILITY; SIMULATION; SIMULATORS; THERMAL HYDRAULICS","Use of adaptive simulation is intended to improve the fidelity and robustness of important core attribute predictions such as core power distribution, thermal margins, and core reactivity. Adaptive simulation utilizes a selected set of past and current reactor measurements of reactor observables, i.e., in-core instrumentation readings, to adapt the simulation in a meaningful way. A meaningful adaption will result in high-fidelity and robust adapted core simulator models. To perform adaption, we propose an inverse theory approach in which the multitudes of input data to core simulators, i.e., reactor physics and thermal-hydraulic data, are to be adjusted to improve agreement with measured observables while keeping core simulator models unadapted. At first glance, devising such adaption for typical core simulators with millions of input and observables data would spawn not only several prohibitive challenges but also numerous disparaging concerns. The challenges include the computational burdens of the sensitivity-type calculations required to construct Jacobian operators for the core simulator models. Also, the computational burdens of the uncertainty-type calculations required to estimate the uncertainty information of core simulator input data present a demanding challenge. The concerns however are mainly related to the reliability of the adjusted input data. The methodologies of adaptive simulation are well established in the literature of data adjustment. We adopt the same general framework for data adjustment; however, we refrain from solving the fundamental adjustment equations in a conventional manner. We demonstrate the use of our so-called Efficient Subspace Methods (ESMs) to overcome the computational and storage burdens associated with the core adaption problem. We illustrate the successful use of ESM-based adaptive techniques for a typical boiling water reactor core simulator adaption problem.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 9-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1048013535","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840278","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840278","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"
"Adaptive Core Simulation Employing Discrete Inverse Theory - Part II: Numerical Experiments","Abdel-Khalik, Hany S; Turinsky, Paul J","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; POWER DISTRIBUTION; REACTIVITY; SENSITIVITY; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; SIMULATION; SIMULATORS","Use of adaptive simulation is intended to improve the fidelity and robustness of important core attribute predictions such as core power distribution, thermal margins, and core reactivity. Adaptive simulation utilizes a selected set of past and current reactor measurements of reactor observables, i.e., in-core instrumentation readings, to adapt the simulation in a meaningful way. The companion paper, ''Adaptive Core Simulation Employing Discrete Inverse Theory - Part I: Theory,'' describes in detail the theoretical background of the proposed adaptive techniques. This paper, Part II, demonstrates several computational experiments conducted to assess the fidelity and robustness of the proposed techniques. The intent is to check the ability of the adapted core simulator model to predict future core observables that are not included in the adaption or core observables that are recorded at core conditions that differ from those at which adaption is completed. Also, this paper demonstrates successful utilization of an efficient sensitivity analysis approach to calculate the sensitivity information required to perform the adaption for millions of input core parameters. Finally, this paper illustrates a useful application for adaptive simulation - reducing the inconsistencies between two different core simulator code systems, where the multitudes of input data to one code are adjusted to enhance the agreement between both codes for important core attributes, i.e., core reactivity and power distribution. Also demonstrated is the robustness of such an application.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1049013536","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840279","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"

In order to take advantage of the improved economics offered by these modern fuel designs while simultaneously assuring safe and reliable reactor operation, both the reload design process and the online core monitoring procedures must be based on appropriate calculation methods. The modeling of transition cores involving the gradual introduction of these new fuel designs poses a severe challenge for the current core physics methods. Recognizing this, Westinghouse has engaged in a continuing process of improving its core physics calculation packages. This development program is supported by a comprehensive validation effort to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the improved methods as well as to identify areas requiring further development. The purpose of this paper is to summarize some of the results of this program.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51-59","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1051013538","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840281","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840281","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"
"Uncertainty Estimates in Cold Critical Eigenvalue Predictions","Karve, Atul A; Moore, Brian R; Mills, Vernon W; Marrotte, Gary N","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; CONTROL ELEMENTS; DIFFUSION EQUATIONS; EIGENVALUES; FORECASTING; SIMULATION; SIMULATORS; TRANSFER FUNCTIONS","A recent cycle of a General Electric boiling water reactor performed two beginning-of-cycle local cold criticals. The eigenvalues estimated by the core simulator were 0.99826 and 1.00610. The large spread in them (= 0.00784) is a source of concern, and it is studied here. An analysis process is developed using statistical techniques, where first a transfer function relating the core observable Y (eigenvalue) to various factors (X's) is established. Engineering judgment is used to recognize the best candidates for X's. They are identified as power-weighted assembly k{sub {infinity}}'s of selected assemblies around the withdrawn rods. These are a small subset of many X's that could potentially influence Y. However, the intention here is not to do a comprehensive study by accounting for all the X's. Rather, the scope is to demonstrate that the process developed is reasonable and to show its applicability to performing detailed studies. Variability in X's is obtained by perturbing nodal k{sub {infinity}}'s since they directly influence the buckling term in the quasi-two-group diffusion equation model of the core simulator. Any perturbations introduced in them are bounded by standard well-established uncertainties. The resulting perturbations in the X's may not necessarily be directly correlated to physical attributes, but they encompass numerous biases and uncertainties credited to input and modeling uncertainties. The 'vital few' from the 'unimportant many' X's are determined, and then they are subgrouped according to assembly type, location, exposure, and control rod insertion. The goal is to study how the subgroups influence Y in order to have a better understanding of the variability observed in it.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 60-69","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1052013539","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840282","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840282","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"

A nondestructive experimental method for such validation has been developed based on a tomographic technique. The gamma-ray flux distribution is recorded in each axial node of the fuel assembly separately, whereby the relative rod-by-rod content of the fission product {sup 140}Ba is determined. Measurements indicate that 1 to 2% accuracy (1{sigma}) is achievable.A device has been constructed for in-pool measurements at reactor sites. The applicability has been demonstrated in measurements at the Swedish boiling water reactor (BWR) Forsmark 2 on irradiated fuel with a cooling time of 4 to 5 weeks. Data from the production code POLCA-7 have been compared to measured rod-by-rod contents of {sup 140}Ba. An agreement of 3.1% (1{sigma}) has been demonstrated.It is estimated that measurements can be performed on a complete BWR assembly in 25 axial nodes within an 8-h work shift. As compared to the conventional method, involving gamma scanning of individual fuel rods, this method does not require the fuel to be disassembled nor does the fuel channel have to be removed. The cost per measured fuel rod is estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than the conventional method.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 70-76","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1053013540","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840283","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840283","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"

The results of this study are to be applied to future reload designs. A new method, the Modified Power Shape Forced Diffusion (MPSFD) method, is presented that initially computes the BP cross section to force the power distribution into a desired shape. The method employs a simple formula that expresses the BP cross section as a function of the difference between the calculated radial power distributions (RPDs) and the limit set for the maximum RPD. This method places BPs into all fresh fuel assemblies (FAs) having an RPD greater than the limit. The MPSFD method then reduces the BP content by reducing the BPs in fresh FAs with the lowest RPDs. Finally, the minimum BP content is attained via a heuristic fine-tuning procedure.This new BP design program has been automated by incorporating the new MPSFD method in conjunction with the heuristic fine-tuning program. The program has automatically produced excellent results for the reference core, and has the potential to reduce fuel costs and save manpower.","","","","","","United States","2005-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 86-95","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1055013542","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840285","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840285","","Nuclear Technology","1","151"

Their uses have shown that both core design and shuffling sequence optimization can be exploited to reduce the time needed for reloading a core with an in-core shuffling scheme.

There are considerable advantages of the MFE as compared with the traditional fuel rods, such as: Using supercritical and superheated steam considerably increases the thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle up to 44-45%. Strong negative coolant and void reactivity coefficients with a very short thermal delay time allow the reactor to shutdown quickly in the event of a reactivity or power excursion. Core melting and the creation of corium during severe accidents are impossible. The heat transfer surface area is larger by several orders of magnitude due to the small spherical dimensions of the MFE.

In addition, current reactor safety systems are considering auxiliary cooling schemes that assure ex-vessel debris coolability utilizing direct water injection into molten material pools to achieve core quenching and eventual coolability. The phenomenon common in both applications is direct contact heat exchange. The current study focuses on detailed measurements of liquid-metal/water direct contact heat exchange that is directly applicable to improvements in effective heat transfer in devices that are being considered for both of these purposes.In this study, a test facility was designed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to map the operating range of liquid-metal/water direct contact heat exchange. The test section (184-cm height, 45.75-cm width, and 10-cm depth) is a rectangular slice of a larger heat exchange device. This apparatus was used not only to provide measurements of integral thermal performance (i.e., volumetric heat transfer coefficient), but also local heat transfer coefficients in a bubbly flow regime with X-ray imaging based on measured parameters such as bubble formation time, bubble rise velocity, and bubble diameters.To determine these local heat transfer coefficients, a complete methodology of the X-ray radiography for two-phase flow measurement has been developed. With this methodology, a high-energy X-ray imaging system is optimized for our heat exchange experiments. With this real-time, large-area, high-energy X-ray imaging system, the two-phase flow was quantitatively visualized. An efficient image processing strategy was developed by combining several optimal digital image-processing algorithms into a software computational tool written in MATLAB called T-XIP. Time-dependent heat transfer-related variables such as bubble volumes and velocities, were determined. Finally, an error analysis associated with these measurements has been given based on two independent procedures. This methodology will allow one to utilize X-ray attenuation for imaging vapor bubbles with acceptable errors (bubbles {approx}1 to 5 cm {+-} 5 to 20%).Subcooled water (T{sub sat} - T{sub water} [approximately equal to] 10 deg. C) was brought into contact with liquid lead (or lead alloys) at an elevated temperature (T{sub lm} = 500 deg. C and T{sub lm} - T{sub melting} [approximately equal to] 200 deg. C). The study was conducted over a range of ambient pressures (1 to 10 bar) with four different water injection rates (1.5 to 8 g/s; 0.1 to 1 kg/m{sup 2}.s). The results showed that the system pressure has a slight effect on volumetric heat transfer coefficient, the bubble formation time, and the bubble rise velocity. Increasing the system pressure, however, resulted in an increase in the bubble average heat transfer coefficient. Increasing the water injection rate directly had only a small effect on the bubble rise velocity or formation rate. Increasing the water injection rate resulted in a decrease in the local bubble heat transfer coefficient.Direct contact heat transfer also has some key disadvantages; e.g., flow instabilities caused by local vapor explosion is one of the issues related to direct contact heat exchange, particularly for liquid/liquid exchange with high temperature differences. In this study, the region of stable heat transfer was mapped and the effects of the liquid metal temperature, the water injection rate, and the operating pressure were investigated. The pressure required to stabilize the heat exchange process was found to be a function of the water injection rate but generally increasing the system pressure helped stabilize the system. It was also found that the larger the injection rate, the higher the pressure required to stabilize the 0012syst.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 182-220","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0415109935","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808443","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808443","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","150"

The purpose of this work is to investigate the containment flooding strategy of the Mark-III system after a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) breach. The Kuosheng Power Plant is a typical BWR-6 nuclear power plant (NPP) with Mark-III containment. The Severe Accident Management Guideline (SAMG) of the Kuosheng NPP has been developed based on the BWR Owners Group (BWROG) Emergency Procedure and Severe Accident Guidelines, Rev. 2. Therefore, the Kuosheng NPP is selected as the plant for study, and the MAAP4 code is chosen as the tool for analysis. A postulated specific station blackout sequence for the Kuosheng NPP is cited as a reference case for this analysis. Because of the design features of Mark-III containment, the debris in the reactor cavity may not be submerged after an RPV breach when one follows the containment flooding strategy as suggested in the BWROG generic guideline, and the containment integrity could be challenged eventually. A more specific containment flooding strategy with drywell venting after an RPV breach is investigated, and a more stable plant condition is achieved with this strategy. Accordingly, the containment flooding strategy after an RPV breach will be modified for the Kuosheng SAMG, and these results are applicable to typical Mark-III plants with drywell vent path.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 251-262","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1041013528","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840271","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840271","","Nuclear Technology","3","150"
"Hydrogen Mitigation Strategy of the APR1400 Nuclear Power Plant for a Hypothetical Station Blackout Accident","Kim, Jongtae; Hong, Seong-Wan; Kim, Sang-Baik; Kim, Hee-Dong","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; CONTAINMENT; DESIGN; FLUID MECHANICS; HYDROGEN; MODIFICATIONS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; OUTAGES; POWER REACTORS; REACTOR ACCIDENTS; STEAM; TANKS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS; VENTILATION; VENTS; WATER","In order to analyze the hydrogen distribution during a hypothetical station blackout accident in the Korean next-generation Advanced Power Reactor 1400 (APR1400) containment, the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code GASFLOW was used. The source of the hydrogen and steam for the GASFLOW analysis was obtained from a MAAP calculation. The discharged water, steam, and hydrogen from the pressurizer are released into the water of the in-containment refueling water storage tank (IRWST). Most of the discharged steam is condensed in the IRWST water because of its subcooling, and dry hydrogen is released into the free volume of the IRWST; finally, it goes out to the annular compartment above the IRWST through the vent holes. From the GASFLOW analysis, it was found that the gas mixture in the IRWST becomes quickly nonflammable by oxygen starvation but the hydrogen is accumulated in the annular compartment because of the narrow ventilation gap between the operating deck and containment wall when the igniters installed in the IRWST are not operated. When the igniters installed in the APR1400 were turned on, a short period of burning occurred in the IRWST, and then the flame was extinguished by the oxygen starvation in the IRWST. The unburned hydrogen was released into the annular compartment and went up to the dome because no igniters are installed around the annular compartment in the base design of the APR1400. From this result, it could be concluded that the control of the hydrogen concentration is difficult for the base design. In this study design modifications are proposed and evaluated with GASFLOW in view of the hydrogen mitigation strategy.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 263-282","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1042013529","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840272","","Nuclear Technology","3","150"

These meters can decrease the thermal performance of nuclear power plants because the feedwater flow rate can be overmeasured due to their fouling phenomena that make corrosion products caused by long-term operation accumulate in the feedwater flow meters. Therefore, in this paper, a software sensor using a fuzzy inference system is developed in order to increase the thermal efficiency by accurately estimating online the feedwater flow rate. The fuzzy inference system to be used for black-box modeling of the feedwater system is equipped with an automatic design algorithm that automates the selection of the input signals to the fuzzy inference system and its fuzzy rule generation including parameter optimization. The proposed algorithm was verified by using the numerical simulation data of the MARS code for Kori Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 and also the real plant data of Yonggwang Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3. In the simulations using numerical simulation data and real plant data, the relative 2{sigma} errors and the relative maximum error are small enough. The proposed method can be applied successfully to validate and monitor the existing feedwater flow meters.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 293-302","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1044013531","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840274","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840274","","Nuclear Technology","3","150"

In the developed model, the temperature and enthalpy are defined at the boundary of a calculation cell, and the exact solutions for the temperature distribution in a calculation cell are utilized. This feature of the developed model frees calculation from the undesirable effects of numerical diffusion, and only a small number of nodes are required. Also, the developed model removes the ambiguity from the parameter values at the inlet and exit of a calculation.The BoSupSG-SS computer code was developed by using the analysis model, and it performed well with only three calculation nodes to analyze a superheated SG. The developed model can be effectively used for the cases where a fast one-dimensional calculation is required such as an SG or system design analysis.","","","","","","United States","2005-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 315-324","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1046013533","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840276","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840276","","Nuclear Technology","3","150"

In order to remove the spent MTR-HEU fuel of the core and store it safely a program was established at the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares y Energias Alternativas (INEA). This program included training, acquisition of hardware and software, design and construction of a decay pool, transfer of the spent HEU fuel elements into the decay pool and his final transport to Savannah River in United States. In this paper are presented data of activities calculated for each relevant radionuclide present in spent MTR-HEU fuel elements of the IAN-R1 Research Reactor and the total activity. The total activity calculated takes in consideration contributions of fission, activation and actinides products. The data obtained were the base for shielding calculations for the decay pool concerning the storage of spent MTR-HEU fuel elements and the respective dosimetric evaluations in the transferring operations of fuel elements into the decay pool.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 769; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on nuclear data for science and technology, Santa Fe, NM (United States), 26 Sep - 1 Oct 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1945277; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1450-1453","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06A4790034955","10.1063/1.1945277","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20722455","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20722455","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","769"

The theory/experiment comparison shows that for the abundances the JENDL3.3 presents the best performance while for the decay constants the revised version of ENDF/B-VI.8 shows the best agreement. As a by-product and a consistency check, the {beta}eff parameter was obtained without the need of the Diven factor and the power normalization and it is in excellent agreement with independent measurements. Also, the {beta}eff result is independent on the nuclear data library used in the fitting procedure.

A new recipe has been evolved for generating high-temperature ACE files for use with the MCNP code. Under this scheme the low-temperature ACE file is first converted to an ENDF formatted file using the ACELST code and then Doppler broadened, essentially limited to the data in the resolved resonance region, to any desired higher temperature using SIGMA1. The SIGACE code then generates a high-temperature ACE file for use with the MCNP code. A thinning routine has also been introduced in the SIGACE code for reducing the size of the ACE files. The SIGACE code and the recipe for generating ACE files at higher temperatures has been applied to the SEFOR fast reactor benchmark problem (sodium-cooled fast reactor benchmark described in ENDF-202/BNL-19302, 1974 document). The calculated Doppler coefficient is in good agreement with the experimental value. A similar calculation using ACE files generated directly with the NJOY system also agrees with our SIGACE computed results. The SIGACE code and the recipe is further applied to study the numerical benchmark configuration of selected idealized PWR pin cell configurations with five different fuel enrichments as reported by Mosteller and Eisenhart. The SIGACE code that has been tested with several FENDL/MC files will be available, free of cost, upon request, from the Nuclear Data Section of the IAEA.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 769; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on nuclear data for science and technology, Santa Fe, NM (United States), 26 Sep - 1 Oct 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1945056; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 499-502","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US06A4941035106","10.1063/1.1945056","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20722606","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20722606","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","769"

"Within-Pin Reaction Rate Distributions: CASMO-4 and HELIOS Compared Against Tomographic Measurements at the PROTEUS Reactor","Fauchere, C Pralong; Murphy, M; Jatuff, F; Chawla, R","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BURNUP; BWR TYPE REACTORS; COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY; DISTRIBUTION; FISSION; FUEL ASSEMBLIES; GAMMA RADIATION; IRRADIATION; PHOTON EMISSION; PROTEUS REACTOR; REACTION KINETICS; SELF-ABSORPTION; URANIUM 238; URANIUM DIOXIDE; VALIDATION; ZERO POWER REACTORS","In the framework of the LWR-PROTEUS project - an extended validation program for advanced light water reactor core analysis tools conducted at the Paul Scherrer Institute - the radial, internal variations of the total fission rate (F{sub tot}) and the capture rate in {sup 238}U (C{sub 8}) have been calculated for zero-burnup pins of a Westinghouse SVEA-96+ boiling water reactor fuel assembly using two codes, namely, CASMO-4 and HELIOS. While F{sub tot} distributions predicted by CASMO-4 and HELIOS are in good agreement, C{sub 8} distributions show significant inconsistencies (20 to 30%). The calculations are compared with experimental results obtained using single photon emission computerized tomography for several SVEA-96+ pins irradiated in the zero-power reactor PROTEUS. The comparisons confirm the predicted shape of the F{sub tot} distributions within UO{sub 2} pins and clearly indicate that HELIOS within-pin predictions for C{sub 8} are more reliable than CASMO-4 results. This is important for the derivation of gamma-ray self-absorption corrections when pin-integrated reaction rates are to be determined using the gamma-scanning technique. Thus, the use of CASMO-4-type within-pin distributions would lead to 3 to 4% discrepancies in the absolute, self-absorption-corrected pin-integrated values deduced for C{sub 8} and hence for C{sub 8}/F{sub tot}. For relative C{sub 8} distributions, the discrepancy would be much smaller, namely, up to {approx}1% if pins containing a burnable absorber are involved.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 27-36","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0404109924","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808432","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","150"
"Development and Implementation of a Newton-BICGSTAB Iterative Solver in the FORMOSA-B BWR Core Simulator Code","Kastanya, Doddy Yozef Febrian; Turinsky, Paul J","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; FUEL MANAGEMENT; NEUTRON DIFFUSION EQUATION; NEWTON METHOD; OPTIMIZATION; REACTOR CORES; SIMULATORS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS; TWO-PHASE FLOW","A Newton-Krylov iterative solver has been developed to reduce the CPU execution time of boiling water reactor (BWR) core simulators implemented in the core simulator part of the Fuel Optimization for Reloads Multiple Objectives by Simulated Annealing for BWR (FORMOSA-B) code, which is an in-core fuel management optimization code for BWRs. This new solver utilizes Newton's method to explicitly treat strong nonlinearities in the problem, replacing the traditionally used nested iterative approach. Newton's method provides the solver with a higher-than-linear convergence rate, assuming that good initial estimates of the unknowns are provided. Within each Newton iteration, an appropriately preconditioned Krylov solver is utilized for solving the linearized system of equations. Taking advantage of the higher convergence rate provided by Newton's method and utilizing an efficient preconditioned Krylov solver, we have developed a Newton-Krylov solver to evaluate the three-dimensional, two-group neutron diffusion equations coupled with a two-phase flow model within a BWR core simulator. Numerical tests on the new solver have shown that speedups ranging from 1.6 to 2.1, with reference to the traditional approach of employing nested iterations to treat the nonlinear feedbacks, can be achieved. However, if a preconditioned Krylov solver is employed to complete the inner iterations of the traditional approach, negligible CPU time differences are noted between the Newton-Krylov and traditional (Krylov) approaches.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 56-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0406109926","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808434","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808434","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","150"

"Analysis of Fluid Flow and Solute Transport in a Fracture Intersecting a Canister with Variable Aperture Fractures and Arbitrary Intersection Angles","Longcheng, Liu; Neretnieks, Ivars","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; APERTURES; CONTAINERS; DEPOSITION; DISTRIBUTION; FLOW RATE; FLUID FLOW; FRACTURES; MASS TRANSFER; SIMULATION; SOLUTES; SPENT FUELS; WATER","A multitude of simulations have been made for different types of rough-walled fractures, by using FEMLAB[reg], to evaluate the mass transfer to and from water flowing through a fracture with spatially variable apertures and with an arbitrary angle of intersection to a canister that contains spent nuclear fuel. This paper presents and discusses only the results obtained for the Gaussian fractures.The simulations suggest that the intersection angle has only a minor influence on both the volumetric and the equivalent flow rates. The standard deviation of the distribution of the volumetric flow rates of the many realizations increases with increasing roughness and spatial correlation length of the aperture field, and so does that of the equivalent flow rates. The mean of the distribution of the volumetric flow rates is determined, however, solely by the hydraulic aperture, while that of the equivalent flow rates is determined by the mechanical aperture. Based upon the analytical solutions for the parallel plate model, it has been found that the distributions of both the volumetric and the equivalent flow rates are close to the Normal. Thus, two simple expressions can be devised to quantify the stochastic properties of fluid flow and solute transport through spatially variable fractures without making detailed calculations in every fracture intersecting a deposition hole or a tunnel.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 132-144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1032013519","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840262","","Nuclear Technology","2","150"
"Comparison of Severe Accident Results Among SCDAP/RELAP5, MAAP, and MELCOR Codes","Wang, T -C; Wang, S -J; Teng, J -T","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; ALTERNATING CURRENT; CONTAINERS; COOLANTS; ECCS; FEEDWATER; LOSS OF COOLANT; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; OUTAGES; RUPTURES; STEAM GENERATORS; TURBINES; VALVES","This paper demonstrates a large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) sequence of the Kuosheng nuclear power plant (NPP) and station blackout sequence of the Maanshan NPP with the SCDAP/RELAP5 (SR5), Modular Accident Analysis Program (MAAP), and MELCOR codes. The large-break sequence initiated with double-ended rupture of a recirculation loop. The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) closed, the feedwater pump tripped, the reactor scrammed, and the assumed high-pressure and low-pressure spray systems of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) were not functional. Therefore, all coolant systems to quench the core were lost. MAAP predicts a longer vessel failure time, and MELCOR predicts a shorter vessel failure time for the large-break LOCA sequence. The station blackout sequence initiated with a loss of all alternating-current (ac) power. The MSIVs closed, the feedwater pump tripped, and the reactor scrammed. The motor-driven auxiliary feedwater system and the high-pressure and low-pressure injection systems of the ECCS were lost because of the loss of all ac power. It was also assumed that the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump was not functional. Therefore, the coolant system to quench the core was also lost. MAAP predicts a longer time of steam generator dryout, time interval between top of active fuel and bottom of active fuel, and vessel failure time than those of the SR5 and MELCOR predictions for the station blackout sequence. The three codes give similar results for important phenomena during the accidents, including SG dryout, core uncovery, cladding oxidation, cladding failure, molten pool formulation, debris relocation to the lower plenum, and vessel head failure. This paper successfully demonstrates the large-break LOCA sequence of the Kuosheng NPP and the station blackout sequence of the Maanshan NPP.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 145-152","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1033013520","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840263","","Nuclear Technology","2","150"
"Pyroprocessing of Light Water Reactor Spent Fuels Based on an Electrochemical Reduction Technology","Ohta, Hirokazu; Inoue, Tadashi; Sakamura, Yoshiharu; Kinoshita, Kensuke","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BURNUP; DECONTAMINATION; ELECTROREFINING; FBR TYPE REACTORS; FISSION PRODUCTS; MATERIAL BALANCE; PLUTONIUM; RARE EARTHS; REDUCTION; SPENT FUELS; URANIUM; URANIUM DIOXIDE; WATER COOLED REACTORS; WATER MODERATED REACTORS","A concept of pyroprocessing light water reactor (LWR) spent fuels based on an electrochemical reduction technology is proposed, and the material balance of the processing of mixed oxide (MOX) or high-burnup uranium oxide (UO{sub 2}) spent fuel is evaluated. Furthermore, a burnup analysis for metal fuel fast breeder reactors (FBRs) is conducted on low-decontamination materials recovered by pyroprocessing. In the case of processing MOX spent fuel (40 GWd/t), UO{sub 2} is separately collected for {approx}60 wt% of the spent fuel in advance of the electrochemical reduction step, and the product recovered through the rare earth (RE) removal step, which has the composition uranium:plutonium:minor actinides:fission products (FPs) = 76.4:18.4:1.7:3.5, can be applied as an ingredient of FBR metal fuel without a further decontamination process. On the other hand, the electroreduced alloy of high-burnup UO{sub 2} spent fuel (48 GWd/t) requires further decontamination of residual FPs by an additional process such as electrorefining even if RE FPs are removed from the alloy because the recovered plutonium (Pu) is accompanied by almost the same amount of FPs in addition to RE. However, the amount of treated materials in the electrorefining step is reduced to {approx}10 wt% of the total spent fuel owing to the prior UO{sub 2} recovery step. These results reveal that the application of electrochemical reduction technology to LWR spent oxide fuel is a promising concept for providing FBR metal fuel by a rationalized process.","","","","","","United States","2005-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 153-161","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1034013521","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840264","","Nuclear Technology","2","150"

For passive dosimetry applications, the use of activation foils addresses the neutron environment while the use of low neutron response CaF{sub 2}:Mn thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) addresses the gamma environment. While radiation-hardened diamond photoconducting detectors (PCD) have been developed that provide a very precise fast response (picosecond) dosimeter and can provide a time-dependent profile for the radiation environment, the mixed field response of the PCD is still uncertain and this interferes with the calibration of the PCD response. In order to address the research reactor experimenter's need for a dosimeter that reports silicon dose and dose rate at a test location during a pulsed reactor operation, a silicon calorimeter has been developed. This dosimeter can be used by itself to provide a dose in rad(Si) up to a point in a reactor pulsed operation, or, in conjunction with the diamond PCD, to provide a dose rate. This paper reports on the development, testing, and validation of this silicon calorimeter for applications in water-moderated research reactors.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in ASTM International.","","Medium: X; Size: 7 p.","","SAND2005-2839J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US1001265","","","2010-03-08T00:00:00Z","971822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/971822","","Proposed for publication in ASTM International.","",""

The purpose of constructing JOYO was to obtain technical information about liquid-metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBRs) through experience with their design, construction, and operation and to use the reactor as a fast neutron irradiation facility for the development of fuels, materials, and other components required for the LMFBR program. Through design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance experience, JOYO has contributed much to the LMFBR development program. In addition to providing operating experience, many kinds of irradiation tests have been conducted for the development of fuels and materials under the conditions of higher fast neutron flux and temperature than those in light water reactors. JOYO has been operated successfully for a quarter-century without any serious problem, and this operation demonstrated the safety and reliability of the sodium-cooled fast reactor.The reactor has just been upgraded to the MK-III core to increase irradiation capability for playing a greater role in providing an irradiation field as a fast reactor.

This new objective required an extension of the planned reactor lifetime. A major renovation program was carried out in the plant from 1994 to 2003, involving safety upgrading, component inspections and repairs, and the 10-yr statutory maintenance. The main work consisted of the addition of a backup control rod to the reactor; improvement of earthquake protection by reinforcement of buildings and components and replacement of the emergency water cooling circuit; improvement of protection against sodium fire by partitioning the secondary sodium circuit in the steam generator building, reinforcement of steam generator casing, and installation of an antiwhip system on the high-pressure steam pipes; replacement of hot parts of the 321 stainless steel secondary loops and steam generator modules, affected by delayed reheat cracking; special inspections of the reactor internal structures to demonstrate their good condition.

As a result, the neutron flux density of the core was increased, and the reactor thermal power was increased to 140 MW(thermal) from the originally designed 100 MW(thermal). To accommodate the increased thermal power, the flow rates of sodium coolant in the primary and secondary systems were increased by 20 and 10%, respectively. Also, all intermediate heat exchangers and dump heat exchangers were replaced with new ones. The replacement of these large sodium components was carried out over an [approximately]1-yr period with both fuel and molten sodium still in the reactor vessel (RV).Major challenges in the replacement were the control of impurity ingress to existing systems and protection from radiation exposure in the high-dose-rate regions inside the containment vessel. During the replacement, the seal bag method, impurity concentration monitoring of cover gas, and low-pressure control of cover gas were applied to prevent damage to existing components and systems, such as the RV, fuel subassemblies, sodium piping, and tanks. The measures taken to reduce the radiation exposure were a lowering of the surrounding dose rate through the use of temporary shielding, shortening of the operation time near the high-dose-rate area by first doing thorough training, and the employment of protection equipment to avoid contamination. The replacement of components was completed without major trouble, and methods applied for the replacement proved to be effective in the operation and maintenance of sodium-cooled reactors.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 56-66","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1026013513","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840256","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840256","","Nuclear Technology","1","150"

The notion of in-service monitoring ranges from the continuous monitoring of the reactor in operation to the thorough in-service reactor inspection during programmed shutdowns. However, the highly specific environment found in French liquid metal fast reactor plants - Phenix and Superphenix - makes monitoring and inspection complicated because of the use of a sodium coolant that is hot, opaque, and difficult to drain.The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, in collaboration with its traditional French partners, Electricite de France utilities and FRAMATOME/Novatome Engineering, decided to conduct a 6-yr research and development program (1994-2000) to explore this problem vis-a-vis Superphenix, as well as the possibilities of intervening within the reactor block or on components in a sodium environment. Furthermore, the safety reevaluation of Phenix, conducted between 1994 and 2003, represented an excellent 'test bench' during which the limits of inspection processes - applied to an integrated reactor concept - were surpassed using techniques such as fuel subassembly head scanning, ultrasonic examination of the core support, and visual inspection of the cover-gas plenum following a partial sodium draining. Repair techniques were investigated for cleaning of sodium wet structure surfaces, cutting of damaged parts, and welding in sodium aerosol atmosphere. Both conventional and laser processes were tested.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-78","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1027013514","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840257","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840257","","Nuclear Technology","1","150"

As an international effort between the United States and the Republic of Kazakhstan, a cesium-trapping system was jointly designed, fabricated, installed, and successfully operated. The results are significant for a number of reasons, including (a) a significant reduction of radioactivity levels of the BN-350 coolant and reactor surfaces, thereby reducing exposure to workers during shutdown operations; (b) demonstration of scientific ideas; and (c) the engineering application of effective cesium trap deployment for commercial-sized liquid-metal reactors. About 255 300 GBq (6900 Ci) of cesium was trapped, and the {sup 137}Cs specific activity in BN-350 primary sodium was decreased from 296 MBq/kg (8000 {mu}Ci/kg) to 0.37 MBq/kg (10 {mu}Ci/kg) by using seven cesium traps containing reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) as the cesium adsorbent. Cesium trapping was accomplished by pumping sodium from the primary circuit, passing it through a block of RVC within each trap, and returning the cleaned sodium to the primary circuit. Both to predict and to analyze the behavior of the cesium traps in the BN-350 reactor primary circuit, a model was developed that satisfactorily describes the observed results of the cesium trapping. By using this model, thermodynamic parameters, such as the heat of adsorption of cesium atoms on RVC and on internal piping surfaces of the BN-350 reactor primary circuit, -22.7 and -5.0 kJ/mole, respectively, were extracted from the experimental data.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 79-99","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1028013515","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840258","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840258","","Nuclear Technology","1","150"

CEA has demonstrated that it is possible to define appropriate and efficient processes to meet the different situations encountered in decommissioning LMFRs. Mechanical techniques derived from standard technologies have been successfully applied to fast reactor decommissioning to complete primary vessel draining from sodium. In addition, specific chemical processes have been developed to deal safely with metallic sodium reactivity. Sodium-contaminated equipment has been successfully cleaned by reacting sodium with water mist in an atmosphere with carbon dioxide to form inert sodium carbonate. Bulk sodium has been successfully converted into aqueous caustic soda by injection of liquid-metallic sodium into sodium hydroxide solution. Several processes were also defined to deal with specific sodium wastes. In all cases the principle is based on a sodium/water chemical reaction where the released hydrogen and heat are controlled. With the development of a wide variety of processes, all steps in the decommissioning of LMFRs are assumed to be now properly mastered.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 100-110","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1029013516","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840259","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840259","","Nuclear Technology","1","150"

Any small leak in the SG allows the hot sodium (Na) to come into contact with the water/steam, and this results in a violent reaction and SG damage. A secondary circuit is normally used to prevent such reactions causing damage to the reactor core and primary vessel.NNC Ltd. has developed a copper (Cu)-bonded SG system, the objective of which is to provide three separate solid boundaries (two steel and one Cu) between the primary sodium coolant and the water/steam and hence eliminate the possibility of contact between Na and water/steam. The design uses a hot isostatic pressure method of construction to bond all three barriers to aid heat transfer. This highly reliable system allows the elimination of the secondary circuit, greatly reducing the cost of the reactor system and increasing availability.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 111-119","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1030013517","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840260","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840260","","Nuclear Technology","1","150"

The Liquid injection nozzle (LIN) is cross aligned with the fuel channel to control the reactor by injecting poison. For a safe operation, the gap between the LIN and CT should be maintained in order to prevent a contact of the neighboring tubes. The remote field eddy current (RFEC) method was applied to measure the gap between a nonmagnetic Zircaloy-2 liquid injection nozzle (LIN) and a Zircaloy-2 calandria tube. Under the condition of inserting the RFEC probe into the coaxial tubes and of crossing a LIN above or under the CT, the modeling of a LIN signal is needed to check the possibility of a gap measurement. The Volume Integral Code S/W which covers the axi-symmetric 3D configuration has been very rarely applied to obtain a LIN signal. This problem was solved by assuming a LIN as a flaw which can be described as a complete 3D object. This simulated LIN signal was verified by performing the laboratory experiment. The gap between the LIN and CT can be correlated with the amplitude of the LIN signals in the voltage plane. Typical noises in the fuel channel were the relative constriction, the change in the pressure tube diameter (fill-factor), thickness variation, and so on. These noise signals were simulated by using the modeling and were analyzed by considering their dependency on the phase angle and amplitude of the voltage plane in order to separate the gap signal from them. It could be concluded that the voltage plane analysis of the simulated RFEC signals were effective for obtaining the gap measurement of the neighboring tube.","","","","","","United States","2005-04-09T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 760; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Conference on review of progress in quantitative nondestructive evaluation, Golden, CO (United States), 25-30 Jul 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1916709; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 440-446","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A8474094986","10.1063/1.1916709","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20655375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20655375","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","760"
"Strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime : focus on the civilian nuclear fuel cycle.","Saltiel, David H; Pregenzer, Arian Leigh","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 11 NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE AND FUEL MATERIALS; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; 45 MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONRY, AND NATIONAL DEFENSE; COMMUNITIES; ENERGY DEMAND; EXPORTS; FUEL CYCLE; FUEL SUPPLIES; GLOBALIZATION; GREENHOUSE EFFECT; INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION; MANAGEMENT; MONITORING; NUCLEAR ENERGY; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR POWER; NUCLEAR WEAPONS; PROLIFERATION; REPROCESSING; SECURITY; VULNERABILITY; WEAPONS","Leaders around the world and across the ideological spectrum agree that the global nonproliferation regime is facing a serious test. The emergence of sophisticated terrorist networks, black markets in nuclear technology, and technological leaps associated with globalization have conspired to threaten one of the most successful examples of international cooperation in history. The rampant proliferation of nuclear weapons that was predicted at the start of the nuclear age has been largely held in check and the use of those weapons avoided. Nonetheless, with the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the threat of nuclear proliferation seems more serious than ever. Although experts readily concede that there exist many pathways to proliferation, the threat posed by the misuse of the civilian nuclear fuel cycle has received considerable recent attention. While the connection between nuclear energy and nonproliferation has been a topic of discussion since the dawn of the nuclear age, world events have brought the issue to the forefront once again. United States President George W. Bush and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohammad ElBaradei are among those who have highlighted proliferation risks associated with civilian nuclear power programs and called for revitalizing the nuclear nonproliferation regime to address new threats. From the possibility of diversion or theft of nuclear material or technology, to the use of national civilian programs as a cover for weapons programs - what some have called latent proliferation - the fuel cycle appears to many to represent a glaring proliferation vulnerability. Just as recognition of these risks is not new, neither is recognition of the many positive benefits of nuclear energy. In fact, a renewed interest in exploiting these benefits has increased the urgency of addressing the risks. Global energy demand is expected to at least double by the middle of the century and could increase even more quickly. Much of the new demand will come from the rapidly expanding economies in China and India, but much of the developing world stands poised to follow the same path. This growth in demand is paralleled by concerns about global warming and the long-term reliability of carbon-based fuel supplies, concerns which expanded use of nuclear power can help to address. For these reasons and others, many countries in Asia have already clearly signaled that nuclear energy will play a key role for years to come. Numerous proposals have been made in the last two years for reducing the proliferation risk of the civilian nuclear fuel cycle. These range from a ban on export of enrichment and reprocessing technology to countries not already possessing operational capabilities to multinational management of the nuclear fuel cycle and strengthening existing monitoring and security mechanisms. The need for international willingness to enforce nonproliferation commitments and norms has also been emphasized. Some of these proposals could significantly impact the production of nuclear energy. Because the successful strengthening of the nonproliferation regime and the expansion of nuclear energy are so closely related, any successful approach to resolving these issues will require the creative input of experts from both the nuclear energy and nonproliferation communities. Against this backdrop, Sandia National Laboratories organized its 14th International Security Conference (ISC) around the theme: Strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime: Focus on the Civilian Nuclear Fuel Cycle. The goal of the conference was to begin a constructive dialogue between the nuclear energy and nuclear nonproliferation communities. The conference was held in Chantilly, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. on April 4-6, 2005, and was attended by approximately 125 participants from fifteen countries. The ISC agenda was structured to produce a systematic review of the connection between civilian nuclear energy programs and the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to identify constructive approaches to strengthen the nonproliferation regime. The conference began by reviewing the energy and security context that has, once again, raised the profile of this issue. A discussion of the risks associated with the civilian nuclear fuel cycle was then used to inform the analysis of several potential risk-management tools. The conference concluded by looking for lessons from the past as well as looking forward to future opportunities, with a particular focus on East Asia. In this paper we summarize the debates and ideas that emerged during the conference. Although we have drawn on material presented by speakers and comments made by participants, we do not quote or cite the specific contributions of individuals.","","","Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Albuquerque, NM, and Livermore, CA (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2005-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proposed for publication in the INMM Journal.","","Medium: X; Size: 15 p.","","SAND2005-2577J","AC04-94AL85000","TRN: US1001264","","","2010-03-08T00:00:00Z","971818","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/971818","","Proposed for publication in the INMM Journal.","",""

However, it can be applied only during normal plant operation since hydrogen is usually injected into the feedwater and this system is in standby mode during start-up operations. It is estimated that the core internals are subjected to the strain rate that may cause susceptibility to SCC initiation during start-up. Therefore, it is beneficial to perform hydrogen injection during start-up as well in order to suppress SCC initiation.For this purpose, we installed an additional hydrogen injection system to be used during plant start-up at the Tokai-2 power station. This trial Hydrogen water chemistry During Start-up (HDS) system was applied following the 19th refueling and maintenance outage in December 2002. By comparing results obtained during this start-up with HDS to previous start-up data using normal water chemistry, we made the following observations. First, as the reactor water temperature increased from initial conditions up to 180 deg. C via nuclear heating, dissolved oxygen and hydrogen peroxide concentrations decreased to levels lower than previously observed. Second, during subsequent nuclear heating, up to 250 deg. C, the dissolved oxygen concentration did not exceed 1 ppb, and the electrochemical corrosion potential was maintained in a low range near -400 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 312-324","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0402109922","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808430","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808430","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","149"

The 200-MW HTR-module was designed by Siemens under the criteria that no active safety protection systems were necessary because of its inherent safe nature. For simulating the behavior of the HTR-module during severe water ingress accidents, a water, steam, and helium multiphase cavity model was developed and implemented in the dynamic simulator for nuclear power plants (DSNP) simulation system. Comparisons of the DSNP simulations incorporating these models with experiments and with calculations using the time-dependent neutronics and temperature dynamics code were made to validate the simulation. The analysis of the primary circuit showed that the maximum water concentration increase in the reactor core was &lt;0.3 kg/(m{sup 3}s). The water vaporization in the steam generator and characteristics of water transport from the steam generator to the reactor core would reduce the rate of water ingress into the reactor core. The analysis of a full cavitation of the feedwater pump showed that if the secondary circuit could be depressurized, the feedwater pump would be stopped by the full cavitation. This limits the water transported from the deaerator to the steam generator. A comprehensive simulation of the HTR-module power plant showed that the water inventory in the primary circuit was limited to {approx}3000 kg. The nuclear reactivity increase caused by the water ingress would lead to a fast power excursion, which would be inherently counterbalanced by negative feedback effects. The integrity of the fuel elements, because the safety-relevant temperature limit of 1600 deg. C is not reached in any case, is not challenged.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 253-264","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1015013502","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840245","","Nuclear Technology","3","149"

It is part of an overall effort in providing qualification basis for the INER/TPC BWR transient analysis method developed for the Kuosheng and Chinshan plants. The method primarily utilizes an advanced system thermal hydraulics code, RETRAN02/MOD5, for transient safety analyses. Since pressurization transients would result in a strong coupling effect between core neutronic and system thermal hydraulics responses, the INER/TPC method employs the one-dimensional kinetic model in RETRAN with a cross-section data library generated by the Studsvik-CMS code package for the transient calculations. The Peach Bottom Turbine Trip (PBTT) tests, including TT1, TT2, and TT3, have been successfully performed in the plant and assigned as standards commonly for licensing method qualifications for years. It is an essential requirement for licensing purposes to verify integral capabilities and accuracies of the codes and models of the INER/TPC method in simulating such pressurization transients. Specific Peach Bottom plant models, including both neutronics and thermal hydraulics, are developed using modeling approaches and experiences generally adopted in the INER/TPC method. Important model assumptions in RETRAN for the PBTT test simulations are described in this paper. Simulation calculations are performed with best-estimated initial and boundary conditions obtained from plant test measurements. The calculation results presented in this paper demonstrate that the INER/TPC method is capable of calculating accurately the core and system transient behaviors of the tests. Excellent agreement, both in trends and magnitudes between the RETRAN calculation results and the PBTT measurements, shows reliable qualifications of the codes/users/models involved in the method. The RETRAN calculated peak neutron fluxes of the PBTT tests are higher than the measurements, which ensures the conservatism of using the INER/TPC method for Kuosheng and Chinshan licensing safety analyses.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 265-280","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1016013503","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840246","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840246","","Nuclear Technology","3","149"

In the CONFU assembly concept, {approx}20% of the UO{sub 2} fuel pins are replaced with fertile free fuel hosting the transuranic elements (TRUs) generated in the previous cycle. This leads to a fuel cycle sustainable with respect to net TRU generation, and the amount and radiotoxicity of the nuclear waste can be significantly reduced in comparison with the conventional once-through UO{sub 2} fuel cycle. It is shown that under the constraints of acceptable power peaking limits, the CONFU assembly exhibits negative reactivity feedback coefficients comparable in values to those of the reference UO{sub 2} fuel. Feasibility of the PWR core operation and control with complete TRU recycle has been shown based on full-core three-dimensional neutronic simulation. However, gradual buildup of small amounts of Cm and Cf challenges fuel reprocessing and fabrication due to the high spontaneous fission rates of these nuclides and heat generation by some Pu, Am, and Cm isotopes. Feasibility of the processing steps becomes more attainable if the time between discharge and reprocessing is 20 yr or longer.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 281-303","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1017013504","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840247","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840247","","Nuclear Technology","3","149"

The experiment has distinguishable 3-D hydraulics effects that allow for code model verification and reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained.The transient investigated was conducted at 29% reactor power, and it was initiated from a steady state where three out of four reactor coolant pumps were operating. The transient consisted of the start-up of the nonoperating pump. Simulation results were compared to both temperature and pump data from the experiment. Temperature predictions compared reasonably well to the experimental data; however, discrepancies existed between predicted and experimental pump head values.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 304-308","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1018013505","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840248","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840248","","Nuclear Technology","3","149"

The responses of the system including the temperature of the pool of water in the test vessel, pressure and temperature of the containment vessel, and dynamic pressures and force were measured. In addition, high-speed movies were taken through the windows. The tests using corium with a 70:30 composition and pure zirconia resulted in a spontaneous energetic steam explosion, while the tests with other compositions did not lead to an energetic FCI. The debris size distribution and pressure and temperature responses clearly indicated the cases with an energetic explosion and the cases without an explosion. The high-speed movie taken during the FCI through the visible window clearly disclosed the outstanding phases of the FCI, which were the melt entry phase, the triggering phase, and the continued melt jet and expansion of the mixing zone phase.","","","","","","United States","2005-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 309-323","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1019013506","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840249","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840249","","Nuclear Technology","3","149"

The reactor was operated in conjunction with a hybrid catalyst system consisting of methanol synthesis and dehydration catalysts, and the influence of reaction parameters on syngas conversion was investigated. The activities of different dehydration catalysts were compared under DME synthesis conditions. Reaction temperature and pressure exhibited similar positive effects on DME formation. A catalytic stability test of the hybrid catalyst system was performed for 880 hours, during which CO conversion only decreased from 88% to 81%. In the microchannel reactor, the catalyst deactivation rate appeared to be much slower than in a tubular fixed-bed reactor tested for comparison. Test results also indicated that the dehydration reaction rate and the water depletion rate via a water-gas-shift reaction should be compatible in order to achieve high selectivity to DME. Using the microchannel reactor, it was possible to achieve a space time yield almost three times higher than commercially demonstrated performance results. A side-by-side comparison indicated that the heat removal capability of the microchannel reactor was at least six times greater than that of a commercial slurry reactor under similar reaction conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US), Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 44; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: 1 Mar 2005","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1722-1727","","PNNL-SA-42358","AC05-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0888-5885; IECRED; 1573; BM0101010; TRN: US0502194","10.1021/ie0492707","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15016310","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15016310","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","6","44"

The MCNP4B code package is utilized in the analysis with ENDF/B-VI continuous energy cross sections. The full core with the initial loading case is considered in simulations. The variation of the effective multiplication factor as a function of core loading height is also analyzed. Three different geometrical models are employed to see the effect of geometrical detail on the criticality calculations. Results are compared with diffusion calculations as well as the experimental data. Results show that the use of the homogenized fuel zone model does not yield acceptable results and underestimates the core criticality. However, the results obtained by using models with uniform and randomly distributed coated fuel particles in the fuel zone are in quite good agreement and there is not any systematic difference. Furthermore, criticality values do not change significantly with different random arrangements of coated fuel particles in fuel spheres. However, the random and irregular arrangements of pebbles may result in statistically different criticality values at least due to varying streaming effect.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 131-137","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0389109909","10.13182/NSE04-17","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","20808417","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808417","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","149"

The lack of mechanical moving parts or other active components drastically reduces the probabilities of hardware failure. For passive systems, it is necessary to introduce the concept of functional failure, i.e., the possibility that the loads will exceed the capacity in a reliability physics framework. In this paper we analyze the passive cooling of a gas-cooled fast reactor, and we use an importance-sampling Monte Carlo technique to propagate the epistemic uncertainties and to calculate the probabilities of functional failures. The results show that functional failures are an important contributor to the overall failure probability of the system and, therefore, should be included in probabilistic risk assessments. A comparison with an alternative active design is considered also. The results show that the active system can have, for this particular application, better reliability than the passive one.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 129-140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1006013493","10.13182/NT149-129","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20840236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840236","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

In other words, it is difficult to take into account the particle motion in the criticality evaluations. We have developed a novel criticality evaluation code to resolve this problem. The criticality evaluation code, coupling a discrete element method simulation code with a continuous-energy Monte Carlo transport code, makes it possible to study the effects of the particulate dynamics on criticality. This criticality evaluation code is applied to the mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel powder agitation process. The criticality evaluations are performed while mixing the MOX fuel powder and an additive powder in a stirred vessel to investigate the effects of the powder free surface deformation and the particulate mixture state on the effective multiplication factor. The evaluation results reveal that the effective multiplication factor decreases due to the powder boundary deformation while it increases as the mixture condition of MOX powder and Zn-St powder is close to homogeneous.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 141-149","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1007013494","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840237","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840237","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

As reactivity and kinetic coefficients are poor in such cores (low delayed neutron fraction and Doppler feedback, high coolant void coefficient), special attention has been paid to their dynamic behavior during transient conditions. A dynamics code, MAT4 DYN, has been expressly developed to study loss-of-flow, reactivity insertion, and loss-of-coolant accidents. It takes into account two fuel geometries (cylindrical and spherical) and two thermal-hydraulics models for the coolant (incompressible for liquid metals and compressible for helium).Three nitride-fuel configurations are analyzed according to their coolant: sodium and lead (both with pin fuel) and helium (with particle fuel). Dynamics calculations show that if the fuel nature is appropriately chosen, with sufficient margins during transients, then this can counterbalance the poor reactivity coefficients for liquid-metal-cooled cores, thus proving the interest of this kind of concept. On the other hand, the gas-cooled core dynamics is very badly affected by the high value of the helium void coefficient in a hard spectrum, this effect being amplified by the very low thermal inertia of the fuel particles. Hence, concepts other than a particle-bed fuel should be investigated for a helium-cooled fast-spectrum MA burner.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 150-174","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1008013495","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840238","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840238","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

Currently, advanced nodal codes treat the inside of an assembly as homogeneous, and the temperature distribution inside a node is usually ignored. Namely, the fuel temperature is estimated from the assembly average power density, and the moderator temperature is calculated from the nodewise closed-channel model. However, the validity of a flat temperature distribution inside a node has not yet been investigated, because a three-dimensional pin-by-pin whole-core calculation must be done for comparison. A three-dimensional pin-by-pin nodal-transport code for a pressurized water reactor (PWR) core analysis, SCOPE2, was used in this study since it can directly treat the pin-by-pin feedback effect. A whole-core subchannel analysis code was developed to enhance the thermal-hydraulic capability of SCOPE2. The pin-by-pin feedback models for fuel and moderator temperature were established, and their impact on the core characteristics was investigated in a 3 x 3 multiassembly and the whole PWR core geometries. The calculations showed that modeling of the pin-by-pin temperature distribution revealed a negligible effect on core reactivity and only a slight impact on the radial peaking factor. The difference in the radial peaking factor that is exposed by the pin-by-pin temperature modeling is less than 0.005 in the test calculations.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 175-188","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1009013496","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840239","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840239","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

The superheating and the latent heat of fusion of the jet are the principal factors governing this type of thermal fragmentation. On the other hand, the effect of the initial sodium temperature is regarded as negligible in the case of thermal conditions expected to result in CDAs for practical metallic fuel cores. Based on the fragmentation data for several kinds of jets (Cu, Ag, SUS, U, and U-5 wt% Zr alloy), an empirical correlation is proposed that is applicable to the calculation of a mass median diameter of fragments produced by the thermal fragmentation of the jet with a solid crust under low ambient Weber number conditions.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 189-199","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1010013497","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840240","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840240","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

The depletion rate of reactor coolant inventory was experimentally investigated after the safety injection failure during a large-break loss-of-coolant accident utilizing the Seoul National University Integral Test Facility (SNUF), which is scaled down to 1/6.4 in length and 1/178 in area from the APR1400 [Advanced Power Reactor 1400 MW(electric)]. The experimental results showed that the core coolant inventory decreased five times faster before than after the extinction of sweepout in the reactor downcomer, which is induced by the incoming steam from the intact cold legs. The sweepout occurred on top of the spillover from the downcomer region and expedited depletion of the core coolant inventory. The test result was simulated with the MAAP4 severe accident analysis code. The calculation results of the original MAAP4 deviated from the test data in terms of coolant inventory distribution in the test vessel. After the calculation algorithm of coolant level distribution was improved by including the subroutine of pseudo pressure buildup, which accounts for the differential pressure between the core and downcomer in MAAP4, the core melt progression was delayed by hundreds of seconds, and the code prediction was in reasonable agreement with the overall behavior of the SNUF experiment.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 200-216","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1011013498","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840241","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840241","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

In this work, hot tests were carried out on the main flow sheet (U and Pu recovery) using a nitric acid solution of a spent commercial boiling water reactor fuel with burnup of 55 000 MWd/t HM. First, a separation experiment was conducted using a column packed with AR-01 anion exchanger, and the separation behavior of about 20 elements was examined. Then electrolytic reduction was performed for the U(VI) eluate from the first column using a flow-type electrolysis cell. Subsequently, the reduced U solution was applied to the second AR-01 column to separate the U(IV) from contaminated fission products. Most amounts of Pu(IV)-Np(IV), were successfully separated and recovered in the first column. In the electrolysis, U(VI), Np(V,VI), and a trace amount of Pu(VI) were reduced to U(IV), Np(IV), and Pu(IV), respectively. In the second column, the U(IV) with small amounts of Np(IV) and Pu(IV) was completely separated from the fission products. These results demonstrated that the proposed U and Pu recovery process is essentially feasible, though more effective elution methods for Pd and Tc need to be investigated further.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 217-231","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1012013499","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840242","","Nuclear Technology","2","149"

DynMo is modular and could be applied to power systems with different types of reactors, energy conversion, and heat pipe radiators. This paper presents a general description of DynMo-TE for a space power system powered by a Sectored Compact Reactor (SCoRe) and that employs off-the-shelf SiGe thermoelectric converters. SCoRe is liquid metal cooled and designed for avoidance of a single point failure. The reactor core is divided into six equal sectors that are neutronically, but not thermal-hydraulically, coupled. To avoid a single point failure in the power system, each reactor sector has its own primary and secondary loops, and each loop is equipped with an electromagnetic (EM) pump. A Power Conversion assembly (PCA) and a Thermoelectric Conversion Assembly (TCA) of the primary and secondary EM pumps thermally couple each pair of a primary and a secondary loop. The secondary loop transports the heat rejected by the PCA and the pumps TCA to a rubidium heat pipes radiator panel. The primary loops transport the thermal power from the reactor sector to the PCAs for supplying a total of 145-152 kWe to the load at 441-452 VDC, depending on the selections of the primary and secondary liquid metal coolants. The primary and secondary coolant combinations investigated are lithium (Li)/Li, Li/sodium (Na), Na-Na, Li/NaK-78 and Na/NaK-78, for which the reactor exit temperature is kept below 1250 K. The results of a startup transient of the system from an initial temperature of 500 K are compared and discussed.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867225; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1005-1020","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7467073399","10.1063/1.1867225","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630568","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

Fuel bundles for terrestrial liquid metal fast breeders reactors typically use 217 - 271 pins per sub-assembly, while some SP100 designs use up to 331 pins in a central subassembly that was surrounded by partial assemblies. Because thermal creep is exponentially related to temperature, small changes in fuel pin cladding temperature can make large differences in the lifetime in a high temperature liquid metal reactor (LMR). This paper uses the COBRA-IV-I computer code to determine the temperature distribution within LMR fuel bundles. COBRA-IV-I uses the sub-channel analysis approach to determine the enthalpy (or temperature) and flow distribution in rod bundles for both steady-state and transient conditions. The COBRA code runs in only a few seconds and has been benchmarked and tested extensively over a wide range of flow conditions. In this report the flow and temperature distributions for two types of lithium cooled space reactor core designs were calculated. One design uses a very tight fuel pin packing that has a pitch to diameter ratio of 1.05 (small wire wrap with a diameter of 392 {mu}m) as proposed in SP100. The other design uses a larger pitch to diameter ratio of 1.09 with a larger more conventional sized wire wrap diameter of 1 mm. The results of the COBRA pin bundle calculations show that the larger pitch-to-diameter fuel bundle designs are more tolerant to local flow blockages, and in addition they are less sensitive to mal-flow distributions that occur near the edges of the subassembly.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867226; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1021-1032","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7468073400","10.1063/1.1867226","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630569","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630569","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

These advanced TPV modules are projected to produce &gt; 0.9 W/cm2 at an efficiency &gt; 24% while operating at a converter radiator and module temperature of 1373 K and 325 K, respectively. Radioisotope and nuclear (fission) powered space systems utilizing these advanced TPV modules have been evaluated. For a 100 We radioisotope TPV system, systems utilizing as low as 2 general purpose heat source (GPHS) units are feasible, where the specific power for the 2 and 3 GPHS unit systems operating in a 200 K environment is as large as {approx} 16 We/kg and {approx} 14 We/kg, respectively. For a 100 kWe nuclear powered (as was entertained for the thermoelectric SP-100 program) TPV system, the minimum system radiator area and mass is {approx} 640 m2 and {approx} 1150 kg, respectively, for a converter radiator, system radiator and environment temperature of 1373 K, 435 K and 200 K, respectively. Also, for a converter radiator temperature of 1373 K, the converter volume and mass remains less than 0.36 m3 and 640 kg, respectively. Thus, the minimum system radiator + converter (reactor and shield not included) specific mass is {approx} 16 kg/kWe for a converter radiator, system radiator and environment temperature of 1373 K, 425 K and 200 K, respectively. Under this operating condition, the reactor thermal rating is {approx} 1110 kWt. Due to the large radiator area, the added complexity and mission risk needs to be weighed against reducing the reactor thermal rating to determine the feasibility of using TPV for space nuclear (fission) power systems.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867275; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1441-1448","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7470073402","10.1063/1.1867275","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630571","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

In order to secure launch approval, it has to be demonstrated that these reactors will remain sufficiently subcritical when submerged in water or wet sand and subsequently flooded with water, following a launch abort accident. The resulting shift in the neutron spectrum towards thermal increases reactivity, potentially making the reactors supercritical. Incorporating 'Spectral Shift Absorbers' (or SSAs), elements such as boron, europium, gadolinium or rhenium, which have significantly higher absorption cross-sections for thermal versus fast neutrons, can offset the reactivity increase. It has always been the assumption that the worst-case submersion accident is with a fully flooded reactor; however, this work shows that, depending on the type and amount of SSA in the reactor, a submerged but unflooded reactor core could be more reactive, raising a safety concern. This condition, referred to as 'reactivity inversion', is investigated for the following SSA elements: boron, boron-10, samarium-149, europium, europium-151, gadolinium, gadolinium-155, gadolinium-157 and rhenium, by varying the ratio of SSA to fissile atoms in the reactor. The effect of placing a coating of SSA material on the outside of the reactor vessel is also investigated. Gadolinium-157 is the most effective SSA material investigated as a core additive, yielding the greatest increase in the safety worth of a submerged space reactor with a comparatively small decrease in excess reactivity. Samarium-149 yields a similar increase in safety worth, but with a much larger decrease in excess reactivity. Natural europium and gadolinium are also promising: however, the decrease in the excess reactivity is greater with europium than with gadolinium. Boron and boron-10 are not particularly attractive as core additives, but boron-10 yields the greatest benefit as a coating. Rhenium is useful only if the desired safety worth is small (&lt; $3) and at a significant mass penalty.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867145; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 285-294","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7472073404","10.1063/1.1867145","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630573","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

Such a system has the potential to be a very simple and robust space-reactor power system. Gas-cooled reactors have been built and operated in the past, but very few have been coupled directly to the turbomachinery in this fashion. In this paper we describe the option for testing such a system with a small reactor and turbomachinery at Sandia National Laboratories. Sandia currently operates the Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR) at steady-state powers up to 4 MW and has an adjacent facility with heavy shielding in which another reactor recently operated. Sandia also has a closed-Brayton-Cycle test bed with a converted commercial turbomachinery unit that is rated for up to 30 kWe of power. It is proposed to construct a small experimental gas-cooled reactor core and attach this via ducting to the CBC turbomachinery for cooling and electricity production. Calculations suggest that such a unit could produce about 20 kWe, which would be a good power level for initial surface power units on the Moon or Mars. The intent of this experiment is to demonstrate the stable start-up and operation of such a system. Of particular interest is the effect of a negative temperature power coefficient as the initially cold Brayton gas passes through the core during startup or power changes. Sandia's dynamic model for such a system would be compared with the performance data. This paper describes the neutronics, heat transfer, and cycle dynamics of this proposed system. Safety and radiation issues are presented. The views expressed in this document are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect agreement by the government.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867160; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 437-448","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7473073405","10.1063/1.1867160","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630574","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630574","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

They require no pumping, their design easily deals with freezing and thawing of the liquid metal, and they can provide substantial levels of redundancy. Nevertheless, no reactor has ever been operated and cooled with heat pipes, and the startup and other operational characteristics of these systems remain largely unknown. Signification deviations from normal reactor heat removal mechanisms exist, because the heat pipes have fundamental heat removal limits due to sonic flow issues at low temperatures. This paper proposes an early prototypic test of a Heat Pipe Reactor (using existing 20% enriched nuclear fuel pins) to determine the operational characteristics of the HPR. The proposed design is similar in design to the HOMER and SAFE-300 HPR designs (Elliot, Lipinski, and Poston, 2003; Houts, et. al, 2003). However, this reactor uses existing UZrH fuel pins that are coupled to potassium heat pipes modules. The prototype reactor would be located in the Sandia Annular Core Research Reactor Facility where the fuel pins currently reside. The proposed reactor would use the heat pipes to transport the heat from the UZrH fuel pins to a water pool above the core, and the heat transport to the water pool would be controlled by adjusting the pressure and gas type within a small annulus around each heat pipe. The reactor would operate as a self-critical assembly at power levels up to 200 kWth. Because the nuclear heated HPR test uses existing fuel and because it would be performed in an existing facility with the appropriate safety authorization basis, the test could be performed rapidly and inexpensively. This approach makes it possible to validate the operation of a HPR and also measure the feedback mechanisms for a typical HPR design. A test of this nature would be the world's first operating Heat Pipe Reactor. This reactor is therefore called 'HPR-1'.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867161; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 449-460","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7474073406","10.1063/1.1867161","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630575","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630575","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

After all excess rhenium is removed from the reactor core, gadolinium-155 or europium-151 is added to the core in the form of a 0.1 mm oxide coating on the inside of the reactor vessel and/or as a nitride additive to the UN fuel. To compensate for increased parasitic neutron absorption, the UN fuel enrichment in the SAIRS reactor is increased to from 83.5% to a maximum of 94%.

In addition to enjoying some degree of autonomy, these systems need to operate reliably through the end of the mission, which could not be realized solely through a redundancy in the reactor's coolant loop. Besides increasing the total system mass, such hardware redundancy does not eliminate a single-point failure in the reactor and subsequent loss of coolant. This paper presents three concepts of the liquid metal cooled. Sectored, Compact Reactor (SCoRe) for the avoidance of single-point failure. The SCoRe-S, ScoRe-M, and SCoRe-L concepts are for small, medium, and large reactor cores, covering a wide range of electrical power requirements, from 10's of kWe to a few MWe. As a common feature in all SCoRe concepts, the reactor core is divided into six sectors that are neutronically coupled but thermal-hydraulically decoupled. The dividers of the sectors are liquid metal heat pipes, which facilitate cooling a sector experiencing a Loss of Coolant (LOC) by passively transporting the fission power generated in it to the two adjacent sectors without losing the mission. At the same time, the fission power of the reactor is reduced to avoid overheating the fuel in the sector experiencing a LOC. The SCoRe concepts have compact, hexagonal cores surrounded by a relatively thick (10 cm minimum) BeO reflector and axial BeO reflector that is 4 cm thick.

Because very little experience exists regarding the operational behavior of these systems, Sandia National Laboratories (through its Laboratory Directed Research and Development program) is developing a closed-loop test bed that can be used to determine the operational behavior of these systems and to validate models for these systems. Sandia has contracted Barber-Nichols Corporation to design, fabricate, and assemble a Closed-loop Brayton Cycle (CBC) system. This system was developed by modifying commercially available hardware. It uses a 30 kWe Capstone C-30 gas-turbine unit (www.capstoneturbine.com) with a modified housing that permits the attachment of an electrical heater and a water cooled chiller that are connected to the turbo-machinery in a closed loop. The test-loop reuses the Capstone turbine, compressor, and alternator. The Capstone system's nominal operating point is 1150 K turbine inlet temperature at 96,000 rpm. The annular recuperator and portions of the Capstone control system (inverter) and starter system are also reused. The rotational speed of the turbo-machinery is controlled either by adjusting the alternator load by either using the electrical grid or a separate load bank. This report describes the test-loop hardware SBL-30 (Sandia Brayton Loop-30kWe). Also presented are results of early testing and modeling of the unit. The SBL-30 hardware is currently configured with a heater that is limited to 80 kWth with a maximum outlet temperature of {approx}1000 K.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867189; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 699-710","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7482073414","10.1063/1.1867189","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20630583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630583","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

The studies described in this paper were performed under one of those contracts, which was to investigate the use of a nuclear power conversion system based on the closed Brayton cycle (CBC). The conceptual design effort performed included BPCS (Brayton power conversion system) trade studies to minimize system weight and radiator area and advance the state of the art of BPCS technology. The primary requirements for studies were a power level of 100 kWe (to the PPU), a low overall power system mass (with a target of less than 3000 kg), and a lifetime of 15 years (10 years full power). For the radiation environment, the system was to operate in the generic space environment and withstand the extreme environments within the Jovian system. The studies defined a BPCS design traceable to NBP (Nuclear Electric Propulsion) requirements and suitable for future potential missions with a sound technology plan for TRL (Technical Readiness Level) advancement identified. The studies assumed a turbine inlet temperature {approx} 100C above the current the state of the art capabilities with materials issues identified and an approach for resolution developed. Analyses and evaluations of six HRS (heat rejection subsystem) concepts and PMAD (Power Management and Distribution) architecture trades will be discussed in the paper.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867192; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 727-737","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7483073415","10.1063/1.1867192","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20630584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630584","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

This proposed mission, known as Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) would use a nuclear reactor and an associated electrical generation system (Reactor Power Plant - RPP) to provide power to the spacecraft. The JIMO spacecraft is envisioned to use this power for science and communications as well as Electric Propulsion (EP). Among other potential power-generating concepts, previous studies have considered Thermoelectric and Brayton power conversion systems, coupled to a liquid metal reactor for the JIMO mission. This paper will explore trades in system mass and radiator area for a nuclear reactor power conversion system, however this study will focus on Stirling power conversion. Stirling convertors have a long heritage operating in both power generation and the cooler industry, and are currently in use in a wide variety of applications. The Stirling convertor modeled in this study is based upon the Component Test Power Convertor design that was designed and operated successfully under the Civil Space Technology Initiative for use with the SP-100 nuclear reactor in the 1980's and early 1990's. The baseline RPP considered in this study consists of four dual-opposed Stirling convertors connected to the reactor by a liquid lithium loop. The study design is such that two of the four convertors would operate at any time to generate the 100 kWe while the others are held in reserve. For this study the Stirling convertors hot-side temperature is 1050 K, would operate at a temperature ratio of 2.4 for a minimum mass system and would have a system efficiency of 29%. The Stirling convertor would generate high voltage (400 volt), 100 Hz single phase AC that is supplied to the Power Management and Distribution system. The waste heat is removed from the Stirling convertors by a flowing liquid sodium-potassium eutectic and then rejected by a shared radiator. The radiator consists of two coplanar wings, which would be deployed after the reactor is in space. For this study design, the radiators would be located behind the conical radiation shield of the reactor and fan out as the radiator's distance from the reactor increases. System trades were performed to vary cycle state point temperatures and convertor design as well as power output. Other redundancy combinations were considered to understand the affects of convertor size and number of spares to the system mass.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867193; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 738-749","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7484073416","10.1063/1.1867193","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630585","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630585","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

Drawbacks to their use include the expense of working with toxic materials, a limited industrial infrastructure, and material properties that are challenging in the non-irradiated state and seriously degrade under neutron irradiation. As an example of neutron effects, mechanical properties degrade under relevant conditions to the point where encasement in structural alloys is necessary. Such measures are required if neutron fluence exceeds {approx}1x1024 n/m2 (E&gt;0.1 MeV). At high temperatures (&gt;500 deg. C for Be and &gt;600 deg. C for BeO), irradiation-induced swelling may also limit the maximum allowable dose without additional engineering measures. Significant volumetric swelling (&gt;5%) can occur in these materials during neutron irradiation at elevated temperatures for neutron fluences above 1x1025 n/m2. This paper will review Be and BeO fabrication considerations, and summarize the effects of neutron irradiation on material properties.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867196; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 768-775","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7485073417","10.1063/1.1867196","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630586","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630586","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

For a space system, where the time for communication to Earth is significant, autonomous control is imperative. Based on feedback from reactor diagnostics, a controller must be able to automatically adjust to changes in reactor temperature and power level to maintain nominal operation without user intervention. Model-based predictive control (MBPC) (Clarke 1994; Morari 1994) is investigated as a potential control methodology for reactor start-up and transient operation in the presence of an external source. Bragg-Sitton and Holloway (2004) assessed the applicability of MBPC to reactor start-up from a cold, zero-power condition in the presence of a time-varying external radiation source, where large fluctuations in the external radiation source can significantly impact a reactor during start-up operations. The MBPC algorithm applied the point kinetics model to describe the reactor dynamics, using a single group of delayed neutrons; initial application considered a fast neutron lifetime (10-3 sec) to simplify calculations during initial controller analysis. The present study will more accurately specify the dynamics of a fast reactor, using a more appropriate fast neutron lifetime (10-7 sec) than in the previous work. Controller stability will also be assessed by carefully considering the dependencies of each component in the defined cost (objective) function and its subsequent effect on the selected 'optimal' control maneuvers.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867199; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 791-799","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7487073419","10.1063/1.1867199","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630588","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630588","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

In addition, the pros and cons of neutron spectra are significantly different among many of the envisioned space power applications. This paper begins with a discussion of the neutronic differences between fast-spectrum and moderated space reactors. This is followed by a discussion of the pros and cons of fast-spectrum and moderated space reactors separated into three areas--technical risk, performance, and safety/safeguards. A mix of quantitative and qualitative arguments is presented, and some conclusions generally can be made regarding neutron spectrum and space power application. In most cases, a fast-spectrum system appears to be the better alternative (mostly because of simplicity and higher potential operating temperatures); however, in some cases, such as a low-power (&lt;100-kWt) surface reactor, a moderated spectrum could provide a better approach. In all cases, the determination of which spectrum is preferred is a strong function of the metrics provided by the 'customer' - i.e., if a certain level of performance is required, it could provide a different solution than if a certain level of safeguards is required (which in some cases could produce a null solution).

The isotopes were considered to be in-fuel poisons, as well as poisons coating the fuel. One way to quantify the effectiveness of a poison in meeting accident-condition requirements is by defining the safety margin as the difference between keff at the beginning of life and keff during the accident scenarios. The isotope that showed the most potential in increasing the safety margin for the wet-sand/water case was 157Gd. The safety margin was 10%-20% greater using 157Gd as an in-fuel poison as opposed to a coating, depending on the poison quantity. However, the most limiting condition (i.e., the accident scenario with the highest keff, thus the lowest safety margin) is when the reactor is submerged in wet sand. None of the isotopes considered significantly affected the safety margin for the dry-sand case. However, the poison isotopes considered may have applicability for meeting the wet-sand/water keff requirements or as burnable poisons in a moderated system.

This design study identifies the cause, determines the reflector configurations for reactor criticality, and generates worth curves for minimized fission-power-peaking configuration in a lithium-cooled liquid-metal reactor that uses sliding reflectors. Because of the characteristics of the core axial power distribution and axial power distortions inherent to the sliding reflector design, minimizing the power peaking of the reactor involves placing the reflectors in a position that least distorts the axial power distribution.

For the work reported herein, seven probes were constructed with ten sensors each for a total of 70 sensor locations throughout the core. These discrete temperature sensors were monitored over a nine hour period while the test article was heated to over 700 deg. C and cooled to ambient through two operational cycles. The sensor density available permits a significantly elevated understanding of thermal effects within the simulated reactor. Fiber-optic sensor performance is shown to compare very favorably with co-located thermocouples where such co-location was feasible.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867212; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 887-894","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7495073427","10.1063/1.1867212","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20630596","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630596","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

The entire Russian Baikal Test Stand, consisting of a 5.79 m tall vacuum chamber and related support equipment, was reassembled and tested at the TSET facility in less than four months. In November 1992, the first non-nuclear operational test of a complete thermionic power reactor system in the U.S. was accomplished three months ahead of schedule and under budget. A major factor in this accomplishment was the application of a disciplined top-down systems engineering approach and application of a spiral development model to achieve the desired objectives of the TOPAZ International Program (TIP). Systems Engineering is a structured discipline that helps programs and projects conceive, develop, integrate, test and deliver products and services that meet customer requirements within cost and schedule. This paper discusses the impact of Systems Engineering and a spiral development model on the success of the TOPAZ International Program and how the application of a similar approach could help ensure the success of future space reactor development projects.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867214; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 903-909","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7497073429","10.1063/1.1867214","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630598","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630598","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

The choices of the energy conversion technology for these power systems require radiator temperatures that span a wide range, from 350 K to 800 K. Heat pipes with carbon-carbon fins and armor are the preferred choice for these radiators because of inherent redundancy and efficient spreading and rejection of waste heat into space at a relatively small mass penalty. The performance results and specific masses of radiator heat pipes with cesium, rubidium, and potassium working fluids are presented and compared in this paper. The heat pipes operate at 40% of the prevailing operation limit (a design margin of 60%), typically the sonic and/or capillary limit. The thickness of the carbon-carbon fins is 0.5 mm but the width is varied, and the evaporator and condenser sections are 0.15 and 1.35 m long, respectively. The 400-mesh wick and the heat pipe thin metal wall are titanium, and the carbon-carbon armor ({approx} 2 mm-thick) provides both structural strength and protection against meteoroids impacts. The cross-section area of the D-shaped radiator heat pipes is optimized for minimum mass. Because of the low vapor pressure of potassium and its very high Figure-Of-Merit (FOM), radiator potassium heat pipes are the best performers at temperatures above 800 K, where the sonic limit is no longer an issue. On the other hand, rubidium heat pipes are limited by the sonic limit below 762 K and by the capillary limit at higher temperature. The transition temperature between these two limits for the cesium heat pipes occurs at a lower temperature of 724 K, since cesium has lower FOM than rubidium. The present results show that with a design margin of 60%, the cesium heat pipes radiator is best at 680-720 K, the rubidium heat pipes radiator is best at 720-800 K, while the potassium heat pipes radiator is the best performer and lightest at higher temperatures {&gt;=} 800 K.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867218; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 935-945","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7498073430","10.1063/1.1867218","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630599","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630599","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

This facility provides a cost effective method to evaluate concepts/designs and support mitigation of developmental risk. Electrical resistance thermal simulators can be used to closely mimic the heat deposition of the fission process, providing axial and radial profiles. A number of experimental and design programs were underway in 2004 which include the following. Initial evaluation of the Department of Energy Los Alamos National Laboratory 19 module stainless steel/sodium heat pipe reactor with integral gas heat exchanger was operated at up to 17.5 kW of input power at core temperatures of 1000 K. A stainless steel sodium heat pipe module was placed through repeated freeze/thaw cyclic testing accumulating over 200 restarts to a temperature of 1000 K. Additionally, the design of a 37- pin stainless steel pumped sodium/potassium (NaK) loop was finalized and components procured. Ongoing testing at the EFF-TF is geared towards facilitating both research and development necessary to support future decisions regarding potential use of space nuclear systems for space exploration. All efforts are coordinated with DOE laboratories, industry, universities, and other NASA centers. This paper describes some of the 2004 efforts.","","","","","","United States","2005-02-06T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 746; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2005: Conference on thermophysics in microgravity; Conference on commercial/civil next generation space transportation; 22. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion; Conference on human/robotic technology and the national vision for space exploration; 3. symposium on space colonization; 2. symposium on new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 13-17 Feb 2005; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1867213; (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 895-902","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US05A7496073428","10.1063/1.1867213","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20630597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20630597","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","746"

Also, the selection of design variables for optimization was considered to reduce computation time without losing beneficial design search space.

The MCNP4C code was deployed to model and assess the neutron multiplication parameters of pool-based storage and dry transport containers under various loading patterns and moderating conditions. To comply with standard safety requirements, fresh 4.25% enriched nuclear fuel was assumed. The impact of potential optimum moderation due to water steam or foam formation as well as of different interpretations, of neutron multiplication through varying the system boundary conditions was elaborated. The simulations indicate that in the case of compact (all rack locations filled with fresh fuel) single or 'double tiering' loading, the supercriticality can occur under the conditions of enhanced neutron moderation, due to accidentally reduced density of cooling water. Under standard operational conditions the effective multiplication factor (k{sub eff}) of pool-based storage facility remains below the specified safety limit of 0.95. The nuclear safety requirements are fulfilled even when the fuel elements are arranged at a minimal distance, which can be initiated, for example, by an earthquake. The dry container in its recommended loading scheme with 26 fuel elements represents a safe alternative for the repository of fresh fuel. Even in the case of complete water flooding, the k{sub eff} remains below the specified safety level of 0.98. The criticality safety limit may however be exceeded with larger amounts of loaded fuel assemblies (i.e., 32). Additional Monte Carlo criticality safety analyses are scheduled to consider the 'burnup credit' of PWR spent nuclear fuel, based on the ongoing calculation of typical burnup activities.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-13","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0996013483","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840226","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840226","","Nuclear Technology","1","149"

What limits the core life is radiation damage to the HT-9 structural material. The temperature coefficients of reactivity are all negative, except for that of the coolant expansion. However, the negative reactivity coefficient associated with the radial expansion of the core structure can compensate for the coolant thermal expansion. The void coefficient is positive but of no safety concern because the boiling temperature of lead or lead-bismuth is so high that there is no conceivable mechanism for the introduction of significant void fraction into the core. The core reactivity coefficients, reactivity worth, and power distributions are almost constant throughout the core life.It was found possible to design such once-for-life cores using different qualities of Pu and transuranics as long as U is used as the primary fertile material. It is also feasible to design ENHS cores using nitride rather than metallic fuel. Relative to the reference metallic fuel core, nitride fuel cores offer up to {approx}25% higher discharge burnup and longer life, up to {approx}38% more energy per core, a significantly more negative Doppler reactivity coefficient, and less positive coolant expansion and coolant void reactivity coefficient but a somewhat smaller negative fuel expansion reactivity coefficient. The pitch-to-diameter ratio (1.45 of the nitride fuel cores using enriched N) is larger than that (1.36) for the reference metallic fuel core, implying a reduction of the coolant friction loss, thus enabling an increase in the power level that can be removed from the core by natural circulation cooling.It is also possible to design Pu-U(10Zr) fueled ENHS-type cores using Na as the primary coolant with either Na or Pb-Bi secondary coolants. The Na-cooled cores feature a tighter lattice and are therefore more compact but have spikier power distribution, more positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficients, and smaller reactivity worth of the control elements.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0998013485","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840228","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840228","","Nuclear Technology","1","149"

The modeled flow domain exploits the periodicity of the spacer and is separated into a bare bundle and grid region to maintain a manageable model size. An iterative process is used to couple the segregated flow domains to arrive at a converged solution. The grid spacer is a 7 x 7 mixing vane grid representative of an actual pressurized water reactor grid. Pressure drop and rod wall temperature predictions for steady-state operation are computed.

For symmetric two-fissile-component systems with the DR close to unity, the extinction of fission source sites can occur in one of the components even when the initial source is symmetric and the number of histories per cycle is more than 1000. When such a system is made slightly asymmetric, the neutron effective multiplication factor at the inactive cycles does not reflect the convergence to stationary source distribution. To overcome this problem, relative entropy has been applied to a slightly asymmetric two-fissile-component problem with a DR of 0.993. The numerical results are mostly satisfactory but also show the possibility of the occasional occurrence of unnecessarily strict stationarity diagnostics. Therefore, a criterion is defined based on the concept of data compression limit in information theory. Numerical results for a pressurized water reactor fuel storage facility with a DR of 0.994 strongly support the efficacy of relative entropy in both the posterior and progressive stationarity diagnostics.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 38-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0380109900","10.13182/NSE04-15","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","20808408","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808408","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","149"

Thus, it is important to prepare effective cross-section libraries that include an appropriate group structure and are based on an appropriate spectrum. There are several multigroup cross-section libraries available for particular applications. For example, the 47-neutron, 20-gamma group BUGLE library that is derived from the 199-neutron, 42-gamma group VITAMIN-B6 library is widely used for light water reactor (LWR) shielding and pressure vessel dosimetry applications. However, there is no publicly available methodology that can construct problem-dependent libraries. Thus, the authors have developed the Contributon and Point-wise Cross Section Driven (CPXSD) methodology for constructing effective fine- and broad-group structures. In this paper, new fine-group structures were constructed using the CPXSD, and new fine-group cross-section libraries were generated. The 450-group LIB450 and 589-group LIB589 libraries were developed for neutrons sensitive to the fast and thermal energy ranges, respectively, for LWR shielding problems. As compared to a VITAMIN-B6-like library, the new fine-group library developed for fast neutron dosimetry calculations resulted in closer agreement to the continuous-energy predictions. For example, for the fast neutron cavity dosimetry, {approx}4% improvement was observed for the {sup 237}Np(n,f) reaction rate. For the thermal neutron {sup 1}H(n, {gamma}) reaction, a maximum improvement of {approx}14% was observed in the reaction rate at the middowncomer position.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51-64","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0381109901","10.13182/NSE04-23","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","20808409","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808409","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","149"

The response surface method is employed as an optimization technique. The objective function is defined as a combination of the heat transfer rate and the inverse of friction loss with weighting factor. The bend angle and base length of the mixing vane are selected as design variables. In most of the numerical experiments, both the heat transfer and friction loss are enhanced as the bend angle and base length increase. The swirl and cross-flow characteristics and thermal-hydraulic performances of different shapes of mixing vane are discussed. From the results, the close relationship between the swirl factor and the heat transfer rate has been found. In the specified ranges of the design variables, the sensitivity of the objective function to the base length is only about one-tenth of the sensitivity to the bend angle. Nine points for numerical experiments were sufficient for construction of a reliable response surface. The optimum shape has been obtained as a function of the weighting factor in the objective function.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1000013487","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840230","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840230","","Nuclear Technology","1","149"

To analyze the thermal-hydraulic parameters in a subassembly of a liquid metal-cooled reactor with a flow blockage, the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute has developed the MATRA-LMR-FB code. This code uses the distributed resistance model to describe the sweeping flow formed by the wire wrap around the fuel rods and to model the recirculation flow after a blockage. The hybrid difference scheme is also adopted for the description of the convective terms in the recirculating wake region of low velocity. Some state-of-the-art turbulent mixing models were implemented in the code, and the models suggested by Rehme and by Zhukov are analyzed and found to be appropriate for the description of the flow blockage in an LMR subassembly. The MATRA-LMR-FB code predicts accurately the experimental data of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory 19-pin bundle with a blockage for both the high-flow and low-flow conditions. The influences of the distributed resistance model, the hybrid difference method, and the turbulent mixing models are evaluated step by step with the experimental data. The appropriateness of the models also has been evaluated through a comparison with the results from the COMMIX code calculation. The flow blockage for the KALIMER design has been analyzed with the MATRA-LMR-FB code and is compared with the SABRE code to guarantee the design safety for the flow blockage.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 71-87","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1001013488","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840231","","Nuclear Technology","1","149"

The monitoring system was applied to the IEA-R1 experimental reactor at the Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares (IPEN). The IEA-R1 is a 5-MW pool-type research reactor that uses light water as coolant and moderator and graphite as reflector. The GMDH provides a general framework for characterizing the relationships among a set of state variables of a process system and is used for generating estimates of critical variables in an optimal data-driven model form. The monitoring system developed in this work was used to predict the IEA-R1 reactor environment, using nuclear power, rod position, and coolant temperatures, by combining two variables at a time. The results obtained using the GMDH models agreed very well with the dose rate measurements, with prediction errors of less than 5%. The error was minimal when the dose rate prediction was made using reactor power and coolant temperature.","","","","","","United States","2005-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 149; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 101-109","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N1003013490","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840233","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840233","","Nuclear Technology","1","149"

Specifically, these seals prevent the leakage of toxic gases and hazardous chemicals to the environment and final products from the rotating equipment used in manufacturing processes. Diamond coatings have the potential to provide negligible wear, ultralow friction, and high corrosion resistance for the sliding surfaces of mechanical seals, because diamond exhibits outstanding tribological, physical, and chemical properties. However, diamond coatings produced by conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) exhibit high surface roughness (R{sub a} {&gt;=} 1 {mu}m), which results in high wear of the seal counterface, leading to premature seal failure. To avoid this problem, we have developed an ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) film formed by a unique CH{sub 4}/Ar microwave plasma CVD method. This method yields extremely smooth diamond coatings with surface roughness R{sub a} = 20-30 nm and an average grain size of 2-5 nm. We report the results of a systematic test program involving uncoated and UNCD-coated SiC shaft seals. Results confirmed that the UNCD-coated seals exhibited neither measurable wear nor any leakage during long-duration tests that took 21 days to complete. In addition, the UNCD coatings reduced the frictional torque for seal rotation by five to six times compared with the uncoated seals. This work promises to lead to rotating shaft seals with much improved service life, reduced maintenance cost, reduced leakage of environmentally hazardous materials, and increased energy savings. This technology may also have many other tribological applications involving rolling or sliding contacts.","","","Argonne National Lab.

This LWR MOX recycle strategy is still widely regarded as an interim step leading to the eventual establishment of sustainable fast reactor fuel cycles. The OECD/NEA Working Party on the Physics of Plutonium Fuels and Innovative Fuel Cycles (WPPR) has recently completed a review of the technical options for plutonium management in what it refers to as the 'medium term'. For the purpose of the review, the WPPR considers the medium term to cover the period from now up to the point at which fast reactor fuel cycles are established on a commercial scale. The review identified a number of different designs of innovative plutonium fuel assemblies intended to be used in current LWR cores, in LWRs with significantly different moderation properties, as well as in high-temperature gas reactors. The full review report describes these various options and highlights their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper briefly summarizes the main findings of the review.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 244-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0985011742","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837904","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837904","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

This work, which extends the current experimental database to a large geometric scale, is of interest notably with regard to the start-up procedures in natural-circulation-cooled boiling water reactors. It should help the understanding of the physical phenomena that may cause flow instability in such conditions and can be used for validation of thermal-hydraulics system codes. The tests were performed at a constant power, balanced by a specific condenser heat removal capacity. The test matrix allowed the reactor pressure vessel power and pressure to be varied, as well as other parameters influencing the natural-circulation flow. The power spectra of flow oscillations showed in a few tests a major and unique resonance peak, and decay ratios between 0.5 and 0.9 have been found. The remainder of the tests showed an even more pronounced stable behavior. A classification of the tests is presented according to the circulation modes (from single-phase to two-phase flow) that could be assumed and particularly to the importance and the localization of the flashing phenomenon.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 294-312","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0989011744","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837906","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837906","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

They are all based on the general guideline of the code scaling, applicability, and uncertainty (CSAU) method. Although there is an extensive compilation of experimental and theoretical databases and a detailed guide about the best-estimate calculation of loss-of-coolant accidents, these applications are dissimilar to each other. The absence of a procedure to implement the requirement of direct data comparison with integral- and separate-effects tests in determining the code uncertainty is the main cause of the differences. To overcome this problem, a code-accuracy-based uncertainty estimation (CABUE) technique has been developed, in which the code accuracy becomes the measure of the selection of code parameters and the determination of the ranges of them. An application of this technique to a Westinghouse three-loop nuclear power plant has been successfully performed.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 335-347","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0992011746","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837908","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837908","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

The reactor is running successfully, with an upgraded power level of 10 MW. To save money on the purchase of costly fresh LEU fuel elements, the use of less burnt HEU spent fuel elements along with the present LEU fuel elements is being considered. The proposal calls for the HEU fuel elements to be placed near the thermal column to gain the required excess reactivity. In the present study the safety analysis of a proposed mixed-fuel core has been carried out at a calculated steady-state power level of 9.8 MW. Standard computer codes and correlations were employed to compute various parameters. Initiating events in reactivity-induced accidents involve various modes of reactivity insertion, namely, start-up accident, accidental drop of a fuel element on the core, flooding of a beam tube with water, and removal of an in-pile experiment during reactor operation. For each of these transients, time histories of reactor power, energy released, temperature, and reactivity were determined.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 369-376","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0995011747","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837909","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837909","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

The principal aim is to predict neutron-induced activation levels using both methods and make comparisons against the measured thermal reaction rates. Neutron transport calculations have been performed for a fixed source using a spatially lumped fission neutron distribution, which has been derived from measurements. The deterministic code used is based on the finite element approximation to the multigroup second-order even-parity neutron transport equation, which is implemented in the EVENT code. The Monte Carlo solutions were obtained using the MCNP4C code, in which neutron cross sections are represented in pointwise (or continuous) form. We have compared neutron spectra at various locations not only to show differences between using multigroup deterministic and continuous energy (point nuclear data) Monte Carlo methods but also to assess neutron-induced activation levels calculated using the spectra obtained from both methods. Results were also compared against experiments that were carried out to determine neutron-induced reaction rates. To determine activation levels, we employed the European Activation Code System FISPACT. We have found that the neutron spectra calculated at various in-core and out-of-core components show some differences, which mainly reflect the use of multigroup and point energy nuclear data libraries and methods employed, but these differences have not resulted in large errors on the calculated activation levels of materials that are important (such as steel components) for decommissioning studies of the reactor. The agreement of calculated reaction rates of thermal neutron detectors such as the {sup 55}Mn(n,{gamma}){sup 56}Mn against measurements was satisfactory.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 223-234","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0983013476","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840219","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840219","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

Applicability concerning nuclide composition comes essentially from using empirical equations describing specific heat and density to give simplified forms of the models. The models developed originally for a stepwise reactivity insertion mode are shown in the current paper to approximately stand for the ramp reactivity insertion mode by giving their theoretical formation and are validated by applying experimental data from JAERI's Transient Experiment Critical Facility (TRACY) on a low-{sup 235}U-enriched uranium nitrate solution as well as CRAC experiments on high-{sup 235}U-enriched uranium nitrate solution together with past accident data, including the most recent JCO accident.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 235-243","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0984013477","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840220","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

The test rod had the same geometric configuration as the HANARO fuel, and its aluminum cladding with fins was made by coextrusion on the stainless steel heating tube. Three types of test sections were used: hexagonal with seven rods, triangular with three rods, and rectangular with four rods. Each test bundle has three spacers axially, and a view window is located in the upper region of the test section. Flow patterns until the CHF condition are typically varied from bubbly flow to annular flow, and then CHF occurs through the long annular flow period. A total of 36 bundle CHF data were obtained from the 3 test sections. The results showed that the CHFs for bundles are larger than those for a single rod with the same geometrical dimension by a maximum 26% as the mass flux changes. It is considered that these results are induced by the enhancement of the turbulence and thermal mixing generated by the spacers. In addition, measurement of the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) in the rectangular bundle was attempted using sound signals. A hydrophone was attached near the outlet wall of the test section. Hydrophone signals around the ONB point were measured and analyzed based on the frequency through the real fast Fourier transform. Frequency analysis showed clear differences in the power spectral densities for two different frequency ranges before and after ONB, which verifies the usefulness of sound signals for ONB detection.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 287-293","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0988013479","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840222","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840222","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

The relationship between the Nusselt number (Nu) and the Rayleigh number (Ra) in the molten metal pool region is determined and compared with the correlations in the literature and experimental data with subcooled water. Given the same Ra condition, the present experimental results for Nu of the liquid metal pool with coolant boiling are found to be higher than those predicted by the existing correlations or measured from the experiment with subcooled boiling. To quantify the observed effect of the external cooling on the natural convection heat transfer rate from the molten pool, it is proposed to include an additional dimensionless group characterizing the temperature gradients in the molten pool and in the external coolant region. Starting from the Globe and Dropkin correlation, engineering correlations are developed for the enhancement of heat transfer in the molten metal pool when cooled by an overlying coolant. The new correlations for predicting natural convection heat transfer are applicable to low-Prandtl-number (Pr) materials that are heated from below and solidified by the external coolant above.

Fission product fractionation is in accordance with the modern trend toward zero emission of toxic materials; salt-free separation utilizing in situ electrochemistry will suit the current direction of research and development in the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. A catalytic electrolytic extraction and dissolution method, which would avoid secondary waste arising, was proposed to separate the target, the radioactive but potentially strategic elements Pd, Ru, Rh, Tc, Te, and Se, dissolved in high-level liquid waste (HLLW). It was confirmed that RMFPs could be recovered essentially from simulated HLLW with the conceptual scheme, although further studies for the optimization were required to obtain higher recovery ratios of RMFPs. Elemental separation not only offers alternative material resources to meet expanding demands for catalysts in fuel cell/hydrogen energy systems but is also the first step for transmutation or other selective strategies for waste management of long-lived fission products.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 348-357","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0993013481","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840224","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840224","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"
"Modeling of Colloid Transport Mechanisms Facilitating Migration of Radionuclides in Fractured Media","Shihhai, Li; Yang, H -T; Jen, C -P","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COLLOIDS; DIFFUSION; FILTRATION; FRACTURES; HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTES; POROUS MATERIALS; RADIOISOTOPES; RADIONUCLIDE MIGRATION; ROCKS; SIMULATION; SURFACES","Performance assessments of high-level radioactive waste disposal have emphasized the role of colloids in the migration of radionuclides in the geosphere. The transport of colloids often brings them in contact with fracture surfaces or porous rock matrix. Colloids that attach to these surfaces are treated as being immobile and are called filtered colloids. The filtered colloids could be released into the fracture again; that is, the attachment of colloids may be reversible. Also, the colloids in the fracture could diffuse into the porous matrix rock. A methodology is proposed to evaluate a predictive model to assess transport within the fractured rock as well as various phenomenological coefficients employed in the different mechanisms, such as filtration, remobilization, and matrix diffusion of colloids. The governing equations of colloids considering mechanisms of the colloidal transport in the fractured media, including filtration, remobilization, and matrix diffusion, have been modeled and solved analytically in previous studies. In the present study, transport equations of colloids and radionuclides that consider the combination of the aforementioned transport mechanisms have also been solved numerically and investigated. The total concentration of mobile radionuclides in the fracture becomes lower because the concentration of mobile colloids in the fracture decreases when the filtration coefficient for colloids increases. Additionally, the concentration of mobile radionuclides was increased at any given time step due to the higher sorption partition coefficient of radionuclides associated with colloids. The results also show that the concentration of radionuclides in the fracture zone decreases when the remobilization coefficient of colloids or the percentages of the matrix diffusion flux of colloids increase.","","","","","","United States","2004-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 358-368","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0994013482","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840225","","Nuclear Technology","3","148"

The coupling of COBRA-TF with TRAC-PF1/NEM is performed by providing from TRAC to COBRA-TF axial and radial thermal-hydraulic boundary conditions and relative pin-power profiles, obtained with the pin power reconstruction model of the nodal expansion method (NEM). An efficient algorithm for coupling of the subchannel code COBRA-TF with TRAC-PF1/NEM in the parallel virtual machine environment was developed addressing the issues of time synchronization, data exchange, spatial overlays, and coupled convergence. Local feedback modeling on the pin level was implemented into COBRA-TF, which enabled updating the local form functions and the recalculation of the pin powers in TRAC-PF1/NEM after obtaining the local feedback parameters. The coupled TRAC-PF1/NEM/COBRA-TF code system was tested on the rod ejection accident and main steam line break benchmark problems. In both problems, the local results are closer than before the introduced multilevel coupling to the corresponding critical limits. This fact indicates that the assembly average results tend to underestimate the accident consequences in terms of local safety margins. The capability of local safety evaluation, performed simultaneously (online) with coupled global three-dimensional neutron kinetics/thermal-hydraulic calculations, is introduced and tested. The obtained results demonstrate the importance of the current work.","","","","","","United States","2004-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 414-425","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0372109892","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808400","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808400","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","148"

The paper includes three parts. In the first part, a simplified time-varying linear model of the PWR power system is constructed, and its inner structure and time-varying characteristics are analyzed. That provides a solid basis for study and design of the nuclear reactor power control system. In the second part, a systematic design method of fuzzy control systems is introduced and applied to control the nuclear reactor power process. The design procedures and parameters are given in detail. This systematic design method has some notable advantages. The control of a global fuzzy model can be decomposed into controlling a set of linear submodels. Each submodel controller can be independently designed by using a linear quadratic regulator approach. This systematic design method gives a sufficient and necessary condition to guarantee the stability of fuzzy control systems; thus, better control performance can be obtained due to the accurate control gains. In the third part, the control performance of the nuclear reactor fuzzy control system is examined by simulation experiments, including nuclear reactor power shutdown, start-up, and adjustment operations. The satisfactory experiment results have shown that the systematic design method for fuzzy control systems is effective and feasible.","","","","","","United States","2004-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 429-444","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0374109894","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808402","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808402","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","3","148"

The reference plant for KNPEC-2 is the Yong Gwang Nuclear Unit 1, which is a Westinghouse-type 3-loop, 950 MW(electric) pressurized water reactor. Because of the limited computational capability at that time, it uses overly simplified physical models and assumptions for a real-time simulation of NSSS thermal-hydraulic transients. This may entail inaccurate results and thus, the possibility of so-called ''negative training,'' especially for complicated two-phase flows in the reactor coolant system. To resolve the problem, we developed a realistic NSSS thermal-hydraulic program (named ARTS code) based on the best-estimate code RETRAN-3D. The systematic assessment of ARTS has been conducted by both a stand-alone test and an integrated test in the simulator environment. The non-integrated stand-alone test (NIST) results were reasonable in terms of accuracy, real-time simulation capability, and robustness. After successful completion of the NIST, ARTS was integrated with a 3-D reactor kinetics model and other system models. The site acceptance test (SAT) has been completed successively and confirmed to comply with the ANSI/ANS-3.5-1998 simulator software performance criteria. This paper presents our efforts for the ARTS development and some test results of the NIST and SAT.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 3-11","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0964011724","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837886","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837886","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

Features of an ABWR are reactor internal pumps (RIPs) placed in the lower plenum and downcomer, peripherally bottom-mounted on the reactor pressure vessel - which should require different modeling from the jet pumps and two recirculation pumps in the primary outer-loop recirculations of BWR-5.Efforts focused on modeling and simulating the ABWR with transient analyses by the point-kinetics model with the local reactivity modified by local importance weighting of the squared nodal power during start-up tests using the RETRAN-3D code, version MOD003 without three-dimensional kinetics. The core and reactor pressure vessel including ten ABWR RIPs and the steam lines were modeled, and simulations were carried out for the cases of the one-pump trip test, the changing-setpoint tests, the main-steam-isolation-valve-closure test, and the generator load rejection test with bypass.The analytical simulation with RETRAN-3D/MOD003 well reproduced the measured data of the ABWR in operation for the RIP trip and the transient tests and could demonstrate its validation for applying to the ABWR with modeling of RIPs.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 12-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0965011725","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837887","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837887","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

The two Prairie Island reactors are Westinghouse 2-loop units with 121 asymmetric 14 x 14 lattice assemblies utilizing up to 8 wt% gadolinium while Monticello is a General Electric 484 bundle boiling water reactor. All reactor cases were executed in full core utilizing 24 axial nodes per assembly in the fuel with 1 additional reflector node above, below, and around the perimeter of the core. Cross-section sets used in this benchmark effort were generated by EPRI's CPM-3 as well as Studsvik's CASMO-3 and CASMO-4 to allow for separation of the lattice calculation effect from the nodal simulation method. These cases exercised the depletion-shuffle-depletion sequence through four cycles for each unit using plant data to follow actual operations. Flux map calculations were performed for comparison to corresponding measurement statepoints. Additionally, start-up physics testing cases were used to predict cycle physics parameters for comparison to existing plant methods and measurements.These benchmark results agreed well with both current analysis methods and plant measurements, indicating that CORETRAN-01 may be appropriate for steady-state physics calculations of both the Prairie Island and Monticello reactors. However, only the Prairie Island results are discussed in this paper since Monticello results were of similar quality and agreement. No attempt was made in this work to investigate CORETRAN-01 kinetics capability by analyzing plant transients, but these steady-state results form a good foundation for moving in that direction.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 25-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0966011726","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837888","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837888","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

Consequently, a large effort has been made to capture the flow pattern produced by the jet created by the steam injection, including in the model a large number of nodes for the three-dimensional (3-D) representation of the two vessels. The influence of the nodalization of the DWs on the calculation was investigated by means of two additional models using one volume for each of the DWs and a 3-D calculation using a much coarser mesh, respectively.Since the fluid in the DWs was well mixed and stratification occurred only below the injection level, all the models could predict very accurately the global variables such as pressure and temperature. The 3-D simulation also reproduced the wall and gas temperature distributions fairly well. The only (inferred) discrepancy with the test was the overprediction in the upward deflection of the buoyant steam jet.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 35-47","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0967011727","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837889","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

The amount of liquid carried from the system is dependent on the assumed break size, feedwater boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Although liquid carryout is potentially realistic during this scenario, there are no plant or test facility data on which to validate the amount of water carryout.Because the steam generator tube stress evaluation is a safety related analysis, a conservative approach is required. Overcooling effects for an SLB transient are maximized by retaining as much steam generator liquid as possible to remove energy from the reactor coolant system. Because water carryout is nonconservative, and due to the lack of data, the analysis is performed assuming no liquid is carried from the break. This boundary condition is difficult to impose on a RETRAN-3D analysis since the amount of liquid entrained in the break flow is determined by internal code models, which the analyst cannot control directly.This paper presents the methodology used to eliminate water carryout for these types of calculations. The methodology consists of a combination of special RETRAN-3D code modifications and model input changes.In the second part of the paper, the results of an SLB analysis for the Oconee Nuclear Station employing the above methodology are presented. These analyses are done to compute the temperature differences between the steam generator tubes and the shell of the once-through steam generator. The temperature of the thin tubes decreases much faster than the temperature of the shell during an overcooling transient such as an SLB, resulting in tensile stresses that might lead to tube failures.A number of break sizes were analyzed starting with a double-ended main SLB down to a small break of 0.0372 m{sup 2} (0.4 ft{sup 2}). The sensitivity of the tube tensile stress to the assumed break size is presented.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 48-55","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0968011728","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837890","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

Modeling of both pebble-bed and prismatic configurations is possible. In the case of the pebble-bed concept, refueling of pebbles is simulated to account for the nonuniform environment in the reactor core and history-dependent particle behavior. Monte Carlo sampling of particles is employed in fuel failure prediction to capture the statistical features of dimensions; material properties; and, in the case of the pebble-bed concept, the statistical nature of the refueling process. An advanced fuel failure model has been developed based on a probabilistic fracture mechanics approach. The mechanical analysis includes effects of anisotropic irradiation-induced dimensional changes and isotropic irradiation-induced creep, and the fluence-dependent Poisson ratio in irradiation creep. The stress analysis is benchmarked against the calculations of Japanese High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR) first-loading fuel and finite element result on one case performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The failure model predictions are compared with NPR1, NPR2, and NPR1A capsule irradiation data.

This artificial nuclide can be produced through {sup 241}Am neutron capture carried on in a neutron field typical of a thermal reactor. In order to suppress the thermal neutron flux, which will cause {sup 242m}Am depletion mainly through fission, proper neutron filters should be adopted. In a very intense neutron field, the {sup 242m}Am enrichment depends mainly on the energy distribution of the neutrons, the sample thickness, and the cutoff energy of the neutron filter.An investigation on different geometries of the sample to be irradiated using Cd, B, Sm, and Gd as neutron filters has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulation. The most favorable results have been obtained irradiating thin {sup 241}Am samples (11 {mu}g/cm{sup 2}) covered with a Gd (0.2-mm-thick) or Sm (1-mm-thick) filter. In these cases the theoretical {sup 242m}Am enrichment can reach 20%.The preparation of significant quantities of this unconventional nuclear fuel implies isotopic separation techniques operating in high radioactive environments and hopefully characterized by very high recovery factors, which are in no way trivial problems.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 97-101","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0971013475","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840218","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840218","","Nuclear Technology","1","148"

Turbine trip transients in a BWR are pressurization events in which the coupling between core space-dependent neutronic phenomena and system dynamics plays an important role. In addition, the available real plant experimental data make this benchmark problem very valuable. Over the course of defining and coordinating the BWR TT benchmark, a systematic approach has been established to validate best-estimate coupled codes. This approach employs a multilevel methodology that not only allows for a consistent and comprehensive validation process but also contributes to the study of different numerical and computational aspects of coupled best-estimate simulations.

Through regular exercise 3 and extreme scenarios 3 and 4, its adequacy and robustness were validated. It was deduced that the cross-section format and the core boundary conditions are major influential factors causing errors in three-dimensional power predictions. Power swings observed in extreme scenarios were attributed to intermittent void generation and void sweeping driven by rapid pressurization. Based on a series of sensitivity studies for extreme scenario 4, it was confirmed that neglect of in-channel direct heating causes a large positive reactivity insertion and neglect of bypass direct heating causes only a small change in reactivity effects. Specifying an integration time-step size of &lt;1 ms is recommended for keeping the numerical error within an acceptable level. To investigate the detailed in-channel void distribution and its possible influences on the fuel thermal margin, a one-way coupled system between TRAC/BF1-ENTREE and the three-field subchannel code NASCA was developed. Detailed void distributions at the upper part of the core where the boiling transition will occur become sufficiently uniform during the major period of the turbine trip event. Their influences on the thermal margin seem negligible.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 208-225","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0357109877","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808385","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808385","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","148"

For the exercise 2 benchmark calculations with given thermal-hydraulic boundary conditions of the core, the analyses were performed with the core model DYN3D. Concerning the modeling of the BWR core in the DYN3D code, several simplifications and their influence on the results were investigated. The standard calculations with DYN3D were performed with 764 coolant channels (one channel per fuel assembly), the assembly discontinuity factors (ADF), and the phase slip model of Molochnikov. Comparisons were performed with the results obtained by calculations with 33 thermal-hydraulic channels, without the ADF and with the slip model of Zuber and Findlay. It is shown that the influence on core-averaged values of the steady state and the transient is small. Considering local parameters, the influence of the ADF or the reduced number of coolant channels is not negligible. For the calculations of exercise 3, the DYN3D model validated during the exercise 2 calculations in combination with the ATHLET system model, developed at Gesellschaft fuer Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit for exercise 1, has been used. Calculations were performed for the basic scenario as well as for all specified extreme versions. They were carried out using a modified version of the external coupling of the codes, the 'parallel' coupling. This coupling shows a stable performance at the low time step sizes necessary for an appropriate description of the feedback during the transient. The influence of assumed failures of different relevant safety systems on the plant and the core behavior was investigated in the calculations of the extreme scenarios. The calculations of exercises 2 and 3 contribute to the validation of DYN3D and ATHLET/DYN3D for BWR systems.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 226-234","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0358109878","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808386","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808386","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","148"

The first exercise of the benchmark to model the whole reactor thermal hydraulics with specified power has been performed with the CATHARE system code. Exercise 2, devoted to core thermal-hydraulic neutronic analysis with provided boundary conditions and neutronic cross sections, has been carried out with the CRONOS2 and FLICA4 codes. Finally, exercise 3, combining system thermal hydraulics and core three-dimensional thermal-hydraulics-neutronics, was computed with the three coupled codes: CATHARE, CRONOS2, and FLICA4.Our one-dimensional thermal-hydraulic reactor computation agrees well with the benchmark reference data and demonstrates the capacities of CATHARE to model a turbine trip transient. Coupled three-dimensional thermal-hydraulic and neutronic analysis displays a high sensitivity of the power peak to the core thermal-hydraulic model. The use of at least 100 channels is recommended to achieve reasonable results for integral and local parameters. Deviations between experimental data and exercise 3 results are discussed: timing of events, core pressure drop, and neutronic model.

This module has two options: the MODKIN option that makes use of a modal method based on the assumption that the neutronic flux can be approximately expanded in terms of the dominant lambda modes associated with a static configuration of the reactor core, and the NOKIN option that uses a one-step backward discretization of the neutron diffusion equation.

COS3D, based on a modified one-group neutronic model, is a 3-D core simulator used for licensing analyses and core management of commercial boiling water reactor (BWR) plants in Japan. TRAC-BF1 is a plant simulator based on a two-fluid model. TRAC-BF1/COS3D is a coupled system of both codes, which are connected using a parallel computing tool. This code system was applied to the OECD/NRC BWR Turbine Trip Benchmark. Since the two-group cross-section tables are provided by the benchmark team, COS3D was modified to apply to this specification. Three best-estimate scenarios and four hypothetical scenarios were calculated using this code system. In the best-estimate scenario, the predicted core power with TRAC-BF1/COS3D is slightly underestimated compared with the measured data. The reason seems to be a slight difference in the core boundary conditions, that is, pressure changes and the core inlet flow distribution, because the peak in this analysis is sensitive to them. However, the results of this benchmark analysis show that TRAC-BF1/COS3D gives good precision for the prediction of the actual BWR transient behavior on the whole. Furthermore, the results with the modified one-group model and the two-group model were compared to verify the application of the modified one-group model to this benchmark. This comparison shows that the results of the modified one-group model are appropriate and sufficiently precise.","","","","","","United States","2004-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 281-290","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0363109883","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808391","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808391","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","148"

In the second part, the CORETRAN results of Phase 2 are summarized and the core 3-D response to the pressurization transient prior to SCRAM is discussed. The CORETRAN results show a slight axial flux redistribution toward the top of the core, while radially a flux redistribution is observed toward core regions with assemblies that are initially moderately voided and where the axial power shape is increasingly top-peaked. The impact of the control rod configuration as well as the assembly coolant inventory dynamics on the 3-D flux redistribution is also discussed.

This method is carried out through the coupling of three-dimensional (3-D) neutron modeling of a reactor core into system codes. It is particularly appropriate for transients that involve strong interactions between core neutronics and reactor loop thermal hydraulics. For this purpose, the Peach Bottom boiling water reactor turbine trip test was selected to challenge the capability of such coupled codes. The test is characterized by a power excursion induced by rapid core pressurization and a self-limiting course behavior. In order to perform the closest simulation, the coupled thermal-hydraulic system code RELAP5 and 3-D neutron kinetic code PARCS were used. The obtained results are compared to those available from experimental data. Overall, the coupled code calculations globally predict the most significant observed aspects of the transient, such as the pressure wave amplitude across the core and the power course, with an acceptable agreement.

The goal of achieving a high power level to enhance economic performance simultaneously with adoption of passive decay heat removal and modularity capabilities resulted in designs in the range of 600-800 MW(thermal), which we classify as a medium power level compared to the lower [{approx}100 MW(thermal)] and higher [2800 MW(thermal)] power ratings of other lead-alloy-cooled designs. The plant design that was developed shows promise of achieving all the Generation-IV goals for future nuclear energy systems: sustainable energy generation, low overnight capital cost, a very low likelihood and degree of core damage during any conceivable accident, and a proliferation-resistant fuel cycle. The reactor and fuel cycle designs that evolved to achieve these missions and goals resulted from study of the following key trade-offs: waste reduction versus reactor safety, waste reduction versus cost, and cost versus proliferation resistance. Secondary trade-offs that were also considered were monolithic versus modular design, active versus passive safety systems, forced versus natural circulation, alternative power conversion cycles, and lead versus lead-bismuth coolant.These studies led to a selection of a common modular design with forced convection cooling, passive decay heat removal, and a supercritical CO{sub 2} power cycle for all our reactor concepts. However, the concepts adopt different core designs to optimize the achievement of the two missions. For the low-cost electricity production mission, a design approach based on fueling with low enriched uranium operating without costly reprocessing in a once-through cycle was pursued to achieve a long operating cycle length by enhancing in-core breeding. For the actinide-burning mission three design variants were produced: (1) a fertile-free actinide burner, i.e., a single-tier strategy, (2) a minor actinide burner with plutonium burned in the LWR fleet, i.e., a two-tier strategy, and (3) an actinide burner with characteristics balanced to also favor economic electricity production.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 305-320","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0955011717","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837879","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837879","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

Reduced cost is pursued through the use of (1) a modular design and maximum power rating to capitalize on an economy of scale within the constraints imposed by modularity, (2) a very compact and simple supercritical-CO{sub 2} power cycle, and (3) simplifications of the primary system allowed by the use of lead coolant. Excellent safety is pursued by adopting the integral fast reactor approach of achieving a self-controllable reactor that responds to all key abnormal occurrences, including anticipated transients without scrams, by a safe shutdown without exceeding core integrity limits. The three concepts developed are the fertile-free actinide burner for incineration of all transuranics from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel, the fertile-free minor actinide (MA) burner for preferential burning of MAs working in tandem with LWRs or gas-cooled thermal reactors, and the actinide burner with thorium fuel aimed also at reducing the electricity generation costs through longer-cycle operation.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 321-343","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0956011718","10.13182/NT147-321","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","20837880","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837880","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

The design explores the potential benefits of thorium-based fuel in actinide-burning cores, in particular in terms of the reduction of the large reactivity swing and enhancement of the small Doppler coefficient typical of fertile-free actinide burners. Reduced electricity production cost is pursued through a longer cycle length than that used for fertile-free burners and thus a higher capacity factor. It is shown that the concept can achieve a high transuranics destruction rate, which is only 20% lower than that of an accelerator-driven system with fertile-free fuel. The small negative fuel temperature reactivity coefficient, small positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, and negative core radial expansion coefficient provide self-regulating characteristics so that the reactor is capable of inherent shutdown during major transients without scram, as in the Integral Fast Reactor. This is confirmed by thermal-hydraulic analysis of several transients without scram, including primary coolant pump trip, station blackout, and reactivity step insertion, which showed that the reactor was able to meet all identified thermal limits. However, the benefits of high actinide consumption and small reactivity swing can be attained only if the uranium from the discharged fuel is separated and not recycled. This additional uranium separation step and thorium reprocessing significantly increase the fuel cycle costs. Because the higher fuel cycle cost has a larger impact on the overall cost of electricity than the savings from the higher capacity factor afforded through use of thorium, this concept appears less promising than the fertile-free actinide burners.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 344-367","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0957011719","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837881","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837881","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

Two concepts are presented: (1) an actinide burner reactor, designed to incinerate mostly plutonium and some MAs, and (2) a minor actinide burner reactor, devoted to burning mostly minor actinides and some plutonium. These transuranics are loaded in a fertile-free Zr-based metallic fuel to maximize the incineration rate. Both designs feature streaming fuel assemblies that enhance neutron leakage to achieve favorable neutronic feedback and a double-entry control rod system that reduces reactivity perturbations during seismic events and flattens the axial power profile. A detailed neutronic analysis shows that both designs have favorable neutronic characteristics and reactivity feedback mechanisms that yield passive safety features comparable to those of the Integral Fast Reactor. A safety analysis presents the response of the burners to anticipated transients without scram on the basis of (1) the integral parameter approach and (2) simulations of thermal-hydraulic accident scenario conditions. It is shown that both designs have large thermal margins that lead to safe shutdown without structural damage to the core components for a large spectrum of unprotected transients. Furthermore, the actinide destruction rates are comparable to those of the accelerator transmutation of waste concept, and a fuel cycle cost analysis shows the potential for economical accomplishment of the transmutation mission compared to other proposed actinide-burning options.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 368-387","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0958011720","10.13182/NT04-1","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20837882","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837882","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

Due to the higher core outlet temperature ({approx}550 deg. C) compared to that of light water reactors ({approx}300 deg. C), a wide portfolio of power cycles is available for the lead alloy fast reactor (LFR). Comparison of the following cycles for the LFR was performed: superheated steam (direct and indirect), supercritical steam, helium Brayton, and supercritical CO{sub 2} (S-CO{sub 2}) recompression. Heat transfer from primary to secondary coolant was first analyzed and then the steam generators or heat exchangers were designed. The direct generation of steam in the lead alloy coolant was also evaluated. The resulting temperatures of the secondary fluids are in the range of 530-545 deg. C, dictated by the fixed space available for the heat exchangers in the reactor vessel. For the direct steam generation situation, the temperature is 312 deg. C. Optimization of each power cycle was carried out, yielding net plant efficiency of around 40% for the superheated steam cycle while the supercritical steam and S-CO{sub 2} cycles achieved net plant efficiency of 41%. The cycles were then compared based on their net plant efficiency and potential for low capital cost. The superheated steam cycle is a very good candidate cycle given its reasonably high net plant efficiency and ease of implementation based on the extensive knowledge and operating experience with this cycle. Although the supercritical steam cycle net plant efficiency is slightly better than that of the superheated steam cycle, its high complexity and high pressure result in higher capital cost, negatively affecting plant economics. The helium Brayton cycle achieves low net plant efficiency due to the low lead alloy core outlet temperature, and therefore, even though it is a simpler cycle than the steam cycles, its performance is mediocre in this application. The prime candidate, however, appears to be the S-CO{sub 2} recompression cycle, because it achieves about the same net plant efficiency as the supercritical steam cycle and is significantly simpler than the steam cycles. Moreover, the S-CO{sub 2} cycle offers a significantly higher potential for an increase in efficiency than steam cycles, after better materials allow the LFR operating temperatures to be increased. Therefore, the S-CO{sub 2} is chosen as the reference cycle for the LFR, with the superheated or supercritical steam cycles as backups if the S-CO{sub 2} cycle development efforts do not succeed.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 388-405","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0959011721","10.13182/NT147-388","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","20837883","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837883","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

C. We briefly review the current state of the technology concerning the interaction of Pb and Pb-Bi alloys with structural materials. We then identify the key challenges to successful use of materials in these systems and suggest a path forward to the development of new materials and operating methods to allow higher-temperature operation. Our focus is on the necessary trade-offs that must be considered and how these trade-offs influence R and D choices. Our analysis suggests that three classes of materials will be needed for successful deployment of a lead-alloy-cooled reactor system. A lower-temperature qualified material will be necessary for the pressure boundary. The structural and cladding materials will require 1000 deg. C- and 1200 deg. C-class materials. The 1000 deg. C-class material will be exposed to the 1000 deg. C coolant. The 1200 deg. C-class material will be required for the cladding and structural materials in the core region.

We discuss the neutronics performance of nonfertile, fertile metallic, and fertile nitride fuels loaded with 20 to 30 wt% LWR-grade plutonium plus minor actinides and burned in an open-lattice lead-alloy-cooled fast reactor, with an emphasis on the fuel cycle life and spent fuel isotopic content. As a comparison, similar fuel was also studied in a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Our calculations show that the average actinide burn rate for fertile-free fuel is similar for both the sodium- and lead-bismuth-cooled cases, ranging from 1.02 to 1.16 g/MWd, compared to a typical LWR actinide generation rate of 0.303 g/MWd. In addition, our calculations show that the effective full-power days (EFPDs) of operation (or equivalent reactivity-limited burnup) using fertile fuel can extend beyond 20 yr, and the average actinide burn rate is similar for both the sodium- and lead-bismuth-cooled cases, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 g/MWd. Using the same parameters (i.e., a large pitch-to-diameter ratio, same linear power, and fissile/fertile loading, etc.), the lead-alloy-cooled cases had an EFPD that was 18% to several times greater than their sodium-cooled counterparts. However, tight sodium-cooled lattices are equivalent to the looser lead-alloy lattices in terms of beginning-of-life excess reactivity.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 457-469","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0963011723","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837885","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

The isotope {sup 210}Po is a pure alpha emitter with a half-life of 138.38 days. For typical values of the neutron flux the {sup 210}Po concentration in the coolant can reach 1-10 Ci/kg. While exposure of plant personnel to Po is prevented under normal operating conditions because the primary system is sealed, Po does pose a radiological hazard during maintenance activities for which access to submerged structures is required as well as during accidents resulting in breach of the primary-system barrier. Obviously, continuous removal of Po from the LBE reduces this hazard. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which Po is formed in and released from the LBE. We summarize research performed at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate the basic chemistry of four mechanisms of Po release, which could serve as the basis for a coolant cleanup system in LBE-cooled reactors. The mechanisms explored are lead polonide evaporation, formation of polonium hydride, rare-earth filtering, and alkaline extraction. For the key chemical species involved expressions are given for useful quantities such as formation energy, release, and deposition rates. It is concluded that the most promising removal mechanism is alkaline extraction, although a more systematic investigation of this mechanism is needed.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 406-417","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0960013473","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840216","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840216","","Nuclear Technology","3","147"

The current noise analysis-based MTC measurement, relying on the cross correlation between the neutron noise measured by a single in-core neutron detector and the local temperature noise given by a single core-exit thermocouple located at the top of the same fuel assembly, or of a neighboring fuel assembly, is not accurate. The MTC is systematically underestimated by a factor of 2 to 5 compared to its design-predicted value. A theoretical study shows that, in case of nonhomogeneous moderator temperature noise, the core-averaged moderator temperature noise should be used for the MTC estimation. The new estimation method can reach up to 3% accuracy as compared with the results of core calculations for the Swedish Ringhals-2 pressurized water reactor (PWR). We show via noise measurements performed at the Ringhals-2 PWR that the moderator temperature noise is actually radially strongly heterogeneous and loosely coupled. The new MTC noise estimator is demonstrated to provide an accurate MTC evaluation, with the core-averaged moderator temperature noise estimated via the use of many radial in-core gamma-thermometers. More important, different forms of weighting functions are suggested to calculate the core-averaged moderator temperature noise. This new MTC noise estimator, which is nonintrusive and free of calibration, can therefore be applied to monitor the MTC throughout the cycle.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-29","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0342109862","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808370","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808370","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","148"

The receding horizon control method is combined with a parameter estimator to overcome the problems of the linear modeling and time-varying characteristics of a process. It is a suitable control strategy for time-varying systems, in particular, because the parameter estimator identifies a controller design model recursively at each time step, and also the receding horizon controller recalculates an optimal input at each time step by using newly measured signals. The proposed controller is applied to the axial power distribution control in a pressurized water reactor. The reactor dynamics model used for computer simulations is a two-point xenon oscillation model in which the reactor core is axially divided into two regions (upper and lower halves) and each region is assumed to have a single input and a single output and to be coupled with the other region. It is shown from numerical simulations that the proposed controller exhibits very fast tracking responses due to the step and ramp changes of axial target shape and also works well in a time-varying parameter condition.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 153-161","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0352109872","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808380","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808380","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","148"

In the context of pin removal reactivity effects in a light water reactor assembly, for example, it is illustrative to carry out, for any arbitrary localized material composition perturbation, a decomposition of the total effect into individual space- and energy-dependent contributions of the different unit cells in the assembly. If this decomposition is normalized to +100% in the case of a positive reactivity effect and to -100% in the case of a negative reactivity effect, an importance map is established that indicates the relative contribution (in percent) of each individual contributing cell to the total reactivity effect caused by the localized material composition change. Such an importance map can be interpreted as a sensitivity matrix that quantifies the final discrepancy in a calculated reactivity effect, with respect to its reference value, as a weighted sum of the complete collection of cell-wise data and/or modeling discrepancies. The current paper outlines the basic theory and gives certain practical applications of the proposed decomposition methodology. Thus, it is found that the developed methodology offers in-depth, quantitative explanations for calculational discrepancies observed in the analysis of fuel pin removal experiments conducted in the framework of the LWR-PROTEUS program at the Paul Scherrer Institute.","","","","","","United States","2004-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 148; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 162-171","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0353109873","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20808381","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20808381","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","148"

The program is dedicated to the physics studies of accelerator-driven systems in support of transmutation studies of minor actinides and long-lived fission products. It began in 1995 with the coupling of a Cf source in MASURCA and was followed by a commercial (d,T) source. In 2001, a specially constructed (d,D)/(d,T) neutron generator (GENEPI) was placed in MASURCA and the MUSE-4 program commenced.We describe the first phases of the MUSE-4 program, with data presented that were obtained up to about the summer of 2002. We present some results from the 'reference' configuration, which can operate at critical. We present traverses of measured fission reaction rates, with comparison to calculations. Also in the reference configuration, we performed activation foil measurements and present these results compared to calculations.Because a major objective of the MUSE program is to test and qualify methods of subcritical reactivity measurement, we have devoted a major portion of our studies to this area. We have used classical methods (rod drop, source multiplication) to attempt to measure the subcritical level. In these early phases we studied core configurations of around k{sub eff} = 0.995. Deeper subcriticality (k{sub eff} = 0.96) was achieved by inserting a safety rod.In addition to the methods mentioned above, we have devoted a lot of effort to pulse neutron source, fluctuation (Rossi-{alpha} and Feynman-{alpha}), and transfer function methods (e.g., cross-power spectral density).

The design explores the potential benefits of thorium-based fuel in actinide-burning cores, in particular in terms of the reduction of the large reactivity swing and enhancement of the small Doppler coefficient typical of fertile-free actinide burners. Reduced electricity production cost is pursued through a longer cycle length than that used for fertile-free burners and thus a higher capacity factor. It is shown that the concept can achieve a high transuranics destruction rate, which is only 20% lower than that of an accelerator-driven system with fertile-free fuel. The small negative fuel temperature reactivity coefficient, small positive coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, and negative core radial expansion coefficient provide self-regulating characteristics so that the reactor is capable of inherent shutdown during major transients without scram, as in the Integral Fast Reactor. This is confirmed by thermal-hydraulic analysis of several transients without scram, including primary coolant pump trip, station blackout, and reactivity step insertion, which showed that the reactor was able to meet all identified thermal limits. However, the benefits of high actinide consumption and small reactivity swing can be attained only if the uranium from the discharged fuel is separated and not recycled. This additional uranium separation step and thorium reprocessing significantly increase the fuel cycle costs. Because the higher fuel cycle cost has a larger impact on the overall cost of electricity than the savings from the higher capacity factor afforded through use of thorium, this concept appears less promising than the fertile-free actinide burners.","","","Idaho National Lab.

One possibility for transmutation of this material is the use of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is a combination of uranium and plutonium oxides. MOX fuel is used in nuclear reactors worldwide, so a large experience base for its use already exists. However, to limit implementation of SNF transmutation to only a fraction of the LWRs in the United States with a reasonable number of license extensions, full cores of MOX fuel probably are required. This paper addresses the logistics associated with using LWRs for this mission and the design issues required for full cores of MOX fuel. Given limited design modifications, this paper shows that neutronic safety conditions can be met for full cores of MOX fuel with up to 8.3 wt% of plutonium.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 171-180","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0944011709","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837871","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837871","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

Near such components there is significant discrepancy between velocity predictions and measurements. Even in rod bundles without flow deflectors, the turbulence predictions of standard k-[curly epsilon] models show significant discrepancy with measurements. These discrepancies are greater near components that cause flow deflections. Turbulence generated by vanes on spacer grids significantly enhances thermal mixing.

Newly developed heat transfer models are discussed that take into account both the local heat flux on a heated surface, which is characterized by the boiling regime, and the average critical heat flux (CHF) on a heated surface, which is restricted by countercurrent flow limitation (CCFL), including the effect of an inclination angle of the gap. The models were incorporated into the mechanistic detailed code RELAP/SCDAPSIM/MOD3.2. The local heat flux was applied to the outer surface of the debris and the inner surface of the RPV wall. The average CHF was evaluated through the CCFL phenomenon at each junction in the gap. For the assessment, an analysis of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute's ALPHA test was performed. The calculated peak temperature response of the vessel showed good agreement with the experimental data. It was validated that the new models effectively simulate the coolability in a narrow gap, which could be an effective means of cooling the vessel wall and thereby preventing RPV failure, as was demonstrated in the TMI-2 accident.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 191-201","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0946011711","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837873","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

The test bundle consists of 21 fuel rod simulators, 20 of which are heated electrically over a length of 1024 mm. The center rod is either an unheated fuel rod simulator or a control rod containing B{sub 4}C absorber material. The Zircaloy-4 rod cladding and the grid spacers are identical to those used in pressurized water reactors, whereas the fuel is represented by ZrO{sub 2} pellets. After transient heating to 2000 K and above, cooling of the test bundle is accomplished by injecting water or steam into the bottom of the test section. Hydrogen generation during cooling was found either to stop almost immediately or to increase for a certain time. Increased hydrogen generation was found in those tests in which local melting occurred, probably as a result of oxidation of the melt containing zirconium. Hydrogen release in the flooding/cooling phase of all QUENCH experiments performed so far seems to be insensitive to the coolant (water or steam) under similar test conditions.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 202-215","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0947011712","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837874","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837874","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

In particular, it is shown that such models could be successfully applied to identification of loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCAs). This is demonstrated for LOCA scenarios for a boiling water reactor. Two classes of inverse models are discussed: local models valid only in a selected neighborhood of an unknown element in the data set, representing a state of a considered object, and global models, in the form of partially unilateral models, valid over the whole learning data set. An interesting and useful property of local inverse models is that they can be considered as example-based models, i.e., models that are spanned on particular sets of pattern data. It is concluded that the optimal diagnostic method should combine the advantages of both models, i.e., the high quality of results obtained from a local inverse model and the information about the confidence interval for the expected output provided by a partially unilateral model.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 216-226","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0948011713","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837875","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837875","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"
"Software Safety Analysis of Digital Protection System Requirements Using a Qualitative Formal Method","Lee, Jang-Soo; Kwon, Kee-Choon; Cha, Sung-Deok","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COMPUTER CODES; FAILURES; FAULT TREE ANALYSIS; HAZARDS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; REACTOR SAFETY; REACTOR SHUTDOWN; SAFETY ANALYSIS","The safety analysis of requirements is a key problem area in the development of software for the digital protection systems of a nuclear power plant. When specifying requirements for software of the digital protection systems and conducting safety analysis, engineers find that requirements are often known only in qualitative terms and that existing fault-tree analysis techniques provide little guidance on formulating and evaluating potential failure modes. A framework for the requirements engineering process is proposed that consists of a qualitative method for requirements specification, called the qualitative formal method (QFM), and a safety analysis method for the requirements based on causality information, called the causal requirements safety analysis (CRSA). CRSA is a technique that qualitatively evaluates causal relationships between software faults and physical hazards. This technique, extending the qualitative formal method process and utilizing information captured in the state trajectory, provides specific guidelines on how to identify failure modes and the relationship among them. The QFM and CRSA processes are described using shutdown system 2 of the Wolsong nuclear power plants as the digital protection system example.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-239","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0949011714","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837876","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

The combination of feedforward and feedback control techniques complement each other in that robust control offers guaranteed closed-loop stability in the presence of uncertainties, and optimized feedforward offers an approach to achieving performance that is sometimes limited by overly conservative robust feedback control. The design approach taken in this work combines these techniques by first designing robust feedback control. Alternative methods for specifying a low-order linear model and uncertainty specifications, while seeking as much performance as possible, are discussed and evaluated. To achieve desired performance characteristics, the optimized feedforward control is then computed by using the nominal nonlinear plant model that incorporates the robust feedback control.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 240-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0950011715","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837877","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837877","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

Consistent with the BWR experience, the dominant nuclide contributing to the SCWR coolant radioactivity at full power is {sup 16}N, which is produced by an (n,p) reaction on {sup 16}O. In this paper the production and decay of {sup 16}N in the SCWR coolant circuit along with the shielding requirements imposed on the BOP are analyzed and compared with those in a BWR with a similar thermal power rating. A simple control-mass approach is adopted in which the {sup 16}N inventory in a unit mass of coolant is tracked as the coolant flows in the SCWR and BWR primary systems, which are divided into several compartments (e.g., core, lower plenum, downcomer, etc.) of known volume, mass flow rate, and neutron flux. The values of the neutron flux and (n,p) cross section in the SCWR and BWR cores are calculated by means of full-length radially reflected Monte Carlo eigenvalue models of the SCWR and BWR fuel assemblies. The results are as follows: The {sup 16}N activities in the steam lines of the BWR with normal water chemistry, in the BWR with hydrogen water chemistry, and in the SCWR are about 40, 180, and 380 {mu}Ci/g, respectively. The calculated BWR values compare well with the trends and ranges found in the literature. The SCWR {sup 16}N concentration is significantly higher than that in the BWR for the following four reasons:1. The coolant transit time in the SCWR core is about twice that in the BWR core.2. The neutron flux is higher in the SCWR because of the higher power density.3. The slow coolant pass in the water rods produces a significant {sup 16}N activity at the SCWR core inlet.4. In the SCWR all the {sup 16}N generated in the core is sent to the steam lines because there is no recirculation within the vessel.A simple gamma attenuation model shows that the higher {sup 16}N activity in the SCWR results in shielding requirements only up to 10% higher than for the BWR with hydrogen water chemistry. However, because of the higher SCWR electric power, the specific shielding costs per unit of electric power associated with {sup 16}N are expected to be similar to or better than that for BWRs.","","","","","","United States","2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 269-283","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0952011716","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837878","","Nuclear Technology","2","147"

For some materials, it is not safe to assume that in-reactor spectral variations are small and of no consequence. This point is illustrated using calculations for fusion-relevant materials that were irradiated in the Fast Flux Test Facility-Materials Open Test Assembly (FFTF-MOTA) over a wide range of in-core and out of core positions spanning two and a half orders of magnitude in dpa rate. It is shown that although both the neutron spectrum and flux changes, the spectral effectiveness factor, dpa/1022 n/cm2 (E &gt; 0.1 MeV), remains remarkably constant over this range. The transmutation rate per dpa can vary strongly, however.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Use of Thoria-Urania Fuels in PWRs: A General Review of a NERI Project to Assess Feasible Core Designs, Economics, Fabrication Methods, In-Pile Thermal/Mechanical Behavior, and Waste Form Characteristics","MacDonald, Philip E; Lee, Chan Bock","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; ACCIDENTS; BURNUP; DESIGN; FABRICATION; FUEL CYCLE; MANUFACTURING; PERFORMANCE; PLUTONIUM; PWR TYPE REACTORS; REACTIVITY; SAFETY; SPENT FUELS; THORIUM; THORIUM OXIDES; TRANSMUTATION; URANIUM; URANIUM DIOXIDE; WASTE FORMS","This paper provides an introduction to and a summary of the remaining papers in this issue of Nuclear Technology. The papers in this issue present the important results from a U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored Nuclear Engineering Research Initiative (NERI) project to study the efficacy of the thorium-uranium dioxide (ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}) once-through fuel cycle in current light water reactors. The project addressed fuel cycle neutronics and economics; ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} fuel manufacturing; the in-pile thermal/mechanical behavior of ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} fuel during normal, off-normal, and accident conditions; and the long-term stability of ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} waste. Results from this work show that a small-scale separation of the uranium and thorium will enhance the fuel reactivity and achievable burnup from uranium-thorium dioxide fuels. Under conditions that meet the thermal requirements in present pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a properly designed microheterogeneous fuel will have more reactivity than all-uranium fuel, and the overall production of plutonium is significantly reduced. The use of thorium as a host for actinide fuels when PWRs are used for actinide transmutation was also explored. It was also determined that there were no fundamental obstacles to converting the current plants that manufacture uranium oxide-only fuel to a mixed ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} fuel. Also, the in-service and transient thermal and mechanical performance of homogeneous ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}-based fuels with respect to safety is generally equal to or better than that of all-uranium fuel. Furthermore, a mixed thorium-uranium dioxide spent fuel appears to be a much more stable waste form than uranium oxide spent fuel.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-7","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0931011700","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837862","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837862","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"

However, priming the thorium cycle with {sup 235}U is necessary, and the {sup 235}U fraction in the uranium must be limited to below 20% to minimize proliferation concerns. Thus, a once-through thorium-uranium dioxide (ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}) fuel cycle of no less than 25% uranium becomes necessary for normal pressurized water reactor (PWR) operating cycle lengths. Spatial separation of the uranium and thorium parts of the fuel can improve the achievable burnup of the thorium-uranium fuel designs through more effective breeding of {sup 233}U from the {sup 232}Th. Focus is on microheterogeneous fuel designs for PWRs, where the spatial separation of the uranium and thorium is on the order of a few millimetres to a few centimetres, including duplex pellet, axially microheterogeneous fuel, and a checkerboard of uranium and thorium pins. A special effort was made to understand the underlying reactor physics mechanisms responsible for enhancing the achievable burnup at spatial separation of the two fuels. The neutron spectral shift was identified as the primary reason for the enhancement of burnup capabilities. Mutual resonance shielding of uranium and thorium is also a factor; however, it is small in magnitude. It is shown that the microheterogeneous fuel can achieve higher burnups, by up to 15%, than the reference all-uranium fuel. However, denaturing of the {sup 233}U in the thorium portion of the fuel with small amounts of uranium significantly impairs this enhancement. The denaturing is also necessary to meet conventional PWR thermal limits by improving the power share of the thorium region at the beginning of fuel irradiation. Meeting thermal-hydraulic design requirements by some of the microheterogeneous fuels while still meeting or exceeding the burnup of the all-uranium case is shown to be potentially feasible. However, the large power imbalance between the uranium and thorium regions creates several design challenges, such as higher fission gas release and cladding temperature gradients. A reduction of plutonium generation by a factor of 3 in comparison with all-uranium PWR fuel using the same initial {sup 235}U content was estimated. In contrast to homogeneously mixed U-Th fuel, microheterogeneous fuel has a potential for economic performance comparable to the all-UO{sub 2} fuel provided that the microheterogeneous fuel incremental manufacturing costs are negligibly small.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 20-36","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0933011702","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837864","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837864","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"

Focus is on the fuel economics of the thorium-based cycle for light water reactors (LWRs). Analyses show that the neutronic behavior of a mixed thorium and uranium dioxide (Th + U)O{sub 2} core in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) will not be significantly different from that of a UO{sub 2} core. This implies that homogeneous (Th + U)O{sub 2} fuel can be used in PWRs instead of the current UO{sub 2} fuel without any significant mechanical modification of the fuel design and without any change in the nuclear design limits. However, homogeneous (Th + U)O{sub 2} has not shown any economic advantage over UO{sub 2} fuel when current fuel management strategies are used. Thus, alternative applications of homogeneous (Th + U)O{sub 2} fuel in LWRs have been investigated to enhance the economics of the thorium fuel cycle. Specifically, thorium-uranium fuel with a {sup 235}U enrichment significantly &lt;19.5 wt%, mixed cores of both duplex (Th + U)O{sub 2} and UO{sub 2} fuel assemblies, and use of homogeneous thorium-uranium fuel in small-to-medium PWRs with a 5-yr cycle length have been investigated. The proposed alternatives result in far better fuel economics than the homogeneous thorium-uranium fuel cycle. However, the proposed alternatives do not show the economic merit of thorium-based fuel options for existing LWRs as compared to the UO{sub 2} fuel option. However, the inclusion of spent-fuel disposal costs in the fuel cost estimate makes (Th + U)O{sub 2} fuel competitive with UO{sub 2} fuel. In the case of a spent-fuel disposal cost higher than 700 US$/kg HM, the long-lived core with better economic potential than the UO{sub 2}-fueled core may be realized with the homogeneous (Th + U)O{sub 2} fuel.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0934011703","10.13182/NT03-30","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","20837865","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837865","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"

Destruction rates and residual amounts of Pu and MA in the fuel used for transmutation are examined. In particular, sensitivity of these two parameters to the fuel lattice hydrogen to heavy metal (H/HM) ratio and to the fuel composition was systematically investigated. All burnup calculations were performed using CASMO4, the fuel assembly burnup code. The results indicate that up to 1000 kg of reactor-grade Pu can be burned in Th-based fuel assemblies per gigawatt (electric) year. Up to 75% of initial Pu can be destroyed per passage through reactor core. Addition of MA to the fuel mixture degrades the burning efficiency. The theoretically achievable limit for total transuranium (TRU) destruction per passage through the core is 50%. Efficient MA and Pu destruction in Th-based fuel generally requires a higher degree of neutron moderation and, therefore, higher fuel lattice H/HM ratio than typically used in the current generation of PWRs. Reactivity coefficients evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of designing a Th-Pu-MA fueled core with negative Doppler and moderator temperature coefficients. Introduction of TRU-containing fuels to a PWR core inevitably leads to lower control material worths and smaller delayed-neutron yields than with conventional UO{sub 2} cores. Therefore, a major challenge associated with the introduction of Th-TRU fuels to PWRs will be the design of the whole core and reactor control features to ensure safe reactor operation.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 53-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0935011704","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837866","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837866","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"

The design meets current thermal-hydraulic and safety criteria. Such an assembly would have enough reactivity to achieve three cycles of operation. The pin power distribution indicates a fairly level distribution across the assembly, avoiding hot spots near guide tubes, corners, and other sections where excessive power would create significant loss to thermal-hydraulic margins.This work examined a number of physics and core safety analysis parameters that impact the operation and safety of power reactors. Such parameters as moderator coefficients of reactivity, Doppler coefficients, soluble boron worth, control rod worth, prompt neutron lifetime, and delayed-neutron fractions were considered. These in turn were used to examine reactor behavior during a number of operational conditions, transients, and accidents. Such conditions as shutdown from power with one rod stuck out, steam-line break accident, feedwater line break, loss of coolant flow, locked rotor accidents, control rod ejection accidents, and anticipated transients without scram (ATWSs) were examined.The analysis of selected reactor transients demonstrated that it is feasible to license and safely operate a reactor fueled with plutonium-thorium blended fuel. In most cases analyzed, the thorium mixture had less-severe consequences than those for a core comprising low-enriched uranium fuel. In the analyzed cases where the consequences were more severe, they were still within acceptable limits. The ATWS accident condition requires more analysis.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 69-83","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0936011705","10.13182/NT147-69","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","20837867","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837867","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"

The goals of this mono-recycling strategy or 'twice through fuel cycle' are to transmute the great majority of the long lived actinides in existing LWRs and to discharge a fuel form that is a very robust waste form and whose isotopic content is very proliferation resistant. The incorporation of plutonium into a ThO{sub 2} or yttria-stablized zirconia fertile-free matrix results in the consumption of already-separated plutonium without breeding significant additional {sup 239}Pu. The minor actinides (i.e., neptunium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, etc.) are also included in the ThO{sub 2} or fertile-free transmuter fuel rods to further reduce the overall long-term radiotoxicity of the fuel cycle. Our analyses have shown that thorium-based or fertile-free fuels can reduce the amount of {sup 239}Pu needing further transmutation or going to a repository by {approx}90%. Also, thorium-based fuels produce a mixture of plutonium isotopes high in {sup 238}Pu.

These fuels offer the possibility for increased proliferation resistance and a reduction in the stockpile of weapons-grade and reactor-grade PuO{sub 2} as well as being a more stable waste form. The behavior is described for three different designs of ThO{sub 2}-based fuels: a homogeneous mixture of ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}, a microheterogeneous arrangement of the ThO{sub 2} and UO{sub 2}, and a homogeneous mixture of ThO{sub 2}-PuO{sub 2}. The behavior was calculated with widely known LWR analysis tools extended for ThO{sub 2}-based fuels: (a) MATPRO for calculating material properties, (b) FRAPCON-3 for calculating in-service fuel temperature and fission-gas release, (c) VIPRE-01 for calculating the possibility for departure from nucleate boiling, (d) HEATING7 for calculating in-service two-dimensional temperature distributions in microheterogeneous fuel, (e) SCDAP/RELAP5-3D for calculating the transient reactor system behavior and fuel behavior during loss-of-coolant accidents, and (f) FRAP-T6 for calculating the vulnerability of the cladding to cracking due to swelling of the fuel during hypothetical reactivity-initiated accidents.The analytical tools accounted for the following differences in ThO{sub 2}-based fuels relative to 100% UO{sub 2} fuel: (a) higher thermal conductivity, lower density and volumetric heat capacity, less thermal expansion, and higher melting point; (b) higher fission-gas production for {sup 233}U fission than {sup 235}U fission, but a lower gas diffusion coefficient in the ThO{sub 2} than in the UO{sub 2}; (c) less plutonium accumulation at the rim of the fuel pellets; (d) greater decay heat; (e) microheterogeneous arrangement of fuel; and (f) more-negative moderator temperature and Doppler coefficients and a smaller delayed-neutron fraction. The newly developed models for ThO{sub 2} were checked against data from the light water breeder reactor program. Calculations by these analytical tools indicate that the in-service and transient performance of homogeneous ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}-based fuels with respect to safety is generally equal to or better than that of 100% UO{sub 2} fuel. The in-service and transient temperatures in the most promising neutronic design of microheterogeneous ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2}-based fuel are greater than the temperatures in 100% UO{sub 2} fuel but are still within normal LWR safety limits. The reactor kinetics parameters for ThO{sub 2}-PuO{sub 2}-based fuel cause a higher transient reactor power for some postulated accidents, but in general, the margin of safety for ThO{sub 2}-PuO{sub 2} fuels is equal to or greater than that in 100% UO{sub 2} fuels.","","","","","","United States","2004-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 147; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 120-139","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0940013467","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840210","","Nuclear Technology","1","147"
"Effect of Replacing Helium with a Liquid Metal in the Fuel-Cladding Gap on Fission Gas Release","Wongsawaeng, Doonyapong; Olander, Donald R","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BISMUTH; CLADDING; FISSION PRODUCT RELEASE; FISSION PRODUCTS; GRAIN BOUNDARIES; HELIUM; LIQUID METALS; MELTING POINTS; NUCLEAR FUELS; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; URANIUM DIOXIDE; WATER COOLED REACTORS; WATER MODERATED REACTORS","In light water reactors, a helium-filled gap between the fuel and the cladding accommodates fuel swelling and cladding creepdown. However, the low thermal conductivity of helium results in a large {delta}T over the gap before closure occurs. To remedy this situation, Wright et al. proposed the use of a liquid metal (LM) bond in the fuel-cladding gap. The LM (33 wt% each of lead, tin, and bismuth) was chosen for its low melting point ({approx}120 deg. C), its lack of chemical reactivity with UO{sub 2} and water, and its high thermal conductivity ({approx}100 times that of He). The thermal resistance of the LM-bonded gap is nil.Prior to closure of a helium-bonded gap, the centerline fuel temperature can be hundreds of degrees hotter than that with an LM-bonded gap at the same linear heat rating. Since the diffusion of fission gas atoms depends strongly upon temperature, it is expected that with the high thermal conductivity pellet-cladding gap, the incubation time to fission gas release should be considerably delayed. A modified Booth Sphere model, which takes into account re-solution, is adopted. The amount of fission gas atoms collected at the grain boundary is calculated using realistic time-temperature histories taken from a recent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission review. The saturation value of gas at the grain boundary proposed by Dowling to fission gas release is adopted. The results show that although the temperature in the LM-bonded case is substantially lower than the He-filled case when the gap is open, the temperatures in the two cases equalize when the gap vanishes. Correspondingly, the two cases exhibit a comparable amount of fission gas at the grain boundary. Calculated differences between the times to saturation with LM and He in the gap are as high as {approx}1 yr and as low as 1 to 2 days.","","","","","","United States","2004-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 211-220","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0921011693","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837855","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837855","","Nuclear Technology","3","146"

WISE does not perturb the radiological equilibrium by minimizing transuranium and long-lived-fission product wastes. The main characteristic of WISE is the use of MF systems and of a feed-and-bleed fuel cycle strategy. Irradiated fuel together with fission products always remains inside a WISE core. This implies no release of waste until fuel reserves are available. After the fuel reserves are exhausted, an on-line reprocessing technology can be applied in order to minimize waste.","","","","","","United States","2004-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 230-243","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0923011694","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837856","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837856","","Nuclear Technology","3","146"

This information is essential for the resolution of Generic Safety Issue-191 on the safety margins of the ECCS systems subsequent to debris accumulation and head loss at the screen.Tests were carried out on a simulated containment floor in the laboratory to determine the flow velocities in which different types of objects including insulation debris would move along the floor. CFD analyses were independently carried out to determine the flow velocities in the containment under different flow rates and break locations. It was shown that the flow regimes predicted by the CFD analyses compare well with the experimentally observed movement along the floor.

The computational benchmark calculation was performed for the CANDU end shield system, which has shown that the conventional method produces results consistent with the reference calculations as far as the total dose rate and total heat deposition rate are concerned. Second, the primary shield system analysis was performed for the DUPIC fuel core based on the power distribution obtained from the time-average core model, and the results have shown that the dose rates and heat deposition rates through the primary shield of the DUPIC fuel core are not much different from those of the natural uranium core because the power levels on the core periphery are similar for both cores.

The costs of the use of DepMo have been assessed, and it was concluded that these costs can be justified for the transmutation of the actinides neptunium, americium, and plutonium.","","","","","","United States","2004-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 325-331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0930013465","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840208","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840208","","Nuclear Technology","3","146"

Such knowledge includes not only the technical competencies required by the nature of the technology and particular engineering designs, but also the softer competencies associated with effective management, communication and teamwork. Recent studies have shown that there has been a loss of corporate knowledge and memory. Both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge must be passed on to the next generation of workers in the industry to ensure a quality workforce. New and different techniques may be required to ensure timely and effective knowledge retention and transfer. The IAEA prepared a report on this subject. The main conclusions from the report regarding strategies for managing the aging workforce are included. Also included are main conclusions from the report regarding the capture an d preservation of mission critical knowledge, and the effective transfer of this knowledge to the next generation of NPP personnel. The nuclear industry due to its need for well-documented procedures, specifications, design basis, safety analyses, etc., has a greater fraction of its mission critical knowledge as explicit knowledge than do many other industries. This facilitates the task of knowledge transfer. For older plants in particular, there may be a need for additional efforts to transfer tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge to support major strategic initiatives such as plant license extensions/renewals, periodic safety reviews, major plant upgrades, and plant specific control room simulator development. The challenge in disseminating explicit knowledge is to make employees aware that it is available and provide easy access in formats and forms that are usable. Tacit knowledge is more difficult to identify and disseminate. The challenge is to identify what can be converted to explicit knowledge and to create an environment where tacit knowledge is routinely shared and disseminated. Many NPP operating organizations have taken positive and decisive steps to address the aging workforce situation. A number of these actions are described in the report.","","","International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna (Austria)","none (US)","","United States","2004-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: May-June 2004 issue; PBD: 1 Jun 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0403737","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","827926","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/827926","","Nuclear Plant Journal","3","22"

This work is part of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) contribution to the High Performance Light Water Reactor (HPLWR) European Union project and aims at assessing the capabilities of the code to model the reflooding phenomena in a tight hexagonal lattice (which was one of the core geometries considered at the time for an HPLWR) following a hypothetical loss-of-coolant accident scenario. Even though the latest version of the code has as a default the new PSI reflood model developed by the author, which was tested and assessed against reflooding data obtained at standard light water reactor lattices, this work shows that for tight lattices, the code underpredicts the peak clad temperatures measured during a series of reflooding experiments performed at the NEPTUN-III tight-lattice heater rod bundle facility. The reasons for these differences are discussed, and the (possible) changes needed in the framework of RELAP5/MOD3.3 for improving the modeling of reflooding in tight lattices are investigated.","","","","","","United States","2004-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 99-121","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0912011687","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837849","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837849","","Nuclear Technology","2","146"

In this code, each hexagonal subassembly duct is represented by a folded thin plate structure divided into a user-specified number of shell elements so that the interduct contact forms and the cross-sectional distortion effect of each duct are properly taken into account. In this paper, the numerical model of the ARKAS cellule code is introduced, and the analytical results for two validation problems are presented. From a single duct compaction analysis, the first validation problem, it is clarified that the new analytical model is applicable to simulating the change of duct compaction stiffness that depends on the loading conditions such as the loading pad forms and the number of contact faces. The second validation analysis has been conducted by comparison with the experimental values obtained by the National Nuclear Corporation Limited in the United Kingdom using the core restraint uniplanar experimental rig (CRUPER), an ex-reactor rig in which a cluster of 91 short ducts is compressed by 30 movable peripheral rams toward the center of the cluster in seven stages. The analysis clarified that the predictions obtained using ARKAS cellule agree well with the measured ram loads and interwrapper gap widths during the compaction sequence. One may conclude that ARKAS cellule is valid for quantitative analysis of the core mechanical behavior and will be particularly useful for the evaluation of transient deformation of core assemblies during accidents in which the distortion of loading pads have important effects on obtaining favorable reactivity feedback.","","","","","","United States","2004-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 131-142","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0914011689","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837851","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837851","","Nuclear Technology","2","146"

One way to reduce costs is to reduce the frequency of preventive maintenance and testing. However, these changes must be weighed against their impact on safety and stakeholder relations. We present a methodology that allows the evaluation of decision options using a number of objectives that include safety, economics, and stakeholder relations. First, the candidate decision options are screened to make sure that they satisfy the relevant regulatory requirements. The remaining options are evaluated using multiattribute utility theory. The results of the formal analysis include a ranking of the options according to their desirability as well as the major reasons that explain this ranking. These results are submitted to a deliberative process in which the decision makers scrutinize the results to ensure that they are meaningful. During the deliberation, new decision options may be formulated based on the insights that the formal analysis provides, as happened in the case study of this paper. This case study deals with the reduction in frequency of the containment integrated leak rate test of a boiling water reactor.","","","","","","United States","2004-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 181-198","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0918011691","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837853","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837853","","Nuclear Technology","2","146"

Maanshan is a typical Westinghouse PWR nuclear power plant (NPP) with large, dry containment. The severe accident management guideline (SAMG) of Maanshan NPP is developed based on the Westinghouse Owners Group (WOG) SAMG.The purpose of this work is to analyze the RCS injection strategy of PWR system in an overheated core condition. Power is assumed recovered as the vessel water level drops to the bottom of active fuel. The Modular Accident Analysis Program version 4.0.4 (MAAP4) code is chosen as a tool for analysis. A postulated station blackout sequence for Maanshan NPP is cited as a reference case for this analysis. The hot leg creep rupture occurs during the mitigation action with immediate injection after power recovery according to WOG SAMG, which is not desired. This phenomenon is not considered while developing the WOG SAMG. Two other RCS injection methods are analyzed by using MAAP4. The RCS injection strategy is modified in the Maanshan SAMG.

The structural behavior issues arising from the higher flow rate required to cool the fuel are assessed here, including buckling, vibrations, and potential wear problems. Five flow-induced vibration mechanisms are addressed: buckling instability, vortex-induced vibration, acoustic resonance, fluid-elastic instability, and turbulence-induced vibration. The structural behavior of the 17 x 17 traditional solid fuel array is compared with that of two types of annular fuels, a 15 x 15 array, and a 13 x 13 array.It is seen that the annular fuels are superior to the reference fuel in avoiding vibration-induced damage, even at a 50% increase in flow velocity above today's reactors. The higher resistance to vibration is mainly due to their relatively larger cross section area making them more rigid. The 13 x 13 annular fuel shows better structural performance than the 15 x 15 one due to its higher rigidity. Analysis of acoustic resonance of the inner channel cladding with pump blade passing frequencies showed that the acoustic frequencies are within 120% of the pulsation frequency. The annular fuel exhibits reduced impact, sliding, and fretting wear than the solid fuel, even at 150% flow rate of today's reactors.","","","","","","United States","2004-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 164-180","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0917013461","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840204","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840204","","Nuclear Technology","2","146"

If it is possible to ensure that the vessel lower head remains intact so that relocated core materials are retained within the vessel, the enhanced safety associated with these plants can reduce concerns about containment failure and associated risk. For example, the enhanced safety of the Westinghouse Advanced 600 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor (AP600), which relied upon External Reactor Vessel Cooling (ERVC) for in-vessel retention (IVR), resulted in the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) approving the design without requiring certain conventional features common to existing Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Accordingly, IVR of core melt is a key severe accident management strategy adopted by some operating nuclear power plants and proposed for some advanced light water reactors. However, it is not clear that currently-proposed methods to achieve ERVC will provide sufficient heat removal for higher power reactors. A US–Korean International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (INERI) project has been initiated in which the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Seoul National University (SNU), Pennsylvania State University (PSU), and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) will determine if IVR is feasible for reactors up to 1500 MWe.

The Be(n,{alpha}) reaction results in subsequent buildup of {sup 6}Li and {sup 3}He isotopes with large thermal neutron absorption cross sections causing poisoning of irradiated beryllium. The amount of the poison isotopes depends on the neutron flux level and spectrum. The high-flux MARIA reactor operated in Poland since 1975 consists of a beryllium matrix with fuel channels in cutouts of beryllium blocks. As the experimental determination of {sup 6}Li, {sup 3}H, and {sup 3}He content in the operational reactor is impossible, a systematic computational study of the effect of {sup 3}He and {sup 6}Li presence in beryllium blocks on MARIA reactor reactivity and power density distribution has been undertaken. The analysis of equations governing the transmutation has been done for neutron flux parameters typical for MARIA beryllium blocks. Study of the mutual influence of reactor operational parameters and the buildup of {sup 6}Li, {sup 3}H, and {sup 3}He in beryllium blocks has shown the necessity of a detailed spatial solution of transmutation equations in the reactor, taking into account the whole history of its operation. Therefore, fuel management calculations using the REBUS code with included chains for Be(n,{alpha})-initiated reactions have been done for the whole reactor lifetime. The calculated poisoning of beryllium blocks has been verified against the critical experiment of 1993. Finally, the current {sup 6}Li, {sup 3}H, and {sup 3}He contents, averaged for each beryllium block, have been calculated. The reactivity drop caused by this poisoning is {approx}7%.","","","","","","United States","2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 72-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0910013458","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840201","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840201","","Nuclear Technology","1","146"

The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the existence of hydrogen in an outside pipe on the amount of permeated deuterium through the pipe. It was found that the amount of permeated deuterium decreases by increasing the partial pressure of hydrogen in the outside pipe when the partial pressure of deuterium in the pipe is lower than 100 Pa and that of hydrogen in the outside pipe is larger than 10 kPa. The amount of permeated deuterium on counter permeation was predicted quantitatively by using an effectiveness factor for diffusivity of deuterium in metals and by taking into account the equilibrium state for hydrogen, deuterium, and HD molecules on the metal surface. From the results obtained in this study, it is supposed that the amount of tritium transferred from the primary circuit of the HTTR to the hydrogen production system will be reduced by the existence of high-pressure hydrogen in the catalyst pipe of the steam reformer.","","","","","","United States","2004-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 146; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 83-95","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0911013459","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840202","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840202","","Nuclear Technology","1","146"

The SSR is a new type of water rod in which a water level is naturally developed during operation and changed according to the coolant flow rate through the channel. By taking advantage of the large size of the ABWR-II bundle, the enhanced spectral shift operation by eight SSRs allows operation of the ABWR-II with all control rods withdrawn. In addition, the uranium-saving factor of 6 to 7% relative to the reference ABWR-II core with conventional water rods can be expected due to the greater effect of spectral shift. The combination of these advantages means the ABWR-II with SSRs should be an attractive alternative for the next-generation nuclear reactor.","","","","","","United States","2004-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 247-256","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0895011674","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837836","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837836","","Nuclear Technology","3","145"

This flexibility is due to an uncoupling between the parameters of cooling geometry and the parameters that characterize neutronic optimization (moderation ratio or heavy nuclide concentration and distribution).Among other advantageous features, an HTR core has a better neutron economy than a light water reactor (LWR) because there is much less parasitic capture in the moderator (capture cross section of graphite is 100 times less than the one of water), in internal structures, and in fission products (because of a harder spectrum).Moreover, thanks to the high strength of the coated particles, HTR fuels are able to reach very high burnups, far beyond the possibilities offered by other fuels (except the special case of molten salt reactors).These features make HTRs potentially interesting for closing the nuclear fuel cycle and stabilizing the plutonium inventory.A large number of fuel cycle studies are already available today on three main categories of fuel cycles involving HTRs: (a) high-enriched uranium cycle, based on thorium utilization as a fertile material and high-enriched uranium as a fissile material; (b) low-enriched uranium cycle (LEU), where only LEU is used (from 5 to 15%); (c) plutonium cycle based on the utilization of plutonium only as a fissile material, with (or without) fertile materials.Plutonium consumption at high burnups in HTRs has already been tested with encouraging results under the DRAGON project and at Peach Bottom. To maximize plutonium consumption, recent core studies have also been performed on plutonium HTR cores, with special emphasis on weapon-grade plutonium consumption. We complete the picture by a core study for an HTR burning reactor-grade plutonium. Limits in burnup due to core neutronics are investigated for this type of core.With these limits in mind, we study in some detail the Pu cycle in the special case of a reactor fleet made of a mixture of LWRs and HTRs. It is reasonable to assume that if HTRs are to be deployed on an industrial scale, they will coexist during a long period of time with already existing LWRs. The present paper investigates the symbiotic behavior of LWRs producing plutonium and of HTRs burning it.","","","","","","United States","2004-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 266-274","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0897011676","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837838","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837838","","Nuclear Technology","3","145"

The primary reactor auxiliary cooling system (PRACS) is prepared for the JNC concept to get sufficient heat removal capacity. During 2000 s after the transient, the outlet temperature shows increasing tendency up to the maximum temperature of 430 deg.

"A Proposed Method for the Determination of Leakage Rate for a Reactor Containment Vessel","Tries, Mark A; Bobek, Leo M","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AIR; CONTAINERS; CONTAINMENT; LEAKS; PRESSURE MEASUREMENT; TIME DEPENDENCE; WATER COOLED REACTORS","A method is presented for the determination of the leakage rate for containment vessels of water-cooled reactors. The method is applicable to Type A tests for which the containment vessel is pressurized to some initial overpressure, and subsequent measurements of absolute air pressure and temperature are made to determine the leakage rate. The proposed method incorporates the desirable features of the recommended method for the determination of the leakage rate, namely, that the measured data all have equal statistical weight, the leakage rate is not estimated using finite differences, and the leakage rate is normalized to the initial air content in the containment vessel. The major assumptions of the proposed method are incompressible airflow and a constant absolute air temperature. The proposed method is based on a reasonably accurate description of absolute dry air pressure over time, for which parameters are obtained using a linear regression technique on the transformed pressure measurements. Under the given assumptions the transformed pressure measurements are linear, and therefore, the proposed method avoids the drawback that is encountered in the recommended method of applying a linear model to nonlinear data. The pressure function then is used to determine the leakage rate as a function of time and the integral leakage rate for the duration of the test. Also, the method is readily adaptable to scaling the integral leakage rate to different initial air pressures in the containment vessel. In addition, the assumption of an incompressible airflow is considered to be reasonable for initial Mach numbers less than or equal to 0.4.","","","","","","United States","2004-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 319-323","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0902011679","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837841","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837841","","Nuclear Technology","3","145"
"An Experimental Study of Sweepout and Entrainment in the Advanced Reactor Downcomer","Yoon, Sang H; Suh, Kune Y","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; ACCIDENTS; AIR FLOW; CONTAINERS; COOLANTS; ENTRAINMENT; HELMHOLTZ INSTABILITY; INSPECTION; NOZZLES; POWER REACTORS; REYNOLDS NUMBER; STREAMS; TEST FACILITIES; TWO-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS; VISIBLE RADIATION; WATER","Sweepout from the water surface by gas (vapor or air) flow plays an important role in analyzing the mass and momentum transfer in the reactor downcomer of multidimensional geometry during a loss-of-coolant accident by decreasing the water level in the downcomer. The core water level will tend to decrease rapidly if a considerable amount of the entrained water stream and droplets pass through the break in lieu of flooding the reactor. The amount of entrained water is mostly determined by the interacting gas flow rate, the geometric condition, and the interfacial area between the gas and the water. The sweepout is observed to take place in three rather distinct regions: at the beginning of oscillation, at the full wave, and at the wave peak (droplet separation). The beginning of oscillation normally occurs as a result of the Helmholtz instability, which is defined in terms of the difference between the gas and the liquid velocities. The horizontal water surface is waved greatly before the gas flow reaches the critical point of droplet detachment. In the full-wave region, the droplets from the rough wave are swept into the gas flow and driven to the break. The water stream and droplets near the wave-peak region pass through the break at extremely high velocities.In view of these observations this paper investigates the relation between the gas flow rate and the amount of bypass as a function of time. The test facility was constructed in a 1/10 linear scaled-down model from the 1400-MW(electric) Advanced Power Reactor 1400 (APR1400), which has four direct vessel injection lines, four cold legs, and two hot legs. The air was injected through the three intact cold legs and passed through the broken cold leg. The sweepout was visualized from the acrylic test vessel. When the water level was located at the bottom of the break nozzle, the amount of bypass increased at the high Reynolds number of the gas. In the test the downcomer water level rapidly decreased for the initial minute. Then, given the Reynolds number of the gas, the sweepout hardly occurred as the water level approached the critical point 10 min into the test. So far, the experiment and the analysis for the sweepout have been limited to small annuli, flat plates, and T-junctions, which yielded the two-dimensional flow field. The current experimental results shed light on the flow mechanism and the semiempirical relations for the three-dimensional sweepout in a large-diameter annulus such as the reactor downcomer. The sweepout and entrainment are physically understood by visual inspection of flow in the downcomer. An engineering correlation is developed to predict the multidimensional sweepout and entrainment in the annular downcomer.","","","","","","United States","2004-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 298-310","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0900013456","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840199","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840199","","Nuclear Technology","3","145"

A Generation IV-capable system must have superior sustainability, safety and reliability, and economic cost advantages in comparison with third generation light water reactors (LWRs). A gas core reactor (GCR) with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power converter and cascading power cycle forms the basis for a Generation IV concept that is expected to set the upper performance limits in sustainability and power conversion efficiency among all existing and proposed fission powered systems. A gaseous core reactor delivering thousands of megawatt fission power acts as the heat source for a high-temperature MHD power converter. A uranium tetrafluoride fuel mix, with {approx}95% mol fraction helium gas, provides a stable working fluid for the primary MHD Brayton cycle. The hot working fluid exiting a topping cycle MHD generator has sufficient heat to drive a conventional helium Brayton cycle with 35% thermal efficiency as well as a superheated steam Rankine cycle, with up to 40% efficiency, which recovers the waste heat from the intermediate Brayton cycle. A combined cycle efficiency of close to 70% can be achieved with only a modest MHD topping cycle efficiency. The high-temperature direct-energy conversion capability of an MHD dynamo combined with an already sophisticated steam-powered turbine industry knowledge base allows the cascading cycle design to achieve breakthrough first-law energy efficiencies previously unheard of in the nuclear power industry. Although simple in concept, the gas core reactor design has not achieved the state of technological maturity that established high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and high-temperature molten salt core reactors have pioneered. However, the GCR-MHD concept has considerable promise; for example, like molten salt reactors the fuel is continuously cycled, allowing high burnup, continuous burning of actinides, and hence greatly improved fuel utilization. The fuel inventory is two orders of magnitude lower than LWRs of comparable power output, and fissile plutonium production is likewise lower than in spent LWR fuel. Besides these features, specific GCR-MHD design challenges such as fission enhanced gas conductivity of the MHD partially ionized gas, GCR safety issues and related engineering problems are discussed.","","","","","","United States","2004-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 311-318","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0901013457","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840200","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840200","","Nuclear Technology","3","145"

His view is that in order for new nuclear power plants to be considered, they must be economically competitive when compared to other baseload generation alternatives. With respect to capital cost, the industry has informally conveyed that overnight capital costs need to be below the range of $1,000-$1,200/kWE. Reactor vendors are working to reduce their first of a kind engineering costs to meet this capital cost threshold. Financing is then the next significant factor, which is complicated by whether the plant is being constructed in a regulated environment where the power company has the security of a regulated rate of return or as a merchant plant where the company assumes the risks and benefits of the proposed investment. With respect to operating and maintenance costs, the nuclear power industry has been dedicated to reducing costs while maintaining or improving safety. There are sound plans for spent fuel and high-level waste disposal, but there is a need to improve public confidence in transportation aspects. Regarding making new plants more attractive to investors, the risk factor has been a concern. The new Part 52 process is designed to help by requiring safety design issues to be identified and resolved prior to the issuance of the Combined Operating License (COL) process. While the revised process appears to be more acceptable from an investment risk perspective, there remains uncertainty in the fact that it has never been demonstrated. Skepticism, too, still exists with regard to building plants on schedule and within budget. Mr. Crane concludes that certain incentives will be needed for ''first movers'' in nuclear investment. These could include production tax credits, investment tax credits, government loan guarantees, and power purchase agreements. Despite the challenges facing new plant development, his view is that there is not a better time than now to consider new reactors. The first, most strategic way for the government to ensure new nuclear construction is to establish a national energy platform that recognizes the contribution of nuclear power. Actions are needed too in the reactor design and regulatory process. The best-suited technology is the advanced light water reactor designs. In particular, the Westinghouse AP1000 and the General Electric ESBSW look to be the most promising. Nuclear plants can also help comply with the Kyoto protocol. It is estimated that in 2002, the 103 nuclear units in the U.S. prevented 189.5 million metric tons of carbon, 2.28 million short tons of sulfur dioxide, and 1.39 million short tons of nitrogen oxides. Additional plants only serve to increase these amounts, but all energy sources must strive toward efficiencies to ensure diversification. Future staffing issues are also a critical element for new and existing plants. Not only are nuclear engineers essential, many other skill sets are required to operate and maintain facilities. It is important that we encourage young people to study math and science and it is important that they understand the wide variety of career opportunities available within the nuclear power industry. The interview ends with comments regarding Exelon's pursuit of an early site permit (ESP).","","","Exelon Nuclear (US)","none (US)","","United States","2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Mar-Apr 2004 issue; PBD: 1 Mar 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-39, 50 RANGE","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0402629","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","825400","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/825400","","Nuclear Plant Journal","2","22"

Regarding nuclear power plant economics, he discusses what improvements should be made in the construction cost reduction area and in operation and maintenance costs to make costs more viable. Regarding public relations, he stated that regaining public trust is the most important today. Information disclosure to the public and two-way communication activities (direct discussions, public hearings, etc.) are being expanded. To improve economic competitiveness, two points are important: electric power generating cost reduction through stable operation and a legal framework that eliminates uncertainty by collecting funds to promote plutonium recycling and back-end costs. In the construction of a new plant, the coexistence of quality assurance and a shortened construction period are essential. It is necessary to decide on the design and on the construction process as early as possible. In Japan, 3D-computer aided design is used as the key technology for efficient construction. Moreover, in order to improve project management abilities, computer software aimed at process control and design information management has been developed using past construction experiences. The software will be applied to the next construction project. He cited the reasons why government support is essential for new plant construction, and in what ways existing nuclear power plants in Japan have improved in the last five years. As far as the best available technology for constructing plants, he recommended the large-block construction method and the all-weather construction method as effective construction technologies. The advanced boiling water reactor is best suited for plant construction in the future. Regarding human resources for the future, he noted the use of digital databases with several components, a Systematic Approach to Training method for reactor operators and other plant personnel, and the use of retired professionals to enhance technical skills and troubleshoot problems in advance.","","","Nuclear Power Division, Tokyo Electric Power Company (JP)","none (US)","","United States","2004-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Mar-Apr 2004 issue; PBD: 1 Mar 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 40-41","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0402630","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","825401","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/825401","","Nuclear Plant Journal","2","22"

Three- and four-equation reactor core models were used to examine three transients following tests described in acceptance test procedures: scram, loss of feedwater flow, and closure of main isolation valves. The three-equation model consists of water and steam mixture momentum, including mass and energy balances. The four-equation model is based on liquid and gas phase mass balances, together with a drift-flux approach for the analysis of phase separation. Analysis of the models showed that the scram transient was slightly different for three- and four-equation models. The drift-flux effects can explain such differences. Regarding the loss-of-feedwater transient, the predicted steam flow after scram is larger for the three-equation model. Finally, for the transient related to the closure of main steam isolation valves, the three-equation model provides slightly different results for the pressure change, which affects reactor level behavior.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 150-162","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0887011666","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837828","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837828","","Nuclear Technology","2","145"

The thermal-hydraulic module VIPRE-02, the two-fluid version of the one-fluid code VIPRE-01, has been the object of relatively few assessment studies, and the work presented seeks to reduce this lacuna. The priority has been given to the assessment of the void fraction prediction due to the importance of the void feedback on the core power generation. The assessment data are experimental void fractions obtained from X- and gamma-ray attenuation techniques applied at assembly-averaged as well as subchannel level for both steady-state and transient conditions. These experiments are part of the NUPEC (Japan) program where full-scale boiling water reactor (BWR) assemblies of different types, including assemblies with part-length rods, and pressurized water reactor subassemblies were tested at nominal reactor operating conditions, as well as for a range of flow rates and pressures. Generally, the code performance ranged from adequate to good, except for configurations exhibiting a strong gradient in power-to-flow ratio.

However, the high level of noise in measuring flow rates detracts from the usefulness of this information and forces the operator to exclude the values of the steam and feedwater flow rates when controlling the water level of a steam generator at low operating powers. In recent years, it has been proposed that the wavelet transform can reconstruct a signal that approximates very closely the original signal under a high level of noise. A possible way of differentiating the flow rate from noise is proposed by use of the wavelet noise-reduction or denoising technique and, as one of the potential applications for nuclear power plants, the wavelet transform is incorporated into the water-level controller of steam generators for successful control at low operating powers.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 177-188","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0889011668","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837830","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837830","","Nuclear Technology","2","145"

This code uses the three-dimensional beam element to calculate fuel pin bowing and cladding oval distortion as the primary deformation mechanisms in a fuel pin bundle. The pin dispersion, which is disarrangement of pins in a bundle and would occur during irradiation, was modeled in this code to evaluate its effect on bundle deformation. By applying the contact analysis method commonly used in the finite element method, this model considers the contact conditions at various axial positions as well as the nodal points and can analyze the irregular arrangement of fuel pins with the deviation of the wire configuration.The dispersion model was introduced in the BAMBOO code and verified by using the results of the out-of-pile compression test of the bundle, where the dispersion was caused by the deviation of the wire position. And the effect of the dispersion on the bundle deformation was evaluated based on the analysis results of the code.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 230-237","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0893011672","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837834","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837834","","Nuclear Technology","2","145"
"Determination of Limit Cycles Using Both the Slope of Correlation Integral and Dominant Lyapunov Methods","Castillo, Rogelio; Alonso, Gustavo; Palacios, Javier C","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; COMPUTER CODES; CORRELATIONS; LIMIT CYCLE; LYAPUNOV METHOD; MONITORS; NONLINEAR PROBLEMS; SIGNALS","A method for nonlinear analysis of instabilities in boiling water reactors (BWRs) is presented. Both the Dominant Lyapunov Exponent method and the Slope of the Correlation Integral (SOCI) method are used to analyze the average power reactor monitor (APRM) signals from a BWR. The main advantage of using the two methods in a complementary manner is that doing so results in an enhancement of the capability to analyze noisy systems, such as the APRM signals in a BWR. Previously, such nonlinear analysis had been performed using independently either the Dominant Lyapunov Exponent Method or the SOCI method. These two methods are sensitive to noise in a signal and normally require large amounts of data for a reliable analysis.This proposed system for nonlinear analysis is composed first of a home-developed computer program called 'SLOPE', which is based on the SOCI method. Then, the signal analysis is also performed by the 'LENNS' code, which is used to obtain the dominant Lyapunov exponent. Since only the dominant Lyapunov exponent is computed, there is no need to acquire large amounts of data; thus, computational processing time is greatly reduced, even in the case of noisy data.The system was used to analyze BWR signals containing stationary and nonstationary limit cycles. It was found that this method satisfactorily calculates the limit cycles, extracting useful information from noisy signals.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 139-149","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0886013455","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840198","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840198","","Nuclear Technology","2","145"
"Conceptual Design of HP-STMCs Space Reactor Power System for 110 kWe","El-Genk, Mohamed S; Tournier, Jean-Michel; Chemical and Nuclear Engineering Dept., University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131 (United States)]","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; 22 GENERAL STUDIES OF NUCLEAR REACTORS; BERYLLIUM OXIDES; DESIGN; FISSION; FUEL PINS; HEAT PIPES; LITHIUM; NUCLEAR FUELS; PARAMETRIC ANALYSIS; POTASSIUM; POWER SYSTEMS; RADIATION PROTECTION; RADIATORS; REACTIVITY; REACTOR CORES; REACTOR OPERATION; RHENIUM; SPACE POWER REACTORS; SPACE VEHICLES; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; THERMOELECTRIC CONVERSION; NESDPS Office of Nuclear Energy Space and Defense Power Systems","A conceptual design of a Heat Pipe-Segmented Thermoelectric Module Converters (HP-STMCs) space reactor power system (SRPS) for a net power of 110 kWe is developed. The parametric analysis changed the number of radiator's potassium heat pipes from 224 to 336 and calculated the effects on the operation parameters and total mass of the system. The reactor has a hexagonal core comprised of 126 heat pipe modules, each consists of three UN, 1.5 cm OD fuel pins brazed to a central lithium heat pipe of identical diameter. The Re cladding of the fuel pins is brazed along the active core length to the lithium heat pipe using 6 Re tri-cusps. The reactor control is accomplished using 12 B4C/BeO control drums, a large diameter one on each side of the hexagonal core and a small diameter one at each corner. The control drums are placed within the radial BeO reflector (7.1-9.1 cm thick). The fuel pin peak-to-average power ratio in the reactor core is 1.12-1.19. Despite its very high density and fabrication challenge, using rhenium structure in the reactor core is necessary for three main reasons: (a) the high reactor temperature ({&gt;=} 1500 K); (b) excellent compatibility with the UN fuel and lithium; (c) to cause a spectrum shift that ensures having sufficient negative reactivity margin during a water submersion accident. The reference HP-STMC system with 324, 2.42-3.03 cm OD potassium heat pipes in the radiator is 9.60 m long and has a cone angle of 30 deg. The nominal operation of the reactor's lithium heat pipes and of the radiator's potassium heat pipes is at or below {approx} 45% of the prevailing wicking and sonic limit, respectively. The masses of the reactor and radiation shadow shield are 753.7 kg and 999.5 kg, respectively; the average heat pipes temperature in the reactor is 1513 K; the mass of the reactor's lithium heat pipes with a C-C finned condenser that is 1.5 m long is 516.1 kg; the mass of the radiator is 557.5 kg, with an outer surface area of 87 m2 (6.41 kg/m2) and effective temperatures of 752 K and 734 K for the front and rear radiator sections, respectively. These estimates are for a constant collector temperature for the STMCs of 1300 K and STMCs' thermal and electrical losses of 5% and 8%, respectively. The estimates of the total mass and specific power of the reference HP-STMCs SRPS, pending future detailed design and analysis, are 4261 kg and 25.8 We/kg, respectively.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649628; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 658-672","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3983075767","10.1063/1.1649628","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632874","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632874","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

If fission propulsion systems are to be developed to their full potential, however, near-term customers need to be identified and initial fission systems successfully developed, launched, and utilized. One key to successful utilization is to develop reactor designs that are highly testable. Testable reactor designs have a much higher probability of being successfully converted from paper concepts to working space hardware than do designs which are difficult or impossible to realistically test. ''Test Effectiveness'' is one measure of the ability to realistically test a space reactor system. The objective of this paper is to discuss test effectiveness as applied to the design, development, flight qualification, and acceptance testing of space fission systems. The ability to perform highly effective testing would be particularly important to the success of any near-term mission, such as NASA's Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, the first mission under study within NASA's Project Prometheus, the Nuclear Systems Program.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649629; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 673-679","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3984075768","10.1063/1.1649629","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632875","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632875","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

Considering these challenges, design principles and cost drivers specific to the engineering and fabrication of the reactor shield are presented that contribute to lower recurring mission costs.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649631; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 688-695","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3985075769","10.1063/1.1649631","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632876","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

In this system, power is transferred from the reactor to the Brayton system via a circulated closed loop gas. To allow early utilization, system designs must be relatively simple, easy to fabricate, and easy to test using non-nuclear heaters to closely mimic heat from fission. This combination of attributes will allow pre-prototypic systems to be designed, fabricated, and tested quickly and affordably. The ability to build and test units is key to the success of a nuclear program, especially if an early flight is desired. The ability to perform very realistic non-nuclear testing increases the success probability of the system. In addition, the technologies required by a concept will substantially impact the cost, time, and resources required to develop a successful space reactor power system.

A mission such as this inevitably requires a significant power source both for propulsion and for on-board power. Three reactor concepts, liquid metal cooled, heat pipe cooled and gas cooled are being considered together with three power conversion systems Brayton (cycle), Thermoelectric and Stirling cycles, and possibly Photo voltaics for future systems. Regardless of the reactor system selected it is almost certain that high temperature (materials), refractory alloys, will be required. This paper revisits the material selection options, reviewing the rationale behind the SP-100 selection of Nb-1Zr as the major cladding and structural material and considers the alternatives and developments needed for the longer duty cycle of the JIMO power supply. A side glance is also taken at the basis behind the selection of Uranium nitride fuel over UO2 or UC and a brief discussion of the reason for the selection of Lithium as the liquid metal coolant for SP-100 over other liquid metals.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649645; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 806-814","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3998075782","10.1063/1.1649645","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632889","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

Sub-surface insulated ice caves can also provide insulated habitats to shield from cosmic radiation. Design and operation of the robotic factory is described including the nuclear reactor and chemical process units. The water-cooled reactor uses commercial ZrO2 cermet nuclear fuel.

This methodology involves balancing the competing requirements of having sufficient excess reactivity for the desired lifetime, keeping the reactor subcritical at launch and during submersion accidents, and providing sufficient control over the lifetime of the reactor. These requirements are addressed by three reactivity values for a given reactor design: the excess reactivity at beginning of mission, the negative reactivity at shutdown, and the negative reactivity margin in submersion accidents. These reactivity values define the control worth and the safety worth in submersion accidents, used for evaluating the merit of a proposed reactor type and design. The Heat Pipe-Segmented Thermoelectric Module Converters space reactor core design is evaluated and modified based on the proposed methodology. The final reactor core design has sufficient excess reactivity for 10 years of nominal operation at 1.82 MW of fission power and is subcritical at launch and in all water submersion accidents.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649589; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 319-329","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3971075755","10.1063/1.1649589","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632862","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632862","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

It is pointed out that two important facts need to underlie the development of a test plan: first, that sequential insults and the accumulation of damage are the rule; and second that the response of the nuclear system is stochastic (i.e., for any given set of conditions a probabilistic range of outcomes will occur regardless of the state of our knowledge). Because of these facts a deterministic approach can only be a starting point. The substance of the approach consists of undertaking and documenting three basic efforts: (1) a description of the analysts view of the problem and how it fits into the safety analysis, (2) a formal documentation of the purpose and requirements of the test plan (or test), and (3) an assessment of the use or usefulness of existing test data.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649590; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 330-335","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3972075756","10.1063/1.1649590","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632863","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632863","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

BWX Technologies Inc (BWXT) has a long history of fuel manufacturing. UO2, UCO, and UCx have been fabricated at BWXT for various US and international programs. Recent efforts at BWXT have focused on establishing the manufacturing techniques and analysis capabilities needed to provide a high quality, high power, compact nuclear reactor for use in space nuclear powered missions. To support the production of a space nuclear reactor, uranium nitride has recently been manufactured by BWXT. In addition, analytical chemistry and analysis techniques have been developed to provide verification and qualification of the uranium nitride production process. The fabrication of a space nuclear reactor will require the ability to place an unclad fuel form into a clad structure for assembly into a reactor core configuration. To this end, BWX Technologies has reestablished its capability for machining, GTA welding, and EB welding of refractory metals. Specifically, BWX Technologies has demonstrated GTA welding of niobium flat plate and EB welding of niobium and Nb-1Zr tubing. In performing these demonstration activities, BWX Technologies has established the necessary infrastructure to manufacture UO2, UCx, or UNx fuel, components, and complete reactor assemblies in support of space nuclear programs.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649602; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 426-431","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3974075758","10.1063/1.1649602","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632865","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632865","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

A practical algorithm is proposed for adaptive state filtering and control in nonlinear dynamic systems when the state equations are unknown or are too complex to model analytically. The state equations and inverse plant model are approximated by using neural networks. A framework for a neural network based nonlinear dynamic inversion control law is proposed, as an extrapolation of prior developed restricted complexity methodology used to formulate the adaptive state filter.

The purpose of the high-neutron fluence testing was to demonstrate the survivability of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors in a fission reactor environment. 520 FBGs were installed in the Ford reactor at the University of Michigan. The reactor was operated for 1012 effective full power hours resulting in a maximum neutron fluence of approximately 5x1019 n/cm2, and a maximum gamma dose of 2x103 MGy gamma. This work is significant in that, to the knowledge of the authors, the exposure levels obtained are approximately 1000 times higher than for any previously published experiment. Four different fiber compositions were evaluated. An 87% survival rate was observed for fiber Bragg gratings located at the fuel centerline. Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR), originally developed at the NASA Langley Research Center, can be used to interrogate several thousand low-reflectivity FBG strain and/or temperature sensors along a single optical fiber. A key advantage of the OFDR sensor technology for space nuclear power is the extremely low mass of the sensor, which consists of only a silica fiber 125{mu}m in diameter. The sensors produced using this technology will fill applications in nuclear power for current reactor plants, emerging Generation-IV reactors, and for space nuclear power. The reported research was conducted by Luna Innovations and was funded through a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649627; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 650-657","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3982075766","10.1063/1.1649627","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632873","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632873","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

Fission provides over six orders of magnitude higher energy density, which translates to higher vehicle specific impulse and lower specific mass. These characteristics enable the accomplishment of ambitious space exploration missions. The natural radiation environment in space provides an external source of protons and high energy, high Z particles that can result in the production of secondary neutrons through interactions in reactor structures. Initial investigation using MCNPX 2.5.b for proton transport through the SAFE-400 reactor indicates a secondary neutron net current of 1.4x107 n/s at the core-reflector interface, with an incoming current of 3.4x106 n/s due to neutrons produced in the Be reflector alone. This neutron population could provide a reliable startup source for a space reactor. Additionally, this source must be considered in developing a reliable control strategy during reactor startup, steady-state operation, and power transients. An autonomous control system is developed and analyzed for application during reactor startup, accounting for fluctuations in the radiation environment that result from changes in vehicle location (altitude, latitude, position in solar system) or due to temporal variations in the radiation field, as may occur in the case of solar flares. One proposed application of a nuclear electric propulsion vehicle is in a tour of the Jovian system, where the time required for communication to Earth is significant. Hence, it is important that a reactor control system be designed with feedback mechanisms to automatically adjust to changes in reactor temperatures, power levels, etc., maintaining nominal operation without user intervention. This paper will evaluate the potential use of secondary neutrons produced by proton interactions in the reactor vessel as a startup source for a space reactor and will present a potential control methodology for reactor startup procedures in the event of source fluctuations.","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649623; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 614-622","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3978075762","10.1063/1.1649623","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632869","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632869","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

Terrestrial nuclear power plants rely upon varying degrees of direct human control and interaction for operations and maintenance over a forty to sixty year lifetime. In contrast, an SRPS is intended to provide continuous, remote, unattended operation for up to fifteen years with no maintenance. Uncertainties, rare events, degradation, and communications delays with Earth are challenges that SRPS control must accommodate. Autonomous control is needed to address these challenges and optimize the reactor control design. In this paper, we describe an autonomous control concept for generic SRPS designs. The formulation of an autonomous control concept, which includes identification of high-level functional requirements and generation of a research and development plan for enabling technologies, is among the technical activities that are being conducted under the U.S. Department of Energy's Space Reactor Technology Program in support of the NASA's Project Prometheus.

For the DDG concept, initial tests have been completed to measure pressure drop versus flow rate for a prototypic core flow channel, with gas exiting to atmospheric pressure conditions. The experimental results of the completed DDG tests presented in this paper validate the predicted results to within a reasonable margin of error. These tests have resulted in a re-design of the flow annulus to reduce the pressure drop. Subsequent tests will be conducted with the re-designed flow channel and with the outlet pressure held at 150 psi (1 MPa). Design of a similar test for a nominal flow channel in the HPR heat exchanger (HPR-HX) has been completed and hardware is currently being assembled for testing this channel at 150 psi. When completed, these test programs will provide the data necessary to validate calculated flow performance for these reactor concepts (pressure drop and film temperature rise)","","","","","","United States","2004-02-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 699; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF 2004: 21. symposium on space nuclear power and propulsion: Human space exploration, space colonization, new frontiers and future concepts, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 8-11 Feb 2004; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.1649638; (c) 2004 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 741-748","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US04B3992075776","10.1063/1.1649638","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20632883","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20632883","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","699"

The geometry of the reactor core was modeled as closely as possible including the details of all the fuel elements and control rods. The most significant approximation was made for entrained fission products because of the lack of knowledge of fission product inventory in the current reactor core. This study used the concept of 'average fission product' to model the fission product in the reactor core and determined the concentration of the average fission product by repeating criticality calculations to make the reactor critical for a given critical condition. Finally, the developed model was tested by comparing the calculated results with those of other approaches, i.e., (a) an in-house three-dimensional diffusion code and (b) foil activation measurement. The developed reactor model showed a good agreement with these approaches. The developed model predicted the thermal neutron flux in samples within 11% of difference when compared with the results from the diffusion code and predicted the production of {sup 198}Au and {sup 60}Co within {approx}20% of difference when compared with the values measured with foils. The developed model also calculated the neutron energy spectrum very consistently with the other approaches for the entire energy range considered in this study.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0876011659","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837821","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837821","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"
"Steam Line Break and Station Blackout Transients for Proliferation-Resistant Hexagonal Tight Lattice Boiling Water Reactor","Rohatgi, Upendra S; Jo, Jae H; Chung, Bub Dong; Takahashi, Hiroshi; Downar, Thomas J","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; CONTAINERS; COOLING; COOLING SYSTEMS; FAST REACTORS; FUEL ELEMENTS; HEAT TRANSFER; ISOLATION CONDENSERS; NEUTRON FLUX; NEUTRON SPECTRA; PLUTONIUM; SAFETY; SAFETY ANALYSIS; STEAM LINES; THORIUM OXIDES; TRANSIENTS","Safety analyses of a proliferation-resistant, economically competitive, high-conversion boiling water reactor (HCBWR) fueled with fissile plutonium and fertile thorium oxide fuel elements, and with passive safety systems, are presented here. The HCBWR developed here is characterized by a very tight lattice with a relatively small water volume fraction in the core that therefore operates with a fast reactor neutron spectrum and a considerably improved neutron economy compared to the current generation of light water reactors. The tight lattice core has a very narrow flow channel with a hydraulic diameter less than half of the regular boiling water reactor (BWR) core and, thus, presents a special challenge to core cooling because of reduced water inventory and high friction in the core. The primary safety concern when reducing the moderator-to-fuel ratio and when using a tightly packed lattice arrangement is to maintain adequate cooling of the core during both normal operation and accident scenarios.In the preliminary HCBWR design, the core is placed in a vessel with a large chimney section, and the vessel is connected to the isolation condenser system (ICS). The vessel is placed in containment with the gravity driven cooling system (GDCS) and passive containment cooling system (PCCS) in a configuration similar to General Electric's simplified BWR (SBWR). The safety systems are similar to those of the SBWR; the ICS and PCCS are scaled with power. An internal recirculation pump is placed in the downcomer to augment the buoyancy head provided by the chimney since the buoyancy provided by the chimney alone could not generate sufficient recirculation in the vessel as the tight lattice configuration results in much larger friction in the core than with the SBWR.The constitutive relationships for RELAP5 are assessed for narrow channels, and as a result the heat transfer package is modified. The modified RELAP5 is used to simulate and analyze two of the most limiting events for a tight pitch lattice core: the station blackout and the main-steam-line-break events. The results of the analyses indicate that the HCBWR system will be safely brought to the shutdown condition for these transients.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0878011661","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837823","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837823","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"

These plants have a number of special features, namely, six-loop primary circuit, horizontal steam generators, loop seal in both hot and cold legs, safety injection tank setpoint pressure higher than secondary pressure, etc. As a consequence of the special design solutions, the transient behavior of such a reactor system is different from the usual pressurized water reactor system behavior. To study the transient behavior of these plants, the PMK-2 integral-type facility, a thermal-hydraulic model of the Paks nuclear power plant, was designed and constructed.A short description of the specific design solutions of the VVER-440/213-type plants is given with the modeling aspects and similarity criteria applied to the design of the PMK-2 facility. Since the startup of the facility in 1985, 48 experiments have been performed primarily in an international framework with the participation of several experts from European and overseas countries to study one- and two-phase natural circulation, loss-of-coolant accidents, special plant transients, and experiments in support of the accident management measures. The results of several experiments illustrate the system effects of special design solutions and the effectiveness of bleed-and-feed accident management measures. A brief commentary on the thermal-hydraulic system code validation is provided, and conclusions are offered.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0879011662","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837824","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"

The ATR core is divided into five regions, or lobes, that normally operate at different power levels. To support future irradiation programs, it is desired that the maximum lobe power be increased 10% (from 60 to 66 MW). A modification to ATR's emergency core cooling system is proposed to ensure that adequate safety margins would be maintained during a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). The modification being considered is the addition of an accumulator injection system. The RELAP5 thermal-hydraulic code and the SINDA thermal analyzer were used to simulate the two most challenging design-basis LOCAs identified in the ATR Safety Analysis Report. Calculations were performed both with and without accumulator injection. The results indicate that a 10% increase in maximum lobe power is achievable. Minimum thermal margins increased more than 40% when accumulator injection was simulated.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 44-56","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0880011663","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837825","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"

Six tests have been performed to analyze the effects of the annulus water between the in-core instrumentation nozzle and the thimble tube, external vessel cooling, in-vessel pressure, melt mass, and melt flow for the maintenance of penetration integrity using alumina (Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}) melt as a simulant. The experimental results have been evaluated using the Lower head IntegraL Analysis computer Code (LILAC) and the Modified Bulk Freezing (MBF) model. The test results have shown that the water inside the annulus is very effective in the maintenance of the reactor vessel's penetration integrity because the water prevents the melt from ejection through penetration. The penetration in the no external vessel cooling case has more damage than that in the external vessel cooling case. An increase in in-vessel pressure from 1.0 to 1.5 MPa did not create penetration damage, but an increase in melt mass from 40 to 60 kg and melt flow due to the vessel geometry significantly increased the amount of penetration damage. The analytical results using the LILAC computer code and the MBF model are very similar to the experimental results for the ablation depth of the weld and the melt penetration distance through the annulus, respectively.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 102-114","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0884011665","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837827","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837827","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"
"Uranium Transport in a High-Throughput Electrorefiner for EBR-II Blanket Fuel","Ahluwalia, Rajesh K; Hua, Thanh Q; Vaden, DeeEarl","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BREEDING BLANKETS; CATHODES; CURRENTS; EBR-2 REACTOR; ELECTRIC POTENTIAL; SODIUM; URANIUM; URANIUM CHLORIDES","A unique high-throughput Mk-V electrorefiner is being used in the electrometallurgical treatment of the metallic sodium-bonded blanket fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II. Over many cycles, it transports uranium back and forth between the anodic fuel dissolution baskets and the cathode tubes until, because of imperfect adherence of the dendrites, it all ends up in the product collector at the bottom. The transport behavior of uranium in the high-throughput electrorefiner can be understood in terms of the sticking coefficients for uranium adherence to the cathode tubes in the forward direction and to the dissolution baskets in the reverse direction. The sticking coefficients are inferred from the experimental voltage and current traces and are correlated in terms of a single parameter representing the ratio of the cell current to the limiting current at the surface acting as the cathode. The correlations are incorporated into an engineering model that calculates the transport of uranium in the different modes of operation. The model also uses the experimentally derived electrorefiner operating maps that describe the relationship between the cell voltage and the cell current for the three principal transport modes. It is shown that the model correctly simulates the cycle-to-cycle variation of the voltage and current profiles. The model is used to conduct a parametric study of electrorefiner throughput rate as a function of the principal operating parameters. The throughput rate is found to improve with lowering of the basket rotation speed, reduction of UCl{sub 3} concentration in salt, and increasing the maximum cell current or cut-off voltage. Operating conditions are identified that can improve the throughput rate by 60 to 70% over that achieved at present.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 67-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0882013453","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840196","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840196","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"
"Transient Fuel Behavior and Failure Condition in the CABRI-2 Experiments","Sato, Ikken; Lemoine, Francette; Struwe, Dankward","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BLOWOUTS; BURNUP; CLADDING; DENSITY; ENTHALPY; FBR TYPE REACTORS; FISSION PRODUCTS; FUEL PINS; HEATING RATE; MELTING POINTS; PRESSURIZATION; RUPTURES; SWELLING; THERMAL EXPANSION; TRANSIENTS","In the CABRI-2 program, 12 tests were performed under various transient conditions covering a wide range of accident scenarios using two types of preirradiated fast breeder reactor (FBR) fuel pins with different smear densities and burnups. For each fuel, a nonfailure-transient test was performed, and it provided basic information such as fuel thermal condition, fuel swelling, and gas release. From the failure tests, information on failure mode, failure time, and axial location was obtained. Based on this information, failure conditions such as fuel enthalpy and cladding temperature were evaluated. These failure conditions were compared with the CABRI-1 tests in which different fuels as well as different transient conditions were used. This comparison, together with supporting information available from existing in-pile and out-of-pile experiments, allowed an effective understanding on failure mechanisms depending on fuel and transient conditions. It is concluded that pellet-cladding mechanical interaction (PCMI) due to fuel thermal expansion and fission-gas-induced swelling is playing an important role on mechanical clad loading especially with high smear density and low fuel-heating-rate conditions. At very high heating-rate conditions, there is no sufficient time to allow significant fuel swelling, so that cavity pressurization with fuel melting becomes the likely failure mechanism. Fuel smear density and fission-gas retention have a strong impact both on PCMI and cavity pressurization. Furthermore, pin failure is strongly dependent on cladding temperature, which plays an important role in the axial failure location. With the low smear-density fuel, considerable PCMI mitigation is possible leading to a high failure threshold as well as in-pin molten-fuel relocation along the central hole. However, even with the low smear density fuel, PCMI failure could take place with an elevated cladding-temperature condition. On the other hand, in case of a sufficiently long transient timescale, such low smear density fuel has a potential to allow gas escape to plenum leading to a very effective mitigation of swelling-induced PCMI.In case of very high cladding temperature near its melting point, plenum-gas blowout at cladding rupture takes place before fuel disintegration. Fuel-disintegration behavior under this condition is dominated by fuel enthalpy, and no special effect of the high burnup can be identified through comparison with the CABRI-1 test results.","","","","","","United States","2004-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 145; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 115-137","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0885013454","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20840197","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20840197","","Nuclear Technology","1","145"

The theory and the implementation are also given.Qualification results of the uranyl and plutonium nitrate solutions show that the new density law (also called the isopiestic law) is in good agreement with the benchmarks. Thus, no bias is put into evidence for the uranium solutions, and a small negative bias equal to 0.2% is found for the plutonium solutions.Moreover, the isopiestic law corrects the observed 1% overestimation of k{sub eff} due to the empirical IRSN Leroy and Jouan density law for uranium solutions and the observed 3.4% underestimation of k{sub eff} due to the ARH-600 density law for plutonium solutions.The isopiestic density law has been implemented in CIGALES V2.0, the graphical user interface of the French criticality safety package CRISTAL that calculates the atom densities of nuclides (and writes the input file for CRISTAL computations)","","","","","","United States","2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 303-323","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0868011653","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837815","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837815","","Nuclear Technology","3","144"

A new thermal fragmentation model is proposed that includes three kinds of timescales for modeling the instant fragmentation, spontaneous nucleation fragmentation, and normal boiling fragmentation. The pressure wave propagation in a sodium vapor explosion is analyzed and compared with that in a steam explosion. The energy conversion ratio of an in-vessel sodium vapor explosion is calculated by using hydrodynamic and thermal fragmentation mechanisms, and sensitivity analyses are carried out for some parameters. The initial thermal conditions for energetic fuel-coolant interactions in a sodium system are examined. Results show that the high saturation temperature of sodium results in a much lower pressure peak in a sodium vapor explosion compared to a steam explosion, and the mechanical energy release is limited by the mass of melt participating in the explosion during the core disruptive accident in liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactors.","","","","","","United States","2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 324-336","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0869011654","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837816","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837816","","Nuclear Technology","3","144"

The swelling formulations developed for Russian and American austenitic steels before reaching steady-state conditions are compared, and possible applications of the formulation for Russian steels to some compositionally similar American steels are discussed. The effects of slight composition and metallurgical condition differences on swelling can be used to explain the possible differences between the American steel data and the predictions for the corresponding Russian steel.Ultimate tensile strength and total elongation changes in Russian austenitic steels are correlated with swelling over a large swelling range (0 to 15%) and reveals total loss of ductility and strength as the amount of swelling reaches high values.Since austenitic steel is the main structural material of fast and light water reactors (LWRs) these findings can be applied to the LWR systems considering exposure temperature, dose rate, and neutron energy spectrum differences.","","","","","","United States","2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 369-378","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0872011657","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837819","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837819","","Nuclear Technology","3","144"

C) heat to enable efficient low-cost thermochemical production of hydrogen (H{sub 2}) or production of electricity. This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed AHTR uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the HTGRs, the AHTR uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-PRISM) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near {approx}1400 deg. C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H{sub 2} production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies &gt;50%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [&gt;1000 MW(electric)].","","","","","","United States","2003-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 289-302","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0867011652","10.13182/NT03-1","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20837814","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837814","","Nuclear Technology","3","144"

There is then a risk of Steam Explosion. After the premixing sequence in which the melt is more or less dispersed into water, a fine fragmentation process may start, which can lead to an escalation. Such an event is generally triggered by the destabilization of the vapor film surrounding the hot melt droplets. In this paper, an attempt to describe all the successive processes leading to this fine fragmentation is presented.First, a critical analysis of previous models is performed, allowing us to propose a new sequence of events. As in the previous models, the film destabilization leads to the growth of cold liquid peaks induced by Rayleigh Taylor instability. As these peaks have a smaller density than the drop, they do not penetrate into the hot drop. At the cold liquid-hot liquid contacts, transient heat transfer leads to the explosive boiling of a small amount of coolant. The generated local pressurization deforms the hot melt interface. This can produce fine fragments from the filaments issued from the melt. Some of them may reach the vapor-coolant interface where intense and rapid vaporization occurs. A large bubble then develops, and a new fragmentation sequence may again appear at the bubble collapse. The present model is supported by experimental results.","","","","","","United States","2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 158-174","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0858011643","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837805","","Nuclear Technology","2","144"

The calculated mass-burning rate differs slightly from experimental results, yet it increases with pool temperature in agreement with experimental trends. The mass flux of aerosol driven by thermophoresis is calculated to be about 100 times larger than that by gravity, and the aerosols become concentrated at the edge of the pool.

"Examination of Spent Pressurized Water Reactor Fuel Rods After 15 Years in Dry Storage","Einziger, Robert E; Hanchung, Tsai; Billone, Michael C; Hilton, Bruce A","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BENCHMARKS; CASKS; CLADDING; CREEP; DRY STORAGE; FISSION PRODUCTS; FUEL PELLETS; FUEL RODS; HYDRIDES; HYDROGEN; INERT ATMOSPHERE; MICROHARDNESS; NUCLEAR FUELS; OXIDES; PWR TYPE REACTORS; SURFACES; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; TESTING; THICKNESS","For [approximately equal to]15 yr Dominion Generation's Surry Nuclear Station 15 x 15 Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel was stored in a dry inert-atmosphere Castor V/21 cask at the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory at peak cladding temperatures that decreased from {approx}350 to 150 deg. C. Before storage, the loaded cask was subjected to thermal-benchmark tests, during which time the peak temperatures were greater than 400 deg. C. The cask was opened to examine the fuel rods for degradation and to determine if they were suitable for extended storage. No fuel rod breaches and no visible degradation or crud/oxide spallation from the fuel rod surface were observed. The results from profilometry, gas release measurements, metallographic examinations, microhardness determination, and cladding hydrogen behavior are reported in this paper.It appears that little or no fission gas was released from the fuel pellets during either the thermal-benchmark tests or the long-term storage. In the central region of the fuel column, where the axial temperature gradient in storage is small, the measured hydrogen content in the cladding is consistent with the thickness of the oxide layer. At {approx}1 m above the fuel midplane, where a steep temperature gradient existed in the cask, less hydrogen is present than would be expected from the oxide thickness that developed in-reactor. Migration of hydrogen during dry storage probably occurred and may signal a higher-than-expected concentration at the cooler ends of the rod. The volume of hydrides varies azimuthally around the cladding, and at some elevations, the hydrides appear to have segregated somewhat to the inner and outer cladding surfaces. It is, however, impossible to determine if this segregation occurred in-reactor or during transportation, thermal-benchmark tests, or the dry storage period. The hydrides retained the circumferential orientation typical of prestorage PWR fuel rods. Little or no cladding creep occurred during thermal-benchmark testing and dry storage. It is anticipated that the creep would not increase significantly during additional storage because of the lower temperature after 15 yr, continual decrease in temperature from the reduction in decay heat, and concurrent reductions in internal rod pressure and stress. This paper describes the results of the characterization of the fuel and intact cladding, as well as the implications of these results for long-term (i.e., beyond 20 yr) dry-cask storage.","","","","","","United States","2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 186-200","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0860011645","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837807","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837807","","Nuclear Technology","2","144"

State-of-the-art fission-product transport codes based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium failed to predict this phenomenon. In this work the standard approach of assuming the instantaneous establishment of thermochemical equilibrium is questioned and it will be argued that kinetic limitations may have existed under the severe-accident boundary conditions of the FPT0 and FPT1 tests. To this end a simple monodimensional transport model was developed in an attempt at introducing kinetic aspects within the primary circuit. A number of homogeneous gas-phase reactions between selected fission products and structural materials, complemented by condensation reactions, underlies the kinetic model. In the absence of experimental data, the kinetic constants were estimated using the transition-state theory or semi-empirical methods. The kinetic model was then applied to the analysis of Phebus FPT0 and FPT1 yielding a satisfactory agreement between experimental data and model predictions.","","","","","","United States","2003-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-15","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0846011631","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837793","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837793","","Nuclear Technology","1","144"

FETCH has been developed to model criticality transients in single and multiphase media and is applied here to fissile solution transient criticality. Since the initial transient behavior has different time scales and physics to the longer transient behavior, the transient modeling is divided into two parts: modeling the initial transient over a time scale of seconds in which radiolytic gases and free-surface sloshing play an important role in the transient - this provides information about the dose to workers; and modeling the long-term transient behavior following the initial transient that has a time scale over hours.The neutron dosimetry of worker A who received the largest dose during the Tokaimura criticality incident is also investigated here. This dose was received mainly in the first few seconds of the ensuing nuclear criticality transient. In addition to the multiorgan dosimetry of worker A, this work provides a method of helping to evaluate the yield in the initial phase of the criticality incident; it also shows how kinetic simulations can be calibrated so that they can be applied to investigate the physics behind the incident.","","","","","","United States","2003-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 16-33","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0847011632","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837794","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837794","","Nuclear Technology","1","144"

The applications were preceded by a review of two main physical models, which highly impacted the results. A model comparison to available bibliography models was done, which allowed some code modifications on selected default assumptions to be undertaken. First, the corium convective heat transfer to the wall when it becomes liquid was modified, and second, the default nucleate boiling regime curve in a submerged hemisphere was replaced by a new curve (and, to a much lesser extent, the critical heat flux curve was slightly varied).The applications were devoted to two prototypical light water reactor nuclear power plants, a 2700-MW(thermal) pressurized water reactor (PWR) and a 1381-MW(thermal) boiling water reactor (BWR). The main conclusions of the cavity flooding simulations were that the PWR lower-head survivability is extended although it is clearly not guaranteed, while in the BWR sequence the corium seems to be successfully arrested in the lower plenum.Three applications of the CFX 4.4 computational fluid dynamics code were carried out in the context of the BWR scenario to support the first modification of the aforementioned two scenarios for MELCOR.Finally, in the same BWR context, a statistic predictor of selected output parameters as a function of input parameters is presented, which provides reasonable results when compared to MELCOR full calculations in much shorter CPU processing times.","","","","","","United States","2003-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 34-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0848011633","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837795","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837795","","Nuclear Technology","1","144"

Uncertainty analysis was done with respect to the {sup 99}Mo yield ratio, {sup 239}Pu yield ratio, annual production rate, and decontamination requirement. Validity of a coupled code system, MCNP/ORIGEN2, was evaluated to estimate reliable isotopic number densities after irradiation and cooling. An equilibrium core model for the MCNP fixed-source problem was found by the reactor design methodology known as WIMS/VENTURE. Optimized target design options were proposed for both the LEU and highly enriched uranium (HEU) targets. Variables related to the target fabrication process and reactor physics condition were considered as uncertainty-inducing parameters. The most important factor affecting the overall uncertainty of the LEU option was the engineering tolerances achievable in the fabrication process of fuel film. The LEU has twice the uncertainty of HEU under current technology, which makes the economics of LEU worse than HEU. It is acceptable, however, in view of the radioactive purity of the alpha emitter because the uncertainty of the impurity level of {sup 239}Pu is expected to be relatively small - only 6.5% with a 95% confidence level.","","","","","","United States","2003-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 107-129","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0853011638","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837800","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837800","","Nuclear Technology","1","144"

The feasibility of obtaining the model parameters of a point reactor xenon evolution model with genetic algorithms (GAs) has been investigated earlier using data obtained from a point reactor model under assumed conditions. Actual operational data from The Ohio State University Research Reactor (OSURR) and simulated operational data from the Oconee plant are used to extend this earlier work. It is shown that the point reactor model, joined with an efficient GA parameter estimation procedure, can be used for accurate prediction of global xenon evolution in small reactors (e.g., OSURR). It is also shown that this approach yields just qualitatively correct results in large reactors (e.g., Oconee) where spatial effects become significant. By continuously updating the model parameters obtained by GAs, xenon induced reactivity during transients can be estimated purely from the past reactivity and power data without a knowledge of initial conditions for {sup 135}Xe and {sup 135}I.","","","","","","United States","2003-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 247-255","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0835011620","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837782","","Nuclear Technology","3","143"

In this methodology, both the required enrichment and the fuel performance limits are considered. In order to select the best fuel candidate, the optimal burnup that produces the lowest annual fuel cost within the burnup potential for a given fuel material and smear density ratio is determined.Several nuclear materials are presented as examples of the application of the methodology proposed in this paper. The alternative fuels considered include uranium dioxide (UO{sub 2}), uranium carbide (UC), uranium nitride (UN), metallic uranium (U-Zr alloy), combined thorium and uranium oxides (ThO{sub 2}/UO{sub 2}), and combined thorium and uranium metals (U/Th). For these examples, a typical LWR lattice geometry in a zirconium-based cladding was assumed. The uncertainties in the results presented are large due to the scarcity of experimental data regarding the behavior of the considered materials at high burnups. Also, chemical compatibility issues are to be considered separately.The same methodology can be applied in the future to evaluate the economic potential of other nuclear fuel materials including different cladding designs, dispersions of ceramics into ceramics, dispersions of ceramics into metals, and also for geometries other than the traditional circular fuel pin.","","","","","","United States","2003-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 256-269","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0836011621","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837783","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837783","","Nuclear Technology","3","143"

The economic performance of a nuclear power plant can be significantly improved by increasing the time spent on-line generating electricity relative to the time spent off-line conducting maintenance and refueling. Maintenance includes planned actions (surveillances) and unplanned actions (corrective maintenance) to respond to component degradation or failure. A methodology is described that can be used to resolve, in the design phase, maintenance-related operating cycle length barriers. A primary goal was to demonstrate the applicability and utility of the methodology in the context of the International Reactor, Innovative and Secure (IRIS) design. IRIS is an advanced light water nuclear power plant that is being designed to maximize this on-line generating time by increasing the operating cycle length. This is consequently a maintenance strategy paper using the IRIS plant as the example.Potential IRIS operating cycle length maintenance-related barriers, determined by modification of an earlier operating pressurized water reactor (PWR) plant cycle length analysis to account for differences between the design of IRIS and this operating PWR, are presented. The proposed methodology to resolve these maintenance-related barriers by the design process is described. The results of applying the methodology to two potential IRIS cycle length barriers, relief valve testing and emergency heat removal system testing, are presented.","","","","","","United States","2003-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 270-280","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0837011622","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837784","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837784","","Nuclear Technology","3","143"

This concerns primarily plutonium and minor actinides (neptunium, americium, and curium), accumulated in the spent fuel of nuclear reactors. One of the ways this can be solved is to use a fast reactor with uranium-free fuel. The physics of this type of reactor was widely investigated during the last year for the BN-800 reactor. The solutions of the most important problems were (a) a decrease in nonuniformity of the power distribution and (b) an increase of the Doppler effect. The next stage of such core investigations is an evaluation of self-protection to beyond-design accidents. Preliminary results show a high safety level of the BN-800 reactor with uranium-free fuel in unprotected loss-of-flow and unprotected transient overpower events.","","","","","","United States","2003-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 281-289","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0838011623","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837785","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837785","","Nuclear Technology","3","143"

As an initial step in the site characterization and restart feasibility review, a majority of the primary reactor circuit was chemically decontaminated. Close cooperation between TVA and vendor personnel resulted in project completion ahead of schedule with outstanding results. The final average decontamination factors were excellent, and the final dose rates were very low, with contact readings on most points between one and three mRem/hr. In addition to allowing TVA to do a complete and thorough job of determining the feasibility of the Unit 1 restart, the decontamination effort will greatly reduce personnel exposure during plant recovery, both whole body exposure to gamma radiation and airborne exposure during pipe replacement efforts. The implementation of lessons learned from previous decontamination work performed at Browns Ferry, as well as decontamination efforts at other plants aided greatly in the success. Specific items of note are: (1) The initial leak check of the temporary decontamination system should include ancillary systems such as the spent resin system, as well as the main circulation loop. This could save time and dose exposure if leaks are discovered before the use of such systems is required. (2) Due to the quick turnaround time from the award of contract, a vendor representative was onsite early in the project to help with engineering efforts and procedures. This aided greatly in completing preparations for the decontamination. (3) The work was performed under a single maintenance activity. This resulted in great craft and plant support. (4) The constant coverage by the site's decontamination flush directors provided timely plant support and interface. (5) The FPC system isolation and back flushing to prevent residual chemicals from being left in the FPC system should have been addressed in more detail in the pre-engineering study to prevent delays during the final system cleanup.","","","Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN (US)","none (US)","","United States","2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 38-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0400587","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","821050","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/821050","","Nuclear Plant Journal","5","21"

The CANDU 6 Nuclear Power Plant has been constructed eleven times in the last 25 years. However, the last two units completed on the Qinshan project in China have employed some very innovative construction methods that have not been used on the previous units. In order to make nuclear power generation more competitive, shorter construction schedules and reduced project cost and risks are essential objectives. The application of constructability principles is a major contributor to achieving these objectives. The success of Qinshan has increased the confidence in the new construction methods, which are being implemented on the ACR (Advanced CANDU Reactor) successfully. An ACR construction strategy that utilizes advanced construction techniques has been developed by AECL. The strategy includes paralleling of activities by using extensive modularization and the vertical installation of equipment and modules into the reactor building using a VHL (Very Heavy Lift) crane. This strategy allows short schedules to be met with a minimum risk to the project.","","","Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Chalk River, Ontario (CA)","Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited (US)","","United States","2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 31-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0400569","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","820959","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/820959","","Nuclear Plant Journal","5","21"

Although the rate of population growth has slowed, recent United Nations data suggest that two billion more people will be added to the world by 2050. A special report commissioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that electricity demand would grow almost eight-fold from 2000 to 2050 in a high economic grown scenario and more than double in a low-growth scenario. There is also a global aspiration to keep the environment pristine. Because of these reasons, it is expected that a large number of new nuclear reactors may be operating by 2050. Realization of this has created an impetus for the development of a new generation of reactors in several countries. The goal is to make nuclear power cost-competitive with other resources and to enhance safety to a level that no evacuation outside a plant site would be necessary. It should also generate less waste, prevent materials diversion for weapons production, and be sustainable. This article discusses the status of next-generation reactors under development around the world. Specifically highlighted are efforts related to the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and its six reactor concepts for research and development: Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR); Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor (GFR); Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR); Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor (SFR); Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR); and Molten Salt Reactor (MSR).

Current Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enable training standardization in the nuclear power industry. The delivery of training through the Internet, Intranet and video over IP will facilitate this standardization and bring multiple benefits to the nuclear power industry worldwide. As the amount of available qualified and experienced professionals decreases because of retirements and fewer nuclear engineering institutions, standardized training will help increase the number of available professionals in the industry. Technology will make it possible to use the experience of retired professionals who may be interested in working part-time from a remote location. Well-planned standardized training will prevent a fragmented approach among utilities, and it will save the industry considerable resources in the long run.

Safety levels and electric production are at unprecedented high levels and continue to exceed even high industry goals. Nuclear energy continues to keep the highest priority on performance improvement programs and highly trained and qualified people that maintain its record setting safety and reliability of operations. While the industry has maintained a high level of performance, the advent of deregulation and the consolidation of nuclear power plant ownership, as well as the current climate for concern about both rising energy costs and the availability of power, have raised the standard for nuclear energy's level of competitiveness in today's market place. The resulting challenge is how to more effectively manage risk and to improve performance even further in a generally high-performing industry. One of the most effective ways to develop this culture is to apply the principles of Hum an Performance Technology, or HPT. HPT is a relatively new field. Its principles are derived from the research and practice of behavioral and cognitive psychologists, instructional technologists, training designers, organizational developers, and various human resource specialists. Using the principles of HPT can help the nuclear industry successfully meet ever-changing environmental and business demands.","","","none (US)","none (US)","","United States","2003-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Plant Journal; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: 1 Sep 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 40-42, 45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0892-2055; TRN: US0400588","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","821053","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/821053","","Nuclear Plant Journal","5","21"

The MYRRHA facility in planning has been conceived as potentially replacing BR2 and to be a fast spectrum facility complementary to the thermal spectrum RJH (Reacteur Jules Horowitz) facility, in planning in France. This situation would give Europe a full research capability in terms of nuclear R and D. Furthermore, the disposal of radioactive wastes resulting from industrial nuclear energy production has still to find a fully satisfactory solution, especially in terms of environmental and social acceptability. Scientists are looking for ways to drastically reduce (by a factor of 100 or more) the radio-toxicity of the High Level Waste (HLW) to be stored in a deep geological repository. This can be achieved via burning of minor actinides (MA) and to a less extent of long-lived fission products (LLFP) in Accelerator Driven Systems.

The model was connected to live plant data and intermittently fitted to these by minimization of a weighted least-squares object function. The improvement in precision achieved by this reconciliation was assessed from quantities calculated from the model equations linearized around the minimum and from Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that the inclusion of the flow-passing characteristics of the turbines in the model equations significantly improved the precision as compared to simple mass and energy balances, whereas heat transfer calculations in feedwater heaters did not. Under the assumption of linear model equations, the quality of the fit can also be expressed as a goodness-of-fit Q. Typical values for Q were in the order of 0.9. For a validated model Q may be used as a fault detection indicator, and Q dropped to very low values in known cases of disagreement between the model and the plant state. The sensitivity of Q toward measurement faults is discussed in relation to redundancy. The results of the linearized theory and Monte Carlo simulations differed somewhat, and if a more accurate analysis is required, this is better based on the latter. In practical application of the presently employed techniques, however, assessment of uncertainties in raw data is an important prerequisite.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 103-124","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0822011607","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837769","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837769","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

In this work, the neutron spectrum for a BWR is approximated as a linear combination of the fundamental and first harmonic modes, and these two modes are studied applying reduced order modal models. A stability estimator is constructed to monitor the development of the harmonic mode instability through the calculation of the decay ratio. To achieve an estimation of the decay ratio for each mode, the estimator requires the separation of both modes from the neutron spectrum, and a method to obtain these modes based on a bare homogeneous reactor is presented.

The TRIGA reactor's power response is used to simulate reactor neutron dynamics for in-phase oscillation or the fundamental mode of the reactor modal kinetics for OOP oscillations. The reactor power signal drives a real-time boiling channel simulation, and the calculated reactivity feedback is in turn fed into the TRIGA reactor via an experimental changeable reactivity device. The thermal-hydraulic dynamics, together with first harmonic mode power dynamics, is digitally simulated in the real-time environment. The real-time digital simulation of boiling channel thermal hydraulics is performed by solving constitutive equations for different regions in the channel and is realized by a high-performance personal computer. The nonlinearity of the thermal-hydraulic model ensures the capability to simulate the oscillation phenomena, limit cycle and OOP oscillation, in BWR nuclear power plants. By adjusting reactivity feedback gains for both modes, various oscillation combinations can be realized in the experiment. The dynamics of axially lumped power distribution over the core is displayed in three-dimensional graphs. The HRS reactor power response mimics the BWR core-wide power stability phenomena. In the OOP oscillation HRS, the combination of reactor response and the simulated first harmonic power using shaping functions mimics BWR regional power oscillations. With this HRS testbed, a monitoring and/or control system designed for BWR power oscillations can be experimentally tested and verified.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 132-143","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0824011609","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837771","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837771","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

The search method uses an Improved GA operator, that is, crossover, mutation, and selection. The handling of the encoding technique and constraint conditions is designed so that the GA reflects the peculiar characteristics of the BWR. In addition, some strategies such as elitism and self-reproduction are effectively used to improve the search speed. LP evaluations were performed with a three-dimensional diffusion code that coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic models. Strong axial heterogeneities and three-dimensional-dependent constraints have always necessitated the use of three-dimensional core simulators for BWRs, so that an optimization method is required for computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated by successfully generating LPs for an actual BWR plant applying the Haling technique. In test calculations, candidates that shuffled fresh and burned fuel assemblies within a reasonable computation time were obtained.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 144-151","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0825011610","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837772","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837772","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"
"Impact of Smoke Exposure on Digital Instrumentation and Control","Tanaka, Tina J; Nowlen, Steven P; Korsah, Kofi; Wood, Richard T; Antonescu, Christina E","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; COATINGS; CONTROL; CONTROL SYSTEMS; DIGITAL CIRCUITS; DIGITAL SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC POTENTIAL; FAILURES; HEAT; HUMIDITY; LEAKAGE CURRENT; MAGNETIC DISKS; METALS; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; POLYURETHANES; RECOMMENDATIONS; SMOKES","Smoke can cause interruptions and upsets in active electronics. Because nuclear power plants are replacing analog with digital instrumentation and control systems, qualification guidelines for new systems are being reviewed for severe environments such as smoke and electromagnetic interference. Active digital systems, individual components, and active circuits have been exposed to smoke in a program sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The circuits and systems were all monitored during the smoke exposure, indicating any immediate effects of the smoke. The results of previous smoke exposure studies have been reported in various publications. The major immediate effect of smoke has been to increase leakage currents and to cause momentary upsets and failures in digital systems. This paper presents new results from conformal coatings, memory chips, and hard drive tests.The best conformal coatings were found to be polyurethane, parylene, and acrylic (when applied by dipping). Conformal coatings can reduce smoke-induced leakage currents and protect against metal loss through corrosion. However conformal coatings are typically flammable, so they do increase material flammability. Some of the low-voltage biased memory chips failed during a combination of high smoke and high humidity. Typically, smoke along with heat and humidity is expected during fire, rather than smoke alone. Thus, due to high sensitivity of digital circuits to heat and humidity, it is hypothesized that the impact of smoke may be secondary.Low-voltage (3.3-V) static random-access memory (SRAMs) were found to be the most vulnerable to smoke. Higher bias voltages decrease the likelihood of failure. Erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROMs) and nonvolatile SRAMs were very smoke tolerant. Failures of the SRAMs occurred when two conditions were present: high density of smoke and high humidity. As the high humidity was present for only part of the test, the failures were intermittent. All of the chips that failed during the test recovered after enough venting.Hard disks were tested in severe environments but did not fail during the 2 h of monitoring.While the results of the tests documented in this report confirm that digital circuits can indeed be vulnerable to smoke, there is currently no practical, repeatable testing methodology, so it is not feasible to assess smoke susceptibility as part of environmental qualification. As a result, the most reasonable approach to minimizing smoke susceptibility is to employ design, implementation, and procedural practices that can reduce the possibility of smoke exposure and enhance smoke tolerance. Traditional approaches to mitigate its effects in digital safety instrumentation and control, such as redundancy, separation, defense in depth, as well as adherence to standards (e.g., the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' IEEE 384) and the Code of Federal Regulations Appendix R of 10 CFR 50, should continue to be applied.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 152-160","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0826011611","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837773","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837773","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"
"Updated Aging Assessment Approach and Use with Electric Cable Insulation","Horvath, David A; Colaianni, R Paul","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AGING; DESIGN; ELECTRIC CABLES; EVALUATION; FAILURES; LICENSES; MAINTENANCE; NUCLEAR POWER; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; OPERATION","The service life of nuclear power plant equipment may include operation beyond the original design or qualified life. A technical basis is necessary to demonstrate that critical equipment is capable of continued safe operation for any life extension and renewed license term. Such a technical basis is also useful in addressing initial license term aging degradation, age-related failures, and maintenance issues. Early approaches for addressing aging effects developed for environmental qualification programs in the 1980s were incorporated into the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE) IEEE Std. 1205-1993. However, subsequently, a number of events (including promulgation of the Maintenance Renewal Rule, the new License Renewal Rule, and initial plant owner submittals of License Renewal applications) have resulted in improved aging management approaches, which focus on addressing aging effects rather than attempting to identify and mitigate every possible aging mechanism.An example of a major issue facing nuclear power plants as they mature is the general health of the plant electrical cables. This issue came to the forefront as plants began preparing for license renewal, which requires an evaluation of cables to demonstrate that they will perform their function 20 yr beyond the original 40-yr license period. When the two lead plants started preparing for license renewal, there was no generally accepted approach to the bulk evaluation of plant cables, and there were many who thought it not possible to perform a complete plant cable evaluation. The approaches that emerged from the lead plant reviews demonstrated that an assessment of the general health of plant cables could be performed.IEEE's Nuclear Power Engineering Committee recognized the need to capture these improved approaches. A 2 1/2-yr effort of the IEEE Subcommittee-3 Working Group 3.4 culminating in IEEE Std. 1205-2000 is the consensus of representatives from the two lead license renewal plants (Calvert Cliffs and Oconee), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a national laboratory, other utilities, and multiple engineering/consulting firms. This revision, now complete, updated the Guide to incorporate the aging assessment methods used by the two lead license renewal plants and the experience gained by the industry and the regulator and, in addition, added an example annex applying the guidance to electrical cable, and both are summarized in this paper.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 161-170","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0827011612","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837774","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

A receding horizon control method is to solve an optimization problem for finite future steps at current time and to implement the first optimal control input as the current control input. The procedure is then repeated at each subsequent instant. The dynamics of steam generators is very different according to power levels. The receding horizon controller is designed by using a reduced linear steam generator model fixed over a certain power range and applied to a Westinghouse-type (U-tube recirculating type) nuclear steam generator. The proposed controller designed at a fixed power level shows good performance for any other power level within this power range. The steam generator shows actually nonlinear characteristics. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is implemented for a nonlinear model of the nuclear steam generator to verify its real performance and also shows good responses.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 180-196","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0829011614","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837776","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837776","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

In case of safety-relevant I and C systems, the licensing authorities require the demonstration of sufficient safety of the systems.In several countries ongoing research and development projects are directed to provide a scientific basis and engineering solutions for cost-effective assessment of software-based I and C systems important to safety in NPPs. International initiatives have been started to develop a harmonized safety assessment methodology. The Institute for Safety Technology (ISTec) has been engaged in national and international programs as well as in establishing a two-phase qualification approach, which comprises a generic plant-independent qualification of hardware and software components and a plant-specific system qualification phase.In both generic qualification and plant-specific system qualification, ISTec has been involved as an independent third-party assessor for the relevant state authority. This paper reports experiences from the ISTec involvement in the assessment projects, e.g., in the assessment of the I and C important to safety in the new German High-Flux Research Reactor (FRM-2) in Munich and in the assessments of I and C modernization in NPPs of foreign countries (Bohunice, Slovak Republic; Paks, Hungary; and others). Conclusions are drawn from the experiences with respect to the practicability of the two-phase qualification concept and from the major findings in the plant-specific I and C assessments.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 197-207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0830011615","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837777","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837777","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

It employs a Fizeau interferometer and a charge-coupled device array to locate the position of the maximum interference fringe intensity, which is directly related to the environmental temperature. Consequently, the basic sensing mechanism is independent of the absolute transmitted light intensity, which is the most likely parameter to be affected by external harsh environments such as nuclear irradiation, high pressure/temperature, and cyclical vibration.This paper reports research on the performance of two Fiso Fabry-Perot temperature sensors in environmental conditions expected in nuclear power plants during both normal and abnormal (i.e., accident) conditions. The environmental conditions simulated in this paper include gamma-only ({sup 60}Co) irradiation, pressure/temperature environmental transient, and mixed neutron/gamma field, respectively.The first sensor exhibited no failure or degradation in performance during and following gamma-only irradiation in which a total dose of 15 kGy was delivered at a dose rate of 2.5 kGy/h. Following gamma irradiation, this sensor was then tested for 10.75 days in a thermohydraulic environment prescribed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE323-1983. Intermittent behavior was observed throughout the latter portions of this test, and degradation in performance occurred after the test. Visual evaluation after opening the sensor head indicated that the internal welding methodology was the primary contributor to the observed behavior during this test. Further consultation with the vendor shows that the robustness and reliability of Fiso sensors can be substantially improved by modifying the internal welding methods.The second Fiso temperature sensor was tested in a mixed neutron/gamma environment, in which the total neutron fluence was 2.6 x 10{sup 16} neutrons/cm{sup 2} and the total gamma dose was 1.09 x 10{sup 8} rads. During the initial calibration following completion of the test, the sensor exhibited a fixed offset of 18.9 deg. C (34 deg. F offset) but responded linearly to change in temperature. An annealing phenomenon was observed as the temperature increased, which reduced the offset by {approx}63%. This observed phenomenon will be very valuable in the model building for on-line maintenance and calibration of the Fiso temperature sensor in a mixed neutron/gamma irradiation field. Fiso Technologies in Canada has suggested that the temperature offset may also be reduced by improved welding methods. If these shifts can be compensated in the on-line sensing or calibration model of the Fiso sensor, then this type of fiber optic sensor will be competitive in nuclear power plant applications.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 208-216","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0831011616","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837778","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837778","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"
"Initial Experiments on Fuzzy Control for Nuclear Reactor Operations at the Belgian Reactor 1","Ruan, Da","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BR-1 REACTOR; CEN; CONTROL; FUZZY LOGIC; HAZARDS; HUMAN POPULATIONS; NUCLEAR INDUSTRY; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; REGULATIONS; SAFETY","The application of fuzzy logic control (FLC) in the domain of the nuclear industry presents a tremendous challenge. The main reason for this is the public awareness of the risks of nuclear reactors and the very strict safety regulations in force for nuclear power plants. The very same regulations prevent a researcher from quickly introducing novel control methods into this field. On the other hand, the application of FLC has, despite the ominous sound of the word 'fuzzy' to nuclear engineers, a number of very desirable advantages over classical control, e.g., its robustness and the capability to include human experience into the controller. In this paper an FLC for controlling the power level of a nuclear reactor is described. The study is intended to assess the applicability of FLC in this domain. The final goal is to develop an optimized and intrinsically safe controller. After reviewing some available literature on FLC in nuclear reactors, an FLC is proposed and first tested by comparing it with the classical controller of the Belgian reactor 1 (BR1). In the next step the BR1 at the Belgian Nuclear Research Center (SCK-CEN) was used as a test bed to implement a programmable logic controller-based hardware controller. The BR1 reactor is internationally regarded as a nuclear calibration reference. It therefore provides an excellent environment for this type of experiment because over the years considerable knowledge of the static and dynamic properties of the reactor has been accumulated. The project (1995-1999) aimed at investigating the added value and technical limits of FLC for nuclear reactor operations. The progress made in these experiments including closed-loop experiments are presented and discussed in this paper.","","","","","","United States","2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-240","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0833011618","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837780","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837780","","Nuclear Technology","2","143"

The original-design electrical capacity for each unit was 1500 MW. Unit 1 began operating in 1983, and Unit 2 was started up in 1987. In 1994, the government of Lithuania agreed to accept grant support for the Ignalina NPP Safety Improvement Program with funding supplied by the Nuclear Safety Account of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). As conditions for receiving this funding, the Ignalina NPP agreed to prepare a comprehensive safety analysis report that would undergo independent peer review after it was issued. The EBRD Safety Panel oversaw preparation and review of the report. In 1996, the safety analysis report for Unit 1 was completed and delivered to the EBRD. Part of the analyses covered anticipated transients without scram (ATWS). The analysis showed that some ATWS scenarios could lead to unacceptable consequences in &lt;1 min. The EBRD Safety Panel recommended to the government of Lithuania that the Ignalina NPP develop and implement a program of compensatory measures for the control and protection system before the unit would be allowed to return to operation following its 1998 maintenance outage. A compensatory control and protection system that would mitigate the unacceptable consequences was designed, procured, manufactured, tested, and installed.

Throughout the entire spectrum of the design basis accident, the reactor core is kept covered by the passive emergency core cooling system. The decay heat is removed by the conventional active low-pressure residual heat removal system. As for a postulated severe accident, the suppression pool water floods the lower part of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) in the case when core damage occurs, and the in-vessel retention that keeps the melt inside the RPV is achieved by supplying the coolant. The containment adopts a parallel-double-steel-plate structure similar to a hull structure, which contains coolant between the inner and outer walls to absorb the heat transferred from the inside of the containment. Consequently, the containment structure functions as a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) to remove the decay heat in case of an accident. This paper describes the PCCS performance evaluation by using TRAC code to show one of the characteristic plant features. The core damage frequency for internal events was also evaluated to examine the safety level of the plant and to show the adequacy of the safety system design.","","","","","","United States","2003-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-10","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0814011599","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837761","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837761","","Nuclear Technology","1","143"

RAPID-L is designed for a lunar base power system. It is one of the variants of the RAPID (Refueling by All Pins Integrated Design) fast reactor concept, which enables quick and simplified refueling. The essential feature of the RAPID concept is that the reactor core consists of an integrated fuel assembly instead of conventional fuel subassemblies. In this small-size reactor core, 2700 fuel pins are integrated and encased in a fuel cartridge. Refueling is conducted by replacing a fuel cartridge. The reactor can be operated without refueling for up to 10 yr.Unique challenges in reactivity control systems design have been addressed in the RAPID-L concept. The reactor has no control rod but involves the following innovative reactivity control systems: lithium expansion modules (LEM) for inherent reactivity feedback, lithium injection modules (LIM) for inherent ultimate shutdown, and lithium release modules (LRM) for automated reactor startup. All these systems adopt {sup 6}Li as a liquid poison instead of B{sub 4}C rods. In combination with LEMs, LIMs, and LRMs, RAPID-L can be operated without an operator. This reactor concept is also applicable to the terrestrial fast reactors.

Recent studies have been directed toward homogeneously mixed, heterogeneously mixed, and seed-and-blanket thorium-uranium oxide fuel cycles that rely on 'in situ' use of the bred-in {sup 233}U. However, due to the higher initial enrichment required to achieve acceptable burnups, these fuels are encountering economic constraints. Thorium can nevertheless play a large role in the nuclear fuel cycle, particularly in the reduction of plutonium inventories. While uranium-based mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel will decrease the amount of plutonium in discharged fuel, the reduction is limited due to the breeding of more plutonium (and higher actinides) from the {sup 238}U. Here, we present calculational results and a comparison of the potential burnup of a thorium-based and uranium-based mixed-oxide fuel in a light water reactor. Although the uranium-based fuels outperformed the thorium-based fuels in achievable burnup, a depletion comparison of the initially charged plutonium (both reactor and weapons grade) showed that the thorium-based fuels outperformed the uranium-based fuels by more that a factor of 2, where &gt;70% of the total plutonium in the thorium-based fuel is consumed during the cycle. This is significant considering that the achievable burnups of the thorium-based fuels were 1.4 to 4.6 times less than the uranium-based fuels for similar plutonium enrichments. For equal specific burnups of {approx}60 MWd/kg (i.e., using variable plutonium weight percentages to give the desired burnup), the thorium-based fuels still outperform the uranium-based fuels by more than a factor of 2, where the total plutonium consumption in a three-batch, 18-month cycle was 60 to 70%. This is fairly significant considering that 10 to 15% (by weight) more plutonium is needed in the thorium-based fuels as compared to the uranium-based fuels to achieve these burnups.Furthermore, thorium-based fuels could also be used as a strategy for reducing the amount of long-lived nuclides (including the minor actinides) and thus the radiotoxicity in spent nuclear fuel. Although the breeding of {sup 233}U is a concern, the presence of {sup 232}U and its daughter products (namely {sup 208}Tl) can aid in making this fuel self-protecting, and/or enough {sup 238}U can be added to denature the fissile uranium. From these calculations, it appears that thorium-based fuel for plutonium incineration is superior when compared to uranium-based fuel and should be considered as an alternative to traditional MOX in both current and future/advanced reactor designs.","","","","","","United States","2003-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-36","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0816011601","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837763","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837763","","Nuclear Technology","1","143"
"Coolant Mixing in a Pressurized Water Reactor: Deboration Transients, Steam-Line Breaks, and Emergency Core Cooling Injection","Prasser, Horst-Michael; Grunwald, Gerhard; Hoehne, Thomas; Kliem, Soeren; Rohde, Ulrich; Weiss, Frank-Peter","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BORON; COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION; COOLANT LOOPS; COOLANTS; ECCS; FLOW RATE; FLUID MECHANICS; MIXING; NATURAL CONVECTION; PRESSURE VESSELS; PWR TYPE REACTORS; REACTOR ACCIDENTS; STEAM LINES; WATER","The reactor transient caused by a perturbation of boron concentration or coolant temperature at the inlet of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) depends on the mixing inside the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Initial steep gradients are partially lessened by turbulent mixing with coolant from the unaffected loops and with the water inventory of the RPV. Nevertheless the assumption of an ideal mixing in the downcomer and the lower plenum of the reactor leads to unrealistically small reactivity inserts. The uncertainties between ideal mixing and total absence of mixing are too large to be acceptable for safety analyses. In reality, a partial mixing takes place. For realistic predictions it is necessary to study the mixing within the three-dimensional flow field in the complicated geometry of a PWR. For this purpose a 1:5 scaled model [the Rossendorf Coolant Mixing Model (ROCOM) facility] of the German PWR KONVOI was built. Compared to other experiments, the emphasis was put on extensive measuring instrumentation and a maximum of flexibility of the facility to cover as much as possible different test scenarios. The use of special electrode-mesh sensors together with a salt tracer technique provided distributions of the disturbance within downcomer and core entrance with a high resolution in space and time. Especially, the instrumentation of the downcomer gained valuable information about the mixing phenomena in detail. The obtained data were used to support code development and validation. Scenarios investigated are the following: (a) steady-state flow in multiple coolant loops with a temperature or boron concentration perturbation in one of the running loops, (b) transient flow situations with flow rates changing with time in one or more loops, such as pump startup scenarios with deborated slugs in one of the loops or onset of natural circulation after boiling-condenser-mode operation, and (c) gravity-driven flow caused by large density gradients, e.g., mixing of cold emergency core cooling (ECC) water entering the RPV through the ECC injection into the cold leg. The experimental results show an incomplete mixing with typical concentration and temperature distributions at the core inlet, which strongly depend on the boundary conditions. Computational fluid dynamics calculations were found to be in good agreement with the experiments.","","","","","","United States","2003-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-56","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0817011602","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837764","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837764","","Nuclear Technology","1","143"

From the steady-state test results to simulate the late reflood phase of a large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LBLOCA), isothermal lines show the multidimensional phenomena of a phasic interaction between steam and water in the downcomer annulus very well. MIDAS is a steam-water separate effect test facility, which is 1/4.93 linearly scaled down to a 1400-MW(electric) PWR type of a nuclear reactor, focused on understanding multidimensional thermal-hydraulic phenomena in a downcomer annulus with various types of safety injection during the refill or reflood phase of an LBLOCA. The initial and the boundary conditions are scaled from the pretest analysis based on the preliminary calculation using the TRAC code. The superheated steam with a superheating degree of 80 K at a given downcomer pressure of 180 kPa is injected equally through three intact cold legs into the downcomer.","","","","","","United States","2003-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 57-64","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0818011603","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837765","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837765","","Nuclear Technology","1","143"

Experiments at typical startup conditions (low power and low pressure) are carried out on a steam/water natural-circulation loop. The flashing and the mechanism of flashing-induced instability are analyzed. The effect of system pressure and steam volume in the steam dome is investigated as well.The instability region is found as soon as the operational boundary between single-phase and two-phase operation is crossed. Increasing pressure has a stabilizing effect, reducing the operational region in which instabilities occur. Nonequilibrium between phases and enthalpy transport are found to play an important role in the instability process. In contrast with results reported in the literature, instabilities can occur independently of the position of the flashing boundary in the adiabatic section of the loop. The period of the oscillation is found to be about twice the fluid transit time in the system.","","","","","","United States","2003-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 143; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 77-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0820011605","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20837767","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20837767","","Nuclear Technology","1","143"

These steels were irradiated with 1 MeV protons to doses between 1 and 10 dpa at 300 C both with or without 15 appm helium pre-implanted at {approx}100 C. They were also irradiated at 340 C, but only after 15 appm helium pre-implantation. Small heterogeneously distributed voids were observed in both alloys irradiated at 300 C, but only after helium pre-implantation. The pre-implanted steels irradiated at 340 C exhibited homogeneous void formation, suggesting effects of both helim and irradiation temperature on void nucleation. Voids developed sooner in the SA304 alloy than CW316 alloy at 300 and 340 C, consistent with the behavior observed at higher temperatures (&gt;370 C) for similar steels irradiated in the EBR-II fast reactor. The development of the Frank loop microstructure was similar in both alloys, and was only marginally affected by pre-implanted helium. Loop densities were insensitive to dose and irradiation temperature, and were decreased by helium; loop sizes increased with dose up to about 5.5 dpa and were not affected by the pre-implanted helium. Comparison with microstructures produced by neutron irradiation suggests that this method of helium pre-implantation and proton irradiation emulates neutron irradiation under PWR conditions.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The compact size of a 200-MW(electric) reactor makes it attractive for countries with a less well developed engineering infrastructure, as well as for developed countries seeking to tailor generation capacity more closely to the growth of their electricity demand. The 200-MW(electric) core design reported here is based on the 600-MW(electric) General Electric SBWR core, which was first analyzed in the work performed here in order to qualify the computer codes used in the analysis. Cross sections for the 8 x 8 fuel assembly design were generated with the HELIOS lattice physics code, and core simulation was performed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission codes RELAP5/PARCS. In order to predict the critical heat flux, the Hench-Gillis correlation was implemented in the RELAP5 code. An equilibrium cycle was designed for the 200-MW(electric) core, which provided a cycle length of more than 2 yr and satisfied the minimum critical power ratio throughout the core life.","","","","","","United States","2003-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 230-242","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0806002283","10.13182/NT02-47","","2016-05-24T00:00:00Z","20826854","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826854","","Nuclear Technology","3","142"

In safety design of the HTGR fuels, it is important to retain fission products within particles so that their release to primary coolant does not exceed an acceptable level. From this point of view, the basic design criteria for the fuel are to minimize the failure fraction of as-fabricated fuel coating layers and to prevent significant additional fuel failures during operation. The maximum burnup of the first-loading fuel of the High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) is limited to 3.6%FIMA (% fission per initial metallic atom) to certify its integrity during the operation. In order to investigate fuel behavior under extended burnup condition, irradiation tests were performed. The irradiation was carried out as HRB-22 and 91F-1A capsule irradiation tests. The fuel for the irradiation tests was called extended burnup fuel, whose target burnup and fast neutron fluence were higher than those of the first-loading fuel of the HTTR. In order to keep fuel integrity up to over 5%FIMA, the thickness of buffer and SiC layers of fuel particle were increased. The fuel compacts were irradiated in the HRB-22 and the 91F-1A capsules at the High Flux Isotope Reactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and at the Japan Materials Testing Reactor of the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, respectively. The comparison of measured and calculated release rate-to-birth rate ratios showed that there were additional failures in both irradiation tests. A pressure vessel failure model analysis showed that no tensile stresses acted on the SiC layers even at the end of irradiation and no pressure vessel failure occurred in the intact particles even in a particle with thin buffer layer with failed OPyC layer. The presumed failure mechanisms are additional through-coatings failure of as-fabricated SiC-failed particles or an excessive increase of internal pressure by the accelerated irradiation. Further study is needed to clarify the failure mechanism.","","","","","","United States","2003-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 250-259","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0808002285","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826856","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826856","","Nuclear Technology","3","142"

To evaluate the fuel in terms of its in-reactor performance, some of the important out-of-pile thermophysical and thermomechanical property data like the coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and hot hardness have been generated as a function of temperature. The out-of-pile chemical compatibility of the fuel with Type 316 stainless steel (20% cold-worked) cladding material has also been established experimentally. From the data generated in these measurements, it has been concluded that with this fuel the reactor could be operated at full power with a fuel linear heat rating of 400 W/cm.

Numerical computations are obtained with MC3D REPO developed by Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique.Because of heterogeneous power distribution within the bed, two definitions (mean and local) for the critical heat flux (CHF) are proposed. Even in the first case, the CHF was higher than the Lipinsky one-dimensional flux. As the power is being increased, temperature plateaus above saturation temperature are observed. An analysis is proposed, based on possible different hydrodynamic flow configurations occurring in postdryout regimes. In some experiments, some spheres were superficially molten and stacked together, but globally, the bed was still coolable.The influence of operational parameters such as bottom coolant injection, height of the water, fluidization of upper particles, and subcooled liquid injection on dryout phenomena and CHF values are also described.The MC3D-REPO calculations assuming a thermal equilibrium between the three phases gives results in accordance with experimental data.","","","","","","United States","2003-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 270-282","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0810002287","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826858","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826858","","Nuclear Technology","3","142"

Research conducted on the methylation of mercury strongly suggests the process is microbial in nature and facilitated principally by sulfate-reducing bacteria. This study addressed the potential for mercury methylation by varying sulfate treatments and wetland-based soil in microbial slurry reactors with available inorganic mercury. Under anoxic laboratory conditions conducive to growth of naturally occurring sulfate-reducing bacteria in the soil, it was possible to evaluate how various sulfate additions influenced the methylation of inorganic mercury added to overlying water. Treatments included sulfate amendments ranging from 25 to 500 mg/L (0.26 to 5.2 mM) above the soil's natural sulfate level. This study also provided an assessment of mercury methylation relative to sulfate-reducing bacterial population growth and subsequent sulfide production. Mercury methylation in sulfate treatments did not exceed that of the non-amended control during a 35-day incubation. However, increases in methylmercury concentration were linked to bacterial growth and sulfate reduction. A time lag in methylation in the highest treatment correlated with an equivalent lag in bacterial growth.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-05-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; Other Information: PBD: 29 May 2003","","Medium: ED; Size: vp.","","WSRC-MS-2003-00337","AC09-96SR18500","Journal ID: ISSN 0730-7268; ETOCDK; TRN: US0303076","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","811369","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/811369","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/811369","Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","",""

Considerable efforts have been made in various countries and organizations in this direction. Appropriate benchmarks need to be developed that will permit testing of two particular aspects. One is to verify the capability of the coupled codes to analyze complex transients with coupled core-plant interactions. The second is to test fully the neutronics/T-H coupling. One such benchmark is the Pressurized Water Reactor Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) Benchmark problem. It was sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and The Pennsylvania State University. The benchmark problem uses a 3-D neutronics core model that is based on real plant design and operational data for the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power plant. The purpose of this benchmark is threefold: to verify the capability of system codes for analyzing complex transients with coupled core-plant interactions; to test fully the 3-D neutronics/T-H coupling; and to evaluate discrepancies among the predictions of coupled codes in best-estimate transient simulations. The purposes of the benchmark are met through the application of three exercises: a point kinetics plant simulation (exercise 1), a coupled 3-D neutronics/core T-H evaluation of core response (exercise 2), and a best-estimate coupled core-plant transient model (exercise 3).In this paper we present the three exercises of the MSLB benchmark, and we summarize the findings of the participants with regard to the current numerical and computational issues of coupled calculations. In addition, this paper reviews in some detail the sensitivity studies on exercises 2 and 3 performed by the benchmark team using the coupled code TRAC-PF1/NEM. The purpose of these supporting studies was to aid participants in developing their models.","","","","","","United States","2003-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 95-115","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0797002274","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826845","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826845","","Nuclear Technology","2","142"
"Effects of Secondary Circuit Modeling on Results of Pressurized Water Reactor Main Steam Line Break Benchmark Calculations with New Coupled Code TRAB-3D/SMABRE","Daavittila, Antti; Haemaelaeinen, Anitta; Kyrki-Rajamaeki, Riitta","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BENCHMARKS; FINLAND; PWR TYPE REACTORS; REACTOR KINETICS; SIMULATION; STEAM LINES; THERMAL HYDRAULICS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS; TRANSIENTS","All of the three exercises of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Regulatory Commission pressurized water reactor main steam line break (PWR MSLB) benchmark were calculated at VTT, the Technical Research Centre of Finland. For the first exercise, the plant simulation with point-kinetic neutronics, the thermal-hydraulics code SMABRE was used. The second exercise was calculated with the three-dimensional reactor dynamics code TRAB-3D, and the third exercise with the combination TRAB-3D/SMABRE. VTT has over ten years' experience of coupling neutronic and thermal-hydraulic codes, but this benchmark was the first time these two codes, both developed at VTT, were coupled together. The coupled code system is fast and efficient; the total computation time of the 100-s transient in the third exercise was 16 min on a modern UNIX workstation. The results of all the exercises are similar to those of the other participants. In order to demonstrate the effect of secondary circuit modeling on the results, three different cases were calculated. In case 1 there is no phase separation in the steam lines and no flow reversal in the aspirator. In case 2 the flow reversal in the aspirator is allowed, but there is no phase separation in the steam lines. Finally, in case 3 the drift-flux model is used for the phase separation in the steam lines, but the aspirator flow reversal is not allowed. With these two modeling variations, it is possible to cover a remarkably broad range of results. The maximum power level reached after the reactor trip varies from 534 to 904 MW, the range of the time of the power maximum being close to 30 s. Compared to the total calculated transient time of 100 s, the effect of the secondary side modeling is extremely important.","","","","","","United States","2003-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 116-123","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0798002275","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826846","","Nuclear Technology","2","142"

An attempt is made to explain the differences observed in the solutions by the different modeling of physical processes in the codes. The sensitivity of results on modeling features is also investigated. In addition, the effect of different mapping schemes between fuel assemblies of the core loading and the thermal-fluid dynamics on the accuracy of three-dimensional (3-D) neutronics solutions is studied. The results for the MSLB transient are also evaluated to compare 3-D neutronics and point-kinetics solutions in view of integral and local parameters.

Both the external and internal coupling options of R/P/C have been considered for exercise 3; i.e., the COBRA module of PANBOX was used to calculate the core thermal hydraulics in the external coupling option, whereas the core thermal hydraulics of RELAP5 was used in the internal coupling option. For the representation of thermal-hydraulic channels, a fine channel geometry based on the 177 fuel assemblies was selected for the external coupling option, and a coarse channel geometry based on 19 coarse channels has been investigated for the internal coupling option. The comparison of the results shows very good agreement of important core parameters between the considered coupling variants. Both exercises 2 and 3 have been investigated with respect to local safety parameters like fuel centerline temperatures and minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratios using the on-line hot subchannel analysis capability of R/P/C in the external coupling option. The results show that both quantities are far from the safety-related limits.The benchmark demonstrates, that R/P/C - as part of the integrated CASCADE-3D core analysis system of Framatome ANP GmbH - has proven to be a powerful tool for detailed analyses of an MSLB accident.","","","","","","United States","2003-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 137-145","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0800002277","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826848","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826848","","Nuclear Technology","2","142"

The reference problem is an MSLB in a pressurized water reactor at end of cycle. The analyses were performed with the 3-D core model DYN3D, the thermal-hydraulic system code ATHLET, and the coupled code DYN3D/ATHLET. The results of the DYN3D and ATHLET simulations based on the specification are compared with the results of other participants in the final OECD reports. The effect of the thermal-hydraulic nodalization of the core, i.e., the number of coolant channels, and the influence of the coolant mixing inside the pressure vessel are studied in the paper. Calculations with a reduced number of coolant channels are performed often in coupled calculations for saving computational time. Results of a 25-channel model were compared with the 177-channel calculation (1 channel per assembly). The results for global parameters like nuclear power show only small differences for the two models; however, the prediction of local parameters such as maximum fuel temperatures requires a detailed thermal-hydraulic modeling. The effect of different coolant mixing within the reactor pressure vessel is investigated. It is shown that the influence of coolant mixing mitigates the accident consequences when 3-D neutron kinetics is applied. In case of point kinetics, coolant mixing leads to an opposite effect. To profit from the 3-D core model, a realistic description of the coolant mixing in the coupled codes is a topic of further investigations.","","","","","","United States","2003-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 146-153","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0801002278","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826849","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826849","","Nuclear Technology","2","142"

The overall activity has been completed within the framework of the participation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations-Nuclear Science Committee pressurized water reactor MSLB benchmark.Thermal-hydraulic system codes (various versions of Relap5), three-dimensional (3-D) neutronics codes (Parcs, Quabbox, and Nestle), and one subchannel code (Cobra) have been adopted for the analysis. Results from the following codes (or code versions) are assumed as reference:1. Relap5/mod3.2.2, beta version, coupled with the 3-D neutron kinetics Parcs code parallel virtual machine (PVM) coupling2. Relap5/mod3.2.2, gamma version, coupled with the 3-D neutron kinetics Quabbox code (direct coupling)3. Relap5/3D code coupled with the 3-D neutron kinetics Nestle code.The influence of PVM and of direct coupling is also discussed.Boundary and initial conditions of the system, including those relevant to the fuel status, have been supplied by Pennsylvania State University in cooperation with GPU Nuclear Corporation (the utility, owner of TMI) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The comparison among the results obtained by adopting the same thermal-hydraulic nodalization and the coupled code version is discussed in this paper.The capability of the control rods to recover the accident has been demonstrated in all the cases as well as the capability of all the codes to predict the time evolution of the assigned transient. However, one stuck control rod caused some 'recriticality' or 'return to power' whose magnitude is largely affected by boundary and initial conditions.","","","","","","United States","2003-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 180-204","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0804002281","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826852","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826852","","Nuclear Technology","2","142"

As a first step in the application of these codes, an assessment of both codes for the analysis of reactivity-initiated transients in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) was performed. For that purpose, the Nuclear Energy Agency benchmark exercises, consisting of rod ejection and uncontrolled rod bank withdrawal transients, were selected. These analyses showed that very satisfactory results could be obtained with both CORETRAN and RETRAN-3D. In this paper, a summary of the PWR results, along with an emphasis of important modeling options that were identified during that work, is presented. As a second step, it was considered important to assess both codes for boiling water reactor (BWR) reactivity transients. Therefore, in addition, the analysis of a hypothetical beyond-design-basis rod drop accident for a Swiss BWR core at end of cycle is presented in this paper. This transient, which was previously analyzed with another 3-D code at PSI, shows that also for BWRs, both codes give satisfactory results.","","","","","","United States","2003-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 19-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0792002269","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826840","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826840","","Nuclear Technology","1","142"

Good predictions of such processes by system codes such as RETRAN-3D are, therefore, important from a safety and operational point of view.For this reason, and continuing the validation efforts carried out in the STARS Project at Paul Scherrer Institute, data from experiments in a uniformly heated tube carried out by Bartolomey et al. have been used to assess the subcooled and saturated nucleate boiling models in RETRAN-3D. These experiments were performed at high ({approx}15-MPa) and medium ({approx}7-, 4-, and 3-MPa) pressures. The heat flux (2210 to 420 kW/m{sup 2}) and mass flux (2123 to 405 kg/s m{sup 2}) were selected to cover a range of values spanning operating and transient situations in both BWRs and PWRs.This paper reports on the results obtained with both the four- and five-equation RETRAN-3D flow models. The results show that both models used in RETRAN-3D provide good estimates of subcooled and saturated nucleate boiling in heated tubes. The four-equation model, which makes use of the Electric Power Research Institute void fraction profile fitting model for the reactivity feedback only, shows the best performance for high mass fluxes, whereas the five-equation model, which directly computes the vaporization rate, performs better at low mass fluxes and relatively high heat fluxes.In addition to the results from RETRAN-3D, results obtained with the system code RELAP-5 are included in the plots and used to support the conclusions and to perform a comparative analysis of the methods used by the codes.","","","","","","United States","2003-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 47-63","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0794002271","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826842","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826842","","Nuclear Technology","1","142"

The tests involved steam and helium injection into a preheated, spray-moderated, 1/4-scale model of a pressurized water reactor dry containment. Comparison of GOTHIC predictions to measured data for pressure, vapor temperatures, structure surface temperatures, and helium concentrations provided the opportunity to evaluate methods for modeling gas dispersion, drop heat and mass transfer, and surface heat transfer.The test facility includes three floors. The lower two floors are partitioned into a variety of rooms that simulate the lower regions of the modeled containment. On the upper floor, rooms that simulate the steam generator enclosures and the pressurizer enclosure extend into the dome, which represents about two-thirds of the total volume of the containment.The GOTHIC model was defined with 30 control volumes using a mix of lumped parameter volumes and subdivided volumes that employ a three-dimensional mesh. Each volume included several thermal conductors to model the various structures. More than 100 flow paths were used to model the hydraulic connections.Comparison of predictions to data showed that enhanced grid resolution in the vicinity of the steam-helium release point served to limit dispersion of the steam-helium plume. The data comparisons also suggested that spray effectiveness was reduced by drop impact with the containment wall and by the high drop concentration. The data comparisons further suggested that the presence of condensation, sprays, splashing, and other wetting mechanisms should be considered to obtain a reasonable estimate of the effect of liquid films on the structure surfaces.","","","","","","United States","2003-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 77-91","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0796002273","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826844","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826844","","Nuclear Technology","1","142"

Microstructural characterization revealed that small faulted dislocation loops and cavities were visible at each position, but the cavities were most prominent at the two shank positions. Measurable swelling exists in the shank portions of this particular bolt, and accompanying this swelling is the retention of very high levels of hydrogen absorbed from the environment. The observation of cavities in the CW 316SS at temperatures and doses relevant to LWR conditions has important implications for pressurized water reactors since SA 304SS plates surround the bolts, a steel that usually swells earlier due to its lower incubation period for swelling.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials; Journal Volume: 317; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Apr 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 32-45","","PNNL-SA-37983","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3115; JNUMAM; KC0201020; TRN: US200434%%41","10.1016/S0022-3115(03)00003-5","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15003489","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15003489","","Journal of Nuclear Materials","1","317"

Water-reflected and unreflected 80-cm-diam cylindrical cores were used to obtain the systematic data of critical solution height and differential reactivity for various uranium concentrations from 190 to 240 g/l. The numerically evaluated extrapolation length of neutron flux distribution was in good agreement with the experimental result. The effective neutron multiplication factor k{sub eff} for each core configuration and the effect of uncertainties on k{sub eff} were also numerically evaluated with both the detailed experimental configuration of critical cores and a benchmark model provided for the validation of nuclear calculation codes. The MCNP 4B was used for the evaluation calculations with JENDL-3.2 cross-section library, and the value of the k{sub eff} of the benchmark model was reproduced within the difference of 0.05% {delta}k{sub eff} for the water-reflector cores and 0.17% {delta}k{sub eff} for the unreflected cores.","","","","","","United States","2003-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 221-232","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0784002261","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826832","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826832","","Nuclear Technology","3","141"

Through the failed bottom wall, part of the corium can flow into the cavity, and air can enter the primary circuit. The residual fuel in the core periphery will be further oxidized in air atmosphere. The degradation process will accelerate, and new chemical species will be formed, which can have an impact on the release of radioactive materials.Two experiments were carried out with electrically heated nine-rod pressurized water reactor-type bundles in the CODEX (COre Degradation EXperiment) facility to provide experimental data on the behavior of real fuel bundles under air oxidation conditions. The main objective of the tests was the investigation of oxidation phenomena, and some other important aspects (e.g., enhanced fission product release) were not addressed.The CODEX air ingress tests indicated the acceleration of oxidation phenomena and core degradation processes during the late phase of the vessel melt through accident, when air can have access to the residual fuel bundles in the reactor core. The degradation process was accompanied with zirconium-nitride formation and release of uranium-rich aerosols.","","","","","","United States","2003-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 244-256","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0786002263","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826834","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826834","","Nuclear Technology","3","141"

In German Konvoi plants passive autocatalytic recombiners have been selected for hydrogen risk reduction. This paper proposes a new further improved option by taking credit from both the recombiners for hydrogen releases on slow timescales and the large load-carrying capacity of the spherical steel containment for rapid releases. Therefore, the capacity of spherical steel containment shells is investigated in some detail. The hydrogen and steam distribution in the containment is simulated for a rather conservative accident scenario with a rapid hydrogen release; a large hydrogen detonation is assumed and the transient containment loads as well as the structural containment response are calculated. For all these analyses advanced methods with high time and space resolutions are applied.Detailed evaluations of the structural results considering recent experimental findings suggest that the spherical steel containment can carry the detonation loads. For the final assessment additional accident scenarios must be considered and more plant specific finite element models for the structural response must be applied. Some very local integrity issues need further investigations.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 109-121","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0775002252","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826823","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826823","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

The optimizer has been linked to the reactor analysis code PANTHER for the automated evaluation of loading patterns in a two-dimensional geometry, which is collapsed from the three-dimensional reactor model. GAOPT uses a directed stochastic (Monte Carlo) algorithm to generate initial population members, within predetermined constraints, for use in GAs, which apply the standard genetic operators: selection by tournament, crossover, and mutation. The GAOPT is able to generate and optimize loading patterns for successive reactor cycles (multicycle) within acceptable CPU times even on single-processor systems. The algorithm allows radial shuffling of fuel assemblies in a multicycle refueling optimization, which is constructed to aid long-term core management planning decisions. This paper presents the application of the GA-based optimization to two AGR stations, which apply different in-core management operational rules. Results obtained from the testing of GAOPT are discussed.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 122-141","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0776002253","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826824","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

This multidimensional model has been validated with plant operational data and other computer simulations of a thermal-hydraulic transient. The simulated transient considered was a large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LB LOCA).A validated, 1-D control model of the NPP, for the study of the effects of mixed oxide fuel, was modified to include a standard fuel loading of UO{sub 2}. The development of the 3-D sections of the reactor vessel consisted of ensuring geometrical fidelity with the design of the modeled plant, the Balakovo Unit 4 NPP in Saratov, Russia. A stable operational steady state was obtained and the calculated plant conditions compared well with the design values of the Balakovo plant. Transient results verified that the simulated thermal-hydraulic conditions of the multidimensional model agreed well with both the control and analyses that have been performed separately from this study.It was found that the multidimensional model has shown a reduction in the calculated hot-spot peak-clad temperature (PCT) during the blowdown stage of a LB LOCA and an increase in PCT during the reflood stage. A preliminary uncertainty analysis of the PCT during blowdown stage was performed using a response surface method of the Code Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty Method and a significant number of relevant input variables. From the preliminary analysis, the PCT reduction during blowdown appears to be significant, but a further, more detailed analysis should be performed, along with an uncertainty analysis of the PCT during the reflood stage.The enhanced depiction of the flow patterns and temperature distributions in the transient situation allowed the user further understanding of the thermal-hydraulic conditions throughout the transient. The developed model proved to be suitable for analysis of the VVER-1000 plant, but to further the applicability of the model, a 3-D kinetics model of the neutronics and 3-D hydrodynamic models of the horizontal steam generators should be included.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 142-156","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0777002254","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826825","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

These rods are classified into two types. The first type is 'multipurpose control rod', and the other type is 'regulating control rod'. Two multipurpose control rod banks (LSWCR1, LSWCR2) and three regulating control rod banks (LSWCR5, LSWCR4, LSWCR3) are suggested and developed. The moving characteristics of LSWCRs, related to variation of reactivity and the axial offset (AO), are analyzed, and the operation strategy for LSWCRs is established. Then, an application of LSWCRs for the power maneuvering is performed using the developed strategy, and the reference daily load pattern is 100-50-100%, 2-6-2-14h pattern that is appropriate for operation of the electric grid in Korea. From the results, it is shown that the combinative use of multipurpose control rods (LSWCR1, LSWCR2) makes it possible to control the AO within the target band during the power maneuvering. Also, the results show that the power maneuvering without reactivity compensation by change of boron concentration is accomplished, and consequently the minimization of boron concentration change is possible.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 157-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0778002255","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826826","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826826","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

These fuels are characterized by a high-MA content and the lack of the classical fertile materials such as {sup 238}U or {sup 232}Th. Dedicated fuels still have to be developed; however, programs are under way for their fabrication, irradiation, and testing. In Europe, mainly the oxide route is investigated and developed. A dedicated core will contain multiple 'critical' fuel masses, resulting in a certain recriticality potential under core degradation conditions. The use of dedicated fuels may also lead to strong deterioration of the safety parameters of the reactor core, such as, e.g., the void worth, Doppler or the kinetics quantities, neutron generation time, and {beta}{sub eff}. Critical reactors with this kind of fuel might encounter safety problems, especially under severe accident conditions. For ADSs, it is assumed that because of the subcriticality of the system, the poor safety features of such fuels could be coped with. Analyses reveal some safety problems for ADSs with dedicated fuels. Additional inherent and passive safety measures are proposed to achieve the required safety level. A safety strategy along the lines of a defense approach is presented where these measures can be integrated. The ultimate goal of these measures is to eliminate any mechanistic severe accident scenario and the potential for energetics.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 186-201","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0781002258","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826829","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826829","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

The development of leaks in these vessels can result in costly downtime for the facility. A Vessel Integrity Monitoring System (VIMS) is developed to detect leak formation and estimate the size of the leak to allow evaluation of the risk associated with continued operation. A wide range of leak configurations and fluid flow phenomena are considered in the evaluation of the rate at which a tracer gas dissolved in the cooling jacket water is transported into the vacuum vessel. A methodology is presented that uses basic fluid flow models and careful evaluation of their ranges of applicability to provide a conservative estimate of the transport rates for the tracer gas and hence the time required for the VIMS to detect a leak of a given size.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 202-210","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0782002259","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826830","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826830","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

However, the effect of burnup was not accounted for in previous studies. In this work, the combined effect of fuel burnup, pitch among fuel elements, and number of uniformly mixed absorber rods for a square arrangement on the spent-fuel pool k{sub eff} is investigated.The Monte Carlo computer code MCNP4B with the ENDF-B/VI library and detailed three dimensional geometry was used. The WIMS-D code was used to model the isotopic composition of the standard TRIGA and FLIP fuel for 5, 10, 20 and 30% burnup level and 2- and 4-yr cooling time.The results show that out of the three studied effects, pitch from contact (3.75 cm) up to rack design pitch (8 cm), number of absorbers from zero to eight, and burnup up to 30%, the pitch has the greatest influence on the multiplication factor k{sub eff}. In the interval in which the pitch was changed, k{sub eff} decreased for up to {approx}0.4 for standard and {approx}0.3 for FLIP fuel. The number of absorber rods affects the multiplication factor much less. This effect is bigger for more compact arrangements, e.g., for contact of standard fuel elements with eight absorber rods among them, k{sub eff} values are smaller for {approx}0.2 ({approx}0.1 for FLIP) than for arrangements without absorber rods almost regardless of the burnup. The effect of burnup is the smallest. For standard fuel elements, it is {approx}0.1 for almost all pitches and numbers of absorbers. For FLIP fuel, it is smaller for a factor of 3, but increases with the burnup for compact arrangements. Cooling time of fuel has just a minor effect on the k{sub eff} of spent-fuel pool and can be neglected in spent-fuel pool design.","","","","","","United States","2003-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 211-219","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0783002260","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826831","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826831","","Nuclear Technology","2","141"

Mixing of the low-boron water with the ambient coolant of higher boron content provides an important mitigation mechanism before the low-boron water enters the core.Experimental support is needed to validate the computational tools to be applied to analyze the mixing of the low-boron water. Experiments were performed in the three test facilities - the Upper Plenum Test Facility (UPTF), the Primaerkreislauf (PKL), and the Rossendorf coolant mixing model (ROCOM) - in Germany.The relevant PKL and UPTF tests were focused on small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) scenarios with reflux-condenser mode and restart of natural circulation. The two test facilities represent a typical western-type PWR and are/were operated by Siemens/KWU now Framatome ANP in Germany. While the restart of natural circulation was investigated in the PKL system test facility (volume 1:145, height 1:1), the UPTF experiments dealt with the mixing of water flows with different boron concentration in the cold legs, reactor pressure vessel (RPV) downcomer, and the lower plenum (all these components were full-scale models).The results from the PKL test facility demonstrate that in case of a postulated SBLOCA with reflux condensation phase, natural circulation does not start up simultaneously in all loops. This means that slugs of condensate, which might have accumulated in the pump seal during reflux-condenser mode of operation, would reach the RPV at different points in time. The UPTF tests showed an almost ideal mixing of water flows with different boron concentration in the RPV downcomer.The ROCOM test facility has been built in a linear scale of 1:5 for the investigation of coolant mixing phenomena in a wide range of flow conditions in the RPV of the German KONVOI-type PWR. The test results presented are focused on the mixing of a slug of deborated water during the startup of the first reactor coolant pump. Based on experimentally determined pulse responses, a semianalytical model for the description of coolant mixing inside the KONVOI RPV has been developed. Calculations for a presumed boron dilution event during the startup of the first reactor coolant pump have been carried out by means of the semianalytical model and independently by means of the computational fluid dynamics code CFX-4. The semianalytical model is able to describe the time dependent behavior of the deboration front at each fuel element position in a good agreement with the experiment. All main mixing effects, observed in the experiment, are also reproduced by the CFX calculation.","","","","","","United States","2003-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 141; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 88-107","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0774002251","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826822","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826822","","Nuclear Technology","1","141"

The main core parameters are evaluated in the first and in the equilibrium cycles as a function of the pin diameter in the 6.35- to 10.4-mm range, pin pitch-to-diameter (p/d) ratio in the 1.308 to 1.495 range, and reactor power in the 300- to 1500-MW(electric) range. To mitigate the transient-overpower accident, a requisite is to have a burnup reactivity ({delta}k{sub Bu}) &lt; {beta}{sub eff} in the equilibrium cycle. The use of enriched uranium results in a poor core conversion ratio, and this fuel must be replaced as quickly as possible by the generated plutonium. In the equilibrium cycle the burnup reactivity goal is achieved for core power of 300 MW(electric) using a pin diameter of 10.4 mm and p/d of 1.308. The lead void reactivity is negative for reactor power lower than 750 MW(electric). The Doppler effect is small, as expected in a fast reactor loaded with metallic fuel. The fast fluence limit of 4.0 x 10{sup 23} n/cm{sup 2} is a restrictive parameter of the ILR, and to obtain the burnup of 100 GWd/t HM, a core optimization is needed. All the base accident evaluation and the optimization of the ILR are still to be performed.","","","","","","United States","2002-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 233-254","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0757002234","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826805","","Nuclear Technology","3","140"

Comparison of the neutron balance tables of an LWR (1982 design) and an 'advanced' Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor explained that the relatively low fuel efficiency of the LWR was not primarily a consequence of water moderator absorptions. Rather, the comparatively low LWR fuel efficiency resulted from its use of poison to hold down startup reactivity together with other neutron losses. The research showed that each neutron saved could reduce fuel consumption by about 5%. In a typical LWR some 5 neutrons (out of 100) were absorbed in control poisons over a cycle. There are even more parasitic and leakage neutron absorptions. The objective of the research was to find ways to minimize control, parasitic, and other neutron losses aimed at improved LWR fuel consumption. Further research developed the concept of 'putting neutrons in the bank' in {sup 238}U early in life and 'drawing them out of the bank' late in life by burning the {sup 239}Pu produced. Conceptual designs were explored that could both control the reactor and substantially improve fuel efficiency and minimize separative work requirements.The U.S. Department of Energy augmented its high burnup fuel program based on the research in the late 1970s. As a result of the success of this program, fuel burnup in U.S. LWRs has almost doubled in the intervening two decades.","","","","","","United States","2002-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 350-355","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0765002242","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826813","","Nuclear Technology","3","140"

Many of these same locations will also experience displacement rates that are also lower than that of most in-core fast reactor experiments, 10-7 to 10-8 dpa/s. One question of particular interest is how to define the lower limit of the temperature range over which void swelling can occur, especially at such lower dpa rates. This question was addressed using a flow restrictor component from the low-flux breeder zone of the BN-350 fast reactor in Kazakhstan. This component was constructed of annealed 12X18H10T, an alloy similar to AISI 321. Extensive sectioning to produce 114 separate specimens, followed by examination of the radiation-induced microstructure showed that void swelling in the range of temperatures and dpa rates of interest occurs down to approximately 300 degrees C. At 330 degrees C the swelling reached approximately 1 percent at 20 dpa. Comparison of these data with other published data on this steel from Russian light water reactors at less than 10 dpa confirms that the lowest temperature that stainless steels can begin swelling also appears to be approximately 300 degrees C. Since fusion and LWR spectra generate similar levels of hydrogen and helium, it is expected that these conclusions are equally applicable to both types of reactors when operating at comparable dpa rates.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The parameters of the neuro-fuzzy inference system that estimates the relevant sensor signal are optimized by a genetic algorithm and a least-squares algorithm. The wavelet denoising technique was applied to remove noise components in input signals into the neuro-fuzzy system. By reducing the dimension of an input space into the neuro-fuzzy system without losing a significant amount of information, the PCA was used to reduce the time necessary to train the neuro-fuzzy system, simplify the structure of the neuro-fuzzy inference system, and also, make easy the selection of the input signals into the neuro-fuzzy system. By using the residual signals between the estimated signals and the measured signals, the SPRT is applied to detect whether the sensors are degraded or not. The proposed sensor-monitoring algorithm was verified through applications to the pressurizer water level, the pressurizer pressure, and the hot-leg temperature sensors in pressurized water reactors.","","","","","","United States","2002-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 178-197","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0753002230","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826801","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826801","","Nuclear Technology","2","140"

Prototype silicon carbide ex-core neutron detectors have been assembled and tested under research reactor conditions simulating ex-core neutron monitoring requirements. Linear, pulse-mode operation without the need for gamma compensation has been demonstrated with these prototype detectors. The silicon carbide detectors are compared to presently deployed gas-filled ex-vessel detectors, and several advantages of the silicon carbide technology can be seen. It is anticipated that a wide-range silicon carbide neutron detector can be designed to replace the combined functions of the multiple power range detectors in use.

This instrument works by heating an element of reactor fuel to a constant temperature with an electric heater, such that input electrical power is inversely related to the deposited nuclear power. Tests on first-generation sensor prototypes and subsequent modeling showed three problems: lack of proportionality in the relative neutron and photon response, a relatively low bandwidth, and drift. A model of the sensor has been developed and used to optimize the design of second-generation prototypes with respect to these three problems. Study of the predicted relative neutron and gamma response showed that a nonuniform distribution of nuclear and electrical energy deposition caused the temperature distribution within the sensor to change as the ratio of the energy components varies. This affects sensor power proportionality and increases response time. Heat transfer through the sensor power leads was demonstrated to cause most of the observed drift. The proposed second-generation sensor design forces almost all of the temperature gradient into a thin metal axial region, which gives uniform energy distribution from all sources and better control of thermal leakage and contact resistances. This results in a prediction of increased bandwidth with improved proportionality.","","","","","","United States","2002-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 209-221","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0755002232","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826803","","Nuclear Technology","2","140"

The feedforward control, which is generated via nonlinear programming, is added to the robust FBC system to further improve the control performance. The plant uncertainties, including unmodeled dynamics, linearization, and model reduction, are characterized and estimated. The comparisons of simulation responses based on a nonlinear reactor model demonstrate the achievement of the proposed controller with specified performance and endurance under uncertainty.

The measurement was performed when the boron concentration decreased under 300 ppm in the reactor coolant system, by using the boron dilution method. Detailed calculations were made to estimate all reactivity effects taking place during such a measurement. These effects can only be accounted for through static core calculations that allow calculating contributions to the reactivity change induced by the moderator temperature change. All the calculations were performed with the Studsvik Scandpower SIMULATE-3 code. Analysis of the measurement showed that the contribution of the Doppler effect (in the fuel) was almost negligible, whereas the reactivity effects due to other than the Doppler fuel coefficient and the boron change were surprisingly significant. It was concluded that due to the experimental inaccuracies, the uncertainty associated with the boron dilution method could be much larger than previously expected. The MTC might then be close to -72 pcm/degC, whereas the main goal of the measurement is to verify that the MTC is larger (less negative) than this threshold. The usefulness of the boron dilution method for MTC measurements can therefore be questioned.","","","","","","United States","2002-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 147-163","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0750002227","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826798","","Nuclear Technology","2","140"

By drastically decreasing the amount of materials through these measures, it is expected that the construction cost will be reduced to below 200,000 yen/kW(electric), i.e., below two-thirds times that of light water reactors at present.

Current CHF models in the literature, such as the Mishima/Nishihara and Oh/Englert CHF models, are based on macroscopic system parameters and not local thermal-hydraulic conditions. These macroscopic parameter-based models cannot be readily used for analysis in transient best-estimate thermal-hydraulic codes. The present work focuses on developing a low-flow-rate CHF correlation, based on local conditions, that is amenable to implementation into a best-estimate transient thermal-hydraulic code for a small-hydraulic-diameter duct. The model development proceeds with a means of correlating CHF data to local conditions parameters and then applying a correction factor to the resulting correlation, subsequently permitting accurate predictions over a range of pressures. An evaluation of the proposed local conditions-based CHF model is conducted by predicting independent sets of CHF experimental results over a range of flow rate, pressure, and subcooling conditions. Conclusions on the viability of the proposed CHF model and suggestions for future efforts in improving the reflood heat transfer CHF models for small-hydraulic-diameter ducts are provided with an evaluation of the model results.","","","","","","United States","2002-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0741002218","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826789","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826789","","Nuclear Technology","1","140"

For the 80-MW(thermal) design, the calculations show that no structural problems occur as long as the accelerator proton beam is switched off immediately after accident initiation. A highly unlikely delay of beam stop by 30 min after a combined loss-of-heat-sink and loss-of-flow accident would lead to increased reactor vessel temperatures, which do not cause creep failure. By using a melt-rupture disk on the vacuum pipe of the accelerator proton beam to interrupt the beam at elevated temperatures in a passive manner, the grace time before beam stop is necessary is increased from 30 min to 6 h. An emergency decay heat removal design, which would prevent radioactive release to the atmosphere even more reliably than the Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (PRISM) design, was also investigated. For an ADS of 250-MW(thermal) power with the same vessel as the 80-MW(thermal) ADS examined, the maximum wall temperature reaches 745 K after an immediate beam stop. This does not cause any structural problems either. The grace time until a beam stop becomes necessary for the 250-MW(thermal) system was found to be {approx}12 min. To reduce elevated vessel temperatures more rapidly after a beam stop, alternative cooling methods were investigated, for example, filling the gap between the reactor and the guard vessel with liquid metal and the simultaneous use of water spray cooling on the outside of the guard vessel. This decreases the coolant temperatures already within minutes after switching off the proton beam. The use of chimneys on the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system, which increase the airflow rate lowers the maximum reactor vessel wall temperature only by {approx}20 K. It can be concluded that the critical parameter for the emergency cooling of an ADS is the time delay in switching off the accelerator after accident initiation.","","","","","","United States","2002-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-40","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0742002219","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826790","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826790","","Nuclear Technology","1","140"

It is periodically recovered by setting up a cell configuration in which the pool is made the anode and uranium is electrodeposited on a solid cathode mandrel. A theoretical model is used to determine the current structure of the liquid cadmium anode. The model is validated by comparing against the measured composition of the cathode deposits. Multinodal simulations are conducted to explain the bell shape of deposits observed with this mode of electrotransport. The simulations also determine the dependence of collection efficiency on the electrical charge passed that is functionally consistent with the experimental data. Finally, a simplified operating map of the electrorefiner is presented that can be used to determine the conditions for growing cathode deposits of target composition.","","","","","","United States","2002-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 140; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 41-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0743002220","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826791","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826791","","Nuclear Technology","1","140"

In the first stage, the LP is optimized using an improved GA operator. In the second stage, an exposure-dependent control rod pattern (CRP) is sought using GA with an if-then heuristic rule. The procedure of the improved GA is based on deterministic operators that consist of crossover, mutation, and selection. The handling of the encoding technique and constraint conditions by that GA reflects the peculiar characteristics of the BWR. In addition, strategies such as elitism and self-reproduction are effectively used in order to improve the search speed. The LP evaluations were performed with a three-dimensional diffusion code that coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic models. Strong axial heterogeneities and constraints dependent on three dimensions have always necessitated the use of three-dimensional core simulators for BWRs, so that optimization of computational efficiency is required. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated by successfully generating LPs for an actual BWR plant in two phases. One phase is only LP optimization applying the Haling technique. The other phase is an LP optimization that considers the CRP during reactor operation. In test calculations, candidates that shuffled fresh and burned fuel assemblies within a reasonable computation time were obtained.","","","","","","United States","2002-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 119-139","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0198106966","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20804804","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20804804","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","142"

An improved computer model by the name of DEMACE was employed to evaluate the performance of NMCA throughout the primary coolant circuit (PCC) of a commercial BWR. The molar ratios of hydrogen to oxidizing species in the PCC under normal water chemistry and HWC are analyzed. The effectiveness of NMCA is justified by calculated electrochemical corrosion potential (ECP) around the PCC and in a local power range monitoring (LPRM) housing tube, in which practical in-vessel ECP measurements are normally taken.Prior to the modeling work for the BWR, the Mixed Potential Model, which is embedded in DEMACE and responsible for ECP calculation, was calibrated against both laboratory and plant ECP data. After modeling for various HWC conditions, it is found that the effectiveness of NMCA in the PCC of the selected BWR varies from region to region. In particular, the predicted ECP in the LPRM housing tube is notably different from that in the nearby bulk environment under NMCA, indicating that cautions must be given to a possible, undesirable outcome due to a distinct ECP difference between a locally confined area and the actual bulk environment.","","","","","","United States","2002-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 142; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 220-229","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0207106975","10.13182/NSE01-72","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","20804813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20804813","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","142"

The OMEGA test simulated the blowdown phase of a double-ended cold-leg break, whereas the ISP-26 test simulated a small break (5%) in a full height, volume (1/48), and power ({approx}1/342) scaled facility representing a typical two (or four)-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR) system.The RETRAN-3D results for the OMEGA test show good estimates of the important system parameters, with the best agreement corresponding to the use of the dynamic-slip flow model. A sensitivity analysis on the break flow showed that the Henry/Fauske-Isoenthalpic Expansion critical flow model yields the best results, which are significantly improved with a refined nodalization upstream of the break.The ISP-26 was also simulated using the dynamic-slip flow model. The results indicate that the code is able to calculate a small-break LOCA with a model including the main PWR system components and to reproduce the principal physical processes in a reasonable manner.In summary, this assessment shows the ability of RETRAN-3D to model LOCA scenarios in a reasonable way and also points to areas where further model improvement could result in more accurate simulations.","","","","","","United States","2002-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 185-204","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0734002211","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826782","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826782","","Nuclear Technology","3","139"

Although the best-estimate LOCA licensing methodology can provide the greatest margin on the peak cladding temperature (PCT) evaluation during a LOCA, it generally takes much more resources to develop. Instead, implementation of evaluation models required by Appendix K of 10CFR50 on an advanced thermal-hydraulic platform such as RELAP5, TRAC, etc., also can gain significant margin for the PCT calculation. Through compliance evaluation against Appendix K of 10CFR50, all of the required evaluation models have been implemented in RELAP5-3D. To verify and assess the development of the Appendix K version of RELAP5-3D, nine kinds of separate-effects experiments and eight sets of LOCA integral experiments were adopted. Through the assessments against separate-effects experiments, the success of the code modification in accordance with Appendix K of 10CFR50 was demonstrated. Besides, one set of a typical integral large-break LOCA from Loss-of-Fluid Test Facility experiments (L2-5) has also been applied to preliminarily evaluate the integral performance of the Appendix K version of RELAP5-3D. The PCT predicted by the evaluation models is greater than the one from best-estimate calculation in the whole LOCA history with the conservatism of 150 K, and the measured PCTs of L2-5 are also well bounded by the evaluation model calculation. Another seven sets of integral-effect experiments will be further applied in the next step to ensure the reasonable integral conservatism of the newly developed LOCA licensing analysis code (RELAP5-3DK/INER), which can cover all the phases of both large- and small LOCA in one code.","","","","","","United States","2002-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 233-252","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0737002214","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826785","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826785","","Nuclear Technology","3","139"

Due to high radiation levels, all these devices must be operated in a hot cell, which is a heavily shielded sealed room. Since these devices must be highly reliable, real-time monitoring is necessary to check that they are working correctly. A real-time three-dimensional graphic simulator is proposed to monitor the spent nuclear fuel dismantlement devices through the Internet.

The validity of the derived theoretical expressions has been assessed for the case of a reactivity perturbation corresponding to the removal of an individual fuel pin from a nominal BWR assembly, thus effectively substituting the pin by water. Such reactivity effects are of importance in the context of evaluating advanced fuel element designs, e.g., those employing part-length rods. Two different geometry models have been implemented for the LWR-PROTEUS critical research facility [full core (FC) and a smaller, reduced geometry (RG)], using the light water reactor assembly code BOXER, and calculations have been performed for the nominal cases (all pins present in the central test assembly) and the perturbed cases (individual pins removed). The FC results have been compared with the results of the RG model with two different boundary conditions (reflective and critical albedo). The comparisons have shown that the results of critical albedo calculations feature superior representability.

A fuel assembly burned in conjunction with fixed absorbers may have a higher reactivity for a given burnup than an assembly that has not used fixed absorbers. As a result, guidance on burnup credit, issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Spent Fuel Project Office, recommends restricting the use of burnup credit to assemblies that have not used burnable absorbers. This recommendation eliminates a large portion of the currently discharged SNF from loading in burnup credit casks and thus severely limits the practical usefulness of burnup credit. Therefore, data are needed to support the extension of burnup credit to additional SNF. This research investigates the effect of various fixed absorbers, including integral burnable absorbers, burnable poison rods, control rods, and axial power shaping rods, on the reactivity of PWR SNF. Trends in reactivity with relevant parameters (e.g., initial fuel enrichment, burnup and absorber type, exposure, and design) are established, and anticipated reactivity effects are quantified. Where appropriate, recommendations are offered for addressing the reactivity effects of the fixed absorbers in burnup-credit safety analyses.","","","","","","United States","2002-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 91-126","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0728002205","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826776","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826776","","Nuclear Technology","2","139"

The imaging system consists of visible-light high-speed digital video, low-energy X-ray digital imaging, and high-energy X-ray digital imaging subsystems. The data provide information concerning the melt jet velocity, melt jet configuration, melt volume fractions, void fractions, and spatial and temporal quantification of premixing length scales for a model fuel-coolant system of molten lead poured into a water pool (fuel temperatures 500 to 1000 K; jet diameters 10 to 30 mm; coolant temperatures 20 to 90 deg. C). Overall results indicate that the FCI has three general regions of behavior, with the high fuel-coolant temperature region similar to what might be expected under severe accident conditions. It was observed that the melt jet leading edge has the highest void fraction and readily fragments into discrete masses, which then subsequently subdivide into smaller masses of length scales &lt;10 mm. The intact jet penetrates &lt;3 to 5 jet length/jet diameter before this breakup occurs into discrete masses, which continue to subdivide. Hydrodynamic instabilities can be visually identified at the leading edge and along the jet column with an interfacial region that consists of melt, vapor, and water. This interface region was observed to grow in size as the water pool temperature was increased, indicating mixing enhancement by boiling processes.","","","","","","United States","2002-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 127-144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0729002206","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826777","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826777","","Nuclear Technology","2","139"

Steam/water flows induced by the break and by the containment sprays would transport debris to the containment floor. Subsequently, debris would likely transport to and accumulate on the suction sump screens of the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) pumps, thereby potentially degrading ECCS performance and possibly even failing the ECCS.A systematic study was conducted on various types of fibrous and metallic foil debris to determine their transport in water. Test results reported include incipient movement, bulk movement, accumulation on a screen, the ability of debris to jump over 5-cm (2-in.) and 15-cm (6-in.) curbs, and the effects of accelerating flow and turbulence. These data are currently being used in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics modeling to determine the potential for each debris type to reach the suction screen.","","","","","","United States","2002-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 145-155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0730002207","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826778","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826778","","Nuclear Technology","2","139"

The Center for Emergency Response, Training, and Analysis (CERTA) located at the headquarters of NSD, Budapest, Hungary, was established in 1997. The center supports the NSD installation, radiological monitoring, and advisory team in case of nuclear emergencies, with appropriate hardware and software for communication, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction. The vital information transfer and analysis (VITA) system represents an important part of the CERTA, as it provides for the continuous remote inspection of the four VVER-440/V213 units of the Hungarian Paks nuclear power plant (NPP). The on-line information system maintains a continuous data link with the NPP through a managed leased line that connects CERTA to a gateway computer located at the Paks NPP. The present scope of the system is a result of a 4-yr development project: In addition to the basic safety parameter display functions, the VITA system now includes an on-line break parameter estimation module, an extensive training package based on simulated transients, and on-line data transfer capabilities to feed accident diagnosis/analysis codes.","","","","","","United States","2002-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 156-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0731002208","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826779","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826779","","Nuclear Technology","2","139"

This facility was constructed to provide a high-intensity, forward-directed beam for use in neutron capture therapy with an epithermal flux of [approximately equal to]10{sup 10} n/cm{sup 2}.s at the medical room entrance with negligible fast neutron and gamma-ray contamination. The fission converter assembly consists of 10 or 11 MITR fuel elements placed in an aluminum tank and cooled with D{sub 2}O. Thermal-hydraulic criteria were established based on heat deposition calculations. Various startup tests were performed to verify expected neutronic and thermal-hydraulic behavior. Flow testing showed an almost flat flow distribution across the fuel elements with &lt;5% bypass flow.

The program includes three activities.The first activity is in-vessel steam explosion. Premixing phenomena are studied in the QUEOS and PREMIX test series. The efficiency of energy conversion is the subject of ECO tests. The BERDA experimental program investigates the load capacity of a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) in steam explosion events.The second activity is hydrogen behavior and mitigation. Advanced models and numerical tools are developed to describe hydrogen sources, distribution of gases in containment, the various modes of hydrogen combustion, and corresponding structural loads.The third activity is ex-vessel melt behavior. The release behavior of melt after RPV failure is studied in DISCO and KAJET tests. In support of core catcher development, interaction with sacrificial and refractory materials, further melt spreading and cooling phenomena are investigated in KAPOOL, KATS, and COMET tests.The goal is to describe and quantify the governing mechanisms and to develop verified models and numerical tools that are able to predict maximum possible loads for severe accident scenarios on full plant scale. The work supported the development and assessment of the safety design of the French-German European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR). It led to a broader understanding of severe accident phenomena and of controlling and mitigating measures that can also be of benefit for existing plants.","","","","","","United States","2002-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 10-20","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0719002196","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826767","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826767","","Nuclear Technology","1","139"

The model is constructed as a module structure with the help of discrete transitional functions of the kinetics, power feedback, and automatic regulator blocks taking into account nonlinear relationships. Good agreement between the calculated and experimental dependence of changes in the power for different changes in the setting reactivity is achieved. Using the model, power transition processes have been evaluated at different values of the parameters of the automatic power regulator (APR). It has been shown that the best transition processes correspond to higher APR rates at the elimination of the APR smoothing unit.

Although the digital PPS can be designed with high reliability, it is considered to be vulnerable to common mode failure (CMF) in the system software, resulting in a total loss of the built-in hardware redundancy. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation has been performed to demonstrate the intrinsic capability of the KSNP design in coping with the design-basis events concurrent with CMF in the digital PPS. Instead of the conservative bounding analysis methodology, a best-estimate analysis methodology has been developed and utilized since the design-basis events accompanied by CMF in the digital PPS are categorized as beyond-design-basis events. An additional reactor trip function on high containment pressure in the diverse protection system (DPS), which is totally diverse from the PPS and is not affected by the CMF in the digital PPS, has been proposed to meet the acceptance criteria of the evaluation results. A variety of diverse means such as the DPS, process control systems, and operator actions including design modification have been verified to be effective in mitigating the design-basis events with CMF in the digital PPS.","","","","","","United States","2002-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 42-49","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0723002200","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826771","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826771","","Nuclear Technology","1","139"

For concepts in which shutdown rods are situated outside the core region, as is the case in contemporary modular pebble bed designs, accurate calculations are needed for the worth of these shutdown rods not only in normal operation but also under accident conditions in which significant changes occur, for instance, due to inadvertant moderation increase in the core (ingress of water or other hydrogeneous compound). Corresponding validation experiments, employing a variety of reactivity measurement techniques, were conducted in the framework of the HTR-PROTEUS program employing low-enriched uranium pebble-type fuel. Details of the experimental configurations, along with the measurement results obtained, are given for two different HTR-PROTEUS cores, in each of which four different shutdown rod combinations were investigated. Comparisons made with calculations, based on both approximative deterministic models and geometrically 'near-to-exact' Monte Carlo analyses, have clearly brought out the sensitivity of the experimental results to calculational correction factors when conventional (thermal) techniques are used for reactivity measurements in such systems. Considerably greater systematic accuracies are reflected in the experimental shutdown rod values obtained using specially developed epithermal techniques, and it is these results that are recommended for benchmarking purposes.","","","","","","United States","2002-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 50-60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0724002201","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826772","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826772","","Nuclear Technology","1","139"

The empirical correlation uses the balance of hydraulic forces acting on the spacer grid. The amount of pressure drop is assumed to depend largely on the reduction of the flow cross section, the flow constriction in the spacer region, and the frictional loss. The grid form drag due to the relative plugging and the flow constriction by the grid components were found to be the primary factors of the total pressure drop. The computational correlation combines the pressure drop due to flow blockage by the spacer grid and the pressure drop calculated by dynamics analysis. The pressure loss coefficients from the empirical correlation agree well with the measured ones for the spacer grids with and without the mixing vane. The computational correlation overpredicts the pressure loss coefficients for the spacer grid with the mixing vane.","","","","","","United States","2002-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 72-79","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0726002203","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826774","","Nuclear Technology","1","139"

Effective multiplication factors for fresh fuel assemblies on the railroad platform, fresh fuel assemblies in the within-plant fuel transportation vehicle, and fresh fuel assemblies in the spent fuel storage pool are calculated. If there is no absorber between the units, the configurations with all MOX assemblies result in higher effective multiplication factors than the configurations with all LEU assemblies when the system is dry. When the systems are flooded, the configurations with all LEU assemblies result in higher effective multiplication factors. For normal operating conditions, effective multiplication factors for all configurations are below the presumed upper subcritical limit of 0.95. For an accident condition of a fully loaded within-plant fuel transportation vehicle that is 'flooded' with low-density water (possibly from a fire suppression system), the presumed upper subcritical limit is exceeded by configurations containing either LEU or a combination of LEU and MOX assemblies.","","","","","","United States","2002-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 80-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0727002204","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826775","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826775","","Nuclear Technology","1","139"

Current Japanese 8 x 8 type Step II BWR fuel from Fukushima Daini Unit 2 was refabricated to short segments, and thermal energy from 272 to 586 J/g (65 to 140 cal/g) was promptly inserted to the test rods. Cladding deformation of the BWR fuel by the pulse irradiation was smaller than that of pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuels. However, cladding failure occurred in tests with fuel at burnup of 61 GWd/tonne U at fuel enthalpies of 260 to 360 J/g (62 to 86 cal/g) during the early stages of transients, while the cladding remained cool. The failure was comparable to the one observed in high-burnup PWR fuel tests, in which embrittled cladding with dense hydride precipitation near the outer surface was fractured due to pellet cladding mechanical interaction. Transient fission gas release by the pulse irradiation was {approx}9.6 to 17% depending on the peak fuel enthalpy.","","","","","","United States","2002-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 246-259","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0713002190","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826761","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826761","","Nuclear Technology","3","138"
"A Fission Gas Release Model for High-Burnup LWR ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} Fuel","Long, Yun; Yuan, Yi; Kazimi, Mujid S; Ballinger, Ronald G; Pilat, Edward E","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BREEDER REACTORS; BURNUP; FISSION PRODUCT RELEASE; MIXED OXIDE FUELS; PLUTONIUM; PLUTONIUM 239; POROSITY; POWER DISTRIBUTION; PWR TYPE REACTORS; RESONANCE IONIZATION MASS SPECTROSCOPY; SHAPE; THORIUM OXIDES; URANIUM 233; URANIUM DIOXIDE","Fission gas release in thoria-urania fuel has been investigated by creating a specially modified FRAPCON-3 code. Because of the reduced buildup of {sup 239}Pu and a flatter distribution of {sup 233}U, the new model THUPS (Thoria-Urania Power Shape) was developed to calculate the radial power distribution, including the effects of both plutonium and {sup 233}U. Additionally, a new porosity model for the rim region was introduced at high burnup. The mechanisms of fission gas release in ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} fuel are expected to be essentially similar to those of UO{sub 2} fuel; therefore, the general formulations of the existing fission gas release models in FRAPCON-3 were retained. However, the gas diffusion coefficient was adjusted to a lower level to account for the smaller observed release fraction in the thoria-based fuel. To model the accelerated fission gas release at high burnup properly, a new athermal fission gas release model was introduced. The modified version of FRAPCON-3 was calibrated using the measured fission gas release data from the light water breeder reactor. Using the new model to calculate the gas release in typical pressurized water reactor hot pins gives data that indicate that the ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} fuel will have considerably lower fission gas release above a burnup of 50 MWd/kg HM.","","","","","","United States","2002-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 260-272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0714002191","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826762","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826762","","Nuclear Technology","3","138"

Through a systematic definition of sequences and thermal-hydraulic analyses using RETRAN-3D, the most important parameters on downcomer overcooling were identified. The break location that leads to the most significant overcooling was found to be the hot leg side in the loop that does not contain the charging flow inlet. The initial power level had a large effect on the downcomer overcooling. The closure failure of the pressurizer power operated relief valves and the termination failure of the safety injection were found to be the most significant operator actions. In contrast, auxiliary feedwater control failure had little effect on overcooling, and the steam dump valve closure failure merely resulted in a temperature rise in the latter half of the transient. Through these analyses, recommendations for sequence grouping and against downcomer overcooling are provided.","","","","","","United States","2002-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 273-283","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0715002192","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826763","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826763","","Nuclear Technology","3","138"

Much attention has recently been focused on approaches to transmutation of spent nuclear fuel and on the potential benefits and risks of transmutation. Drawing on findings from studies carried out in different countries, this paper assesses the potential impacts of transmutation in standard thermal and fast reactors. A parametric scoping using standard methods to analyze mass flows and waste hazards gives a sense of the limitations and key variables in transmutation. With respect to waste, the impacts of the transmutation effort are found to depend strongly on the separation efficiency of the reprocessing system, the performance of the disposal repository, and the transmutation rate in the reactor.","","","","","","United States","2002-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 284-299","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0716002193","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826764","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826764","","Nuclear Technology","3","138"

The ADS utilizes neutrons, which are generated by high-energy protons of giga-electron-volt-grade, but cross sections for the interaction of high-energy particles are not available for use in current ADS engineering design. In this paper the neutron behavior in the ADS target based on the related experimental data is clarified, and the feasibility of the ADS regarding both the molten salts (Flibe: {sup 7}LiF-BeF{sub 2}-ThF{sub 4}-{sup 233}UF{sub 4}, chloride: NaCl-ThCl{sub 4}-{sup 233}UCl{sub 4}) and oxide ([Th, {sup 233}U]O{sub 2}) fuels is examined. The difference between the experiment and the calculated result at the ADS high-energy region is discussed. In a comparison of the fuels, the time evolution of k{sub eff} and the beam current in the burning period are calculated. The calculated results suggest that the ADS with solid fuel has better future prospects than that with molten-salt fuels. The ADS with Flibe molten-salt fuel tends to require a high beam current and consequently needs the installation of a metallic spallation target and the continuous removal for fission products and protactinium. In comparison with the Flibe fuel, the ADS with chloride fuel has a flux distribution that is similar to a solid fuel reactor.","","","","","","United States","2002-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 300-312","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0717002194","10.13182/NT02-1","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","20826765","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826765","","Nuclear Technology","3","138"

Although the best-estimate LOCA methodology can provide the greatest margin on the peak cladding temperature (PCT) evaluation during LOCA, it will take many more resources to develop and to get final approval from the licensing authority. Instead, implementation of evaluation models required by Appendix K of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Part 50 (10 CFR 50), upon an advanced thermal-hydraulic platform can also gain significant margin on the PCT calculation. A program to modify RELAP5-3D in accordance with Appendix K of 10 CFR 50 was launched by the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Taiwan, and it consists of six sequential phases of work. The compliance of the current RELAP5-3D with Appendix K of 10 CFR 50 has been evaluated, and it was found that there are 11 areas where the code modifications are required to satisfy the requirements set forth in Appendix K of 10 CFR 50.

An important feature of the revised SWAT is that its functions are achieved by calling validated neutronics codes without any changes to the original codes. This feature is realized with a system function of the operating system, which allows the revised SWAT to be independent of the development status of each code.A package of the revised SWAT contains the latest libraries based on JENDL-3.2 and the second version of the JNDC FP library. These libraries allow us to analyze burnup problems, such as an analysis of postirradiation examination (PIE), using the latest evaluated data of not only cross sections but also fission yield and decay constants.Another function of the revised SWAT is a library generator for the ORIGEN2 code, which is one of the most reliable burnup codes. ORIGEN2 users can obtain almost the same results with the revised SWAT using the library prepared by this function.The validation of the revised SWAT is conducted by calculation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development/Nuclear Energy Agency burnup credit criticality safety benchmark Phase I-B and analyses of PIE data for spent fuel from Takahama Unit 3. The analysis of PIE data shows that the revised SWAT can predict the isotopic composition of main uranium and plutonium with a deviation of 5% from experimental results taken from UO{sub 2} fuels of 17 x 17 fuel assemblies. Many results of fission products including samarium are within a deviation of 10%. This means that the revised SWAT has high reliability to predict the isotopic composition for pressurized water reactor spent fuel.","","","","","","United States","2002-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 97-110","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0703002180","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826751","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826751","","Nuclear Technology","2","138"

The fuel cycle assessment was carried out by calculating the main performance parameters: natural uranium and separative work requirements, fuel cycle cost, and proliferation potential of the spent fuel. These performance parameters were compared with a corresponding slightly enriched (all-U) fuel cycle applied to a PWR of current technology. The main conclusion derived from this comparison is that fuel cycle requirements and fuel cycle cost for the mixed Th/U fuel are higher in comparison with those of the all-U fuel. A comparison and analysis of the quantity and isotopic composition of discharged Pu indicate that the Th/U fuel cycle provides only a moderate improvement of the proliferation resistance. Thus, the overall conclusion of the investigation is that there is no economic justification to introduce Th into a light water reactor fuel cycle as a homogeneous ThO{sub 2}-UO{sub 2} mixture.","","","","","","United States","2002-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 111-122","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0704002181","10.13182/NT01-21","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20826752","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826752","","Nuclear Technology","2","138"

Iodine speciation along the transport path from the fuel to cooler regions of the HTS and into containment is evaluated using chemical thermodynamics calculations, leading to a prediction of the volatile iodine mole fraction that theoretically would enter containment. Sensitivities to a decrease in the cesium-to-iodine ratio, a decrease in iodine concentration in the coolant, and an increase in oxygen partial pressure are tested. The role of the presence of other elements, namely, molybdenum, tellurium, uranium, and lithium, are also evaluated. Under most conditions, the mole fraction of iodine entering containment in volatile form is found to be &lt;0.1%. There are circumstances, however, when cesium iodide can be destabilized by a low cesium-to-molybdenum ratio in an oxidizing atmosphere such as steam. To further explore this situation and to validate the code, chemical equilibrium calculations are also compared to earlier Knudsen-cell experimental studies of the interaction of cesium, iodine, molybdenum, and urania. In these experiments, the partial pressures of cesium molybdate and elemental iodine are measured as a function of temperature over the range 1100 to 1500 K. The calculated Cs{sub 2}MoO{sub 4} vapor pressures agree with the experimental results within an order of magnitude at temperatures up to 1200 K; and between 770 and 1150 K, the agreement is within a factor of 2 to 5 depending on the chemical system.","","","","","","United States","2002-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 162-178","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0707002184","10.13182/NT138-162","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","20826755","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826755","","Nuclear Technology","2","138"

An approximate analytical solution of the transport equation is given. The calculation dependencies of the RFP release coefficients on the main parameters such as defect size, fuel-to-cladding gap, temperature of the internal cladding surface, and radioactive decay constant were analyzed.It is shown that the change of the RFP release from the fuel elements with the initial defects during long-term irradiation is, mainly, caused by fuel swelling followed by reduction of the fuel-to-cladding gap and the fuel temperature. The calculation model for the RFP release from defective fuel elements applicable to light water reactors (LWRs) was developed.

The results show that thorium-based fuels in the intermediate spectrum of tight-pitch LWRs have considerable advantages in terms of conversion ratio, reactivity control, nonproliferation characteristics, and a reduced production of long-lived radiotoxic wastes. Because of the high conversion ratio of thorium-based fuels in intermediate spectrum reactors, the total fissile inventory required to achieve a given fuel burnup is only 11 to 17% higher than that of {sup 238}U fertile fuels. However, unlike {sup 238}U fertile fuels, the void reactivity coefficient with thorium-based fuels is negative in an intermediate spectrum reactor.

In an effort to assess this class of coolants in advanced nuclear systems of the next generation, an innovative fast reactor concept that eliminates the need for steam generators and main coolant pumps and thus offers capital and operating cost reduction was explored. The working steam is generated by direct-contact vaporization of water by liquid metal in the chimney above the core and is then sent directly to the turbine. The presence of a lighter fluid in the chimney substantially enhances the natural circulation of the Pb-Bi within the reactor pool. A key technical issue of this reactor concept is the consequences of Pb-Bi aerosol generation within the vessel, its transport within the power cycle components and impact on the design and operation of the turbine.Generation, transport, and deposition of Pb-Bi aerosols were modeled. It was found that the utilization of a suitable chevron steam separator design reduces the heavy-liquid metal transported to the steam lines by about three orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, the residual Pb-Bi ({approx}0.003 kg/s) is predicted to be sufficient to cause embrittlement of the turbine blades if conventional materials are used and the plant is to operate for 40 yr. Four solutions to this problem were assessed and found potentially viable from a technical standpoint: blade coating, employment of alternative materials, electrostatic precipitation, and oxidation of the Pb-Bi droplets.","","","","","","United States","2002-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 138; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 30-43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0696002173","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826744","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826744","","Nuclear Technology","1","138"

A mass and energy balance on a Lagrangian quench front control volume along with temporal scaling methods are utilized in developing the quench front scaling groups for a phenomena-specific second-tier scaling analysis. A sample calculation is presented comparing the quench front scaling groups calculated for a prototypical Westinghouse 17 x 17 PWR fuel design and that of the geometry and material configuration used in the FLECHT SEASET series of experiments.","","INIS; OSTI as DE00800995","Bettis Atomic Power Lab., West Mifflin, PA (US); Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2002-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Engineering and Design (submitted to); Other Information: Submitted to Nuclear Engineering and Design; PBD: 1 Apr 2002","","Medium: ED; Size: vp.","","B-T-3432","AC11-98PN38206","TRN: US0206080","","","2009-12-11T00:00:00Z","800995","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/800995","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/800995","Nuclear Engineering and Design (submitted to)","",""

The main objective was to incorporate burned fuel composition calculated with the WIMSD4 deterministic code into the MCNP4B Monte Carlo code and compare the calculated k{sub eff} with the measurements. The criticality experiment was performed in 1998 at the ''Jozef Stefan'' Institute TRIGA Mark II reactor in Ljubljana, Slovenia, with the same fuel elements and loading pattern as in the TRIGA criticality benchmark experiment with fresh fuel performed in 1991. The only difference was that in 1998, the fuel elements had on average burnup of {approx}3%, corresponding to 1.3-MWd energy produced in the core in the period between 1991 and 1998. The fuel element burnup accumulated during 1991-1998 was calculated with the TRIGLAV in-house-developed fuel management two-dimensional multigroup diffusion code. The burned fuel isotopic composition was calculated with the WIMSD4 code and compared to the ORIGEN2 calculations. Extensive comparison of burned fuel material composition was performed for both codes for burnups up to 20% burned {sup 235}U, and the differences were evaluated in terms of reactivity. The WIMSD4 and ORIGEN2 results agreed well for all isotopes important in reactivity calculations, giving increased confidence in the WIMSD4 calculation of the burned fuel material composition. The k{sub eff} calculated with the combined WIMSD4 and MCNP4B calculations showed good agreement with the experimental values. This shows that linking of WIMSD4 with MCNP4B for criticality calculations with burned fuel is feasible and gives reliable results.","","","","","","United States","2002-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 169-180","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0687002164","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826735","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826735","","Nuclear Technology","3","137"

Electricity energy sector projections for fossil fuel plants, renewable energy sources, and nuclear power plants are analyzed on a least cost basis. The impact of constraints on the emissions of greenhouse gases is included in the analysis.

"High Local Power Densities Permissible at Siemens Pressurized Water Reactors","Kuehnel, Klaus; Richter, Klaus-Deiter; Drescher, Gerhard; Endrizzi, Ivo","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; CONTROL; FUEL CYCLE; FUEL MANAGEMENT; HYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTS; NUCLEAR FUELS; NUCLEAR INDUSTRY; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; NUCLEATE BOILING; POWER DENSITY; PWR TYPE REACTORS; RADIOACTIVE WASTES; REACTOR CORES; REACTOR FUELING; STEADY-STATE CONDITIONS; THERMAL HYDRAULICS; THREE-DIMENSIONAL CALCULATIONS","Operating nuclear fuel to higher discharge burnups reduces not only fuel cycle costs but also the volume of radioactive waste requiring disposal. In pressurized water reactors (PWRs), high local power densities are a prerequisite for achieving a high batch burnup.The range of maximum power densities that can be exploited for in-core fuel management and operational flexibility is restricted by the limiting conditions for operation obtained from analyses of anticipated operational occurrences and hypothetical accidents.Since utilities mainly use available margins for implementing advanced in-core fuel management strategies or for power uprating, a suitable parameter for making a rough comparison of the present thermal-hydraulic design status of different PWRs is the maximum local heat flux achieved during actual cycles under steady-state full-power conditions. A comparison between Siemens PWRs and the PWR designs of other vendors shows that the maximum local power densities during steady-state operation are usually higher in Siemens PWRs.The main reasons why higher power densities are permissible can usually be attributed to different core surveillance concepts (instrumentation and control) in conjunction with different control assembly management schemes. Moreover, two representative studies conducted with a new methodology using the three-dimensional neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupled code PANBOX for core transient analysis present additional margins. Especially in plants using the Siemens core surveillance concept, the new methodology yields significant additional margins for PWRs to be operated with even higher permissible local power densities.The additional departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margin gained in the representative studies was 0.38. However, utilization of this additional margin is accompanied by larger void fractions within the upper section of the hot channel during normal operation. Therefore, increasing steady-state maximum power densities has to be done gradually while collecting and evaluating operating experience each time. Depending on the specific circumstances at a plant, the gained margin can be utilized not only for more economical core loading patterns (improved low-leakage loading and/or elimination of burnable absorbers) or power uprating but also, in Siemens PWRs, to eliminate having to readjust the DNBR limitation circuit for one or more cycles.Although the concept presented here is specifically tailored to Siemens PWRs, it is obvious that the application of a three-dimensional neutronics/thermal-hydraulics coupled code could also provide significant benefits for non-Siemens PWRs as well.","","","","","","United States","2002-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 73-83","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0679002156","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826727","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826727","","Nuclear Technology","2","137"

This core has a large power level of {approx}1500 MW(electric) favoring the economic aspect. To promote plutonium and minor actinide burning as much as possible, total suppression of {sup 238}U, which produces {sup 239}Pu by conversion, and large quantities of minor actinides in the core are desirable. Therefore, the {sup 238}U-free fuel is homogeneously mixed with a considerable quantity of minor actinides.From the safety point of view, both the Doppler effect and the coolant (sodium) void reactivity become less favorable in a {sup 238}U-free core. To preserve these two important safety parameters on an acceptable level, a hydrogenated moderator separated from the fuel and nuclides, such as W or {sup 99}Tc, is added to the core in the place of {sup 238}U. Tungsten and {sup 99}Tc have strong capture resonances at appropriate energies, and {sup 99}Tc itself is a long-lived fission product to be transmuted with profit.This core allows the achievement of a consumption rate of {approx}100 kg/TW(electric).h of transuranic elements, {approx}70 kg/TW(electric).h for plutonium (due to {sup 238}U suppression), and 30 to 35 kg/TW(electric).h for minor actinides. In addition, {approx}14 kg/TW(electric).h of {sup 99}Tc is destroyed when this element is present in the core (the initial loading of {sup 99}Tc is &gt;4000 kg in the core).The activity of newly designed subassemblies has also been investigated in comparison to standard fast reactor subassemblies (neutron sources, decay heat, and gamma dose rate). Finally, a transmutation scenario involving pressurized water reactors and minor actinide-burning fast reactors has been studied to estimate the necessary proportion of burner reactors and the achievable radiotoxicity reduction with respect to a reference open cycle.","","","","","","United States","2002-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 84-96","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0680002157","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826728","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826728","","Nuclear Technology","2","137"

The applicability of the autoregressive (AR) model for this purpose was examined in the case of the fuel subassembly outlet coolant thermocouples and the primary circuit electromagnetic flowmeter (EMF) of Monju, the prototype fast breeder reactor in Japan.The use of an AR model with exogenous input (ARX model) is possible when the physical variable to be sensed can be observed by an alternative means with a faster response time than that of the sensor in question. In the case of the subassembly outlet thermocouple, the temperature output from an eddy-current sensor, during pseudorandom reactor power variation, served as the exogenous input.In respect to the thermocouple response, AR and ARX modeling were shown to be applicable, and the transient responses thus derived agreed well with each other and with the results measured by means of a step change in sodium temperature. However, the primary circuit EMF response time, estimated using the AR model, decreased with increasing flow rate even when approaching the rated flow, demonstrating that the method was not completely applicable. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the response is faster than that estimated in the rated condition.","","","","","","United States","2002-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 163-168","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0686002163","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826734","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826734","","Nuclear Technology","2","137"

To understand whether the physical phenomena observed in the full-height and full-pressure facility during an LOFW transient can be simulated in the reduced-height and reduced-pressure IIST facility, two counterpart tests based on the same scenarios as those of the BETHSY tests were performed. These two tests performed in BETHSY differ mainly at the initiation of the bleed-and-feed process on the primary side in order to examine the effectiveness of recovery measures on the processes of the pressurizer power-operated relief valves early and late opening. The initial and boundary conditions of the current tests were determined by scaling down the corresponding conditions of the LOFW experiments performed at BETHSY. In view of the inherent differences in design, scaling approach, and facility operation conditions in the systems, the consistency between the counterpart tests is examined by identifying key thermal-hydraulic phenomena and clarifying their differences. The results of the IIST and BETHSY tests showed the common thermal-hydraulic behaviors of key parameters, such as system pressure, void fraction in the hot leg, primary coolant inventory, pressurizer level, and discharged mass evolutions. The chronological events studied in the IIST facility are generally consistent with those studied in BETHSY. The results from the IIST facility may not be exact replications of the BETHSY response; however, the physics involved in bleed-and-feed are well measured and modeled.","","","","","","United States","2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 10-27","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0675002152","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826723","","Nuclear Technology","1","137"

The bulk permeability of the cracked top crust is estimated based on simple fracture mechanics and application of Poiseuille's law to the fractures. The gap is considered as an abstraction representing an initially rugged interface, which probably expanded by thermal deformation and cracking in connection with the water ingress. The coupled flow and heat conduction problem for the top crust is solved in slab geometry based on the two-phase Darcy equations together with quasi-steady mass and energy conservation equations. The resulting water penetration depth is in good agreement with the depth of the so-called loose debris bed. The lower-head and bottom-crust problem is treated analogously by a two-dimensional axisymmetric model. The notion of a gap is maintained as a useful concept in the flow analysis. Simulations show that a central hot spot with a peak wall temperature of 1075 to 1100 deg. C can be obtained, but the quenching rates are not satisfactory. It is concluded that a three-dimensional model with an additional mechanism to explain the sudden water ingress to the hot spot center would be more appropriate.","","","","","","United States","2002-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 137; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-46","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0676002153","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826724","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826724","","Nuclear Technology","1","137"

This model has been derived from the system of total continuity, and it divides the reactor coolant system (RCS) into two regions, namely, the saturated and subcooled regions. The pressurizer is considered as a saturated region, and the remaining part of the RCS is regarded as a subcooled region. Taking the on-line measurements of the RCS including the RCS pressure, temperature, pressurizer water level, and charging and letdown flow rates, this model can directly evaluate on-line the RCS leakage rate. It is noted that this model is applicable only if the RCS remains subcooled. To verify the applicability of this model, data generated by RELAP5/MOD3 simulation and experimental measurements from the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Taiwan, Integral System Test Facility were adopted to assess this model. With further on-line verification against the Maanshan training simulator, this model was finally delivered to the Maanshan nuclear power plant (a three-looped Westinghouse pressurized water reactor) to assist the operator training and on-line evaluation of the RCS leakage rate. The smallest amount of leak flow that can be detected by the ROCK model is 3 gal/min.","","","","","","United States","2001-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 292-300","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0667002144","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826715","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826715","","Nuclear Technology","3","136"

The root-locus method is used to examine the stability of the system. The relation between the poles of the system and the physical processes causing the instabilities is investigated. For a natural-circulation thermal-hydraulic system, the two types of instabilities (type-I and type-II oscillations) can clearly be attributed to the dynamics of different types of pressure drops. However, it is not possible to associate these instability types with certain poles of the system.The root loci of a reactor with weak void reactivity feedback and those of the thermal-hydraulic system behave similarly: The same pole pair remains the least stable one as the operating conditions move from the type-I instability region to the type-II region. In the case of a reactor with strong void reactivity feedback, an exchange in the stability of two pole pairs is found: The least stable pole pair in the type-II region is not the same as in the type-I region.","","","","","","United States","2001-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 301-314","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0668002145","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826716","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826716","","Nuclear Technology","3","136"

A model has been developed regarding the pressure vessel with its auxiliary parts plus the fuel elements as the zone, with the six steam generators as one single unit. The stream from the steam generator is split, with its larger part returning to the zone through the main circulating pump and the smaller one passing through the purifier column. Based on this flowchart, the formation kinetics of corrosion products and of radioactive substances are evaluated. Correlation analysis is applied to reveal any eventual interdependence of the processes, whereas the range-per-scatter (R/S) method is used to characterize the random or deterministic nature of a process. The evaluation of the t {yields} {infinity} limits of the kinetic equations enables one to conclude that (a) the total amount of corrosion products per element during one cycle is almost always &lt;15 kg and (b) the zone acts as a highly efficient filter with an efficiency of {approx}1. The R/S results show that the fluctuations in the concentrations of the corrosion products are persistent; this finding indicates that random effects play here little if any role and that the processes in the coolant are under control. Correlation analyses show that the variations of the concentrations are practically uncorrelated and that the processes are independent of each other.","","","","","","United States","2001-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 331-341","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0670002147","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826718","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826718","","Nuclear Technology","3","136"

In this process, the actinide oxides in the spent fuel are reduced using lithium at 650 deg. C in the presence of molten LiCl, yielding the corresponding actinides and Li{sub 2}O. The actinides are then extracted from the reduction product by means of electrorefining. Associated with the reduction step is an ancillary salt-recovery step designed to electrochemically reduce the Li{sub 2}O concentration of the salt and recover the lithium metal.Experiments were performed at the laboratory scale (50 to 150 g of fuel and 0.5 to 3.5 l of salt) and engineering scale (3.7 to 5.2 kg of fuel and 50 l of salt). Laboratory-scale experiments were designed to obtain information on the fundamental factors affecting process rates. Engineering-scale experiments were conducted to verify that the parameters controlling process scaleup are sufficiently understood, and to test equipment and operating concepts at or near full scale. All indications are that the electrochemical-based process should be workable at practical plant sizes.","","","","","","United States","2001-12-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 342-353","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0671002148","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826719","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826719","","Nuclear Technology","3","136"

Neutron radiation fields at light water reactor (LWR) power plants are typically characterized by low-energy distributions due to the presence of large amounts of scattering material such as water and concrete. These low-energy distributions make it difficult to accurately monitor personnel exposures, since most survey meters and dosimeters are calibrated to higher energy fields such as those produced by bare or D2O-moderated 252Cf sources. Commercial plants typically use thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) in an albedo configuration for personnel dosimetry and survey meters based on a thermal-neutron detector inside a cylindrical or spherical moderator for dose rate assessment, so their methods of routine monitoring are highly dependent on the energy of the neutron fields. Battelle has participated in neutron assessments at a number of LWR facilities to characterize neutron radiation fields and to evaluate the responses of plant dosimeters and survey instruments. In these studies the tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) was relied on as the primary instrument for measuring neutron dose and dose equivalent rates, and 3He and multisphere spectrometers were used to measure energy distributions. The use of these instruments in LWR work locations is usually difficult because of extreme environmental conditions such as high temperatures. These studies have confirmed the presence of low-energy neutron fields in most work locations. The studies have also found that albedo dosimeters used at power plants typically over-respond by factors of four or more when using a calibration based on californium exposures. Survey instruments also respond high, usually by at least a factor of two, in typical LWR environments.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2001-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research.

To do so, a comprehensive methodology for designing an accident mitigation system was developed on the basis of the following studies. Threats to the reactor core, which are inherent to PWRs, were systematically analyzed. Following this, efforts to specify the requirements needed to mitigate the threats were made with the specification of components composing the mitigation systems. On the basis of a loss-of-coolant accident as an example of the severest accident, thermohydro analyses without any mitigation systems were made to determine the requirements needed to keep the core safe. Information related to the system's design parameters were successfully obtained. On the basis of these studies, candidates for mitigation systems that respond in accordance with the scales and phases in progress of accidents were systematically selected and discussed. In the future, the methodology presented herein may be extended to cover the structuring of overall plant safety systems.","","","","","","United States","2001-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 141-157","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0655002132","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826703","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826703","","Nuclear Technology","2","136"

This has resulted in the reassessment of existing licensing criteria and failure-mode study. To address the issue, a statistics-based methodology is suggested to predict failure probability of irradiated fuel rods under an RIA. Based on RIA simulation results in the literature, a failure enthalpy correlation for an irradiated fuel rod is constructed as a function of oxide thickness, fuel burnup, and pulse width. Using the failure enthalpy correlation, a new concept of ''equivalent enthalpy'' is introduced to reflect the effects of the three primary factors as well as peak fuel enthalpy into a single damage parameter. Moreover, the failure distribution function with equivalent enthalpy is derived, applying a two-parameter Weibull statistical model. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to estimate the effects of burnup, corrosion, peak fuel enthalpy, pulse width, and cladding materials used.","","","","","","United States","2001-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 158-168","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0656002133","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826704","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826704","","Nuclear Technology","2","136"

Four experiments were conducted with a different number of pressurizer power-operated relief valves (PORVs) and centrifugal charging pumps (CCPs) engaged in performing the primary-side bleed-and-feed operation. In addition, the effect of opening a pressure vessel venting-path was also evaluated. The focus was on the effectiveness and adequacy of current EOPs and the observation of associated thermal-hydraulic phenomena. The test results indicated that the current EOPs can function well in mitigating the consequences of a LOFW event provided that at least two fully opened PORVs and one actuated CCP are used. The opening of a pressure vessel venting path during the bleed-and-feed operation is helpful in the primary system depressurization but has little effect to increase the pressure vessel coolant inventory. However, by opening one PORV, precaution for the reactor coolant system (RCS) integrity should be taken for system overpressurization caused by insufficient heat removal capability. Furthermore, an effective control of restored feedwater to a low injection rate is favorable to minimize the thermal stress in the RCS pressure boundary.","","","","","","United States","2001-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 204-220","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0660002137","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826708","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826708","","Nuclear Technology","2","136"

The approach is based on the premise that data for normal operation lie on a surface and abnormal situations lead to deviations from the surface in a particular way. Statistically significant deviations from the surface result in the detection of faults, and the characteristic directions of deviations are used for isolation of one or more faults from the set of typical faults. Principal component analysis (PCA), a multivariate data-driven technique, is used to capture the relationships in the data and fit a hyperplane to the data. The fault direction for each of the scenarios is obtained using the singular value decomposition on the state and control function prediction errors, and fault isolation is then accomplished from projections on the fault directions. This approach is demonstrated for a simulated pressurized water reactor steam generator system and for a laboratory process control system under single device fault conditions. Enhanced fault isolation capability is also illustrated by incorporating realistic nonlinear terms in the PCA data matrix.","","","","","","United States","2001-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 221-230","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0661002138","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826709","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826709","","Nuclear Technology","2","136"

A three-dimensional beam element model is used in this code to calculate fuel pin bowing and cladding oval distortion, which are the dominant deformation mechanisms in a fuel pin bundle. In this work, the property of the cladding oval distortion considering the wire-pitch was evaluated experimentally and introduced in the code analysis.The BAMBOO code was validated in this study by using an out-of-pile bundle compression testing apparatus and comparing these results with the code results. It is concluded that BAMBOO reasonably predicts the pin-to-duct clearances in the compression tests by treating the cladding oval distortion as the suppression mechanism to BDI.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 14-23","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0646002123","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826694","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826694","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"

Therefore, a medium-sized program aiming at reactor outage simulation and evaluation, such as midloop operation (MLO) with loss of residual heat removal (RHR), has been developed. Important thermal-hydraulic processes involved during MLO with loss of RHR can be properly simulated by the newly developed reactor outage simulation and evaluation (ROSE) code. The two-region approach with a modified two-fluid model has been adopted to be the theoretical basis of the ROSE code.To verify the analytical model in the first step, posttest calculations against the integral midloop experiments with loss of RHR have been performed. The excellent simulation capacity of the ROSE code against the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research Integral System Test Facility test data is demonstrated. To further mature the ROSE code in simulating a full-sized pressurized water reactor, assessment against the WGOTHIC code and the Maanshan momentary-loss-of-RHR event has been undertaken. The successfully assessed ROSE code is then applied to evaluate the abnormal operation procedure (AOP) with loss of RHR during MLO (AOP 537.4) for the Maanshan plant. The ROSE code also has been successfully transplanted into the Maanshan training simulator to support operator training. How the simulator was upgraded by the ROSE code for MLO will be presented in the future.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-49","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0648002125","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826696","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826696","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"

Most development has been directed toward large-break (LB) LOCAs (LBLOCAs), since for most pressurized water reactors (PWRs), the LBLOCA generates the limiting peak cladding temperature (PCT). As plants age, are uprated, and continue to seek improved operating efficiencies, the small break (SB) LOCA (SBLOCA) and intermediate-break (IB) LOCA (IBLOCA) can become a concern.Modifications have been made to the WCOBRA/TRAC-MOD7A code to enable it to make realistic calculations of SBLOCAs and IBLOCAs in a Westinghouse PWR. The MOD7A version has recently been approved for use as part of the Westinghouse best-estimate LOCA methodology for LBLOCAs. Thus, the modifications and improvements potentially allow LOCA calculations ranging from SBLOCAs to LBLOCAs using a single code version.The WCOBRA/TRAC-MOD7A, Rev. 4 SB02 version was used to calculate the transient response of a four-loop PWR for a range of break sizes located at the bottom of one of the cold legs. The break sizes ranged from a 0.051-m (2-in.) to a 0.406-m (16-in.) equivalent hole diameter. Each calculation was performed assuming American Nuclear Society (ANS) 1979 decay heat. The plant input assumed the loss of one train of safety injection as well as a power shape that was highly top skewed, which imposed some conservatism on the calculations but allowed a meaningful comparison to Appendix K-type analysis results. The realistic SBLOCA and IBLOCA results showed significantly reduced PCTs compared to those typically obtained from Appendix K LOCA calculations. The realistic results also can be categorized into four separate types of breaks, from a conventional slowly draining SBLOCA to an LBLOCA.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 50-62","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0649002126","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826697","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826697","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"

Specific issues include when and how dismantlement should be accomplished and what the radwaste classification of the dismantled system would be at the time it is disassembled. Whereas radiation levels and residual radiological characteristics of the majority of the plant systems are directly measured using standard radiation survey and radiochemical analysis techniques, actual measurements of reactor zone materials are not practical due to high radiation levels and inaccessibility. For these reasons, neutron transport analysis was used to estimate induced radioactivity and radiation levels in the Chernobyl NPP Unit 1 reactor core materials and structures.Analysis results suggest that the optimum period of safe storage is 90 to 100 yr for the Unit 1 reactor. For all of the reactor components except the fuel channel pipes (or pressure tubes), this will provide sufficient decay time to allow unlimited worker access during dismantlement, minimize the need for expensive remote dismantlement, and allow for the dismantled reactor components to be classified as low- or medium-level radioactive waste. The fuel channel pipes will remain classified as high-activity waste requiring remote dismantlement for hundreds of years due to the high concentration of induced {sup 63}Ni in the Zircaloy pipes.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 76-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0651002128","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826699","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826699","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"

Since all of these materials (NaF traps and the uranium-laden charcoal) are not suitable for long-term storage, they will be converted to a uranium oxide (U{sub 3}O{sub 8}), which is suitable for long-term storage.The conversion of the MSRE material into an oxide presents unique problems, such as criticality concerns, a large radiation field caused by the daughters of {sup 232}U (an impurity isotope in the {sup 233}U), and the possible spread of the high-radiation field from the release of {sup 220}Rn gas. To overcome these problems, a novel process was conceived and developed. This process was specially tailored for providing remote operations inside a hot cell while maintaining full containment at all times to avoid the spread of contamination. This process satisfies criticality concerns, maximizes the recovery of uranium, minimizes any radiation exposure to operators, and keeps waste disposal to a minimum.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 89-98","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0652002129","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826700","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826700","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"
"A Critical Review of the Practice of Equating the Reactivity of Spent Fuel to Fresh Fuel in Burnup Credit Criticality Safety Analyses for PWR Spent-Fuel Pool Storage","Wagner, J C; Parks, C V","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BORON; BURNUP; CONFIGURATION; CRITICALITY; ENRICHMENT; PONDS; PWR TYPE REACTORS; RADIOACTIVE WASTE STORAGE; REACTIVITY; SAFETY ANALYSIS; SPENT FUELS","This research examines the practice of equating the reactivity of spent fuel to that of fresh fuel for the purpose of performing burnup credit criticality safety analyses for pressurized water reactor (PWR) spent-fuel pool (SFP) storage conditions. The investigation consists of comparing k{sub eff} estimates based on reactivity ''equivalent'' fresh fuel enrichment (REFFE) to k{sub eff} estimates using the calculated spent-fuel isotopics. Analyses of selected storage configurations common in PWR SFPs show that this practice yields nonconservative results (on the order of a few tenths of a percent) in configurations in which the spent fuel is adjacent to higher-reactivity assemblies (e.g., fresh or lower-burned assemblies) and yields conservative results in configurations in which spent fuel is adjacent to lower-reactivity assemblies (e.g., higher-burned fuel or empty cells). When the REFFE is determined based on unborated water moderation, analyses for storage conditions with soluble boron present reveal significant nonconservative results associated with the use of the REFFE. Finally, it is shown that the practice of equating the reactivity of spent fuel to fresh fuel is acceptable, provided the conditions for which the REFFE was determined remain unchanged. Determination of the REFFE for a reference configuration and subsequent use of the REFFE for different configurations violates the basis used for the determination of the REFFE and, thus, may lead to inaccurate, and possibly, nonconservative estimates of reactivity.A significant concentration ({approx}2000 ppm) of soluble boron is typically (but not necessarily required to be) present in PWR SFPs, of which only a portion ([less than or approximately equal]500 ppm) may be credited in safety analyses. Thus, a large subcritical margin currently exists that more than accounts for errors or uncertainties associated with the use of the REFFE. Consequently, the findings presented here do not represent a significant safety concern unless/until the subcritical margin associated with the soluble boron (that is not currently explicitly credited) is offset by the uncertainties associated with burnup credit and/or the expanded allowance of credit for the soluble boron.","","","","","","United States","2001-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 130-140","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0654002131","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20826702","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20826702","","Nuclear Technology","1","136"

Issues include when and how dismantlement should be accomplished and what the radwaste classification of dismantled systems would be at the time of disassembly. While radiation levels and residual radiological characteristics of the majority of the plant systems are measured directly using standard radiation survey and radiochemical analysis techniques, actual measurements of reactor zone materials are not practical due to high radiation levels and inaccessibility. Thus neutron transport analysis was used to estimate induced radioactivity and radiation levels in the Chornobyl NPP reactor core materials and structures. Analysis results suggest that the optimum period of safe storage is 90 to 100 years for the reactor. For all of the reactor components except the fuel channel pipes (or pressure tubes), this will provide sufficient decay time to allow unlimited worker access during dismantlement, minimize the need for expensive remote dismantlement, and allow for the dismantled reactor components to be classified as low- or medium-level radioactive waste. The fuel channel pipes will remain classified as high-activity waste requiring remote dismantlement for hundreds of years due to the high concentration of induced nickel-63 in the Zircalloy pipes.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The effects of accounting for lattice dynamics on the modeling of neutron scattering in 235U, 238U, 238Pu, and other nuclides have been demonstrated. The new formulation essentially reproduces other investigators previous results for isotropic scattering and quantifies the departures from the isotropic values when higher angular orders are accounted for. The correct accounting for the lattice effects influences the estimated values for the probability of neutron absorption and scattering, which in turn affect the estimation of core reactivity and burnup characteristics. It is shown that, when using the exact scattering kernel formulation, the probability for upscattering significantly increases with increasing temperatures. For example, upscattering for 238U from below the 20.67 eV resonance increases from 5.57% at 300 K to 30.41% at 1000 K, respectively. Thus, it is shown that the exact scattering kernel is strongly sensitive to temperature, a fact of major importance for High Temperature Reactor fuels. The slowing down process is important in thermal reactors because it results in the neutrons entering the thermal energy range in which the majority of fission events occur. Correctly modeling the slowing down and hence slowing down source into the thermal energy range and consequently allowing the correct modeling of the thermal energy neutron fluxes (or the correct thermal range portion of the spectrum) is paramount to the correct prediction of criticality and safety features such as the Doppler effect. These artifacts are important for all thermal spectrum reactors. In High Temperature Reactors such as the NGNP or the Deep Burn HTR these effects are even more important.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Main results of German studies on source term estimation are discussed. Core heatup events are no longer dominant for modern fuel, but fission product transport during water ingress accidents (steam cycle plants) and He-circuit depressurizations are relevant, mainly due to remobilization of fission products that were plated out in the course of normal operation or that became dust borne. The following important lack of knowledge was identified: Data on plateout in normal operation are insufficient, as are data on behavior of dust-borne activity in total; better knowledge in these fields is also important for maintenance/repair and design/shielding. For core heatup events, the influence of burnup on temperature-induced fission product release has to be measured for future Pu-containing high burnup fuel; furthermore, transport mechanisms out of the He circuit into the environment require further examination. For water/steam ingress events, mobilization of plated-out fission products by steam or water has to be considered in detail along with steam interaction with kernels of particles with defective coatings. For source terms of depressurization, a more detailed knowledge of flow pattern and shear forces on surfaces is necessary. To improve the knowledge on plateout and dust in normal operation and to generate specimens for experimental remobilization studies, planning/design of plateout/dust examination facilities to be added to HTRs running in the next future reactors [HTR10 and the High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR)] is proposed. For severe air ingress and reactivity accidents, which belong to hypothetical events with frequencies &lt;1 x 10{sup -7} yr{sup -1}, behavior of future advanced fuel elements has to be experimentally tested.","","","","","","United States","2001-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 183-193","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0636121295","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822290","","Nuclear Technology","3","135"

The {sup 138}Xe to {sup 88}Kr activity ratio is decided on the basis of the fissile irradiation with the different neutron spectrum in the core region and the fission fragment emission rate into coolant. This method was applied to actual plant data, and it was demonstrated that the dominant source of off-gas in a plant with nondefective fuel is Pu produced by the burnup of uranium impurities in the core structure.

The SDM evaluator in FORMOSA-B had been a first-order accurate Rayleigh quotient variational technique. It was deemed unreliable for difficult perturbed loading patterns (LPs) and thus was replaced by a high-fidelity, robust, computationally efficient evaluator. The new model is based on the solution of the one-group diffusion equation using approximate albedo boundary conditions for a three-dimensional, variable axial node, 10 x 10 assembly subregion around the stuck rod location. The fidelity and robustness of the model are first demonstrated by performing calculations on difficult perturbed LPs and for different plant cores. It is shown that the SDM reactivity is estimated within 40 pcm for the highest worth rod and that the speedup factors are 50 to 100 for small cores (and even more for larger cores) in comparison to the full-core three-dimensional simulations. Next, the successful implementation of the model in imposing the SDM constraint for FORMOSA-B's adaptive simulated annealing (SA)-based optimization strategy is presented. The results demonstrate SA's ability to remove large SDM violations (&gt;700 pcm) along with thermal margin and critical flow constraint violations. Finally, the importance of having the SDM constraint on during optimization is shown by comparing results with a simulation in which the constraint is off.","","","","","","United States","2001-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 241-251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0640121299","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822294","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822294","","Nuclear Technology","3","135"

It is a water-cooled reactor with {sup 233}U as the fissile material. Using the Monte Carlo n-particle transport code MCNP, shielding optimization calculations are carried out for the south beam port tube, which is meant for neutron radiography of spent-fuel subassemblies of the fast breeder test reactor. The neutron beam port is a graded cylindrical aluminium channel starting from the center of the reactor core; it pierces through the biological shield and is 2 m long. The diameter of the channel at the core center is 54 mm, at the other end it is 25 cm, and it is 0.5 m below the floor level. The latter end serves as the neutron surface source for these calculations. The calculations have been carried out in cylindrical geometry (r,z) of shield structures. From results of the analysis, a movable shield 50 cm thick (25 cm paraffin and 25 cm lead), 75 cm wide, and 172 cm long extending {approx}95 cm into the demineralizer room (cooling water purification room) is proposed to replace the existing temporary shield structure. In addition, fixed shields of the same thickness and width of 50 cm on either side of the beam is recommended to reduce the dose levels to a few tens of microsieverts per hour in the accessible areas. Further, the lead-shielded cylindrical tube meant for insertion of irradiated fuel subassemblies for neutron radiography needs to be covered with 20 cm of paraffin up to a height of 1 m from ground level to avoid streaming of neutrons through the air column.","","","","","","United States","2001-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 265-272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0642121301","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822296","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822296","","Nuclear Technology","3","135"

The system was further applied to detailed phenomenological studies. A symmetric pattern of the first azimuthal mode gave a dynamic boundary condition for ideal out-of-phase flow oscillations and lowers the regional instability threshold. The intermode interaction between the fundamental and first azimuthal modes was demonstrated under postulated large oscillations.

The parallel computing adaptive SA optimization scheme, which incorporates the optimization-layer-by-layer (OLL) neutronics evaluation model is then applied to determining the optimum fuel assembly (FA) loading pattern (LP) in the Korea Nuclear Unit 2 pressurized water reactor (PWR) using seven Pentium personal computers (three 266-MHz Pentium II and four 200-MHz Pentium Pro computers). It is shown that the parallel scheme enhances the efficiency of the SA optimization computation significantly but that it can get trapped in local optimum LPs more frequently than the single-processor SA scheme unless one takes preventive steps. As a way to prevent trapping of the parallel scheme in local optima, using multiple seed LPs is proposed instead of a single LP with which the individual processors start each stage, and how to determine the multiple seed LPs is discussed. Because of the high efficiency of the parallel scheme, the acceptability of a hybrid neutronics evaluation model, which is slower but more accurate than the OLL model, in the parallel optimization calculation is examined from the standpoint of computing time. By demonstrating that the FA LP optimization calculation for the equilibrium cycle core of the KNU-2 PWR can be completed in &lt;1 h on seven Pentiums, we justify the routine utilization of the hybrid model in the parallel SA optimization scheme.","","","","","","United States","2001-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 39-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0625121284","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822279","","Nuclear Technology","1","135"

Neutronic analyses were performed by using the CITATION diffusion code and the MCNP4B2 Monte Carlo code. The output of CITATION and MCNP4B2 were input to the PARET thermal-hydraulic code to study the steady-state and transient thermal-hydraulic behavior of the reactor. To benchmark the PARET model, data were obtained from different measurements performed by thermocouples in the instrumented fuel (IF) rod during the steady-state operation both under forced- and natural-convection mode and compared with the calculation. The mass flow rates needed for input to PARET were taken from the Final Safety Analysis Report for a downward forced coolant flow equivalent to 3500 gal/min. For natural convection cooling of the reactor, the mass flow rate was generated using the NCTRIGA code. Peak fuel temperatures measured by the thermocouples in the IF rods at different power levels of the TRIGA core were compared with the values calculated by PARET. The axial distribution of the temperatures of the fuel centerline, fuel surface, and the cladding surface in the hot channel were calculated for the reactor operating at the full-power level. Fuel surface heat flux and heat transfer coefficients for the hot channel were also calculated for the reactor operating at the full-power level. The investigated results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental and operational values. The testing of the PARET model calculations through benchmarking the available TRIGA experimental and operational data for pulse-mode operations showed that PARET can successfully be used to analyze the transient behavior of the reactor. Major transient parameters, such as peak power and prompt energy released after pulse, full-width at half-maximum of pulse peak, and maximum fuel centerline temperatures for different fuel elements at different pulses, were computed and compared with the experimental and operational values. It was observed that pulsing of the reactor inserting an excess reactivity of 1.996 $ shoots the reactor power level to 873 MW compared to an experimental value of 852 MW; the maximum fuel temperature corresponding to this peak power was found to be 512 deg. C. The investigation on maximum available reactivity insertion at full power (2.24 $) by the transient rod raises the reactor power to 1629 MW, and the fuel centerline temperature from the calculations is found to be 937 deg.

The once-through direct-cycle plant system is the leading system of fossil-fired power plants (FPPs). Estimates of the coolability and necessary sizes of the SCR startup systems, sequences, and required equipment for startup are investigated with reference to supercritical FPPs. There are two types of supercritical boilers. One is a constant pressure boiler, and the other is a variable pressure boiler.First, startup of the constant pressure boiler is examined. The reactor starts at a supercritical pressure. A startup bypass system consisting of a flash tank and pressure-reducing valves is required. Second, startup of the variable pressure boiler is investigated. The reactor starts at a subcritical pressure, and the pressure increases with the load. A steam-water separator and a drain tank are required for startup.The results of computer calculations show that with both constant pressure and variable pressure startup, the peak cladding temperature does not exceed the operating limit through startup, and both startup sequences are feasible. The sizes of the components required for the startup systems are assessed. To simplify the plant system and to reduce the component size, variable pressure startup with steam separators in the bypass line appears desirable.","","","","","","United States","2001-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 221-230","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0618121277","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822272","","Nuclear Technology","3","134"

The CAREM-25 is designed based on principles of inherent safety, passive safety functions, and ease of operation. This paper analyzes the safety philosophy from the point of view of risk by performing a level-III probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) of this prototype. The specific PSA steps are discussed, including a specially developed method to obtain representative initiating events, system analysis by fault trees, event development in event trees, plant and containment response analysis, containment event tree development, consequence calculations, and risk representation. The PSA results are presented and discussed in terms of their own values as well as in comparison to other PSA results performed for larger nuclear power plants (NPPs). The advantages of the CAREM-25 from the risk point of view are studied in terms of the effective reduction of both the probability of severe accident sequences and the potential consequences of such sequences (radiological and emergency preparedness impact). The risk point of view also provides a perspective to analyze the impact of several design modifications in order to further reduce the residual risk of the NPP. These design modifications, several of which have already been included in the prototype, are discussed and evaluated.","","","","","","United States","2001-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 97-109","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0610121269","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822264","","Nuclear Technology","2","134"

The capital and operating costs were estimated from the viewpoint of conceptual design. Assuming that the annual discount rate is 5% during the construction (5 yr) and operation period (40 yr) and contingency is 25% of the capital cost, the levelized unit cost (LUC) of DUPIC fuel fabrication was estimated to be 616 $/kg HE, which is mostly governed by annual operation and maintenance costs that correspond to 63% of LUC. Among the operation and maintenance cost components being considered, the waste disposal cost has the dominant effect on LUC ({approx}49%).

The conceptual design study has shown that fresh DUPIC fuel can be transferred to the core following the existing spent-fuel discharge route, provided that new fuel-handling equipment, such as the manipulator, opening/sealing tool of shipping casks, new fuel magazine, new fuel ram, dryer, gamma-ray detector, etc., are installed. The reverse path loading option is known to minimize the number of additional pieces of equipment for fuel handling, because it utilizes the existing spent-fuel handling equipment, and the discharge of spent DUPIC fuel can be done through the existing spent-fuel handling system without any modification. However, because the decay heat of spent DUPIC fuel is much higher than that of spent natural uranium fuel, the extra cooling capacity should be supplemented in the spent-fuel storage bay. Based on the conceptual design study, the capital cost for DUPIC fuel handling and extra storage cooling capacity was estimated to be $3 750 000 (as of December 1999) per CANDU plant. The levelized unit cost of DUPIC fuel handling was then obtained by considering the amount of fuel that will be required during the lifetime of a plant, which is 5.13 $/kg heavy metal. Compared with the other unit costs of the fuel cycle components, it is expected that DUPIC fuel handling has only a minor effect on the overall fuel cycle cost.","","","","","","United States","2001-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 130-148","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0612121271","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822266","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822266","","Nuclear Technology","2","134"

Therefore, the future electricity generation scale was analyzed to evaluate the appropriate capacity of the high-level waste disposal facility in Korea, which is a key parameter of the disposal cost estimation.

The fuel cycle cost (FCC) was calculated by a deterministic method in which reference values of fuel cycle components are used. The FCC was then analyzed by a Monte Carlo simulation to get the uncertainty of the FCC associated with the unit costs of the fuel cycle components. From the deterministic analysis on the equilibrium fuel cycle model, the DUPIC FCC was estimated to be 6.21 to 6.34 mills/kW.h for DUPIC fuel options, which is a little smaller than that of the once-through FCC by 0.07 to 0.27 mills/kW.h. Considering the uncertainty (0.40 to 0.44 mills/kW.h) of the FCC estimated by the Monte Carlo simulation method, the cost difference between the DUPIC and once-through fuel cycle is negligible. On the other hand, the material balance calculation has shown that the DUPIC fuel cycle can save natural uranium resources by {approx}20% and reduce the spent fuel arising by {approx}65% compared with the once-through fuel cycle. In conclusion, the DUPIC fuel cycle is comparable with the once-through fuel cycle from the viewpoint of FCC. In the future, it should be important to consider factors such as the environmental benefit owing to natural uranium savings, the capability of reusing spent pressurized water reactor fuel, and the safeguardability of the fuel cycle when deciding on an advanced nuclear fuel cycle option.","","","","","","United States","2001-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 167-186","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0614121273","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822268","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822268","","Nuclear Technology","2","134"

The Mode K reactor regulating system, which actuates control bank movements, consists of two closed control loops, one for the coolant average temperature control and the other for the axial power shape control. Via its peculiar logic for selecting the control banks to be driven, the Mode K controls the coolant average temperature and axial power shape simultaneously and automatically within their allowed operating limits. In this way, the Mode K significantly reduces the operator burden associated with conventional manual power shape control during LFOs. A simple and flexible soluble boron scenario complements the Mode K logic and contributes toward reducing operational burden by its simplicity. The Mode K logic has been implanted in the Korean Next-Generation Reactor, a 1300-MW(electric) class evolutionary nuclear power plant under development in Korea, and various kinds of LFOs including frequency control have been simulated using the Framatome engineering simulator SAPHIR. The simulation results show reasonable core control performance of the Mode K as well as proper behaviors of other major nuclear steam supply system components such as the pressurizer and steam generator.","","","","","","United States","2001-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 196-207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0616121275","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822270","","Nuclear Technology","2","134"

Both of these unique methods of FINELOAD-3 were developed to achieve an effective BWR LP optimization strategy and to have high computational efficiency. FINELOAD-3 also adjusts deep CR positions to compensate for the core reactivity deviation caused by fuel shuffling. The objective function is to maximize the end-of-cycle core reactivity while satisfying the specified thermal margins and cold shutdown margin constraints.

A passive containment cooling system applies gravity-drained water to the outer surface of the steel containment shell to remove heat by evaporation and convection. Mass transfer is the dominant means of containment heat removal on both inner and outer steel shell surfaces. On the inside, condensation on the containment shell dominates heat removal and is influenced by the distribution of steam and noncondensible gases. The AP600 design basis analysis for containment does not rely on fan coolers or sprays to homogenize the internal atmosphere. During the post-blowdown phase of a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) transient, mixing due to break momentum may be neglected by assuming momentum to be dissipated within the break compartment, conservatively minimizing source momentum-induced mixing. One or more buoyant plumes will rise from openings in the operating deck, and a wall boundary layer induced by heat and mass transfer to the containment shell will flow downward. Both the plume and wall layer entrain bulk mixture, acting to circulate the bulk mixture. The fluid dynamics leads to a time-averaged vertical gradient of steam concentration. Simple integral entrainment relations have been examined to assess the order of magnitude of vertical steam concentration differences that may occur in the AP600 containment during the long-term LOCA transient.","","","","","","United States","2001-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 37-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0605121264","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822259","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822259","","Nuclear Technology","1","134"

Cesium iodide aerosol was introduced into the test section with a carrier gas. After quantifying the deposited mass of cesium and iodine, the test section was reheated to realize the revaporization. The revaporized materials were deposited onto another test section with an axial temperature gradient located downstream. Two runs (WAV1 and WAV2) were conducted. In WAV2, the influence of metaboric acid was examined. Most of the deposited cesium and iodine in the test section was revaporized and transported downstream. In WAV2, deposition density of cesium was much larger than that of iodine. It was supposed that a part of the cesium iodide that was deposited in the upstream test section reacted with boric oxide to form cesium metaborate.","","","","","","United States","2001-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 134; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0607121266","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822261","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822261","","Nuclear Technology","1","134"

The Westinghouse probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) was used for screening probabilistically important scenarios only. Corresponding integrated-behavior-logic diagrams (IBLDs) were constructed, and accident trajectories were developed. Small cold-leg break accidents and direct vessel injection line break accidents were analyzed. Scenarios in which TH phenomena may play a major role, and which have the highest frequency of core uncovery and heatup were identified. Important insights were obtained. Application of this method to the AP600 has shown its value in prioritizing safety issues. Its application to the AP600 has been further ensured by (a) relying on the Westinghouse PRA to model functional/logical relationships of the components/systems, (b) using a peer review approach to validate the most important IBLDs, and (c) comparing accident trajectories with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission-sponsored AP600 experimental results. While this application has demonstrated effectiveness of the method in accident scenario screening for the AP600, the TH-PA method has broader potential.","","","","","","United States","2001-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 269-289","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0595121254","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822249","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822249","","Nuclear Technology","3","133"

Benchmarking computational methods in all aspects of the fuel cycle with measured data is then an obvious necessity. Analysis of public domain data reveals that the cycle-2 irradiation in the Quad Cities-1 boiling water reactor is the most recent U.S. destructive examination, involving the irradiation of five mixed-oxide (MOX) assemblies using 80 and 90% fissile Pu, quite close to weapons-grade Pu isotopic. Such measurements are rare, and they might be the only source of information to quantify differences in key neutronics parameters between high-fissile Pu systems and the well-characterized use of reactor-grade Pu. The pin neutronic performances for the UO{sub 2} and MOX fuels are compared with assembly-level calculation in which {approx}20% of the pins are MOX pins surrounded by UO{sub 2} pins. For MOX rods, HELIOS models the chains for the isotopes of uranium and plutonium reasonably well when compared with measured data at {approx}12,000 MWd/tonne. However, indications are that the amounts of heavier actinides are underpredicted. Measurements and calculations of the relative pin power distribution for the last few weeks of the irradiation and the burnup are fairly consistent. The critical effects of the contribution of the 0.296-eV resonance to the production of higher actinides and the destruction of {sup 239}Pu are discussed.","","","","","","United States","2001-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 310-324","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0597121256","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822251","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822251","","Nuclear Technology","3","133"

Two fluence reduction options, peripheral assembly replacement and additional shield installation in the outer core structures, were applied to the Kori Unit-1 reactor, and the fluence reduction effect was carefully analyzed. For an accurate estimate of the neutron fluence at the RPV and a reasonable description of the modified peripheral assemblies, a full-scope explicit modeling of a Monte Carlo simulation was employed in all calculations throughout this study. The Kori Unit-1 cycle-16 core was modeled on a three-dimensional representation by using the MCNP4B code, and the fluence distribution was estimated at the inner wall beltline around the circumferential weld of the RPV. On the basis of fracture toughness requirements of the RPV, the two modified cases were predicted to have an additional life of 7 to 10 effective full-power years. Throughout the core nuclear characteristics analyses, it was confirmed that the critical peaking factors for safe reactor operation were satisfied with the design limits.","","","","","","United States","2001-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 325-337","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0598121257","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822252","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822252","","Nuclear Technology","3","133"

A mathematical model to predict a breakthrough curve of I{sub 2} on the adsorbent bed was proposed. This model consists of the mass balance equation of I{sub 2} in the adsorbent bed, the mass transfer equation of I{sub 2} through the boundary layer surrounding the adsorbent particle, the intraparticle diffusion equation of I{sub 2}, and the kinetic equation for the gas-solid reaction between I{sub 2} and loaded Ag{sup 0}. Two unknown parameters in the model, the intraparticle diffusivity D{sub e} and the apparent rate constant for the gas-solid reaction k{sub r} were determined simultaneously from the adsorption data measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer. The breakthrough curves predicted by the model using these parameters were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The rate-controlling step was evaluated by the effectiveness factor calculated from the k{sub r} value and the concentration gradient of I{sub 2} in the adsorbent particles, which was estimated by the model. From these results, the adsorbent structure required to improve the process performance is discussed.

In this study, the simulation of a depressurization accident without reactor scram (DAWS) was performed for a future HTGR with 450-MW thermal output, introducing the annular core of pin-in-block-type fuel, which was originally designed in Japan. The DAWS has the possibility of becoming one of the severe accidents postulated in the HTGR. To perform an accurate simulation, a new analytical model for reactor dynamics and indirect decay heat removal from the surface of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) during the DAWS was developed. The features of the new simulation model are as follows:1. A single-channel model is coupled with a two-dimensional reactor thermal model in the new simulation model. The reactor kinetics with a single-channel model during the DAWS is simulated taking into account heat removal from the reactor calculated in the R-Z reactor thermal model, including the RPV and indirect vessel cooling system. No conventional calculation codes with a single channel have a heat removal model from an RPV or were able to simulate precisely the transient during DAWS.2. A xenon buildup and decay model for the reactivity calculation is made in addition to one point-kinetics approximation to simulate a recriticality and a power oscillation following the initiation of the DAWS.3. A transient simulation can be performed for two kinds of core models of pin-in-block- and multihole-type fuels.The accurate evaluation of xenon density and core temperature is of prime importance in the simulation of the DAWS. From the simulation result with a proper safety margin, it was confirmed that the safety performance of passive decay heat removal with cooling indirectly from the surface of the RPV is outstanding for the DAWS, and a severe-accident-free HTGR can be designed. The newly developed code is applicable to the detailed safety evaluation necessary to future HTGR design.","","","","","","United States","2001-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 141-152","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0586121245","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822240","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822240","","Nuclear Technology","2","133"

Lead-bismuth fluid properties have been added to the ATHENA code so that it can be used in the thermal-hydraulic analysis of lead-bismuth-cooled reactors. The capability of ATHENA to calculate the void fraction of a two-component, two-phase mixture of liquid lead-bismuth and steam in cocurrent upflow was assessed using the El-Boher and Lesin void correlation. The assessment showed that the drift flux correlations currently available in the code predicted trends that were in reasonable agreement with the El-Boher and Lesin void correlation, but the predicted void fractions were significantly too high. For example, the Kataoka-Ishii correlation, which was the best of the available correlations, predicted void fractions that were up to 30% greater than the values from the El-Boher and Lesin correlation. Consequently, the El-Boher and Lesin correlation was implemented in a modified version of ATHENA. The implementation was complicated by the fact that the El-Boher and Lesin correlation was an explicit correlation for void fraction rather than a drift flux correlation. An approach was developed so that the code's basic drift flux formulation could be used to easily implement an explicit void correlation. The predictions of the modified code were in excellent agreement with the El-Boher and Lesin void correlation.","","","","","","United States","2001-02-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 187-193","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0589121248","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822243","","Nuclear Technology","2","133"

The neutronic characteristics of the fissile and fertile materials have been exploited to arrive at optimal fuel assembly and core configurations. Each fuel assembly consists of an enriched uranium seed zone and a thoria blanket zone. They are in the form of ring-type fuel clusters. The fuel is contained in vertical pressure tubes placed in a hexagonal lattice array in a D{sub 2}O moderator. Boiling H{sub 2}O coolant is used. The {sup 235}U enrichment is {approx}5.4%. The thoria rods contain the {sup 233}U bred in situ by irradiation of one batch load of mere thoria clusters (without the seed zone) for one fuel cycle in the same reactor. There is no need for external feed enrichment in thoria rods. Additionally, some moveable thoria clusters are used for the purpose of xenon override. The fissile production rate from the fertile material and the consumption rate of fissile inventory is judiciously balanced by the choice of U/Th fuel rod diameter and the number and location of thoria rods in the fuel assembly and in the core. During steady-state operation at rated power level, there is no need for any conventional control maneuvers such as change in soluble boron concentration or control rod movement as a function of burnup. Burnable poison rods are also not required. A very small reactivity fluctuation of {+-}2 mk in 300 effective full-power days of operation is achieved and can be nearly met by coolant inlet enthalpy changes or moveable thoria clusters. Control is required only for cold shutdown of the reactor. The uranium as well as thoria rods achieve a fairly high burnup of 30 to 35 GWd/tonne at the time of discharge. Since the excess reactivity for hot-full-power operation is nearly zero at all times during the fuel cycle and since the coefficients of reactivity due to temperature and density variations of coolant are nearly zero by design, there is hardly any possibility of severe accidents involving large reactivity excursions.","","","","","","United States","2001-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-32","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0577121236","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822231","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822231","","Nuclear Technology","1","133"

When the heat exchangers of the decay heat removal system are operated in the upper plenum of a reactor vessel, cold sodium exiting the heat exchangers may penetrate into the gap regions between fuel subassemblies; this gap flow between the wrapper tubes of subassemblies is called interwrapper flow (IWF). During natural circulation decay heat removal, IWF will significantly modify the flow and temperature distributions in the subassemblies. Sodium experiments were carried out to investigate these phenomena, using a test section consisting of seven subassemblies housed and connected to an upper plenum. The cooling effect of IWF on the fuel subassemblies was evaluated and a new nondimensional parameter was deduced to characterize this effect. On the other hand, IWF reduced the natural circulation flow in the primary loop due to a temperature decrease in the upper part of the core. A balance between the cooling effect and the flow reduction effect is discussed. Three-dimensional analyses were performed to establish an estimation method for IWF. For the temperature decreases due to IWF at the hottest point in the subassemblies there was good agreement between experiments and predictions.","","","","","","United States","2001-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 77-91","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0581121240","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822235","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822235","","Nuclear Technology","1","133"

Past records of anomalous changes noted in reactor water quality were first surveyed to identify the substances presenting the highest probability of intrusion into reactor water. The ions and their concentrations were derived, taking into account mutual chemical reactions among the substances and the plant operating conditions affecting the balance equation of the reactor primary system.The results predicted for the peak conductivity of reactor water during plant startup were within {+-}15% of the measured data. This good agreement found on a comparison of estimated results with measured data from an actual plant substantiated the validity of the present method.","","","","","","United States","2001-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 133; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 92-102","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0582121241","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822236","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822236","","Nuclear Technology","1","133"

The experiments were performed with partly burned fuel in two compact and uniform core configurations in the same arrangements as were used in the fresh fuel criticality benchmark experiment performed in 1991. In the experiments, both core configurations contained only 12 wt% U-ZrH fuel with 20% enriched uranium. The first experimental core contained 43 fuel elements with average burnup of 1.22 MWd or 2.8% {sup 235}U burned. The last experimental core configuration was composed of 48 fuel elements with average burnup of 1.15 MWd or 2.6% {sup 235}U burned. The experimental determination of k{sub eff} for both core configurations, one subcritical and one critical, are presented. Burnup for all fuel elements was calculated in two-dimensional four-group diffusion approximation using the TRIGLAV code.

Generalized learning or direct inverse control architecture was adopted in which the neural network was trained off-line to learn the inverse model of the PWR. Two neural network controllers were designed: One provided control rod position, which controlled the axial power distribution, and the other provided the change in boron concentration, which adjusted core total power. An additional feedback controller was designed so that power tracking capability was improved. The time duration between control actions was 15 min; thus, the xenon effect is limited and can be neglected. Therefore, the xenon concentration was not considered as a controller input variable, which simplified controller design.

To boost the epithermal neutron flux at the reference irradiation point, the efficiency of a fission plate with almost 1.5 kg of 20% enriched uranium and 2.3 kW of thermal power is investigated. With the same purpose in mind, the TRIGA reactor core setup is optimized, and standard fresh fuel elements are concentrated partly in the outermost ring of the core. Further, a detailed parametric study of the materials and dimensions for all the relevant parts of the irradiation facility is carried out. Some of the standard epithermal neutron filter/moderator materials, as well as 'pressed-only' low-density Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and AlF{sub 3}, are considered. The proposed version of the BNCT facility, with PbF{sub 2} as the epithermal neutron filter/moderator, provides an epithermal neutron flux of {approx}1.1 x 10{sup 9} n/cm{sup 2}.s, thus enabling patient irradiation times of &lt;60 min.

The design presents an equally efficient alternative to the BNCT beams in TRIGA reactor thermal columns that are more commonly applied. The cavity of the dry cell, a former JSI TRIGA reactor spent-fuel storage facility, adjacent to the thermalizing column, could rather easily be rearranged into a suitable patient treatment room, which would substantially decrease the overall developmental costs.","","","","","","United States","2000-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 179-195","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0558121217","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822212","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822212","","Nuclear Technology","2","132"

The MELCOR input deck for Kuosheng NPP is established based on Kuosheng NPP design data and the MELCOR users' guides. The initial steady-state conditions are generated with a developed self-initialization algorithm. The main severe accident phenomena and the fission product release fractions associated with the SBO accident were simulated. The predicted results are plausible and as expected in light of current understanding of severe accident phenomena. The uncertainty of this analysis is briefly discussed. The important features of the MELCOR 1.8.4 are described. The estimated results provide useful information for the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of Kuosheng NPP.

The calculations were carried out on a Three Mile Island Unit 2 configuration using the computer code SCDAP/RELAP5/MOD3.2.Different accident scenarios were simulated. The high-pressure injection and makeup flow rates were changed. The extreme case with no water being added during the accident was examined. Reflood by restart of coolant pump 2B was also studied. Finally, the size of the power-operated relief valve opening was also changed. The effects of these accident scenarios on the accident progression and the core damage process were studied.It is concluded that, according to code MOD3.2, the molten material slumped to the lower head of the reactor vessel when the junction of the top and side crusts failed after the molten pool had reached the periphery of the core. When the effective stress caused by pressure imbalance inside and outside of the crust became larger than the ultimate strength of the crust, the crust failed mechanically.","","","","","","United States","2000-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 256-280","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0564121223","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822218","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822218","","Nuclear Technology","2","132"

To consider the full isotopic composition and the temperature effect, new MCNP libraries have been generated from ENDF/B-VI release 3 and validated for typical benchmark problems. The lattice codes WIMS-AECL and HELIOS were then benchmarked by the MCNP code for the major physics parameters such as burnup reactivity, coolant void reactivity, fuel temperature coefficient, etc. The calculations have shown that the physics parameters estimated by the lattice codes are consistent with those by MCNP. However, there is a tendency that the error increases slightly when the fuel burnup is high. This study has shown that the WIMS-AECL produces reliable results for CANDU fuel analysis. However, it is recommended that the cross-section library be updated to be used for the high-burnup fuels even though the current results are generally acceptable. This study has also shown that the HELIOS code has the potential to be used for CANDU fuel lattice analysis in the future.","","","","","","United States","2000-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 128-151","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0555121214","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822209","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822209","","Nuclear Technology","1","132"

The plant conditions of Yonggwang Units 3 and 4, a pressurized water reactor (PWR) of 2815-MW(thermal) power in Korea, were reviewed, and possible event sequences were identified. From the CCT analysis for the five cases of typical plant configurations, it was estimated for the earliest CCT to be 40 min after the event in a case with a large cold-leg opening and emptied steam generators (SGs). However, the case with water-filled SGs significantly delayed the CCT through the heat removal to the secondary side. From the GIPR analysis for the six possible gravity-injection paths from the refueling water storage tank (RWST), the case with the injection point and opening on the other leg side was estimated to be the most suitable path to avoid core boiling. In addition, from the sensitivity study, it was evaluated for the plant to be capable of providing the core cooling for the long-term transient if nominal RWST water is available. As a result, these analysis methods and results will provide useful information in understanding the plant behavior and preparing the mitigation measures after the event, especially for Combustion Engineering-type PWR plants. However, to directly apply the analysis results to the emergency procedure for such an event, additional case studies are needed for a wide range of operating conditions such as reactor coolant inventory, RWST water temperature, and core decay heat rate.","","","","","","United States","2000-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 152-166","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0556121215","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822210","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822210","","Nuclear Technology","1","132"

The purpose of this engineered safety feature is to prevent the ATR's surge tank, which contains compressed air, from emptying during a small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA). If the surge tank were to empty, the air introduced into the primary coolant loop could potentially cause the performance of the primary and/or emergency coolant pumps to degrade, thereby reducing core thermal margins. Safety analysis performed with the RELAP5 thermal-hydraulic code and the SINDA thermal analyzer shows that adequate thermal margins are maintained during an SBLOCA with the new engineered safety feature installed. The analysis also shows that the surge tank will not empty during an SBLOCA even if one of the primary coolant pumps fails to trip.","","","","","","United States","2000-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 167-178","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0557121216","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822211","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822211","","Nuclear Technology","1","132"

The TPSA method is an optimization algorithm that is based on SA, but has several distinguishing features: an automatic temperature annealing schedule, time homogeneity, and a significant affinity with parallel execution. The calculation results of a test problem revealed that TPSA was superior to traditional SA in terms of detailed loading pattern optimizations. The reason for this is that the TPSA temperature annealing schedule can effectively avoid local optima by repeating a cooling and heating cycle automatically.","","","","","","United States","2000-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 136; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 247-257","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US06N0060106828","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20804666","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20804666","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","2","136"

For a high plutonium mass per pebble and low burnup values, k{sub {infinity}} decreases with uniform temperature, which indicates a negative uniform temperature coefficient of reactivity (UTC). However, for a low plutonium mass per pebble, as well as for a high plutonium mass per pebble in combination with high burnup, k{sub {infinity}} is maximal at a particular uniform temperature. Below this temperature, the UTC is positive, while above this temperature it is negative. Branching calculations with only a varying moderator temperature show almost the same behavior, which indicates that the contribution of the fuel temperature plays a minor role for the mentioned effect. To understand the reactivity effect, the moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) is investigated by two methods. In the first method, changes in reaction rates of individual nuclides and their corresponding contributions to the MTC are calculated, whereas in the second method the four-factor formula has been used. For the fresh fuel cases, the positive coefficient at low temperature is due to a positive coefficient for the thermal utilization factor. For high moderator temperatures, the coefficient for the resonance escape probability renders the MTC negative. This trend is basically caused by the shift of the high-energy tail of the Maxwell-spectrum toward the 1-eV resonance of {sup 240}Pu, and toward the resonances of {sup 241}Pu, which leads to an increase of the capture-to-fission ratio.","","","","","","United States","2000-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 279-296","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0538121197","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822192","","Nuclear Technology","3","131"

A specific large-break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) for Kuosheng NPP is simulated with the use of the MELCOR 1.8.4 code. This accident is induced by a double-ended guillotine break of one of the recirculation pipes concurrent with complete failure of the emergency core cooling system. The MELCOR input deck for the Kuosheng NPP is established based on the design data of the Kuosheng NPP and the MELCOR users' guides. The initial steady-state conditions are generated with a developed self-initialization algorithm. The effect of the MELCOR 1.8.4-provided initialization process is demonstrated. The main severe accident phenomena and the corresponding fission product released fractions associated with the large-break LOCA sequences are simulated. The MELCOR 1.8.4 predicts a longer time interval between the core collapse and vessel failure and a higher source term. This MELCOR 1.8.4 input deck will be applied to the probabilistic risk assessment, the severe accident analysis, and the severe accident management study of the Kuosheng NPP in the near future.","","","","","","United States","2000-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 319-331","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0540121199","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822194","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822194","","Nuclear Technology","3","131"

This consists of the possibility of obtaining proper uncertainty bands each time a nuclear plant transient scenario is calculated. A methodology suitable for introducing such a capability into a system code is discussed. At the basis of the derivation of the code with (the capability of) internal assessment of uncertainty (CIAU), there is the uncertainty methodology based on the accuracy extrapolation (UMAE), previously proposed by the University of Pisa, although other uncertainty methodologies can be used for the same purpose.The idea of the CIAU is the identification and the characterization of standard plant statuses and the association of uncertainty to each status. One hypercube and one time interval identify the plant status. Quantity and time uncertainties are combined for each plant status.The recently released U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission RELAP5/MOD3.2 system code constitutes the CIAU. This is used for showing the applicability of the proposed method. The derivation of the methodology is discussed, and reference results of pressurized water reactor plant transients are shown bounded by the CIAU-calculated uncertainty bands.","","","","","","United States","2000-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 159-196","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0531121190","10.13182/NT00-5","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","20822185","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822185","","Nuclear Technology","2","131"

For better understanding and proper improvement of the reactivity coefficient problem of ROX, the fuel temperature coefficient, the void coefficient, and the delayed neutron fraction were also studied. A mixed-oxide (MOX)-fueled LWR was considered for reference purposes.From the result of the cell burnup calculation, ROX fuel transmutes 90% of net initially loaded weapons-grade Pu, and 2.5% of initially loaded Pu is converted to MAs when V{sub m}/V{sub f} is 2.0 and discharge burnup in effective full-power days is equivalent to that of 33 GWd/t in MOX fuel. Reactor-grade Pu-based ROX fuel transmutes 80% of net initially loaded Pu, and 6.7% of initially loaded Pu converts to MAs with the same condition as the weapons-grade Pu ROX fuel. TOX fuel also has a good Pu transmutation capability, but the {sup 233}U production amount is approximately a half of the fissile Pu transmutation amount. The MA production amount in TOX fuel is lower than that in MOX and ROX fuels. The LLFP production amount in ROX fuel is lower than that in MOX and TOX fuels. The radiotoxicity hazard of ROX spent fuel is lower compared to that in TOX and MOX spent fuels.The thermal neutron energy region is important in ROX fuel for fuel temperature coefficient and void coefficient problems. From these calculations, 15 to 20% {sup 232}Th-added ROX fuel seems the best to use as a once-through Pu-burning fuel compared to TOX and MOX fuels in conventional LWRs, because of its higher Pu transmutation, lower radiotoxicity hazard.","","","","","","United States","2000-08-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 197-209","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0532121191","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822186","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822186","","Nuclear Technology","2","131"

Understanding the intricacies of fusion power, promised for 50 years, ,is sometimes difficult because there are a number of ways of doing it. There is hot fusion, cold fusion and con-fusion. Hot fusion is what powers suns through the conversion of mass energy to kinetic energy. Cold fusion generates con-fusion and nobody really knows what it is. Honestly - this is true. There does seem to be something going on here; I just don't know what. Apparently some experimenters get energy out of a process many call cold fission but no one seems to know what it is, or how to do it reliably.

The model uses point kinetics to study core-wide oscillations, and it couples two time-domain calculations, for the fundamental and first harmonic modes, to study out-of-phase oscillations. The channel coolant flow dynamics is dominant in the power fluctuations observed by in-core nuclear instrumentation, and additive white noise is added to the solution for the channel flow in the thermal-hydraulic model to generate a noisy power time series. Autoregressive analysis performed with the computer-generated series agrees with the stability properties of the boiling channel.

The apparatus was used in the temperature gradient 1 (TG1) experiment to measure fission product releases from Zircaloy-sheathed irradiated Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) UO{sub 2} fuel samples during fast temperature ramps in the presence of a radial temperature gradient in the fuel. The ohmic heating of the UO{sub 2}, combined with surface heat removal by the surrounding helium coolant flow, produced a radial temperature profile that approximates the profile for fission- or decay-heated fuel.The 11 tests conducted in the TG1 experiment simulated various transient heating rates and high-temperature annealing conditions. The results indicate that the DEH technique can produce large radial temperature gradients and rapid heating rates. Ceramographic examinations showed columnar grain growth and evidence of UO{sub 2} melting. Chemical interactions between the tungsten electrodes and the UO{sub 2} were also observed. Releases of krypton, and release and redistribution of cesium were measured. Fission product release and redistribution results from some of the tests are also reported.The Kr measurements indicated that the amount of Kr released was highly dependent upon the peak dwell power: The higher the dwell power, the higher the cumulative release. The redistribution of cesium was mapped using emission gamma radiography of the fuel specimen after the test. Cesium was released from the center of the fuel sample where temperatures were the highest. A well-defined area was confirmed near the center where the Cs activity was depleted. The measured Kr releases were in good agreement with the Cs migration and release.","","","","","","United States","2000-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 22-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0523121182","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822177","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822177","","Nuclear Technology","1","131"

Following an SBLOCA, the transient two-phase level in the core recedes below the top of the core, exposing the core to steam cooling and heatup of the fuel. To compute the velocity distributions, the Navier-Stokes equations were solved in vorticity form using an explicit upwind finite difference numerical scheme. The model was applied to the well-known lid-driven cavity problem and the data in the literature for vertically heated channels. Comparison of the model to the data in the literature provided validation of the approach.Application of the model to the conditions at the time of the peak clad temperature during core uncovery for a typical limiting small cold-leg break in a pressurized water reactor further revealed that the hot-channel steam flow can vary dramatically at the hot spot due to the severe distortion in the axial steam flow that is characteristic of asymmetrically heated channels. The results of the evaluation support the need for a thorough technical basis for the steam flow rates that are typically assumed to cool the hot rods in many commercial fuel rod heatup codes. These codes typically assume a constant mass flow along the axis of the fuel rod to compute the cladding temperature response. Mixed convection is shown to reduce the channel average velocity along the axis of the fuel rod by as much as 15%. The reductions in channel velocity will produce an attendant increase in the peak clad temperature achieved during an SBLOCA. The results of this study suggest that for the steam velocities used to cool hot rods during an SBLOCA, one needs to consider the mixed-convection behavior that can affect the convective heat transfer in the upper portions of exposed nuclear fuel bundles.","","","","","","United States","2000-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 69-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0526121185","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822180","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822180","","Nuclear Technology","1","131"

The simulation has been performed using the computer code SPECTRA, a thermal-hydraulic code, designed specifically for analyzing containment behavior of nuclear power plants.Results of the present calculations are compared to the measurement data as well as the results obtained earlier with the codes MELCOR, TRAC-BF1, and TRACG. The calculated PCC efficiencies are somewhat lower than the measured values. Similar underestimation of PCC efficiencies had been obtained in the past, with the other computer codes. To explain this difference, it is postulated that condensate coming into the tubes forms a stream of liquid in one or two tubes, leaving most of the tubes unaffected. The condensate entering the water box is assumed to fall down in the form of droplets. With these assumptions, the results calculated with SPECTRA are close to the experimental data.It is concluded that the SPECTRA code is a suitable tool for analyzing containments of advanced reactors, equipped with passive containment cooling systems.","","","","","","United States","2000-07-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 131; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 82-101","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0527121186","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822181","","Nuclear Technology","1","131"

The continuing research and development (R and D) in accelerator-driven systems and accelerator-driven transmutation of waste have brought attention to the lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) nuclear coolant technology. Around the world R and D organizations are investigating the LBE technology in the areas of materials and corrosion, coolant quality control, thermal hydraulics, and nuclear data. There have also been concerted efforts to develop very long lived core, lead-alloy-cooled, proliferation-resistant, super safe, and transportable reactors. In this paper, the thermodynamic basis for controlling oxygen level in lead-bismuth to prevent steel corrosion and coolant contamination is examined. The operational conditions, including the thermodynamic activity of oxygen, cover-gas oxygen partial pressure, mixtures of H{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O (steam) for obtaining such low oxygen partial pressure, and the voltage signals of one type of oxygen sensors (with solid electrolyte and molten bismuth electrode) are calculated. These results provide the guidance to implement the oxygen control technique. The authors are performing laboratory experiments to verify this understanding and building an LBE material and thermal-hydraulic test facility to further develop LBE technology for accelerator transmutation of wastes applications.","","","Los Alamos National Lab., NM (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 23-24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004264","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086958","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086958","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

One of the key components in the ATW concept is a target that, via spallation, produces neutrons to transmute nuclear waste. Since significant heat is generated during fissioning of the waste actinides, an efficient heat removal system is necessary. Liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is an efficient coolant as well as a good spallation target for production of neutrons. The LBE coolant technology has been successfully used in Russian submarine nuclear reactors. The International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) has funded the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering (IPPE) and the Experiment and Design Organization-Gidropress (EDO-GP) of Russia to design and manufacture a pilot target (Target Circuit One-TC1) that incorporates Russian LBE technology into the ATW concept. The target will be tested in the 800-MeV, 1-mA proton beam at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in 2 yr. These target experiments will provide valuable information on the performance of LBE as both spallation target and coolant. They will also help to design target/blanket systems for future ATW facilities. In summary, the authors have carried out thermal-hydraulic analyses for the LANL/IPPE/EDO-GP 1-MW LBE target. It is shown that the current design is suitable for the beam-on tests. The diffuser plate successfully enhances the coolant flow around the window center but still avoids generating recirculation zone downstream. The temperature range is within the proper operation range for both the LBE coolant and the structural materials.","","","Los Alamos National Lab., NM (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 24","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004265","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086959","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086959","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

When this legislation was enacted, the 70,000-tonne limit appeared sufficient for the spent fuel already produced by commercial nuclear power plants (NPPs), plus the bulk of the spent fuel to be produced through the remaining NPP licensed lifetimes (a total of 40 yr). Recent developments require reexamination of this premise. On one hand, average fuel burnups achieved in current reactors have increased substantially. Many pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel batches average &gt;45 GWd/tonne compared to an average of 35 GWd/tonne in the mid-1980s. This will reduce storage requirements. On the other hand, utility deregulation, consolidation of the nuclear utility industry, and improvements in US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing efficiency have led to prospects that 90 of the 103 operating NPPs may seek license renewals for a total of 60 yr of operation. This could lead to a large increase in spent-fuel quantities. Extending the lifetime of 90 NPPs by 20 yr each will have significant economic and environmental benefits. However, unless the issue of eventual disposition of spent fuel from these relicensed NPPs is confronted soon, there will be difficulty in achieving license renewals. Several approaches can be considered, as follows: (1) Amend the law to increase the quantity of spent fuel to be disposed of in the first repository; (2) Begin the process of siting and licensing a second repository; (3) Further reduce the quantity of spent fuel generated by developing and using high-burnup fuel; and (4) Seek means, consistent with US nonproliferation policy, to recycle some US spent fuel.","","","Gamma Engineering (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 65-66","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004284","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20086978","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20086978","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

Mechanical decontamination processes, by comparison, leave the surface layer distorted, highly stressed, and contaminated with process media. Techniques employing grinding and particle impingement rework the surface of malleable metals such as stainless steel, folding the contamination into pockets where material is released for uncontrolled use.

"Investigation of BWR depletion calculations with SAS2H","Wagner, J C; DeHart, M D","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; BWR TYPE REACTORS; BURNUP; S CODES; SPENT FUELS; CRITICALITY; H CODES","The SAS2H sequence of the SCALE system has historically been used to characterize isotopics, radiation sources, and decay heat for spent nuclear fuel. However, there has been little work performed to investigate the viability of the SAS2H modeling limitations in application to the geometric complexities of boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel. Thus, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has initiated a study to investigate the use of SAS2H for calculating spent BWR fuel isotopics for criticality analyses and to assess the adequacy of SAS2H for this task. This paper discusses comparisons between one-dimensional (1-D) SAS2H and detailed two-dimensional (2-D) HELIOS assembly calculations.

"Fundamental-mode sources in approach to critical experiments","Goda, J; Busch, R","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; MULTIPLICATION FACTORS; FISSION NEUTRONS; CRITICALITY; SAFETY; CRITICAL MASS; ZERO POWER REACTORS; REACTIVITY; RESEARCH PROGRAMS; RADIATION SOURCES","An equivalent fundamental-mode source is an imaginary source that is distributed identically in space, energy, and angle to the fundamental-mode fission source. Therefore, it produces the same neutron multiplication as the fundamental-mode fission source. Even if two source distributions produce the same number of spontaneous fission neutrons, they will not necessarily contribute equally toward the multiplication of a given system. A method of comparing the relative importance of source distributions is needed. A factor, denoted as g* and defined as the ratio of the fixed-source multiplication to the fundamental-mode multiplication, is used to convert a given source strength to its equivalent fundamental-mode source strength. This factor is of interest to criticality safety as it relates to the 1/M method of approach to critical. Ideally, a plot of 1/M versus {kappa}{sub eff} is linear. However, since 1/M = (1 {minus} {kappa}{sub eff})/g*, the plot will be linear only if g* is constant with {kappa}{sub eff}. When g* increases with {kappa}{sub eff}, the 1/M plot is said to be conservative because the critical mass is underestimated. However, it is possible for g* to decrease with {kappa}{sub eff} yielding a nonconservative 1/M plot. A better understanding of g* would help predict whether a given approach to critical will be conservative or nonconservative. The equivalent fundamental-mode source strength g*S can be predicted by experiment. The experimental method was tested on the XIX-1 core on the Fast Critical Assembly at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The results showed a 30% difference between measured and calculated values. However, the XIX-1 reactor had significant intermediate-energy neutrons. The presence of intermediate-energy neutrons may have made the cross-section set used for predicted values less than ideal for the system.","","","Los Alamos National Lab., NM (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 177-178","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004728","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20104485","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104485","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

Russia has launched more than 30 reactors. The RTGs use the heat of alpha decay of {sup 238}Pu for power and typically generate &lt;1 kW of electricity. Apollo, Pioneer, Voyager, Viking, Galileo, Ulysses, and Cassini all used RTGs. Space reactors use the fission energy of {sup 235}U; typical designs are for 100 to 1000 kW of electricity. The only US space reactor launch (SNAP-10A) was a demonstration mission. One reason for the lack of space reactor use by the United States was the lack of space missions that required high power. But, another was the assumed negative publicity that would accompany a reactor launch. The net result is that all space reactor programs after 1970 were terminated before an operating space reactor could be developed, and they are now many years from recovering the ability to build them. Two major near-term needs for space reactors are the human exploration of Mars and advanced missions to and beyond the orbit of Jupiter. To help obtain public acceptance of space reactors, one must correct some of the misconceptions concerning space reactors and convey the following facts to the public and to decision makers: Space reactors are 1000 times smaller in power and size than a commercial power reactor. A space reactor at launch is only as radioactive as a pile of dirt 60 m (200 ft) across. A space reactor contains no plutonium at launch. It does not become significantly radioactive until it is turned on, and it will be engineered so that no launch accident can turn it on, even if that means fueling it after launch. The reactor will not be turned on until it is in a high stable orbit or even on an earth-escape trajectory for some missions. The benefits of space reactors are that they give humanity a stairway to the planets and perhaps the stars. They open a new frontier for their children and their grandchildren. They pave the way for all life on earth to move out into the solar system. At one time, humans built and flew space reactors; it is time to do so again.","","","Sandia National Lab., Albuquerque, NM (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 190","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004734","","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","20104491","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104491","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

"An economics figure of merit in ALPS","Shatilla, Y A","29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY AND ECONOMY; 21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; DEREGULATION; NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS; FUEL MANAGEMENT; WESTINGHOUSE STANDARD REACTOR; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS","One of the most pressing issues facing the deregulated nuclear electric power industry is its economic competitiveness when compared to other sources of electrical power. Traditionally, finding the optimum loading pattern (LP) that meets all the safety and operational objective functions and at the same time produces the most attractive economical solutions is an iterative process. This is because (a) LP search tools usually lack the capability to generate equilibrium solutions and (b) economics objective functions are hard to include in the search process. In this paper, the Westinghouse Advanced Loading Pattern Search code (ALPS) has been demonstrated to successfully find LPs that meet user-defined operational and safety as well as economics objectives. This has been made possible by the development of TULIP language that allows the integration of external procedures into the search process of the main program, ALPS. In the example given, an economic figure of merit (EFM) has been defined and included via TULIP script into the fuel management optimization problem of a three-loop Westinghouse core operating an 18-month cycle. The LPs found by ALPS exhibit a clear trend of meeting and, in some cases, exceeding the EFM objective function defined for the ALPS search process a priori.","","","Westinghouse (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 213-215","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004737","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20104494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104494","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

Of primary interest here is the simplified system design, featuring steam generators that are directly immersed in the lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) coolant of the primary system. To support the safety case for this design approach, model development and analysis of transient coolant voiding during a postulated guillotine-type steam generator tube rupture event has been carried out. For the current design, the blowdown will occur from the steam generator shell into the ruptured 12.7-mm-inside-diameter tube through which the LBE coolant passes. The steam will expand biaxially in the tube, with a portion of the flow vented upward to eventually expand into the cover-gas region, while the balance of the flow is vented downward as a jet into the surrounding downward-flowing LBE. Coolant freezing is not an issue in this case because of high feedwater temperature in relation to the freezing point of the LBE. The specific objectives of the current work are to (a) determine the penetration behavior of the steam jet into the lower cold-leg region, (b) characterize the resultant void behavior in terms of coherent bubble versus breakup into a size distribution of small bubbles, and (c) characterize the motion of the bubbles with regard to rise to the cover-gas region (via the liner-to-coolant vessel gap) versus downward transport with the flowing LBE and subsequent upflow through the core to the cover-gas region.","","","Argonne National Lab., IL (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 257-258","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004743","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20104500","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104500","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

In such a device, long-lived radioactive fission products and transuranic elements from spent fuel would be converted into short-lived radioactive isotopes and stable isotopes. One concern about such devices is that current proton accelerators typically experience beam interruptions many times per day. The beam interruptions last from seconds to hours. A beam interruption leads to a temperature transient similar to, but faster than, that from a reactor scram. These temperature transients cause thermal fatigue that can eventually lead to structural failures in various reactor components.

Examples are the achievement of 100% + natural-circulation heat removal from the low-power-density/low-pressure-drop ultralong lifetime core and utilization of lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) coolant enabling elimination of main coolant pumps as well as the need for an intermediate heat transport circuit. It is required to provide a passive means of removing decay heat and effecting reactor cooldown in the event that the normal steam generator heat sink, including its normal shutdown heat removal mode, is postulated to be unavailable. In the present approach, denoted as the reactor exterior cooling system (RECS), passive decay heat removal is provided by cooling the outside of the containment/guard vessel with air. RECS is similar to the reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system (RVACS) incorporated into the PRISM design. However, to enhance the heat removal, RECS incorporates fins on the containment vessel exterior to enhance heat transfer to air as well as removable steel venetian conductors that provide a conduction heat transfer path across the reactor vessel-containment vessel gap to enhance heat transfer between the vessels. The objective of the present work is to investigate the effectiveness of air cooling in removing heat from the vessel and limiting the coolant temperature increase following a sudden complete loss of the steam generator heat sink.","","","Argonne National Lab., IL (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 261-262","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004745","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20104502","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104502","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

The two options to be pursued were (a) the Accelerator Production of Tritium and (b) the use of commercial light water reactors (CLWRs). DOE committed to select one of these two options as the primary means of tritium production by the end of 1998. The other option would continue to be pursued as a backup to the primary option. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) became involved in the tritium program in early 1996, in response to an inquiry from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for an expression of interest by utilities operating nuclear power plants (NPPs). In June 1996, TVA was one of two utilities to respond to a request for proposals to irradiate lead test assemblies (LTAs) containing tritium-producing burnable absorber rods (TPBARs). TVA proposed that the LTAs be placed in Watts Bar NPP Unit 1 (WBN). TVA participated with DOE (the Defense Programs Office of CLWR Tritium Production), PNNL, and Westinghouse Electric Company (Westinghouse) in the design process to ensure that the TPBARs would be compatible with safe operation of WBN. Following US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issuance of a Safety Evaluation Report (SER) (NUREG-1607), TVA submitted a license amendment request to the NRC for approval to place four LTAs, containing eight TPBARs each, in WBN during the September 1997 refueling outage. In December 1998, DOE announced the selection of the CLWR program as the primary option for tritium production and identified the TVA WBN and Sequoyah NPP (SQN) Units 1 and 2 (SQN-1 and SQN-2, respectively) reactors as the preferred locations to perform tritium production. TVA will prepare license amendment requests for the three plants (WBN, SQN-1, and SQN-2). While the TPBARs replace discreet burnable absorbers in the reactor cores, there are differences in the reactions that occur in the absorber material (lithium aluminate versus boron). At end of life, the lithium aluminate provides considerably more reactivity holddown than the standard boron-containing burnable absorbers. Therefore, it will be necessary for the TVA plant engineering and fuels staffs, working with the fuel vendors, to define the appropriate core loading (number of fresh fuel assemblies, enrichment, etc.) to maintain safe operating limits under both operating and accident conditions. It is recognized that the irradiation of TPBARs in the TVA reactors will also require additional radiological and chemistry program upgrades.","","","TVA, Spring City, TN (US)","","","United States","2000-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 82; Conference: 2000 Annual Meeting - American Nuclear Society, San Diego, CA (US), 06/04/2000--06/08/2000; Other Information: PBD: 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 286-287","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0004751","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20104508","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20104508","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","82"

"Plutonium Recycling in Pressurized Water Reactors: Influence of the Moderator-to-Fuel Ratio","Kloosterman, Jan Leen; Bende, Evert E","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AMERICIUM; BORON; CURIUM; DELAYED NEUTRON FRACTION; FUEL PINS; MIXED OXIDE FUELS; MODERATORS; NEUTRONS; PITCHES; PLUTONIUM; PWR TYPE REACTORS; REACTIVITY WORTHS; REACTOR PHYSICS; RECYCLING; SPENT FUELS; TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT; URANIUM DIOXIDE; VOID COEFFICIENT","The reactor physics trends that can be observed when the moderator-to-fuel (MF) ratio of a mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel lattice increases from two (the standard value) to four are investigated. The influence of the MF ratio on the moderator void coefficient, the fuel temperature coefficient, the moderator temperature coefficient, the boron reactivity worth, the critical boron concentration, the mean neutron generation time, and the effective delayed neutron fraction has been investigated. Increasing the MF ratio to values larger than three gives a moderator void coefficient sufficiently large to recycle the plutonium at least four times. Also, the values of other parameters like the boron reactivity worth, the fuel temperature coefficient, the moderator temperature coefficient, and the mean neutron generation time improve with increasing MF ratio. The effective delayed neutron fraction is almost independent of the MF ratio. According to a point-kinetics model, the response of a MOX-fueled reactor with an MF ratio of four to a moderator temperature decrease is similar to that of a UO{sub 2}-fueled reactor with an MF ratio of two.Scenario studies show that recycling plutonium four times in pressurized water reactors reduces the plutonium production by a factor of three compared with a reference once-through scenario, but the americium and curium production triples. If the plutonium remaining after recycling four times is disposed of, the radiotoxicity reduces by only a factor of two. This factor increases to a maximum of five if the plutonium can be eliminated in special burner reactors. Recycling of americium and curium is needed to reduce the radiotoxicity of the spent fuel to lower values. In general, the plutonium mass reduction increases and the minor actinide production decreases with increasing MF ratio of the MOX fuel.Enlarging the MF ratio can be achieved by increasing the rod pitch or by reducing the fuel pin diameter. In both cases, the economic penalty is about the same and is quite large.","","","","","","United States","2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 227-241","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0511121170","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822165","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822165","","Nuclear Technology","3","130"

The basic idea to prevent recriticality events is to remove a certain amount of fuel material out of the core in order to keep the core subcritical. Based on the simplified models, general guidelines are given that minimize the amount of fuel removal necessary to avoid recriticality events. Multigroup two-dimensional diffusion calculations are also performed to ascertain the tendency obtained by the simple model for the reactivity insertion due to a core collapse. In the sense of controlled material relocation, the fraction of core materials is identified that should be preferentially removed out of the core to eliminate the recriticality potential.","","","","","","United States","2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 242-251","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0512121171","10.13182/NT130-242","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20822166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822166","","Nuclear Technology","3","130"

The implemented power transients of {approx}1% nominal power/s correspond to a control rod withdrawal-type accident in a liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactor (FBR). The analysis of the tests includes the information elements derived from the hodoscope signals, which were assessed quantitatively and supported by destructive and nondestructive posttest examinations. These tests, performed with fuels of various geometries, demonstrated the high margin to failure of such FBR fuel pins within the expected power level before the emergency reactor shutdown. At the same time, these tests performed with high- and low-smear-density industrial pins led to clarification of the influence of pellet design on fuel pin behavior under high overpower condition. With the high-smear-density solid fuel pellet pin of high burnup level, the retained gaseous fission products played an important role in the solid fuel swelling, leading to clad deformation and failure at a maximum heating rate of 81 kW.m{sup -1}, which is much greater than the end-of-life (EOL) linear rating of the pin. With the low smear-density annular pellet pin, an important fuel swelling takes place, leading to degradation of the fuel thermal conductivity. This effect was detected at the power level around 73 kW.m{sup -1}, which is also much higher than the EOL value of the pin. Furthermore, the absence of clad deformation, and consequently of failure even at the power level going up to 134.7 kW.m{sup -1}, confirmed the very high margin to failure. In consequence, it was clarified that gaseous fission products have significant effects on failure threshold as well as on thermal performance during overpower condition, and such effects are significantly dependent on fuel design and power operation conditions.","","","","","","United States","2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 252-271","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0513121172","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822167","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822167","","Nuclear Technology","3","130"

The simulations were performed with the RELAP5/MOD3.2 computer program. Although the simulations neglected reactivity feedback effects, the focus on the thermal-hydraulic aspects represents a step toward full analyses of hypothetical events in HIFAR. Two simulations focused on events associated with the failure of the primary coolant circulation pumps, and three simulations focus on the events associated with the reduced heat removal via the nonavailability of heat exchangers. The critical heat flux subroutine of the RELAP program was modified to account for the concentric annular fuel element geometry of HIFAR fuel elements.","","","","","","United States","2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 296-309","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0516121175","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822170","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822170","","Nuclear Technology","3","130"

The same experimental facility was used to precisely measure the gaseous molecular iodine interactions with epoxy-painted coupons conditioned by two artificial hydrothermal treatments, either by heating at 130degC in a dry atmosphere or by heating at 130 deg. C in a saturated water atmosphere. Then, a kinetic model was developed to represent these experimental results.This paper examines if the previous kinetic model can be used to interpret the gaseous molecular iodine interactions with aged paints. With the rate constant values found for the artificially conditioned paints, the kinetic model agrees with experimental results. Moreover, for the three studied temperatures (95, 110, and 125 deg. C), the values of initial adsorbed water concentration onto the paint and the adsorbed water concentration in equilibrium with the steam of the carrier gas are intermediate between the values found for the two artificial hydrothermal treatments.Finally, a kinetic model is available, allowing the evaluation of precise assessments of the gaseous molecular iodine interactions with aged epoxy paints in the case of a severe PWR accident.","","","","","","United States","2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 362-371","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0520121179","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822174","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822174","","Nuclear Technology","3","130"

Internal radiation doses from radiocesium were estimated to be as high as 8 rads/d. Total dose, which takes into account the internal dose form radiostrontium and the surrounding environment, was estimated to be 15 to 20 rads/d. In contrast, individuals from a reference population lying outside of the exclusion zone registered negligible levels of contamination. The authors used the micronucleus test in a double-blind study to analyze blood samples from 58 individuals. They scored more than 600,000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) but could not reject the null hypothesis that the frequency of micronucleated PCEs in voles exposed to radiation was equal to the frequency in unexposed voles. Results of their study stand in sharp contrast to earlier reports of increased frequencies of micronuclei in rodents exposed to fallout of the Chernobyl accident, but with radiation doses that were orders of magnitude lower than those reported here. Radio resistance and experimental methods are possible explanations for these differences in the results.","","","Texas Tech Univ., Lubbock, TX (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1644-1648","","","FC09-96SR18546","Journal ID: ISSN 0730-7268; ETOCDK; TRN: US0003425","10.1897/1551-5028(2000)019<1644:FOMIBV>2.3.CO;2","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20062549","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20062549","","Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry","6","19"

Observations of cross-sectional samples revealed short oxidized zones preceding crack tips and narrow (10-nm wide), deeply penetrated, oxidized zones along grain boundaries exposed along open cracks. High-resolution TEM imaging and fine-probe analysis were used to determine the local chemistries and structures in these corrosion-affected zones. Matrix areas surrounding the crack tips appeared highly strained, whereas the IG penetrations generally did not. The predominant oxide structure found along crack walls and just ahead of crack tips was NiO with metal-atom ratios similar to the alloy. The attacked grain boundaries off open cracks contained similar fine-grained NiO-structure oxide together with local areas of Cr-rich oxide and Ni-rich metal. In contrast, Cr-rich oxide identified as Cr2O3 predominated at the leading edges of the IG attack. Stereoscopic imaging of these tip structures revealed nm-scale porosity and tunnels within the oxide and pores along the grain-boundary plane ahead of the oxide. The general interpretation of these results is that IG attack and cracking follows local dissolution or oxidation and the formation of pores at grain boundaries. This degradation occurs at the nanometer scale and therefore requires high-resolution ATEM methods to reveal detailed characteristics. Experimental support for several possible IG degradation mechanisms is considered.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The overall strategy is: (a) generation of the problem-dependent cross-section library from basic Evaluated Nuclear Data Files such as ENDF/B-VI and JENDL-3.2 with NJOY94.10+, (b) use of the WIMSD-5 package to generate a few-group neutron macroscopic cross section for all of the materials in the core and its immediate neighborhood, (c) use the three-dimensional CITATION code to perform the global analysis of the core, and (d) checking of the validity of the CITATION diffusion code with the MCNP4B2 Monte Carlo code. The ultimate objective is to establish methods for reshuffling the current core configuration to upgrade the thermal flux at irradiation locations for increased isotope production. The computational methods, tools and techniques, customization of cross-section libraries, various models for cells and supercells, and many associated utilities are standardized and established/validated for the overall neutronic analysis. The excess reactivity, neutron flux, power distribution, power peaking factors, determination of the hot spot, and fuel temperature reactivity coefficients {alpha}{sub f} in the temperature range of 45 to 1000 deg. C are studied. All the analyses are performed using the 4- and 7-group libraries of the macroscopic cross sections generated from the 69-group WIMSD-5 library. The 7-group calculations yield comparatively better agreement with the experimental value of k{sub eff} and the other core parameters. The CITATION test runs using different cross-section sets based on the different models applied in the WIMSD-5 calculations show a strong influence of those models on the final integral parameter. Some of the cells are specially treated with the Prize options available in WIMSD-5 to take into account the fine structure of the flux gradient in the fuel-reflector interface region. The hot spot is found physically at the fuel position C4 with a maximum power density of 1.044559 x 10{sup 2} W/cm{sup 3}. The calculated total peaking factor is 5.8867 compared to the original SAR value of 5.6325. The curve of {alpha}{sub f} with the temperature at zero burnup shows that the curve deviates somewhat with that reported in the original SAR for low-enriched uranium fuel. The MCNP calculations establish that the CITATION calculations and the generated cross-section library are reasonably good for neutronic analysis of TRIGA reactors. The results obtained from the neutronic analysis will be used to analyze the thermal-hydraulic behavior and the safety margins of the core both for steady-state and pulse-mode operations.","","","","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 111-131","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0502121161","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822156","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822156","","Nuclear Technology","2","130"

Such a possibility could be provided by an LWR fuel consisting of Pu in a neutronically inert matrix. It may be necessary to add a burnable absorber or thorium to reduce the reactivity swing during burnup. The methods and data currently used for LWR analyses have not been tested in conjunction with such exotic fuel materials. An international exercise has accordingly been launched to compare the relative performance of different code systems and the accuracy of the basic data. Comparison of the results of cell calculations done with fixed isotopic densities against reference Monte Carlo results shows fairly small but systematic differences in the multiplication factors. A sensitivity analysis done with different basic cross section libraries and the same code system allows one to distinguish between the effects of the codes and those of the databases.The results of the burnup calculations indicate a fair agreement in k{sub {infinity}} both at beginning of life (BOL) and after 1200 days of irradiation [end of life (EOL)] under conditions representative of a present-day pressurized water reactor. At BOL, the fuel temperature coefficients agree fairly well among the different contributions, but unacceptably large differences are observed at EOL. The void coefficients agree well for low voidage, but for void fractions &gt;90%, there are significant effects mostly due to the databases used.

The comparison includes the depressurization and liquid-level behavior during secondary-side blowdown, natural circulation, automatic depressurization system operation, and in-containment refueling water storage tank injection. Reasonable agreement between the test results from APEX NRC-2 and ROSA/AP600 AP-BO-01 has been observed with respect to the timing of depressurization and liquid draining rates. This indicates that the reduced height and pressure scaling of APEX preserves the sequence of events relative to the full-height and pressure ROSA/AP600.","","","","","","United States","2000-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 177-183","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0506121165","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822160","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822160","","Nuclear Technology","2","130"

This technique was developed in the late 1960s and applied in several reactor designs with extensive testing performed at the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Signals employed at EBR-II included the pseudorandom binary sequence, quadratic residue binary sequence, pseudorandom ternary sequence, and multifrequency binary sequence. For all the signals employed, the resultant reactor power perturbation was small enough to be acceptable for normal at-power operation and in-place irradiation experiments. The frequency response results are compared with the zero-power frequency response function, yielding a quantitative measure of the EBR-II reactivity feedback effects. The frequency response function results are in good agreement with rod-oscillator data and model predictions. The multifrequency binary sequence concentrated 64% of the total signal power into the four feedback frequencies associated with the predominant feedback time constants. The input signal quality, characterized by the autocorrelation function and power spectra, validated the automatic control rod drive system design and operation as an effective tool for frequency response determination over the range of frequencies where important system dynamic effects occur.","","","Idaho State Univ., Pocatello, ID (US)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 145-158","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0002344","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030425","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030425","","Nuclear Technology","2","130"

In recent years, these systems have been studied to develop a cradle-to-grave process for the decontamination of ferrous metals typical of the nuclear power industry. This paper expands the understanding of this system to the dissolution of ferrous oxides found on corroded metals of nuclear facilities. It is found that pure iron oxides such as magnetite (Fe{sub 3}O{sub 4}) and hematite (Fe{sub 2}O{sub 3}) dissolve quickly (&lt;1 h) using 0.5 M 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDPA) and a strong reducing agent; the oxides with slower kinetics are the spinel structures, such as the nickel ferrites (NiOFe{sub 2}O{sub 3}), which dissolved very slowly in the foregoing solution. These results were confirmed in bench-scale tests on actual carbon steel and radioactively contaminated stainless steel samples. The decontamination of actual stainless steel from a nuclear reactor vessel required high concentrations of both HEDPA and reducing agent. Methods for treating the spent HEDPA solution are discussed.","","","Argonne National Lab., IL (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 184-195","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0002345","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030426","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030426","","Nuclear Technology","2","130"

Multigroup albedos that are representative of an external medium can be calculated via independent transport calculations and collapsed for use in a few-group three-dimensional transport calculation. The multigroup albedo method is developed and applied to the calculation of the Orphee research reactor. Numerical comparisons between full-core two-dimensional transport calculations and two-dimensional transport calculations performed with multigroup albedos show why the method is interesting. The axial power distribution obtained from a three-dimensional transport calculation with multigroup albedos precisely matches measured experimental values, while results from three-dimensional full-core diffusion calculations give unacceptable errors.","","","Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, Saclay (FR)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Science and Engineering; Journal Volume: 135; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 73-83","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5639; NSENAO; TRN: US0002348","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20030432","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20030432","","Nuclear Science and Engineering","1","135"

As reactors age, however, the material tends to suffer from degradation primarily resulting from irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC) as well as intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). Neutron-irradiated, thermally sensitized Type 304 (UNS S30400) stainless steels (SS) were examined by slow strain rate (SSR) stress corrosion cracking (SCC) tests in 290 C water of 0.2 ppm dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) and by SSR tensile tests in 290 C inert gas environment. Neutron fluences ranged from 4 x 10{sup 22} n/m{sup 2} to 3 x 10{sup 25} n/m{sup 2} (energy [E] &gt; 1 MeV). percent intergranular (%IG) cracking, which has been used as an intergranular (IG) cracking susceptibility indicator in the SSR SCC tests, changes anomalously with neutron fluence in spite of the strain-to-failure rate decreasing with an increase of neutron fluence. Apparently, %IG is a misleading indicator for the irradiated, thermally sensitized Type 304 SS and for the irradiated, nonsensitized SS when IG cracking susceptibility is compared at different neutron fluences, test temperatures, DO, and strain rates. These test parameters may affect deformation and fracture behaviors of the irradiated SS during the SSR SCC tests, resulting in changing %IG, which is given by the ratio of the total IG cracking area to the entire fracture surface area. It is suggested that strain-to-IG crack initiation for the irradiated, thermally sensitized SS and for the irradiated, nonsensitized SS is the alternative indicator in the SSR SCC tests. An engineering expedient to determine the IG crack initiation strain is given by a deviating point on superposed stress-strain curves in inert gas and in oxygenated water. The strain-to-IG crack initiation becomes smaller with an increase of neutron fluence and DO. The SSR tensile tests in inert gas are needed to obtain strain-to-IG crack initiation in addition to the SSR SCC tests in water.","","","Komae Research Lab., Tokyo (JP)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 451-459","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: US0003921","10.5006/1.3280549","","2016-05-04T00:00:00Z","20075963","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20075963","","Corrosion (Houston)","5","56"

The basic chemical composition of the steels was 12% Cr-28% Ni, simulating the grain boundary (GB) composition of irradiated Type 304 (UNS S30400) stainless steel. The EAC crack growth behavior of the steels was examined by performing trapezoidal wave cyclic loading testing on precracked specimens. Results showed that Si significantly affected the EAC by promoting intergranular cracking, with only 0.48% Si promoting almost fully intergranular cracking under trapezoidal wave loading: increasing the crack growth rate; and tending to make cracking easier in the near-surface region rather than in the center of specimens. Only transgranular cracking with relatively low crack growth rates took place in the steel without Si but doped with S and P, respectively. The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) velocities of the steels during trapezoidal wave cyclic loading were estimated. It also was found that the oxide films formed on Si-doped steels in the water were easier to detach than those on Si-free steels during ultrasonic vibration. Three possible mechanisms were proposed to explain the Si effect on EAC behavior. The present results suggest that a radiation-induced low Cr/high (Ni, Si) GB layer in Type 304 steel can be intrinsically susceptible to intergranular SCC in PWR primary water.","","","Tohoku Univ., Sendai (JP)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 460-469","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: US0003922","10.5006/1.3280550","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","20075964","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20075964","","Corrosion (Houston)","5","56"

Effects of flow rate on intergranular crack growth in sensitized Type 304 stainless steel (UNS S30400) in distilled water containing 15 ppm or 25 ppm (2.59 x 10{sup {minus}4} or 4.31 x 10{sup {minus}4} m) sodium chloride (NaCl) at 250 C were examined using compact tension (CT) specimens under constant loading conditions. On increasing the flow rate, the crack growth rate (CGR) drastically increased, but later decreased to a level that was lower than the initial value. The initial increase in CGR was attributed to an enhanced rate of mass transfer of oxygen to the external surface, where it consumed the current emanating from the crack mouth. However, the subsequent decrease in CGR was attributed to crack flushing, which is a delayed process because of the time required to destroy the aggressive conditions that exist within the crack. Once flushing destroyed the aggressive crack environment, CGR decreased with increasing flow rate. The time over which CGR increased after an increase in the flow rate depended on how fast crack flushing occurred by fluid flow; the higher the flow rate and the greater the crack opening, the faster the crack flushing and the shorter the transition time. Finally, intergranular cracks propagated faster in regions nearer both sides of the Ct specimens, where the oxygen supply to the external surface was enhanced under stirring conditions and where minimal resistance existed to current flow from the crack tip to the external surfaces. This observation provided evidence that the crack's internal and external environments were coupled electrochemically.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park, PA (US)","","","United States","2000-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: May 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 482-491","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: US0003923","10.5006/1.3280552","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","20075966","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20075966","","Corrosion (Houston)","5","56"

The group fluxes of individual fuel pins in a heterogeneous fuel bundle are determined using these homogeneous intranodal flux distributions and the form functions obtained from the single-assembly lattice calculations. The pin powers are obtained using these pin fluxes and the pin power cross sections generated by the single-assembly lattice calculation. The accuracy of the reconstruction schemes has been estimated by performing benchmark calculations for partial core representation of a natural uranium CANDU reactor. The results indicate that the reconstruction schemes are quite accurate, yielding maximum pin power errors of less than {approx}3%.

The RELAP5 code has been developed for best-estimate transient simulation of pressurized water reactors and associated systems, but it has not been assessed for a Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor. Therefore, this study has been initiated with an aim to identify the code applicability in a CANDU reactor by simulating some of the tests performed in the RD-14 facility. The RD-14 test facility at Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment is a full-scale pressurized-water loop. The RD-14 is not a scale model of any particular CANDU reactor. Rather, it possesses many geometric features of a CANDU reactor heat transport system and is capable of operating at conditions similar to those expected to occur in a reactor under normal operation and some postulated accident conditions. In this study, two critical reactor header break tests (B8711 and B8713) and three thermosiphoning tests (T8513, T8515, and T8517) were analyzed with the RELAP5 code. The results were compared with experimental data and those of CATHENA performed by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. The RELAP5 analyses demonstrate the code's capability to predict reasonably the main phenomena occurring in the transient, in both the qualitative and the quantitative view. However, some discrepancies after the emergency coolant injection for the critical break case and also related to the behaviors of the mass flow rate and the primary pressure for the thermosiphoning case were observed.","","","","","","United States","2000-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 130; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 18-26","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0495121154","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822149","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822149","","Nuclear Technology","1","130"

It also was clear that the polarization resistance decreased with increases in ECP and H{sub 2}O{sub 2} was present in the water at a given ECP. This impedance data showed the important role of the water chemistry on the degree of oxide resistance. In addition, the polarization resistance result indicated that the oxide film formed on Type 304 SS in 299 C water containing H{sub 2}O{sub 2} could be less resistance and consequently more susceptible to environmentally assisted cracking.","","","GE Corporate Research and Development Center, Schenectady, NY (US)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion (Houston); Journal Volume: 56; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: Paper presented at CORROSION/99, San Antonio, TX (US), April 1999; PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 389-394","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0010-9312; CORRAK; TRN: US0002458","10.5006/1.3280542","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","20050519","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20050519","","Corrosion (Houston)","4","56"

The model is capable of simulating strain hardening under internal pressure followed by a stress relaxation period, the loading producing an interaction between the pellet and cladding. Introduction of a state variable characterizing the damage caused by a bombardment with neutrons into the model has allowed us to simulate the irradiation-induced hardening and creep rate decrease, as well as the saturation noticed after two cycles of irradiation ({approx_equal}45{sm_bullet}10{sup 24}nm{sup {minus}2}(E &gt; 1 MeV)) in a pressurized water reactor (PWR). Finally, the numerical simulations show the model is able to reproduce the totality of the thermomechanical experiments.","","","Electricite de France (FR)","","","United States","2000-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 168-176","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-4289; JEMTA8; TRN: US0003887","10.1115/1.482783","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20075671","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20075671","","Journal of Engineering Materials and Technology","2","122"
"Development of the INSPECT Model for the Prediction of Iodine Volatility from Irradiated Solutions","Dickinson, Shirley; Sims, Howard E","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS; HYDROGEN PEROXIDE; IODINE; IRRADIATION; MODIFICATIONS; OXIDATION; PH VALUE; PWR TYPE REACTORS; RADIATION CHEMISTRY; REDUCTION; SIMULATION; VOLATILITY; WATER","The prediction of iodine behavior in the containment of a pressurized water reactor following a loss-of-coolant accident requires a reliable model of the chemistry of iodine in aqueous solution. The INSPECT model, which has been developed over several years, contains a large number of the relevant chemical reactions of iodine and water radiation chemistry. Since the reaction set was first assembled, new data on rate constants and mechanisms have become available. In addition, the application of the model to various small-scale experiments has revealed problems in the modeling of some reactions, leading to an underprediction of the iodine volatility at high pH, although the experiments have demonstrated that the high-pH volatility remains satisfactorily low.The INSPECT model is described along with the recent modifications that have been made to take account of new data and to improve the modeling where appropriate. The most important of these were (a) changes to the H{sub 2}O{sub 2} - I{sub 2} reaction mechanism, (b) the inclusion of an impurity-catalyzed first-order O{sub 2}{sup -} disproportionation reaction, and (c) the treatment of atomic I as a volatile species. These modifications have led to an increase in the predicted iodine volatility under neutral and alkaline conditions. At pH 4.6, where the original model had been found to be satisfactory, the modifications did not result in a significant change in the predicted volatility.The predictions of the revised model are compared with the results of a comprehensive series of experiments, which are described in a separate paper. The model predictions are in generally good agreement with the experiments for the range of conditions studied (pH 4.6 to 9, 10{sup -5} to 10{sup -4} mol/dm{sup 3} I{sup -}, 0.02 to 0.2 Mrad/h, 25 to 70 deg. C). The results at neutral and high pH show a significant improvement over the previous version of the model, which underestimated the volatility at pH 9 by more than two orders of magnitude.","","","","","","United States","2000-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 374-386","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0489121148","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822143","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822143","","Nuclear Technology","3","129"

The concentration factors of sodium hydroxide were calculated from the results of the conductivity measurement, and the effects of heat flux and solution temperature on the concentration factors were also examined. The conductivities in the crevice were measured in deaerated sodium hydroxide aqueous solutions in a range from 260 to 280 deg. C.The main test results show that the conductivity of high-temperature water increased with an increase of concentration and temperature in the deaerated sodium hydroxide solution and that the conductivity in the tube-tube-support-plate crevice was higher than that of bulk water because of concentrated sodium hydroxide in a crevice. Therefore, this method is applicable to evaluation of the impurity concentration behavior in a crevice. The calculated results of the concentration factor reveal that the factor was {approx}2000 in the range of the heat flux, i.e., the range for the region of a dry and wet condition, and the concentration factors in the sodium hydroxide solutions were lower than those of the field data.","","","","","","United States","2000-03-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 398-406","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0491121150","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822145","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822145","","Nuclear Technology","3","129"

The mechanical behavior of ZIRCALOY-4 sheets is investigated at room temperature. The effect of hydride precipitation on the mechanical behavior and on the rupture mechanism is also studied, in the range from 200 to 1,200 wt ppm hydrogen and for different stress triaxialities. It is shown that the material exhibits a strong anisotropy die to its pronounced texture, and that its mechanical properties depend on the strain rate. Hydride precipitation appears to have no effect on the anisotropy or on the strain-rate sensitivity, in the range from 10{sup {minus}4} to 10{sup {minus}2} s{sup {minus}1}. The main effect of hydrogen is the reduction of the ductility and of crack resistance. The ductile rupture mechanism is studied, focusing on the stage of damage nucleation by hydride fracture. Observations during scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in situ tests show that hydrides allow the transmission of slip, which occurs in ZIRCALOY-4 grains. Hydrides can also deform, together with surrounding zirconium matrix. Damage appears after a plastic-strain yield of about 14 to 25 pct. Fracture occurs first on intergranular hydrides. Fracture of transgranular hydrides is observed only prior to failure, for higher plastic strains.","","","Framatome Nuclear Fuel, Lyon (FR)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Metallurgical and Materials Transactions.

The ability to accurately predict fuel pin performance is an essential requirement for the MOX fuel test assembly design. Detailed radial fission power and temperature profile effects and fission gas release in the fuel pin are a function of the fuel pin's temperature, fission power, and fission product ad actinide concentration profiles. In addition, the burnup-dependent profile analyses in irradiated fuel pins is important for fuel performance analysis to support the potential licensing of the MOX fuel made from WG-plutonium and depleted uranium for use in US reactors. The MCNP Coupling With ORIGEN2 burnup calculation code (MCWO) can analyze the detailed burnup profiles of WG-MOX and reactor-grade mixed-oxide (RG-MOX) fuel pins. The validated code MCWO can provide the best-estimate neutronic characteristics of fuel burnup performance analysis. Applying this capability with a new minicell method allows calculation of detailed nuclide concentration and power distributions within the MOX pins as a function of burnup. This methodology was applied to MOX fuel in a commercial pressurized water reactor and in an experiment currently being irradiated in the ATR. The prediction of nuclide concentration profiles and power distributions in irradiated MOX plus via this new methodology can provide insights into MOX fuel performance.","","","Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Lab., Idaho Falls, ID (US)","USDOE","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 326-335","","","AC07-76ID01570","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0001652","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015667","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015667","","Nuclear Technology","3","129"

These reactors are spheres of 0.11-m radius and 1-MW(thermal) power and with a critical mass of 0.0201 kg of {sup 242m}Am. The advantages of homogeneous reactors are constant fuel reprocessing and constant refueling. As a result, there is a reduction of fission products, which improves the ratio of natural cooling to heat production with respect to a loss-of-control accident (LOCA) and other safety aspects. Homogeneous reactors also have a large negative temperature coefficient and small inherent excess reactivity during operation. The reactor concept the authors have presented for a very small, homogeneous reactor, further enhances the safety aspects in the case of a LOCA, because of a large surface-to-volume ratio. The improved safety, the simplicity, and the small volume should compensate for the use of an unconventional nuclear fuel.","","","Ben-Gurion Univ., Beer-Sheva (IL)","","","United States","2000-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 407-417","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US0001654","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20015669","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20015669","","Nuclear Technology","3","129"

A laboratory treatability study was conducted to examine the ability of native soil bacteria present in the contaminated site to degrade RDX. The results indicated that RDX can be removed effectively from the soil by native soil bacteria through a co-metabolic process. Molasses, identified as an effective cosubstrate, is inexpensive, and this factor makes the treatment system cost effective. The successful operation of aerobic-anoxic soil-slurry reactors in batch mode with RDX-contaminated soil showed that the technology can be scaled up for field demonstration. The RDX concentration in the contaminated soil was decreased by 98% after 4 months of reactor operation. The advantage of the slurry reactor is the simplicity of its operation. The method needs only mixing and the addition of molasses as cosubstrate.","","","Argonne National Lab.

The experiments were performed under the conditions of different break sizes (0.5 and 2%) in the cold leg followed by failure of the high-pressure injection system. The primary system cooldown is implemented by the secondary-side depressurization. The effectiveness of early initiation of the recovery action on reactor safety and related thermal-hydraulic phenomena are examined. The initiation criterion for recovery action considered here is determined by core water levels instead of core exit temperature based on the current emergency operating procedures. The impact of emergency core-cooling flow bypass phenomenon may significantly deteriorate the effectiveness of the recovery operation for a cold-leg SBLOCA. The results showed that the early initiation of secondary-side depressurization can effectively minimize the risk of core damage by preventing fuel rods from heating up throughout the transient.

The yield anisotropy was measured in uniaxial tension in samples obtained from the three directions of a Zr-2.5Nb plate and in shear, by testing in torsion Mini pressure tubes from the same material. From these experiments, the temperature and strain-rate dependence of the yield stress and the dependence of the anisotropy of yielding on temperature were also determined. It is shown that the yield anisotropy of pressure tube material is constant for temperatures up to about 800 K and that the strain-rate sensitivity is also constant up to about 700 K and is equal to {approximately}0.02. In addition, the activation energy (Q) of this material was estimated by using the temperature dependence and rate sensitivity of the yield stress. It was found to be of the same order of magnitude as that determined earlier by other investigators. A polycrystalline, nonlinear self-consistent model that takes into account the crystallographic texture of the material was used to derive the values of the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) which are consistent with prismatic, basal, and pyramidal glide and the values of the Hill's plastic anisotropy coefficients which are consistent with the observed anisotropy of yielding.

In particular, the Irradiation a FOrt Pu (IFOP) experiment in the SILOE reactor and the TRAnsmutation and Burning of ActiNides in Triox carrier (TRABANT1) experiments in the High Flux Reactor are presented and the results are analyzed: Up to a burnup of 1.5 at.%, destructive examinations of the IFOP pin have shown that the high-plutonium-content oxide fuel with a large central hole presents the usual global behavior (good pellet integrity, fuel microstructure). The TRABANT1 oxide fuel pin with a 40% Pu and 5% Np content demonstrates that a burnup of 9.5 at.% can be reached without failure by a high-plutonium-content fuel. However, the TRABANT1 pin 1 (oxide pin with 45% Pu), which had run under severe conditions, has failed at {approx}7 at.% burnup. Destructive examinations of these pins will give more evidence on the causes of the failure. The low-oxygen-to-metal fuel column of (Pu,Ce)O{sub 2-x} melted, thus confirming the poor conductivity of this fuel.","","","","","","United States","2000-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1-12","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0462121121","10.13182/NT00-3","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","20822116","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822116","","Nuclear Technology","1","129"
"Code Development and Assessment for Reactor Outage Thermal-Hydraulic and Safety Analysis - Midloop Operation with Loss of Residual Heat Removal","Liang, Thomas K.S.; Ko, F -K","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; AFTER-HEAT REMOVAL; PWR TYPE REACTORS; REACTOR OPERATION; RESIDUAL POWER; RHR SYSTEMS; SAFETY ANALYSIS; SIMULATION; STEAM GENERATORS; THERMAL HYDRAULICS","Although only a few percent of residual power remains during plant outages, the associated risk of core uncovery and corresponding fuel overheating has been identified to be relatively high, particularly under midloop operation (MLO) in pressurized water reactors. However, to analyze the system behavior during outages, the tools currently available, such as RELAP5, RETRAN, etc., cannot easily perform the task. Therefore, a medium-sized program aiming at reactor outage simulation and evaluation, such as MLO with the loss of residual heat removal (RHR), was developed. All important thermal-hydraulic processes involved during MLO with the loss of RHR will be properly simulated by the newly developed reactor outage simulation and evaluation (ROSE) code. Important processes during MLO with loss of RHR involve a pressurizer insurge caused by the hot-leg flooding, reflux condensation, liquid holdup inside the steam generator, loop-seal clearance, core-level depression, etc. Since the accuracy of the pressure distribution from the classical nodal momentum approach will be degraded when the system is stratified and under atmospheric pressure, the two-region approach with a modified two-fluid model will be the theoretical basis of the new program to analyze the nuclear steam supply system during plant outages. To verify the analytical model in the first step, posttest calculations against the closed integral midloop experiments with loss of RHR were performed. The excellent simulation capacity of the ROSE code against the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research Integral System Test Facility (IIST) test data is demonstrated.","","","","","","United States","2000-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 13-25","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0463121122","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822117","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822117","","Nuclear Technology","1","129"

The focus is on the adequacy of EOPs to limit primary-to-secondary leakage with particular emphasis on the number of ruptured U-tubes on the severity of an incident and the response time available for operator actions. By comparing test data with plant records of a Mihama-2 SGTR event, the key thermal-hydraulic phenomena during SGTR transients can be successfully simulated. The test results indicated that the current EOPs can function well in terminating the break flow and maintaining adequate core cooling. However, the effectiveness in minimizing the radioactive release demands an early and substantial operator involvement. To mitigate the consequences of such an event, the timing to isolate the faulted steam generator (SG) and to terminate safety injection flow will be critical. Furthermore, to avoid overfilling, the water level in the faulted SG needs to be drained prior to the implementation of the cooldown process.","","","","","","United States","2000-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 36-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0465121124","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822119","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822119","","Nuclear Technology","1","129"

Lungmen is the fourth nuclear power plant of the Taiwan Power Company (TPC). LMNPS has two advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) units, each with a thermal power of 3926 MW. The preliminary safety analysis report (PSAR) of LMNPS is currently under review. The Lungmen RETRAN-02/MOD5 model was developed to provide support to TPC in the PSAR review and system design study. An analysis of generator load rejection with failure of all bypass valves was performed against the analysis in the PSAR to benchmark the Lungmen RETRAN model. One of the specific designs of LMNPS is that the reactor has the capability to withstand a full-load rejection or a turbine trip event without a reactor scram. An analysis of generator load rejection with all bypass valves was done to evaluate this design. The results show that this design is appropriate.","","","","","","United States","2000-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nuclear Technology; Journal Volume: 129; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2006 American Nuclear Society (ANS), United States, All rights reserved. http://epubs.ans.org/; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 51-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0029-5450; NUTYBB; TRN: US06N0466121125","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20822120","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20822120","","Nuclear Technology","1","129"

Eddy current signal interpretation is further complicated by cracking geometries more complex than a single axial crack. Although there has been limited success in classifying and sizing defects through artificial neural networks, the ability to predict tubing integrity has, so far, eluded modelers. In large part, this lack of success stems from an inability to distinguish crack signals from those arising from artifacts. We present here a new signal processing technique that deconvolves raw eddy current voltage signals into separate signal contributions from different sources, which allows signals associated with a dominant crack to be identified. The signal deconvolution technique, combined with artificial neural network modeling, significantly improves the prediction of tube burst pressure from bobbin-coil eddy current measurements of steam generator tubing.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Commercially available iron-base hardfacing alloys are being evaluated for replacement of cobalt-base alloys to reduce nuclear plant activation levels. Corrosion testing was used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of several iron-base hardfacing alloys in highly oxygenated environments. The corrosion test results indicate that iron-base hardfacing alloys in the as-deposited condition have acceptable corrosion resistance when the chromium to carbon ratio is greater than 4. Tristelle 5183, with a high niobium (stabilizer) content, did not follow this trend due to precipitation of niobium-rich carbides instead of chromium-rich carbides. This result indicates that iron-base hardfacing alloys containing high stabilizer contents may possess good corrosion resistance with Cr:C &lt; 4. NOREM 02, NOREM 01, and NoCo-M2 hardfacing alloys had acceptable corrosion resistance in the as-deposited and 885 C/4 hour heat treated condition, but rusting from sensitization was observed in the 621 C/6 hour heat treated condition. The feasibility of using an Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation (EPR) test method, such as used for stainless steel, to detect sensitization in iron-base hardfacing alloys was evaluated. A single loop-EPR method was found to provide a more consistent measurement of sensitization than a double loop-EPR method. The high carbon content that is needed for a wear resistant hardfacing alloy produces a high volume fraction of chromium-rich carbides that are attacked during EPR testing. This results in inherently lower sensitivity for detection of a sensitized iron-base hardfacing alloy than stainless steel using conventional EPR test methods.","","INIS; OSTI as DE00754900","Bettis Atomic Power Lab., West Mifflin, PA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Corrosion; Other Information: Submitted to Corrosion; PBD: 1 Nov 1999","","Medium: P; Size: 31 pages","","B-T-3239","AC11-98PN38206","TRN: US0003356","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","754900","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/754900","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/754900","Corrosion","",""

Corrosion kinetic data are used to develop correlations that are a function of time and temperature. The evaluation is based on corrosion tests conducted in out-of-pile autoclaves and in out-of-flux locations of the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at temperatures ranging from 288 to 360 C. Similar to the corrosion behavior of unalloyed zirconium, the high-temperature-water corrosion response of hafnium exhibits three corrosion regimes: pretransition, posttransition, and spalling. In the pretransition regime, cubic corrosion kinetics are exhibited, whereas in the posttransition regime, linear corrosion kinetics are exhibited. Because of the scatter in the spalling regime data, it is not reasonable to use a best fit of the data to describe spalling regime corrosion. Data also show that neutron irradiation does not alter the corrosion performance of hafnium. Finally, the data illustrate that the corrosion rate of hafnium is significantly less than that of Zircaloy-2 and Zircaloy-4.","","INIS; OSTI as DE00755333","Bettis Atomic Power Lab., West Mifflin, PA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","1999-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials; Other Information: Submitted to Journal of Nuclear Materials; PBD: 1 Oct 1999","","Medium: P; Size: 47 pages","","B-T-3232","AC11-98PN38206","TRN: US0003437","","","2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","755333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/755333","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/755333","Journal of Nuclear Materials","",""

This is to help the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in making judgments about acceptance criteria for the REA when high-burnup fuel is used and for assessing the validity of licensee methods for calculating the REA. The approach is twofold. Sensitivity studies were first done to determine the effect on calculated fuel enthalpy of uncertainties in the important parameters that determine the outcome of the REA. The second step, which will be carried out at a later date, is to use the sensitivity to estimate the random error in the fuel enthalpy due to random errors in these key parameters once the variance of these parameters is determined.","","","Brookhaven National Lab., Upton, NY (US)","","","United States","1999-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Nuclear Society; Journal Volume: 81; Conference: American Nuclear Society 1999 Winter Meeting, Long Beach, CA (US), 11/14/1999--11/18/1999; Other Information: PBD: 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 320-321","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0003-018X; TANSAO; TRN: US0000606","","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20005837","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20005837","","Transactions of the American Nuclear Society","","81"

These studies have provided information on the potential of hybrid systems to transmute actinides and, long lived fission products. The potential of such a system remains to be proven, specifically in terms of the physical understanding of the different phenomena involved and their modelling, as well as in terms of experimental validation of coupled systems, sub-critical environment/accelerator. This validation must be achieved through mock-up studies of the sub-critical environments coupled to a source of external neutrons. The MUSE-4 mock-up experiment is planed at the MASURCA facility and will use an accelerator coupled to a tritium target. The great step between the generator used in the past and the accelerator will allow to increase the knowledge in hybrid physic and to decrease the experimental biases and the measurement uncertainties.","","","","","","United States","1999-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 475; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 15.International conference on the application of accelerators in research and industry, Denton, TX (United States), 4-7 Nov 1998; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.59249; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 330-332","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B5468076106","10.1063/1.59249","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21205583","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21205583","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","475"

Based upon analysis of those factors, the double-cantilever beam (DCB) and SG model boiler tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of stress intensity on IGA/SCC crack propagation. K at the crack tips increased with increasing crack length. For a long crack, K decreased with an increasing number of cracks. However, for a short crack, K decreased slightly with an increasing number of cracks. DCB test results showed the IGA/SCC crack velocity of alloy 600 (UNS N06600) increased gradually with increasing K in the range from 15 MPa[radical]m to [approximately]60 MPa[radical]m. This is the range relevant to IGA/SCC crack tips of typical SG tubes under operating conditions of Pressurized-water reactors.

Failure analysis and remedy development studies were undertaken to avoid a recurrence. Destructive examination of a removed tube indicated axial intergranular cracks developed at the top of sludge caused by a boiling crevice geometry. A high ODSCC propagation rate was attributed to high local pH and increased corrosion potential resulting from oxidized copper presumably formed during the maintenance outage and plant heatup. Remedial measures included: (1) crevice neutralization by crevice flushing with boric acid (H[sub 3]BO[sub 3]) and molar ratio control using ammonium chloride (NH[sub 4]Cl), (2) corrosion potential reduction by hydrazine (H[sub 2]NNH[sub 2]) soaking and suppression of oxygen below 20 ppb to avoid copper oxide formation, (3) titanium dioxide (TiO[sub 2]) inhibitor soaking, and (4) temperature reduction of 5 C. Since application of the remedy program, no significant ODSCC has been observed, which clearly demonstrates the benefit of departing from an oxidizing alkaline environment.

Research into space fission power systems has been ongoing (at various levels) since the 1950s, but to date the United States (US) has flown only one space fission system, SNAP-10A, in 1965. Cost and development time have been significant reasons why space fission systems have not been used by the US. High cost and long development time are not inherent to the use of space fission power. However, high cost and long development time are inherent to any program that tries to do too much at once. Nearly all US space fission power programs have attempted to field systems capable of high power, even though more modest systems had not yet been flown. All of these programs have failed to fly a space fission system. Relatively low power (10 to 100 kWe) fission systems may be useful for near-term lunar and Martian surface missions, including missions in which in situ resource utilization is a priority. Such systems may also be useful for deep-space science missions and other missions. These systems can be significantly less expensive to develop than high power systems. Experience gained in the development of low-power space fission systems can then be used to enable cost-effective development of high-power (&gt;1000 kWe) fission systems. The Heatpipe Power System (HPS) is a potential, near-term, low-cost space fission power system. The Heatpipe Bimodal System (HBS) is a potential, near-term, low-cost space fission power and/or propulsion system. Both systems will be composed of independent modules, and all components use existing technology and operate within the existing database. The HPS and HBS have relatively few system integration issues; thus, the successful development of a module is a significant step toward verifying system feasibility and performance estimates. A prototypic HPS module was fabricated, and initial testing was completed in April 1997. All test objectives were accomplished, demonstrating the basic feasibility of the HPS. Fabrication of an HBS module is under way, and testing should begin in 1999.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57515; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1197-1204","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2891072898","10.1063/1.57515","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202493","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202493","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

The ESCORT is a bimodal engine capable of supporting a wide range of propulsive thermal and vehicle electrical power requirements. The ESCORT engine is powered by a fast-spectrum beryllium-reflected CERMET-fueled nuclear reactor. In addition to an expander cycle propulsive mode, the ESCORT is capable of operating in an electrical power mode. In this mode, the reactor is used to heat a mixture of helium and xenon to drive a closed-loop Brayton cycle in order to generate electrical energy. Recent Design Reference Mission requirements (DRM) from NASA Johnson Space Center and NASA Lewis Research Center studies in 1997 and 1998 have detailed upgraded requirements for potential mars transfer missions. The current NASA DRM requires a nuclear thermal propulsion system capable of delivering total mission requirements of 200170 N (45000 lbf) thrust and 50 kWe of spacecraft electrical power. Additionally, these requirements detailed a surface power system capable of providing approximately 160 kW of electrical energy over an approximate 10 year period within a given weight and volume envelope. Current NASA studies use a SP-100 reactor (0.8 MT) and a NERVA derivative (1.6 MT) as baseline systems. A mobile power cart of approximate dimensions 1.7 mx4.5 mx4.4 m has been conceptualized to transport the reactor power system on the Mars Surface. The 63.25 cm diameter and 80.25 cm height of the ESCORT and its 1.3 MT of weight fit well within the current weight and volume target range of the NASA DRM requirements. The modifications required to the ESCORT reactor system to support this upgraded electrical power requirements along with operation in the Martian atmospheric conditions are addressed in this paper. Sufficient excess reactivity and burnup capability were designed into the ESCORT reactor system to support these upgraded requirements. Only slight modifications to reactor hardware were required to address any environmental considerations. These modifications involved sealing any refractory metal alloy components from the CO{sub 2} in the Martian Atmosphere. Also, the Brayton cycle Power Conversion Unit (PCU) hardware was modified to support the upgraded requirements. This paper discusses the design analysis performed and provides information on the final common reactor concept to be used on the Mars surface to support manned missions.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57516; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1205-1210","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2892072899","10.1063/1.57516","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202494","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202494","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

"'Bimodal' NTR and LANTR propulsion for human missions to Mars/Phobos","Borowski, Stanley K; Dudzinski, Leonard A; McGuire, Melissa L","21 SPECIFIC NUCLEAR REACTORS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS; ENRICHED URANIUM; EVALUATION; HYDROGEN; OXYGEN; PERFORMANCE; POWER SYSTEMS; PROPULSION SYSTEMS; ROCKET ENGINES; SPACE PROPULSION REACTORS; SPACE VEHICLES; URANIUM 235; NESDPS Office of Nuclear Energy Space and Defense Power Systems","The nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) is one of the leading propulsion options for future human missions to Mars due to its high specific impulse (Isp {approx}850-1000 s) and attractive engine thrust-to-weight ratio ({approx}3-10). Because only a miniscule amount of enriched uranium-235 fuel is consumed in a NTR during the primary propulsion maneuvers of a typical Mars mission, engines configured for both propulsive thrust and modest power generation (referred to as 'bimodal' operation) provide the basis for a robust, 'power-rich' stage enabling propulsive Mars capture and reuse capability. A family of modular 'bimodal' NTR (BNTR) vehicles are described which utilize a common 'core' stage powered by three 66.7 kN ({approx}15 klbf) BNTRs that produce 50 kWe of total electrical power for crew life support, an active refrigeration/reliquification system for long term, 'zero-boiloff' liquid hydrogen (LH{sub 2}) storage, and high data rate communications. Compared to other propulsion options, a Mars mission architecture using BNTR transfer vehicles requires fewer transportation system elements which reduces mission mass, cost and risk because of simplified space operations. For difficult Mars options, such as a Phobos rendezvous and sample return mission, volume (not mass) constraints limit the performance of the 'all LH{sub 2}' BNTR stage. The use of 'LOX-augmented' NTR (LANTR) engines, operating at a modest oxygen-to-hydrogen (O/H) mixture ratio (MR) of 0.5, helps to increase 'bulk' propellant density and total thrust during the trans-Mars injection (TMI) burn. On all subsequent burns, the bimodal LANTR engines operate on LH{sub 2} only (MR=0) to maximize vehicle performance while staying within the mass limits of two {approx}80 t 'Magnum' heavy lift launch vehicles (HLLVs)","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57726; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1261-1268","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2895072902","10.1063/1.57726","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202497","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202497","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

The paper uses a series of mission opportunities during the NASA DRM focus period and looks at how a NTR (Nuclear Thermal Rocket) can be used to increase the Mars mission payload delivery capability and mission flexibility across the entire mission spectrum. In propulsive mode, a nuclear reactor is used to heat hot hydrogen, which is expanded through a converging/diverging nozzle to generate thrust. Heat pickup in the nozzle and the radial beryllium reflectors is used to drive the turbomachinery in the ESCORT expander cycle. In electrical mode, the reactor is used to heat a mixture of helium and xenon to drive a closed-loop Brayton cycle in order to generate electrical energy. A Mars transportation system integrated performance methodology was developed to assess the sensitivity to weight, thrust and impulse to the Mars conjunction class mission requirements. Propellant tanks, propulsion system mass, shielding, and Brayton cycle power conversion unit requirements were included in this evaluation. This paper examines how the design characteristics of the ESCORT derivative propulsion and power system affect the mission payload capability and the earth launch vehicle design requirements. The same reactor design is also used for Mars surface power reactor, delivered as payload by the ESCORT derivative powered Mars transfer stage.

Anywhere from 50 to 500 kW of electric power (kWe) will be needed, depending on the number of astronauts, level of scientific activity, and life-cycle closure desired. This paper describes a 250-kWe power system based on a gas-cooled nuclear reactor with a recuperated closed Brayton cycle conversion system. The design draws upon the extensive data and engineering experience developed under the various high-temperature gas cooled reactor programs and under the SP-100 program. The reactor core is similar in power and size to the research reactors found on numerous university campuses. The fuel is uranium nitride clad in Nb1%Zr, which has been extensively tested under the SP-100 program. The fuel rods are arranged in a hexagonal array within a BeO block. The BeO softens the spectrum, allowing better use of the fuel and stabilizing the geometry against deformation during impact or other loadings. The system has a negative temperature feedback coefficient so that the power level will automatically follow a variable load without the need for continuous adjustment of control elements. Waste heat is removed by an air-cooled heat exchanger using cold Martian air. The amount of radioactivity in the reactor at launch is very small (less than a Curie, and about equal to a truckload of uranium ore). The system will need to be engineered so that criticality can not occur for any launch accident. This system is also adaptable for electric propulsion or life-support during transit to and from Mars.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57544; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1470-1475","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; Contract AC04-94AL85000; TRN: US08B2904072911","10.1063/1.57544","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202506","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

Their projected endurance at very high temperatures far exceeds that of fuels previously tested and signifies their potential as a fuel for increased performance characteristics (i.e. higher specific impulse and/or longer lifetime, etc.). However, insufficient test data exist under nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) conditions of temperature and hot hydrogen environment to fully evaluate their performance. An investigation into processing techniques was conducted in order to produce a series of pseudo-ternary carbide samples for characterization and testing. Consideration was given to the real world challenges of manufacturing full-scale fuel elements. Particular consideration was given to the fabrication requirements for the innovative, square-lattice honeycomb (SLHC) fuel elements for advanced NTP cores.

The ESCORT is a bimodal engine capable of supporting a wide range of vehicle propulsive and electrical power requirements. The ESCORT engine is powered by a fast-spectrum beryllium-reflected CERMET-fueled nuclear reactor. In propulsive mode, the reactor is used to heat hot hydrogen to approximately 2700 K which is expanded through a converging/diverging nozzle to generate thrust. Heat pickup in the nozzle and the radial beryllium reflectors is used to drive the turbomachinery in the ESCORT expander cycle. In electrical mode, the reactor is used to heat a mixture of helium and xenon to drive a closed-loop Brayton cycle in order to generate electrical energy. This closed loop system has the additional function of a decay heat removal system after the propulsive mode operation is discontinued. The original ESCORT design was capable of delivering 4448.2 N (1000 lbf) of thrust at a vacuum impulse level of approximately 900 s. Design Reference Mission requirements (DRM) from NASA Johnson Space Center and NASA Lewis Research Center studies in 1997 and 1998 have detailed upgraded requirements for potential manned Mars missions. The current NASA DRM requires a nuclear thermal propulsion system capable of delivering total mission requirements of 200170 N (45000 lbf) thrust and 50 kWe of spacecraft electrical power. This is met assuming three engines capable of each delivering 66723 N (15000 lbf) of vacuum thrust and 25 kWe of electrical power. The individual engine requirements were developed assuming three out of three engine reliability for propulsion and two out of three engine reliability for spacecraft electrical power. The approximate target vacuum impulse is 925 s. The Pratt and Whitney ESCORT concept was upgraded to meet these requirements. The hexagonal prismatic fuel elements were modified to address the uprated power requirements while maintaining the peak fuel temperature below the 2880 K limit for W-UO{sub 2} CERMET fuels. A system integrated performance methodology was developed to assess the sensitivity to weight, thrust and impulse to the DRM requirements. Propellant tanks, shielding, and Brayton cycle power conversion unit requirements were included in this evaluation.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57547; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1495-1500","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2907072914","10.1063/1.57547","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202509","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

Recent studies at the Innovative Nuclear Space Power and Propulsion Institute (INSPI) have demonstrated the feasibility of processing solid solution, ternary carbide fuels such as (U, Zr, Nb)C, (U, Zr, Ta)C, (U, Zr, Hf)C and (U, Zr, W)C. The square-lattice honeycomb design provides high strength and is amenable to the processing complexities of these ultrahigh temperature fuels. A parametric analysis is conducted to examine how core geometry, fuel thickness and the propellant flow area effect the thermal performance of the nuclear rocket engine. The principal variables include core size (length and diameter) and fuel element dimensions. The optimum core configuration requires a balance between high specific impulse and thrust level performance, and maintaining the temperature and strength limits of the fuel. A nuclear rocket engine simulation code is developed and used to examine the system performance as well as the performance of the main reactor core components. The system simulation code was originally developed for analysis of NERVA-Derivative and Pratt and Whitney XNR-2000 nuclear thermal rockets. The code is modified and adopted to the square-lattice geometry of the new fuel design. Thrust levels ranging from 44,500 to 222,400 N (10,000 to 50,000 lbf) are considered. The average hydrogen exit temperature is kept at 2800 K, which is well below the melting point of these fuels. For a nozzle area ratio of 300 and a thrust chamber pressure of 4.8 Mpa (700 psi), the specific impulse is 930 s. Hydrogen temperature and pressure distributions in the core and the fuel maximum temperatures are calculated.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57548; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1501-1506","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2908072915","10.1063/1.57548","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202510","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202510","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

A 0.10-cm thick radial graphite reflector, in addition to a 0.20-m thick axial graphite reflector are used to reduce neutron leakage from the reactor. The core is fueled with solid solution of 93% enriched (U, Zr, Nb)C, which is one of several ternary uranium carbides that are considered for this concept. The fuel is to be fabricated as 2 mm grooved (U, Zr, Nb)C wafers. The fuel wafers are used to form square-lattice honeycomb fuel assemblies, 0.10 m in length with 30% cross-sectional flow area. Five fuel assemblies are stacked up axially to form the reactor core. Based on the 30% void fraction, the width of the square flow channel is about 1.3 mm. The hydrogen propellant is passed through these flow channels and removes the heat from the reactor core. To perform nuclear design analysis, a series of neutron transport and diffusion codes are used. The preliminary results are obtained using a simple four-group cross-section model. To optimize the nuclear design, the fuel densities are varied for each assembly. Tantalum, hafnium and tungsten are considered and used as a replacement for niobium in fuel material to provide water submersion sub-criticality for the reactor. Axial and radial neutron flux and power density distributions are calculated for the core. Results of the neutronic analysis indicate that the core has a relatively fast spectrum. From the results of the thermal hydraulic analyses, eight axial temperature zones are chosen for the calculation of group average cross-sections. An iterative process is conducted to couple the neutronic calculations with the thermal hydraulics calculations. Results of the nuclear design analysis indicate that a compact core can be designed based on ternary uranium carbide square-lattice honeycomb fuel. This design provides a relatively high thrust to weight ratio.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57549; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1507-1512","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2909072916","10.1063/1.57549","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202511","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202511","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

These operations, combined with crew habitation and science, result in surface power requirements approaching 160 kilowatts. The power system, delivered on an early cargo mission, must be deployed and operational prior to crew departure from Earth. The most mass efficient means of satisfying these requirements is through the use of nuclear power. Studies have been performed to identify a potential system concept using a mobile cart to transport the power system away from the Mars lander and provide adequate separation between the reactor and crew. The studies included an assessment of reactor and power conversion technology options, selection of system and component redundancy, determination of optimum separation distance, and system performance sensitivity to some key operating parameters. The resulting system satisfies the key mission requirements including autonomous deployment, high reliability, and cost effectiveness at an overall system mass of 12 tonnes and a stowed volume of about 63 m{sup 3}.","","","","","","United States","1999-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 458; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: Space technology and applications international forum - 1999, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 31 Jan - 4 Feb 1999; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.57736; (c) 1999 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1464-1469","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B2903072910","10.1063/1.57736","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21202505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21202505","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","458"

The Braidwood Nuclear Power Plant full-scope operator training simulator is used to generate transient data for two plant systems used in the validation tests. The first test consists of a blind test performed with 39 simulated transients of 20 distinct types in the Braidwood chemical and volume control system. Of the 39 transients, 37 are correctly identified with varying precision within the first 40 s into the transient while the remaining two transients are not identified. The second validation test consists of a double-blind test performed with 14 simulated transients in the Braidwood component coolant water system. In addition to having no prior knowledge of the identity of the transients, in the double-blind test we also had no prior information regarding the identity of the component faults that the simulator was capable of modeling. All 14 transient events are correctly identified with varying precision within the first 30 s into the transient.

An experiment conducted in the harder neutron spectra found within the core of Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) has shown that the helium in this reactor was generated almost exclusively from the interaction of high energy neutrons with the natural isotopes of nickel. There was very little contribution from 59Ni. The helium production was found to scale directly with the nickel content over the range 25+/- 75% Ni. Even at very high neutron exposures, the helium production in such reactors can be predicted within 5% accuracy on the basis of high energy reactions, as demonstrated by an experiment conducted on three Fe+/- 15Cr+/- Ni ternary alloys irradiated to doses of 75+/- 131 dpa in EBR-II.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Nuclear Materials; Journal Volume: 263 Part B; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1740-1744","","PNNL-SA-31664","AC06-76RL01830","TRN: US200404%%187","10.1016/S0022-3115(98)00297-9","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15001458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15001458","","Journal of Nuclear Materials","","263 Part B"

A nuclear propulsion system, such as was being developed under the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) Program, is an example of such a potential payload. This paper uses the results of a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) study to demonstrate the potential importance of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) to test and implement an advanced upper stage (AUS) or payload in a safe orbit and in a cost effective and reliable manner. The RLV is a horizontal takeoff and horizontal landing (HTHL), two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicle. The results of the study shows that an HTHL is cost effective because it implements airplane-like operation, infrastructure, and flight operations. The first stage of the TSTO is powered by Rocket-Based-Combined-Cycle (RBCC) engines, the second stage is powered by a LOX/LH rocket engine. The TSTO is used since it most effectively utilizes the capability of the RBCC engine. The analysis uses the NASA code POST (Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories) to determine trajectories and weight in high-earth orbit for AUS/advanced payloads. Cost and reliability of an RLV versus current generation expandable launch vehicles are presented.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 420; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-1998: Space technology and applications international forum - 1998, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 25-29 Jan 1998; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.54733; (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1151-1156","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B4693053854","10.1063/1.54733","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21179651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21179651","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","420"

In a preliminary and scoping stage the designer needs to evaluate options in an iterative way by using simulations that run fast on a computer. As a consequence of a collaborative agreement between the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), ORNL has been involved in the development of models and calculational procedures for the analysis (neutronic and thermal hydraulic) of power sources for nuclear electric propulsion. The nuclear modules will be integrated into the whole simulation of the nuclear electric propulsion system. The vehicles use either a Brayton direct-conversion cycle, using the heated helium from a NERVA-type reactor, or a potassium Rankine cycle, with the working fluid heated on the secondary side of a heat exchanger and lithium on the primary side coming from a fast reactor. Given a set of input conditions, the codes calculate composition, dimensions, volumes, and masses of the core, reflector, control system, pressure vessel, neutron and gamma shields, as well as the thermal hydraulic conditions of the coolant, clad and fuel. Input conditions are power, core life, pressure and temperature of the coolant at the inlet of the core, either the temperature of the coolant at the outlet of the core or the coolant mass flow and the fluences and integrated doses at the cargo area. Using state-of-the-art neutron cross sections and transport codes, a database was created for the neutronic performance of both reactor designs. The free parameters of the models are the moderator/fuel mass ratio for the NERVA reactor and the enrichment and the pitch of the lattice for the fast reactor. Reactivity and energy balance equations are simultaneously solved to find the reactor design. Thermalhydraulic conditions are calculated by solving the one-dimensional versions of the equations of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum with compressible flow.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 420; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-1998: Space technology and applications international forum - 1998, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 25-29 Jan 1998; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.54749; (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1281-1288","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B4703053864","10.1063/1.54749","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21179661","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21179661","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","420"

Almost certainly within the next thirty years, a human crew will brave the isolation, the radiation, and the lack of gravity to walk on and explore the Red planet. However, because the mission distances and duration will be hundreds of times greater than the lunar missions, a human crew will face much greater obstacles and a higher risk than those experienced during the Apollo program. A single solution to many of these obstacles is to dramatically decrease the mission duration by developing a high performance propulsion system. The gas-core nuclear rocket (GCNR) has the potential to be such a system. We have completed a comparative study of the potential impact that a GCNR could have on a manned Mars mission. The total IMLEO, transit times, and accumulated radiation dose to the crew will be compared with the NASA Design Reference Missions.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 420; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-1998: Space technology and applications international forum - 1998, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 25-29 Jan 1998; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.54731; (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1138-1144","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B4691053852","10.1063/1.54731","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21179649","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21179649","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","420"

This paper will discuss the current application of this NTP stage to a Human Mars mission, and project what implications a nuclear trans-Earth injection (TEI) stage as well as a bi-modal NTP stage could mean to a human visit to Mars.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 420; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-1998: Space technology and applications international forum - 1998, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 25-29 Jan 1998; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.54740; (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1206-1211","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B4698053859","10.1063/1.54740","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21179656","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21179656","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","420"

Batch treatment resulted in the transformation of TNT. Semicontinuous treatment resulted in complete degradation of TNT. In addition to removing TNT, the slurry reactor also removed contaminants such as trinitrobenzene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, RDX, and octahydro-l,3,5,7-tetranitro-l,3,5,7-tetraazocine (HMX). Radiolabeled TNT incubated with reactor biomass showed that 23% of [{sup 14}C]TNT was mineralized, 27% was converted to biomass, and 8% was adsorbed onto the soil. The rest of the [{sup 14}C]TNT was accounted for as metabolites, including a ring cleavage product identified as 2,3-butanediol. Increasing the frequency of soil addition from once to two or three times weekly did not affect the TNT removal rates. The soil slurry reactor also maintained the bacterial population fairly well, needing only 0.3% molasses as a cosubstrate.","","","Argonne National Lab.

In the past 40 years of U.S. government sponsored space nuclear power developments, total economics has received only token consideration. In the real world, nuclear power has had limited acceptance where it provided the enabling capability i.e. isotopes for low power, long life, deep space missions, or reactor power for underwater nuclear submarines. It was also accepted where it was perceived to be more economic. Examples are nuclear reactor powered aircraft carriers, escort vessels and central station power stations. In any case, real and perceived public and environmental safety must always be included into the economic equation.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.52133; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1309-1316","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B6243042260","10.1063/1.52133","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21165702","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21165702","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"

The effect of oxygen presence in the interelectrode gap on the TFE performance was also compared for fission and electrically heating TFE. Electrical heating results in a more uniform axial distributions of emitter temperature, current density, and tungsten loss rate distributions in the central part of the TFE compared to fission heating. Results show that introducing oxygen into the interelectrode gap reduces the output electric power for both fission and electrically heated TFEs.

The Defense Special Weapons Agency's (DSWA) Thermionic Evaluation Facility (TEF) is carrying out both experimental and analytical research to advance thermionic space power technology to meet this expected need. A Modeling and Analysis (M and A) project has been created at the TEF to develop analysis tools, evaluate concepts, and guide research. M and A activities are closely linked to the TEF experimental program, providing experiment support and using experimental data to validate models. A planning exercise has been completed for the M and A project, and a strategy for implementation was developed. All M and A activities will build on a framework provided by a system performance model for a baseline Thermionic Fuel Element (TFE) concept. The system model is composed of sub-models for each of the system components and sub-systems. Additional thermionic component options and model improvements will continue to be incorporated in the basic system model during the course of the program. All tasks are organized into four focus areas: 1) system models, 2) thermionic research, 3) alternative concepts, and 4) documentation and integration.

The single-cell TFE used in this study is the prototype for the 40 kW{sub e} space nuclear power system that is similar to the 6 kW{sub e} TOPAZ-II. The steady-state I-V measurements influence the emitter temperature due to electron cooling. Therefore, to eliminate the steady-state I-V measurement influence on the TFE and provide a better understanding of the behavior of the thermionic energy converter and TFE characteristics, dynamic I-V measurements are made. The dynamic I-V measurements are made at various input power levels, cesium pressures, collector temperatures, and steady-state current levels. From these measurements, it is shown that the dynamic I-V's do not change the TFE characteristics at a given operating point. Also, the evaluation of the collector work function from the dynamic I-V measurements shows that the collector optimization is not due to a minimum in the collector work function but due to an emission optimization. Since the dynamic I-V measurements do not influence the TFE characteristics, it is believed that these measurements can be done at a system level to understand the influence of TFE placement in the reactor as a function of the core thermal distribution.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.51979; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1559-1566","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B6264042281","10.1063/1.51979","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21165723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21165723","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"

The tungsten clad is a single unit, containing a continuous fuel stack with an unfueled section extending through one end of the reactor. The emitters are electrically insulated from the heat source; therefore, several converters may be connected by short leads to produce more voltage per fuel element and to reduce the power losses in the leads. A fast reactor design was chosen; consequently, tungsten may be used for the fuel cladding and the emitters without a significant reactivity penalty due to neutron capture by tungsten epithermal resonances. The ability to use all-tungsten emitters may permit high emitter temperatures. Calculations indicate that at an emitter temperature of 2150 K and current density of 10 A/cm{sup 2}, a 36 cm long thermionic fuel element (TFE) with 9 converters in series should produce 4500 W{sub e} at 9.2 V and 15.7% efficiency. One major advantage of this approach, relative to typical multicell designs is that the system can be tested by electrical heaters in the fuel cavity before loading fuel.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.51980; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1567-1572","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B6265042282","10.1063/1.51980","","2012-06-28T00:00:00Z","21165724","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21165724","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"

The approach was based on the methodology developed for the RSMASS-D models. The RSMASS-D approach for the reactor and shield sub-systems uses a combination of simple equations derived from reactor physics and other fundamental considerations along with tabulations of data from more detailed neutron and gamma transport theory computations. Relatively simple models are used to estimate the masses of other subsystem components of the nuclear propulsion and bimodal systems. Other subsystem components include instrumentation and control (I and C), boom, safety systems, radiator, thermoelectrics, heat pipes, and nozzle. The user of these models can vary basic design parameters within an allowed range to achieve a parameter choice which yields a minimum mass for the operational conditions of interest. Estimated system masses are presented for a range of reactor power levels for propulsion for the PBR propulsion concept and for both electrical power and propulsion for the cermet-core bimodal concept. The estimated reactor system masses agree with mass predictions from detailed calculations with xx percent for both models.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.52136; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1579-1584","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B6267042284","10.1063/1.52136","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21165726","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21165726","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"

Our work showed that thermionics is a viable technology for nuclear bimodal power systems. We demonstrated that materials for a thermionic fuel-emitter combination capable of performing at operating temperatures of 2473 K are not only possible but available. The objective of this work, funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Space and Defense Power Systems, was to evaluate the compatibility of fuel material consisting of an uranium carbide/tantalum carbide solid solution with an emitter material consisting of a monocrystalline tungsten-niobium alloy. The uranium loading of the fuel material was 70 mole% uranium carbide. The program was successfully accomplished by a B and W/SIA LUTCH team. Its workscope was integrated with tasks being performed at both Babcock and Wilcox, Lynchburg Research Center, Lynchburg, Virginia, and SIA LUTCH, Podolsk, Russia. Samples were fabricated by LUTCH and seven thermal tests were performed in a hydrogen atmosphere. The first preliminary test was performed at 2273 K by LUTCH, and the remaining six tests were performed At B and W. Three tests were performed at 2273 K, two at 2373 K, and the final test at 2473 K. The results showed that the fuel and emitter materials were compatible in the presence of hydrogen. No evidence of liquid formation, dissolution of the uranium carbide from the uranium carbide/tantalum carbide solid solution, or diffusion of the uranium into the monocrystalline tungsten alloy was observed. Among the highlights of the program was the successful export of the fuel samples from Russia and their import into the US by commercial transport. This paper will discuss the technical aspects of this work.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.51982; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1593-1598","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; Contract no.

The baseline HPS is a potential, near-term, low-cost space fission power system. The system will be composed of independent modules, and all components operate within the existing database. The HPS has relatively few system integration issues; thus, the successful development of a module is a significant step toward verifying system feasibility and performance estimates. A prototypic, refractory-metal HPS module is being fabricated, and testing is scheduled to begin in November 1996. A successful test will provide high confidence that the HPS can achieve its predicted performance. An HPS incorporating superalloys will be better suited for some terrestrial or planetary applications. Fabrication and testing of a superalloy HPS module should be less challenging than that of the refractory metal module. A superalloy HPS core capable of delivering &gt;100 kWt to a power conversion subsystem could be fabricated for about $500k (unfueled). Tests of the core with electric heat (used to simulate heat from fission) could demonstrate normal and off-normal operation of the core, including the effects of heatpipe failure. A power conversion system also could be coupled to the core to demonstrate full system operation.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 387; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: STAIF-97: Space technology and applications international forum, Albuquerque, NM (United States), 26-30 Jan 1997; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.52006; (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 299-304","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B6272042289","10.1063/1.52006","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21165731","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21165731","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","387"

In light of these perceptions, the debate over where to temporarily store or permanently dispose of spent nuclear fuel (at the reactor site, an interim storage facility, or a permanent repository) provokes immense concern among possible host jurisdictions. To address these concerns, one needs to know if people's subjective opinions conform with the choices they make and are therefore reflected in their economic behavior. Argonne National Laboratory researchers used a hedonic model to complete a study of residential property value dynamics over a 5-year period within a 15-mile radius of two California nuclear power plants. They tracked the economic ramifications of decisions about the spent nuclear fuel stored at those reactors. The study revealed that no significant negative effects on residential property values resulted from a decision to move spent nuclear fuel from wet storage to a dry-cask storage facility or from a request to extend the reactor operating permit (given future changes in the type of nuclear fuel storage facility that would accompany such an extension).","","","Argonne National Lab.

In addition the enormous energy content of the plutonium is released by the fission process and can be captured to produce valuable electric power. While no fission option has been identified that can accomplish the destruction of more than about 70% of the WG-Pu without repeated reprocessing and recycling, which presents additional opportunities for diversion, the gas turbine modular helium-cooled reactor (GT-MHR), using an annular graphite core and graphite inner and outer reflectors combines the maximum plutonium destruction and highest electrical production efficiency and economics in an inherently safe system. Accelerator driven sub-critical assemblies have also been proposed for WG-Pu destruction. These systems offer almost complete WG-Pu destruction, but achieve this goal by using circulating aqueous or molten salt solutions of the fuel, with potential safety implications. By combining the GT-MHR with an accelerator-driven sub-critical MHR assembly, the best features of both systems can be merged to achieve the near total destruction of WG-Pu in an inherently safe, diversion-proof system in which the discharged fuel elements are suitable for long term high level waste storage without the need for further processing. More than 90% total plutonium destruction, and more than 99.9% Pu-239 destruction, could be achieved. The modular concept minimizes the size of each unit so that both the GT-MHR and the accelerator would be straightforward extensions of current technology.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 346; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on accelerator-driven transmutation technologies and applications, Las Vegas, NV (United States), 25-29 Jul 1994; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.49091; (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 347-363","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B8176034103","10.1063/1.49091","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21156101","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21156101","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","346"

The use of the combined double molten salt reactor system allows adequate neutron multiplication to permit using an electron accelerator for the initial neutron flux.

Accelerator-based transmutation study at JAERI is focused on a dedicated transmutor with a subcritical actinide-fueled subcritical core coupled with a spallation target driven by a high intensity proton accelerator. Two types of system concept, solid system and molten-salt system, are discussed. The solid system consists of sodium-cooled tungsten target and metallic actinide fuel. The molten-salt system is fueled with molten actinide chloride that acts also as a target material. The proposed plant transmutes about 250 kg of minor actinide per year, and generates enough electricity to power its own accelerator. JAERI is proposing the development of an intense proton linear accelerator ETA with 1.5 GeV-10 mA beam for engineering tests of accelerator-based transmutation.

An accelerator/target/blanket systems with thermal power in blanket about 1850 Mwt and operating during 30 years have been investigated. Continual feed up by plutonium (fissile material) and Tc-99 (transmuted material) was assumed. Accelerator beam intensity differed 6.3 times (16 mA-Case 1, and 100 mA-Case 2). Conversion ratio (CR) was defined as the ratio of Tc-99 nuclei transmuted to the number of Pu nuclei consumed. The results for two cases are as follows: &lt;mpos;l&gt;&lt;ar;l&gt;&lt;arr&gt; &lt;arc&gt; Case 1&lt;arc&gt;Case 2&lt;arr&gt;CR&lt;arc&gt; 0.77&lt;arc&gt; 1.66&lt;arr&gt;N(LWR)&lt;arc&gt; 8.6&lt;arc&gt; 19.1&lt;arr&gt;Power MWt(el)&lt;arc&gt; 512&lt;arc&gt; 225&lt;arx&gt; where N(LWR)-number of LWRs(3000 MWt(th)) from which yearly discharge of Tc-99 is transmuted during 30 years. High value of conversion ratio considerably exceeding 1 (CR=1.66) was obtained in the system with high source intensity as compared with low source system (CR=0.77). Net output of electric power of high source intensity system is about twice lower due to consumption of electric power for accelerator feed up. The loss of energy for Tc-99 transmutation is estimated as 40 Mev(el)/nuclei.

To replace the aging nuclear reactors used today for this production, we propose to use a spallation neutron source, with neutron multiplication by fission. A 150 MeV, H{sup -} cyclotron can produce a 225 kW proton beam with 50% total system energy efficiency. The proton beam would hit a molten lead target, surrounded by a water moderator and a graphite reflector, producing around 0.96 primary neutron per proton. The primary spallation neutrons, moderated, would strike secondary targets containing a subcritical amount of {sup 235}U. The assembly would show a keff of 0.8, yielding a fivefold neutron multiplication. The thermal neutron flux at the targets location would be 2 10{sup 14} n/cm{sup 2}.s, resulting in a fission power of 500 to 750 kW. One such system could supply the world demand in {sup 99}Mo, as well as other radioisotopes. Preliminary indications show that the cost would be lower than the cost of a commercial 10 MW isotope production reactor. The cost of operation, of disposal of radiowaste and of decommissioning should be significantly lower as well. Finally, the non-critical nature of the system would make it more acceptable for the public than a nuclear reactor and should simplify the licensing process.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 346; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on accelerator-driven transmutation technologies and applications, Las Vegas, NV (United States), 25-29 Jul 1994; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.49177; (c) 1996 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 852-858","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B8257034184","10.1063/1.49177","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21156182","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21156182","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","346"

To accomplish this, an accelerator proton beam/tungsten neutron source model is surrounded by a subcritical blanket using metallic fuel and sodium as coolant. The consequences of typical accident transients, namely unprotected transient overpower (TOP), loss of heat sink (LOHS), and loss of flow (LOF) were calculated for the hybrid system and compared to corresponding results for a metal-fueled fast reactor. Results indicate that the subcritical system exhibits superior performance for TOP (reactivity-induced) transients; however, only in the critical system are reactivity feedbacks able to cause passive shutdown in the LOHS and LOF events. Therefore, for a full spectrum of accident initiators considered, the overall safety behavior of accelerator-driven metal-fueled systems can neither be concluded to be worse nor to be better than advanced reactor designs which rely on passive safety features.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: AIP Conference Proceedings; Journal Volume: 346; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: International conference on accelerator-driven transmutation technologies and applications, Las Vegas, NV (United States), 25-29 Jul 1994; Other Information: DOI: 10.1063/1.49133; (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 557-563","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-243X; APCPCS; TRN: US08B8206034133","10.1063/1.49133","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21156131","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21156131","","AIP Conference Proceedings","1","346"

They can maintain good creep resistance in a very high temperature range of 1,273 K or higher. Here, creep crack growth tests were conducted on Ni-26 pct Cr-17 pct W-0.5 pct Mo alloys with different carbon contents in air and in helium gas environment at 1273 K using the compact-type (CT) specimen, and the effects of carbon content and environment on creep crack growth rate are discussed. Creep crack growth rate da/dt is evaluated by the C* parameters. The da/dt is faster in higher-carbon alloys than in lower-carbon alloys in each environment. This effect of carbon content is attributed to the lower creep ductility due to the increase of fine trans-granular carbides in higher-carbon alloys. The environmental effect on the da/dt vs C* relations is scarcely observed in higher-carbon alloys. In the 0.003 pct C alloy, however, da/dt is much lower in the He gas environment than in air. Carburization is observed ahead of the crack tip in the He gas environment at 1,273 K.

This paper presents elastic-plastic solutions for semi-elliptical surface flaws of four different crack depths. Solutions are developed from a series of finite element analyses using the ABAQUS computer program with a deformation plasticity material constitutive law. Although the solutions are directly applicable to a single set of Ramberg-Osgood material parameters, they may be extended to include various amounts of strain hardening by a ratioing technique utilizing calibration functions from the EPRI handbook for continuous flaws. This paper addresses cylindrical structures loaded by internal pressure, and excludes any consideration of thermal loadings. Elastic-plastic J solutions, determined for pressures up to 5,000 psi (13,700 Pa), or twice the design pressure, depart from plastic-zone-corrected linear elastic predictions at approximately 3,000 psi (7,620 Pa) pressure. The h[sub 1] plastic calibration functions derived in this paper are limited to the point of greatest crack depth in 6:1 aspect ratio semi-elliptical inside surface flaws in cylindrical reactor pressure vessels.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 117:1; Other Information: Presented at the Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference, San Diego, California (US), June 23--27, 1991","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 66-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-9930; CODEN: JPVTAS; TRN: 95-006693","10.1115/1.2842092","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","6466530","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6466530","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; (United States)","","117:1"

Analyzed here is a plate with a semi-elliptical surface crack subjected to various cyclic tensile and bending stresses. A depth and an aspect ratio of the surface crack are assumed to be probabilistic variables. Failure probabilities are calculated using the Monte Carlo methods with the importance sampling or the stratified sampling techniques. Material properties are chosen from the Marshall report, the ASME Code Section XI, and the experiments on a Japanese RPV material carried out by the Life Evaluation (LE) subcommittee of the Japan Welding Engineering Society (JWES), while loads are determined referring to design loading conditions of pressurized water reactors (PWR). Seven organizations participate in this study. At first, the procedures for obtaining reliable PFM solutions with low failure probabilities are examined by solving a unique problem with seven computer programs. The seven solutions agree very well with one another, i.e., by a factor of 2 to 5 in failure probabilities. Next, sensitivity analyses are performed by varying fracture toughness values, loading conditions, and pre and in-service inspections. Finally, life extension simulations based on the PFM analyses are performed. It is clearly demonstrated from these analyses that failure probabilities are so sensitive to the change of fracture toughness values that the degree of neutron irradiation significantly influences the judgment of plant life extension.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 117:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 7-13","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-9930; CODEN: JPVTAS; TRN: 95-006690","10.1115/1.2842095","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6466568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6466568","","Journal of Pressure Vessel Technology; (United States)","","117:1"

A micro ECT probe used here consists of a conventional pancake-type coil as an exciting coil and a micro magnetic sensor array as a set of pickup coils. Magnetic field perturbation due to a flaw was measured with high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The measured signals from the array were compared with numerical results obtained by a three-dimensional A-[phi] code. It was confirmed that the Micro ECT system has the potential to evaluate the length and depth of a flaw with better accuracy than that of a conventional pancake-type ECT in the stream generator tubings in a pressurized water nuclear reactor.","","","","","","United States","1995-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Magnetics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 31:1Pt2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 870-876","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0018-9464; CODEN: IEMGAQ; TRN: 95-006197","10.1109/20.364584","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6801458","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6801458","","IEEE Transactions on Magnetics (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","31:1Pt2"
