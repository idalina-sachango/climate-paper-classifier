"Wall diffuser velocity effects on American Shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) inside a fishway entrance channel","Mulligan, Kevin B.; Rojas, M.; Towler, B.; Lake, B.; Palmer, R.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; fish passage; attraction; Alosa sapidissima; upstream migration; fish behavior","Attraction water for fishways is typically introduced through a diffuser inside the entrance channel, often through the floor or wall. In the spring of 2019, this laboratory study examined how 151 adult American Shad (Alosa sapidissima) responded to different gross velocities through a wall diffuser inside a full-scale fishway entrance channel. Two velocity conditions were studied, 0.152 m/s and 0.305 m/s, both without turning vanes inside the auxiliary water channel. The fish were tracked using the passive integrated transponder telemetry technique. The results of the experiments showed no difference in American Shad behavior when exhibited to the low and high velocity treatments. Moreover, shad passed the diffuser in roughly 3 out of every 4 attempts, regardless of the treatment. However, the similarity in shad behavior and passage performance is believed to be more of a result of the similarity in flow fields that resulted from the lack of flow guidance devices inside the auxiliary water channel. Furthermore, these findings therefore highlight the importance of properly maintained flow guidance devices, an often-overlooked component of an auxiliary water system.","Taylor & Francis","","Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Using energy storage systems to extend the life of hydropower plants","Bhatti, Bilal Ahmad; Hanif, Sarmad; Alam, Jan E.; Mitra, Bhaskar; Kini, Roshan L.; Wu, Di","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE; economic analysis; energy storage system; hybrid operation; hydro turbines; power system operation","Despite their advantages, distributed energy resources (DERs) bring inherent uncertainty and variability into the landscape of modern power systems. As DER penetration grows, conventional generators like hydropower plants have to respond more often to arrest the imbalance in the net load. Hydropower turbines provide their best operational performance with minimal wear and tear when operating at regions of maximum efficiency. However, the current needs for hydropower plants require them to operate under varying load conditions and thus sub-optimal operating points leading to additional stress. To relieve the hydropower plants, this paper proposes a hybridization strategy where a hydropower unit is paired with an energy storage system (ESS) to increase operational flexibility and mitigate damage to the hydro plant. Models are developed to represent the operation of the hybrid system, quantify degradation, and assess economic benefits. Moreover, an innovative controller disaggregates the market dispatch signal into separate control setpoints for the ESS and hydropower unit. In case studies performed on a real-world hydropower facility, it was found that the ESS-based hybridization can extend the life of the hydropower plant by 5% on average. Notably, the economic benefits from reduced maintenance and deferred investment are estimated to be around $3.6 million.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Hydropower flexibility valuation tool for flow requirement evaluation","Roni, Mohammad; Mosier, Thomas; Li, Binghui; Alam, S.M Shafiul; Durvasulu, Venkat; Lawson, Beth; Steindorf, Dave; Pracheil, Brenda; Chalishazar, Vishvas","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; hydropower flexibility; optimization; electricity market; reservoir operation","Timing of generation is becoming more and more valuable. This creates greater potential tension between environmental and power system objectives since both systems require their own flow patterns. Identifying win–win outcomes in this context requires being able to discuss the value of flexibility across stakeholder groups. This research proposes a two-stage optimization method to understand hydropower flexibility to meet both environmental and power system requirements. The tool simulates the two-settlement market process in the U.S. by maximizing revenues from both the day-ahead and real-time markets, subject to plant operational limits, regulatory flow and ramping requirements, and uncertainties associated with water availability and market prices. The model is formulated as linear programming problems and solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer. By examining a range of flow requirements, ramping constraints, and storage capacities, the proposed tool shows how to make more informed decisions to weigh the cost of specific flow requirements in the context of the overall license requirements. Results from the case study show that revenue is more sensitive to the ramping constraints than the minimum flow constraints. We also demonstrate that removing flow constraints in a dry month increases monthly revenue by up to 118%, as opposed to only 1% in a wet month. In addition, our results suggest that using a learning-based water flow forecast results in an increase of monthly revenue up to 6.4% compared with persistence forecast.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluation of Nominal Energy Storage at Existing Hydropower Reservoirs in the US","Hansen, Carly; Ghimire, Ganesh R.; Kao, Shih-Chieh","13 HYDRO ENERGY; nominal energy storage; hydropower reservoirs; conventional hydropower; HESC data set; storage behavior","Long-term planning and operation of hydropower reservoirs require an understanding of both water and energy storage. As energy storage needs of the evolving grid increase, we must account for the water and energy storage potential of these reservoirs. Given the limitations of current data on existing hydropower, we compile statistics related to storage volume and hydraulic head from publicly available data sets and examine differences in descriptions of US hydropower storage. Assembled characteristics are used to calculate nominal energy storage capacity, a simple measure of potential to generate power from a given volume of water, not factoring in detailed constraints. Inventory-based estimates of energy storage are calculated at 2,075 dams, which helps put the potential for US hydropower to support energy storage in context with similar evaluations in other regions and with other energy storage technologies. The national energy storage capacity ranges between 34.5 and 45.1 TWh depending on the information used, with 52% of energy storage located at the 10 largest reservoirs in the US. Energy storage capacities are also calculated at 236 dams with historical volume and elevation data. Finally, reservoir inflows provide context for the storage volumes and sensitivities to hydrologic variability. Larger reservoirs with greater storage volume to inflow ratios are concentrated in the Western US, but the majority of hydropower reservoirs store less than the annual inflow. We address several infrastructure and water resource informatics challenges and highlight remaining issues, including representing seasonal or shorter variability in water volumes and representing connected hydropower facilities.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

An improved understanding of the changes to hydropower dispatch under future higher VRE grid conditions reveals research gap that should be informed power grid planning and reservoir water releases policies considering multiple other water uses and varying hydrologic condition. This study aims to understand the role of hydropower in a changing power grid by employing a production cost model, PLEXOS, across future power system scenarios, planning horizons, and regions. We explore optimized hydropower dispatch to understand its potential role in minimizing the system cost and renewable curtailment. We also examine the sensitivity of hydropower revenue under various grid scenarios of the Eastern U.S. and hydrology conditions. Results indicate hydropower generation follows net load and compensates for the variability of solar and wind generation. Although energy prices are lower during some periods in the future grid scenarios, there is a potential for higher revenue for hydropower by providing both energy and ancillary services during times of stress. Additionally, hydropower revenue is sensitive to hydrology in the SERC region, which we considered as an example. The feasibility of hydropower dispatching with higher ramps between low and high hourly-capacity factors, as indicated in the optimization model, requires further study to consider other water use and ecology constraints.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

We soft-linked a global hydrologic model to a multi-region capacity expansion and planning model for the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) to examine the effects of seasonality in hydropower electricity generation on electricity trade, as well as the economic benefits of unconstrained cross-border electricity trade. We found that transitioning from rainy to dry season decreases hydroelectricity generation by an average of 40% in a normal year across the region. Between 2018 and 2050, satisfying the region's electricity demand will require significant capital investment; nevertheless, extending from current bilateral electricity trade agreements to a fully competitive cross-border electricity trade will result in net annual savings of $3 billion in 2015 USD.

"Revised monthly energy generation estimates for 1,500 hydroelectric power plants in the United States","Turner, Sean W. D.; Voisin, Nathalie (ORCID:000000026848449X); Nelson, Kristian","13 HYDRO ENERGY","<title>Abstract</title> <p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) conducts a regular survey (form EIA-923) to collect annual and monthly net generation for more than ten thousand U.S. power plants. Approximately 90% of the ~1,500 hydroelectric plants included in this data release are surveyed at annual resolution only and thus lack actual observations of monthly generation. For each of these plants, EIA imputes monthly generation values using the combined monthly generating pattern of other hydropower plants within the corresponding census division. The imputation method neglects local hydrology and reservoir operations, rendering the monthly data unsuitable for various research applications. Here we present an alternative approach to disaggregate each unobserved plant’s reported annual generation using proxies of monthly generation—namely historical monthly reservoir releases and average river discharge rates recorded downstream of each dam. Evaluation of the new dataset demonstrates substantial and robust improvement over the current imputation method, particularly if reservoir release data are available. The new dataset—named RectifHyd—provides an alternative to EIA-923 for U.S. scale, plant-level, monthly hydropower net generation (2001–2020). RectifHyd may be used to support power system studies or analyze within-year hydropower generation behavior at various spatial scales.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Hydropower plants also have detrimental impacts on the environment and ecology, including direct impacts to anadromous fish populations. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) – based Biological Performance Assessment (BioPA) toolset is used for biological evaluations of fish passage through hydropower plants. The hydraulic environment of a hydropower plant was evaluated using CFD coupled with discrete element method (DEM) simulations. The predicted flow field and particle collision rate were validated against the experimental data in a water flume that has an idealized hydroturbine distributor geometry. Flow simulations were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic stressors, such as nadir pressure, fluid shear, runner collision, in a physical scale in a hydropower plant with Kaplan turbine which are responsible for injury and mortality of fish in a downstream migration. The cumulative exposure probability for the nadir pressure and collision with turbine runner was found to decrease with increased discharge rate. The lowest discharge rate shows the higher value of cumulative shear exposure probability. The maximum value of collision velocity increases with increased discharge rate. We offer the conclusions that will help in understanding various hydraulic stressors for biological assessment for environmentally sustainable hydroturbine passage.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Getting lost tracking the carbon footprint of hydropower","Jager, Henriette I.; Griffiths, Natalie A.; Hansen, Carly H.; King, Anthony W.; Matson, Paul G.; Singh, Debjani; Pilla, Rachel M.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; hydropower; reservoir; carbon accounting; electricity portfolio","In the transition to low-carbon electricity, well-quantified estimates of carbon dynamics are needed to ensure that emissions reduction targets are achieved. Here we review the state of the science on carbon accounting for hydropower reservoirs and identify limitations and future solutions. Nearly all research on reservoir greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions has focused on individual reservoirs in isolation without considering their position in a freshwater network draining organic matter from upstream watersheds or the coordinated operation of reservoir cascades. Second, carbon inventories have extrapolated from a small, non-probabilistic sample of highly variable measurements of GHG emissions to unsampled reservoirs. A stronger statistical foundation is needed to estimate a global inventory and its uncertainty. Third, attribution to hydropower is based on ranks assigned to reservoir purpose. Instead, the physical influence of hydropower on carbon dynamics could be directly measured. Fourth, current carbon-accounting practices neglect time. A time-varying approach would quantify variation in emissions for electricity portfolios from changes in the fuel mix at different times and account for ancillary services, i.e., the ability to support the grid when variable renewables are not available without using natural gas. Reservoirs also sequester a significant portion of inflowing carbon in sediments and slow the carbon cycle by delaying the return of carbon to the atmosphere for decades to centuries. Together, these refinements would help to illuminate pathways toward meeting energy demand with the longest-possible delay in returning carbon to the atmosphere and without adding ancient sources to the pool of carbon cycling through aquatic ecosystems.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, PV shading also reduces passive solar heating during winter months, leading to an increase in the building heating load during cold seasons. In this study, the heat transfer performance of an enclosure formed by adjacent PV modules is analyzed for three locations in the United States, comparing the daily heat flux through rooftops for the case of a PV-shaded rooftop as well as an unshaded roof. Several result metrics are developed as part of this work, including the saved energy load (SEL), or the energy conserved by adding PV-shading to the rooftop, and the additional energy load (AEL), or the supplemental building energy required to replace shaded solar heating. Lastly, this work calculates the utility factor, being the ratio of SEL and PV power output to AEL as a metric of PV effectiveness. SELs are 5.2, 6.2, and 11.7 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> · year for Dayton, Boise, and Phoenix, respectively, while the AELs for the same locations are 1.6, 1.5, and 2.1 kWh/m<sup>2</sup> · year. The utility factors for the same three locations are 61, 71, and 79. In general, locations with hot, non-cloudy summers and clear skies in winter see the largest utility factor. Further, it is shown that PV shading can conserve building energy during the winter months by preventing radiative losses to cold winter skies.","ASME","","University of Dayton, OH (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Solar Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 144; Journal Issue: 6","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 061011","","","EE0007710","Journal ID: ISSN 0199-6231","10.1115/1.4054710","","2022-10-14T00:00:00Z","1884195","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1884195","","Journal of Solar Energy Engineering","6","144"

Modeling and feasibility analysis of alternative design options are crucial for developing new run-of-river hydropower projects. Our review shows that existing run-of-river hydropower design models focus on maximizing economic potential at high-head diversion schemes with limited consideration of environmental outcomes. Since nearly three-quarters of new hydropower potential in the United States is found at low-head sites and environmental performance standards are imperative to project success, new models are needed to address the multi-dimensional design challenges at these sites. To aid in formulating holistic models, we synthesize the performance objectives and design variables related to early-stage run-of-river facility design. The objectives span six potential impact areas, including hydrologic alteration, sediment continuity, water quality, aquatic species passage, social, and economic. Based on these reviews, we identify three key areas to enhance the capabilities of run-of-river hydropower design models. These are 1) expanded model formulations, 2) assessment of barrier effects, and 3) explicit environmental objectives. The resulting modeling improvements would accelerate the identification of run-of-river hydropower designs that minimize environmental impacts, promote economic competitiveness, and incorporate the value of non-power benefits.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Projects with greater environmental complexity (e.g., endangered species) had significantly longer timelines than projects that were less environmentally complex. We attributed shorter timelines for original licenses to lower environmental complexity (e.g., no endangered species) because most original licenses involved development of already impacted sites.

A common approach to optimizing revenues of a hybrid hydro and energy storage system is using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Although MILP models can provide accurate production cost estimations, they are typically very computationally expensive. To provide a fast yet accurate first-step information to hydropower plant owners or operators who consider integrating energy storage systems, we propose an innovative approach to predicting optimal revenues of an integrated energy generation and storage system. In this study, we examined the performance of two prediction techniques: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and machine learning (ML) models developed based on artificial neural networks (ANN). Predictive equations and models are generated based on optimized solutions from a market participation optimization model, the Conventional Hydropower Energy and Environmental Resource System (CHEERS) model. The two predicting techniques reduce the computational time to evaluate annual revenue for one set of battery configurations from 3 h to 1 to 4 min per run while also being implementable with significantly less data. The model validation prediction errors of developed GAMs and ML models are generally below 5%; for model testing predictions, the ML models consistently outperform the regression equations in terms of root mean square errors. This new approach allows plant owners, operators, or potential investors to quickly access multiple battery configurations under different energy generation and market scenarios. This new revenue prediction method will therefore help reduce the barriers, and thereby promoting the deployment of battery hybridization with existing renewable energy sources.","Elsevier","","Idaho National Lab.

Driven by river flows, conventional hydropower is exposed to the vagaries of weather and climate, motivating drought and climate change hydropower impact studies at large spatial scales. Here we review methods of climate-driven hydropower simulation at large spatial scales, specifically multi-basin regions to global. We identify four types of approach based on complexity of tools and richness of data applied to the problem. Since the earliest attempts to model climate-driven hydropower at continental scale almost two decades ago, the field has transitioned from one of scientific curiosity to practical application, with studies increasingly motivated by the need to inform power grid expansion planning and operation. As the hydrological and water management models used in large-scale hydropower studies become more sophisticated, new opportunities will emerge to study the impacts of changing hydropower on power system reliability and performance at large power grid scale. To grasp these opportunities, the water resources community must continue to enhance data and models for representing river flows and anthropogenic water use and management at subcontinental to global scales.</p>","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Irrigation districts face difficulties in the delivery of water to farmers under drought conditions, during equipment failures, or unplanned infrastructure disruptions. The resilience of interconnected water and power systems can be better analyzed and understood through an integrated approach, using a model that connects the dependencies between the two halves of the system. Using a multi-agent system model capturing both water and power system components, as well as their linkages, we capture the interdependencies of these systems and highlight opportunities for improvement when faced with disruptions. Through simulation scenarios, we examine the system resilience using system performance, quantified as the percentage of met demand of the power and water system, when subjected to drought water year, an unforeseen water demand increase, power outage and dam failure. Scenario results indicate that the effects of low flow years are mostly felt in the power system; unexpected increases in water demand marginally impact irrigation system performance; dams and pumps present vulnerabilities of the system, causing substantial unmet demand during disruptions. Noting the interdependencies between the water–power system halves while leveraging an integrated simulation allows for an insightful analysis of the system impacts during disruptions.</p>","MDPI AG","","Idaho National Lab.

In the United States, thousands of non-powered dams (NPDs) represent untapped opportunities for new energy production. This paper reviews past NPD resource assessments, with a particular focus on those in the United States, and evaluates where there is room for improving methods, data, and assumptions for estimating development potential. Through this review, we catalog the types of information that are available to stakeholders involved in NPD development. Past assessments have generally focused on interests of project developers (i.e. how much hydropower development potential is available); however, needs of other stakeholders are not adequately addressed in literature. We thus suggest specific actions for improving methods and data used in assessing development potential: establishing consistency among datasets, accounting for uncertainties, representing technology in a more robust way, and accounting for a broader suite of factors that affect potential. To support development at NPDs, future research should consider emerging technologies, explore co-development strategies, and incorporate socio-economic incentives and constraints. Additionally, we survey recent NPD retrofit projects in the United States and identify patterns at successful projects (restrictions on additional flow alterations and water quality/ecological requirements are common) and unsuccessful projects (surrendered licenses often cite lack of economic feasibility). A comparison between retrofits and the remaining population of NPDs highlights that certain characteristics are disproportionately observed in successful retrofits (i.e. concrete dams with the primary purpose of navigation). Understanding the current state of the literature and recent patterns in NPD development will help improve future analyses of potential and support broader development-related interests.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

By selectively exchanging cations with Cd<sup>2+</sup> and anions with AuCl<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>, we were able to synthesize CdS and Au nanoparticles in CEL and AEL layers, respectively, through sequential chemical and photocatalytic reactions. Reacting Cd<sup>2+</sup> with thioacetamide formed the CdS nanoparticles in CEL. The photogenerated electrons from CdS were then used to reduce AuCl4– in an H-cell configuration to produce Au nanoparticles in AEL and thus prepare a photocatalytically active BPM film (referred to as a CdS/BPM/Au film). Such a concerted design of BPM allows “vectorial” electron transfer between two layers of BPM leading to its transfer to an acceptor molecule (methyl viologen) in solution. Designing photocatalytically active BPM and understanding the vectorial electron flow between two separate ion-selective layers offer new opportunities in water splitting and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.","American Chemical Society","","Univ. of Notre Dame, IN (United States)","USDOE Office of Science (SC), Basic Energy Sciences (BES)","","United States","2021-03-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry.

"The implications of future climate change on the blue water footprint of hydropower in the contiguous US","Zhao, Gang; Gao, Huilin; Kao, Shih-Chieh","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 13 HYDRO ENERGY","As the largest renewable energy source, hydropower is essential to the sustainability of the global energy market. However, a considerable amount of water can be lost in the form of evaporation from the associated multipurpose reservoirs, and hence enlarge the blue water footprint (BWF) of hydropower in a warming climate. To facilitate the sustainable management of both water and energy resources under the impact of climate change in the contiguous United States (CONUS), the BWF values of 143 major multipurpose reservoirs were evaluated during the historical period (1985–2014) and two future periods (2020–2049 and 2070–2099). The historical reservoir evaporation loss was calculated using the Landsat-based reservoir surface area and a new evaporation rate algorithm that considers the heat storage effect. Future projections of runoff availability, hydropower generation, and reservoir evaporation were estimated based on the downscaled climate model ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). It was found that the BWF for the CONUS is highly spatially heterogeneous, with an average value of 26.2 m<sup>3</sup>/MWh in the historical period. In the future, the BWF values are projected to increase under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. This is especially noticeable under RCP 8.5, which has an average BWF value of 30.2 m<sup>3</sup>/MWh for 2070–2099 (increasing by 15.3% from 26.2 m<sup>3</sup>/MWh). The uncertainty ranges increase even more, from 3.4 m<sup>3</sup>/MWh during 2020–2049 to 5.7 m<sup>3</sup>/MWh during 2070–2099. These findings can benefit water and energy resources management in identifying suitable environmental, economic, operational, and investment strategies for multipurpose reservoirs in a changing environment.","IOP Publishing","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Compared to a single isolated cylinder, tandem cylinders can harness more hydrokinetic energy due to synergy in FIO. Experimental and numerical methods have been utilized to analyze the FIO and energy harnessing of VIVACE. A surrogate-based model of two tandem cylinders is developed to predict the power harvesting and corresponding efficiency by introducing a backpropagation neural network. It is then utilized to reduce excessive experimental or computational testing. The effects of spacing, damping, and stiffness on harvested power and efficiency of the established prediction-model are analyzed. At each selected flow velocity, optimization results of power harvesting using the prediction-model are calculated under different combinations of damping and stiffness. The main conclusions are: (1) The surrogate model, built on extensive experimental data for tandem cylinders, can predict the cylinder oscillatory response accurately. (2) Increasing the damping ratio range from 0–0.24 to 0–0.30 is beneficial for improving power efficiency, but has no significant effect on power harvesting. (3) In galloping, a spacing ratio of 1.57 has the highest optimal harnessed power and efficiency compared with other spacing values. (4) Two tandem cylinders can harness 2.01–4.67 times the optimal power of an isolated cylinder. In addition, the former can achieve 1.46–4.01 times the efficiency of the latter.

"On Secured Spinning Reserve Deployment of Energy-Limited Resources Against Contingencies","Wu, Lei; Liu, Yikui; Tang, Zao","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Pumped-storage hydropower; battery storage system; spinning reserve; system contingency","Featured with fast response abilities and high ramp rates, energy storage systems (ESS), such as pumped-storage hydropower (PSH) plants and battery storage systems (BSS), are considered as key first-responders to provide spinning reserve in response to system contingencies. However, ESSs are energy-limited resources, and their sustained spinning reserve deployment is restricted by the stored energy and available capacity. Indeed, the spinning reserve deployment against contingencies may deviate actual state-of-charge (SOC) from the scheduled value, inducing potential SOC boundary violations and non-dispatchability in later hours. This paper proposes the post-contingency operation model and the spinning reserve secure constraints to address these issues. The post-contingency operation model describes that spinning reserve from ESSs is promptly deployed when contingency occurs, and then gradually substituted by quick-start units when they are switched online. By leveraging this operation strategy, spinning reserve secure constraints in terms of SOC headrooms are adopted to guarantee its deplorability. Furthermore, a modified IEEE 118-bus system with multiple PSHs and BSSs is used to verify the proposed approach.","IEEE","","Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Modeling State Transition and Head-Dependent Efficiency Curve for Pumped Storage Hydro in Look-Ahead Dispatch","Wang, Siyuan; Liu, Jian; Chen, Haotian; Bo, Rui; Chen, Yonghong","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Pumped storage hydro; state transition; inputoutput curve; look-ahead dispatch","As one of the most widely installed utility-scale storage facilities, pumped storage hydro (PSH) plays an essential role in providing flexibility for power systems worldwide. Thus, to accurately quantify the flexibility of PSH units in operational optimization problems is important. The conventional PSH models in the literature rarely consider detailed state transitions due to their hourly-based settings. However, it becomes imperative for operational optimization on short-term intervals, especially with increasing shares of renewable energy in power systems. To this end, this paper presents a novel deterministic PSH model that considers the transition time and trajectory between three states of PSH units in look-ahead dispatch. Moreover, to better characterize the varying efficiency of PSH units with water head and flow rate, this paper proposes to model detailed headdependent efficiency curves (hereafter called input-output curves) in look-ahead dispatch, which encounters heavy computational burdens when short time intervals are applied.

"Secured Reserve Scheduling of Pumped-Storage Hydropower Plants in ISO Day-ahead Market","Wu, Lei; Liu, Yikui; Yang, Yafei; Chen, Yonghong; Baldick, Ross; Bo, Rui","13 HYDRO ENERGY","Due to the fast response ability and high ramping rates, pumped-storage hydropower (PSH) plants are playing an increasingly critical role in mitigating power generation fluctuations induced by the growing proliferation of renewable energy resources. However, because they are energy-limited resources, actual reserve deployment from PSHs would cause the deviation of state-of-charge (SOC) from the scheduled value, which, once accumulated over time, could induce potential violations on SOC limits and cause non-dispatchability of PSHs. In recognizing this potential issue, it can become important to securing the reserve schedule of PSHs and other energy limited resources preventively in the day-ahead market clearing. To ensure reserve dispatchability of PSHs despite SOC deviations, this paper proposes the reserve secure constraints, which are cast as a distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation by judiciously introducing random parameters to describe deployment ratios of scheduled regulation reserve from PSHs. Furthermore, these constraints are converted into tractable second-order cone constraints, and further approximated as linear constraints to be compatible with the current ISO day-ahead market clearing model. A modified IEEE 118-bus system with multiple PSHs is adopted to verify the proposed approach.","IEEE","","Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

These properties make vanadium membranes a promising fusion fuel cycle technology for processes such as tritium extraction from PbLi and exhaust processing. Surface contamination has a deleterious effect on the gas-phase hydrogen permeation through vanadium, and the reported permeabilities range from 10<sup>-14</sup> to 10<sup>-7</sup> mol m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-0.5</sup>. Thin dense films of palladium applied to clean vanadium surfaces enable a consistently high hydrogen permeability. In this study, uncoated vanadium resulted in deuterium permeabilities ranging from 2.8 × 10<sup>-11</sup> to 6.4 × 10<sup>-9</sup> mol m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-0.5</sup> at 300 °C–700 °C, respectively. Post-test analysis revealed a VO<sub>x</sub> surface layer and VC<sub>x</sub> subsurface layer formed on the feed side, while the as-received surface oxide dissolved leaving a submonolayer oxide on the permeate surface. Furthermore, the Pd-coated V resulted in a maximum deuterium permeability of 2.1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> Pa<sup>-0.5</sup> at 375 °C upon activation of the Pd surface by oxidation and reduction. The deuterium permeation declined upon heating to 500 °C due to intermetallic diffusion between the Pd and V.

Understanding and predicting how, when, and where changes in the quantity and quality of water resources occur under different environmental stresses including extreme events is crucial for sustainable management of water resources under a changing environment. However, few studies have attempted to quantify or identify the factors and process interactions controlling the impact of extreme events across water-shed systems. Only few large-scale studies include coordinated monitoring and modeling efforts, which limits our ability to assess the large-scale impact of extreme events on water supply and quality. Methods are lacking to propagate uncertainty in process understanding through an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model framework and evaluate its importance, thus failing to take full advantage of the information potentially available through transformative advances in characterization technologies from high-resolution mass spectrometry to airborne and satellite-based remote sensing. There are consequent risks to our nations water security and to human and ecosystem health that may become exacerbated with the increasing frequency of extreme events that is projected for the coming decades. This paper reviews the current status of watershed science for both water quantity and quality and identifies critical gaps in our current knowledge and modeling capability in addressing the emergent needs in predicting watershed hydrologic and biogeochemical responses (i.e., water quantity and quality) under natural and anthropogenic perturbations. We highlight the need to (1) understand how environmental perturbations including extreme events like floods and droughts propagate through watershed systems and assess their short- and long-term impacts on watershed biogeochemistry, water quality and their recovery pathways; (2) develop and improve a watershed water quality model that reflects the state of scientific understanding gained from observations; and (3) construct a data-model fusion system for watershed characterization, process identification, and mechanistic model parameterization. A large base of modeling, monitoring and data capabilities have been built by various federal government agencies given the relevance of water to their critical missions. An emerging need is to build an integrated national capability for watershed water availability and quality that can address water-related missions across multiple federal agencies.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, in the literature, the role of gel rheology on hydrocarbon production from a fractured reservoir is not very well understood. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for the industry to choose appropriate viscosity parameters of fracturing gels. Motivated by these limitations, first, we have developed a high-fidelity model of non-Newtonian fluid flow to simulate fracture propagation, fluid leak-off, and gel flowback processes to predict the oil production from a hydraulic fractured reservoir. Simulation results of the high-fidelity model show how fracture geometry, formation damage, and gel cleanup process varies with the fracturing fluid rheology. Therefore, the developed model is used to understand the effect of gel rheology on hydrocarbon production via a sensitivity analysis, which provides a set of rheological parameters that maximize the cumulative amount of oil production. Finally, utilizing this optimal high-viscosity gel, a model predictive controller is designed to obtain an optimal pumping schedule necessary for producing a target fracture geometry and proppant concentration. The closed-loop simulation results demonstrate that the obtained pumping schedule successfully achieved the desired fracture geometry and proppant concentration at the end of pumping, leading to the maximum oil production from an unconventional reservoir.","Elsevier","","American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), New York, NY (United States); Texas A & M Univ., College Station, TX (United States).

Therefore, this paper introduces a new idea of installing micro-propeller turbines in the aeration basin of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to extract power from the high-velocity location in the water column. This extracted power can be used to operate a mixer at the top of the membrane to induce the mixing in that region, which will drive the less oxygenated wastewater into the water column. The rest of the extracted power will rotate microturbine rotors for electric power generation. By applying the proposed microturbines to the 13 audited facilities, it was demonstrated to achieve a gross annual energy-savings of 3,836.9 MWh, a gross annual cost-saving of $260,497, and total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would be reduced by 2,714 metric tons/year.

This study assesses the effect of climate change on hydropower and electricity demand in the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) in China on the regional net electric load and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is accomplished by using climate projections from five global climate models (GCMs) to simultaneously force (1) a physically-based hydrological model and a statistically-based hydropower model to estimate the future generating capacity of 21 large hydropower plants in the UYRB and (2) an empirical electricity demand model accounting for socioeconomic and climatic factors. Under climate change, the projected hydropower generation in the UYRB tends to increase in the 21st century but is far less than the increase in electricity demand, increasing the gap between demand and supply. Future increases in overall electricity demand are driven by GDP growth, but climate change will alter the distribution of the seasonal electricity demand. Climate warming decreases electricity demand for heating in winter and increases electricity demand for cooling in summer, but ultimately increases demand. Meanwhile, there is an increasing mismatch between electricity demand and hydropower supply associated with inter- and intra-annual variations, owing to the temporal climate change and increase in compound climate extremes (droughts and heatwaves). Finally, meeting the gap between supply and demand due to climate change is estimated to contribute 79.0–184.6 and 50.6–316.2 MMT CO<sub>2e</sub>/yr of additional GHG emissions by the mid and end of 21st century, respectively.","Elsevier","","Univ. of California, Oakland, CA (United States)","USDOE Office of International Affairs (IA); National Key Research and Development Program of China","","United States","2020-09-16T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Applied Energy; Journal Volume: 279; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 115694","","","IA0000018; 2018YFC1508001","Journal ID: ISSN 0306-2619; PII: S0306261920311909","10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115694","","2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","1850263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1850263","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1850263","Applied Energy","C","279"

The rapid decrease in pressure can cause barotrauma as undissolved gas expands according to Boyle’s law. However, it is difficult to see barotrauma occurring within the body of the fish in real time. In order to determine if transparent fish could provide greater insight into barotrauma, five species of transparent tropical fish were exposed to rapid decompressions so internal injuries could be viewed noninvasively. Before and after photos were taken to review the injuries and high speed video allowed observations of barotrauma pathways in vivo. High speed video recordings show the expansion of the swim bladder and subsequent release of gas through the mouth and gills, and into the body cavity when the swim bladder ruptured. Post-decompression photographs show that many internal injuries were visible and included hemorrhaging and the presence of emphysema within the body cavity and tissues. These observations provide new opportunities to understand the pathways and effects of barotrauma.","Wiley","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this study an autonomous sensor device (Sensor Fish) was used to study a Francis turbine retrofitted with a modular guide vane. The median nadir pressures measured were 74.7, 66.6, and 56.6 kPaA for 90-, 190-, and 380-kW operating conditions respectively. These nadir pressures were compared to other Francis turbines studied using Sensor Fish and were found to be within the same range. The proportion of Sensor Fish releases with severe acceleration events (acceleration = 95G) was also investigated. The proportion ranged from 73 to 80% (runner region), 50 to 64% (guide vane region), and 9 to 28% (draft tube region), which was within the range of the other turbines used for comparison. The Sensor Fish testing that was conducted at Hurley Dam demonstrates that the modular guide vane that was retrofitted to the existing Francis turbine is potentially a suitable replacement that can provide biological performance similar to the guide vane used with other existing Francis turbines, but with the benefit of reduced fabrication costs.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In these FIO/V experiments, a smooth, rigid, single-cylinder on elastic end-supports is tested at Reynolds numbers ranging from 24,000 < Re < 120,000. The parameters of the tested current energy converter (CEC) are cubic stiffness and linear damping. Using the second generation of digital virtual spring-damping (Vck) controller developed by the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory (MRELab), the cubic modeling of the oscillator stiffness is tested. Experimental results show the influence of the parameter variation on the amplitude, frequency, energy conversion, energy efficiency, and power of the converter. All experiments are conducted in the low turbulence-free surface water (LTFSW) channel of the MRELab of the University of Michigan. The main conclusions are: (1) The nonlinearity in the cubic oscillator is an effective way to extend the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) upper branch, which results in higher harnessing power and efficiency compared to the linear stiffness cylinder converter. (2) Compared to the linear converter, the overall power increase is substantial. The nonlinear power optimum, occurring at the end of the VIV upper branch, is 63% higher than its linear counterpart. (3) The cubic stiffness converter with low harnessing damping achieves consistently good performance in all the VIV regions because of the hardening restoring force, especially at higher flow velocity.","MDPI AG","","Vortex Hydro Energy, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)","","United States","2020-06-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energies (Basel); Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 12","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 3283","","","EE0006780; YS2017YFGH000163; YQ2019E017","Journal ID: ISSN 1996-1073; ENERGA; PII: en13123283","10.3390/en13123283","","2021-08-10T00:00:00Z","1799245","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1799245","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1799245","Energies (Basel)","12","13"

The water tunnel test of this three-bladed, horizontal-axis rotor recorded power production, blade loading, the near-wake flow, cavitation effects, and noise generation. These state-of-the-art measurements demonstrate much of the complex physics associated with the flow through an unducted, horizontal-axis turbine, and they elucidate the performance characteristics and flow field effects at an unprecedented fidelity, accuracy and resolution. Measurements of powering coefficients (power, torque and thrust) as a function of tip-speed-ratio were performed. The dataset also includes unsteady measurements of driveshaft loading, blade strain, tower pressures, and radiated noise. Detailed flow mapping using laser Doppler velocimetry, and planar and stereo particle image velocimetry includes measurements of mean velocity and Reynolds stresses. Although the wake measurements are limited to less than half a diameter, they reveal the complex flow patterns in the near-wake structure of the rotor.

"A Channel Network Model for Sediment Dynamics Over Watershed Management Time Scales","Beveridge, Claire; Istanbulluoglu, Erkan; Bandaragoda, Christina; Pfeiffer, Allison M.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; watershed network model; bedload transport; suspended load transport","A mountain watershed network model is presented for use in decadal to centurial estimation of source-to-sink sediment dynamics. The model requires limited input parameters and can be effectively applied over spatial scales relevant to management of reservoirs, lakes, streams, and watersheds (1–100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). The model operates over a connected stream network of Strahler-ordered segments. The model is driven by streamflow from a physically based hydrology model and hillslope sediment supply from a stochastic mass wasting algorithm. For each daily time step, segment-scale sediment mass balance is computed using bedload and suspended load transport equations. Sediment transport is partitioned between grain size fractions for bedload as gravel and sand, and for suspended load as sand and mud. Bedload and suspended load can deposit and re-entrain at each segment. We demonstrated the model in the Elwha River Basin, upstream of the former Glines Canyon dam, over the dam's historic 84-year lifespan. The model predicted the lifetime reservoir sedimentation volume within the uncertainty range of the measured volume (13.7–18.5 million m<sup>3</sup>) for 25 of 28 model instances. Gravel, sand, and mud fraction volumes were predicted within measurement uncertainty ranges for 18 model instances. The network model improved the prediction of sediment yields compared to at-a-station sediment transport capacity relations. The network model also provided spatially and temporally distributed information that allowed for inquiry and understanding of the physical system beyond the sediment yields at the outlet.

"Challenges in the post-licensing stage of U.S. hydropower development: Current status and some potential solutions","Uria Martinez, Rocio; Johnson, Megan; Shan, Rui","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Hydropower; Licensing timeline; Attrition; Power purchase agreement","The issuance of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license is an important milestone in the development process of new U.S. hydropower projects. The complexity and uncertain timeline of the licensing process have been often cited as a key deterrent to new hydropower installations in the United States. However, very little attention has been paid to post-licensing timelines and attrition rates. This article explores the challenges faced by developers in bringing their FERC-licensed hydropower projects to the construction stage. Post-licensing activities to be completed before starting construction include obtaining additional permitting from other federal or state agencies, completing the technical design, securing financing, and in most cases, negotiating a power purchase agreement. For the set of projects that obtained a FERC license between 2007 and 2018, we assembled a dataset—combining information from FERC dockets and responses from a questionnaire to developers—to calculate attrition rates and development timelines and to examine the reasons for delays and cancellations.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Complementary relationship between small-hydropower and increasing penetration of solar photovoltaics: Evidence from CAISO","Shan, Rui; Sasthav, Colin M.; Wang, Xianxun; Lima, Luana M M","14 SOLAR ENERGY; 13 HYDRO ENERGY","To achieve the 100% green electricity goal, we need to understand the relationship between resources in the market and identify the flexible clean resources (i.e., hydropower) to integrate power from wind and photovoltaic (PV). This paper reveals a complementary relationship between small hydropower plants and solar PVs in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) based on the system-wide hourly generation data from 2013 to 2017. When the solar PV increases its portion in the generation mix by 1%, small hydro will increase its portion by 0.01–0.06%. Such response is obvious in the net demand peak hours, both morning and evening. The low operation cost, flexibility, and dispatchability of small hydro in CAISO explain this complementarity. Due to its benefit in emission and low Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), it is suggested to consider more small hydro projects to accommodate additional PV capacity for the 100% green electricity goal. Our estimation indicates that the current feasible potential of small hydro is sufficient, if the relation stays the same over years. If developers can mitigate the environmental impact, more technical potential will become feasible. Thus, small hydro could integrate more solar PV and reduce the demand for natural gas plants and batteries.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The DSP toolkit and its application are presented and described in the article “Evidence-based indicator approach to guide preliminary environmental impact assessments of hydropower development” [1]. Development of the DSP and the output for decision support centralize around 42 river function indicators describing the dimensionality of river ecosystems through six main categories: biota and biodiversity, water quality, hydrology, geomorphology, land cover, and river connectivity. Three main tools are represented in the DSP: A science-based questionnaire (SBQ), an environmental envelope model (EEM), and a river function linkage assessment tool (RFLAT). The SBQ is a structured survey-style questionnaire whose objective is to provide evidence of which indicators have been impacted by hydropower. Based on a global literature review, 140 questions were developed from general hypotheses regarding the impacts of dams on rivers. The EEM is a model to predict the likelihood of hydropower impacting indicators based on a several variables. The intended use of the EEM is for situations of new hydropower development where results of the SBQ are incomplete or highly uncertain. The EEM was developed through the compilation of a dataset containing attributes of dams, reservoirs, and geospatial information on environmental concerns, which was combined with data on ecological indicators documented at those sites through literature review. The model operates through 247 “envelopes” and weighting factors, representing the individual effect of each variable on each indicator, all available through spreadsheets. Finally, the RFLAT is a tool to examine causal relationships amongst indicators. Inter-indicator relationships were hypothesized based on literature review and summarized into node and edge datasets to represent the structure of a graphical network. Bayes theorem was used estimate conditional probabilities of inter-indicator relationships based on the output of the SBQ. Nodes and edges were imported into R programming environment to visualize ecological indicator networks. The datasets can be expanded upon and enriched with more detailed questions for the SBQ, building upon the EEM with to develop more sophisticated models, and identifying new relationships for the RFALT. Additionally, once the tools are applied to numerous hydropower developments, the output of the tools (e.g. evidence of impacted indicators) becomes a very useful dataset for meta-analyses of hydropower impacts.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This study aims to quantify the influence of phase information on the device power output of a virtual WEC array. We run the phase-resolving wave model FUNWAVE-TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) to generate directional waves at the PacWave South site offshore from Newport, Oregon, where future WECs are expected to be installed for testing. The two broad cases presented correspond to mean wave climates during warm months (March–August) and cold months (September–February). FUNWAVE-TVD time series of sea-surface elevation are then used in WEC-Sim, a time domain numerical model, to simulate the hydrodynamic response of each device in the array and estimate their power output. For comparison, WEC-Sim is also run with wave energy spectra calculated from the FUNWAVE-TVD simulations, which do not retain phase information, and with wave spectra computed using the phase-averaged model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). The use of spectral data in WEC-Sim requires a conversion from frequency to time domain by means of random superposition of wave components, which are not necessarily consistent because of the linear assumption implicit in this method. Thus, power response is characterized by multiple realizations of the wave climates.","MDPI","","Pacific Northwest National Lab. (PNNL), Richland, WA (United States); National Renewable Energy Lab.

In contrast, the novel crystal structure of the solvent-free compound <strong>3</strong> shows an exotic non-perovskite quasi-2D layered structure containing edge- and corner-shared AuCl<sub>6</sub> octahedra. The use of Au metal instead of Pb results in unprecedented low band gaps below 2.5 eV for single-layered metal chlorides and bromides. Moreover, at room temperature the three compounds show a weak blue emission due to the electronic transition between Au-6s and Au-5d, in agreement with the density function theory (DFT) calculation results. These findings are discussed in the context of viability of Au-based halides as alternatives for Pb-based halides for optoelectronic applications.","ChemPubSoc Europe","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Carbon supports form the primary porous structure of catalyst layers in which Pt particles are deposited and ionomer films are distributed. Unlike non-porous carbon supports, high surface area carbon support is unique in its relative humidity dependent Pt utilization and performance due to presence of Pt particles in the micropores interior of carbon particles. We model water uptake and Pt utilization in catalyst layers with high-surface-area carbon support. Interactions between functional groups on the carbon pore walls and water play a vital role in controlling water uptake from water vapor by catalyst layers. Ionomer is shown to influence proton access in micropores, even though it may not deposit into the micropores.","Electrochemical Society","","Raytheon Technologies Research Center, East Hartford, CT (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Transportation Office.

Previous research has recovered dead eels downstream of hydropower facilities and, for some fish, injuries were easily attributed to blade strike; however, others showed no external signs of injury suggesting that other stressors, such as rapid decompression may be a potential source of mortality. For this research, yellow– and silver-phase American eel were held and allowed to acclimate to 172 kPa (absolute pressure) in hyper/hypobaric hydro-chambers for about 1 d. After acclimation, the state of buoyancy was determined prior to exposure to a rapid decompression simulating pressures encountered during hydroturbine passage. Fish were then examined for signs of barotrauma. Eel did not attain a state of neutral buoyancy but rather maintained negative buoyancy suggesting that eels, and possibly other benthic species, likely maintain a state of negative buoyancy to facilitate occupancy on or near the substrate. Additionally, eel were found to be resilient to rapid decompression, displaying no instantaneous mortality and minimal injuries, suggesting that barotrauma is not likely a major concern for American eel passing downstream through hydroturbines.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper, we quantify net revenue and downstream flow impact trade-offs of a cascading series of 36 small-scale hydropower facilities under consideration for development in Northeast California. To do so, we develop a net-revenue-maximizing optimization model that determines hydropower operations while capturing key technical and river network constraints. We find that significantly constraining maximum discharges from each facility largely eliminates downstream flow impacts but negligibly changes the 36 facilities' combined operations and net revenues.

"Hydrodynamic and Structural Response Modeling of a Prototype Floating Membrane Reservoir System for Pumped Storage Hydropower","Hadjerioua, Boualem; Eldredge, Thomas; Medina, Hector; DeNeale, Scott T.","42 ENGINEERING; 13 HYDRO ENERGY","Hydrodynamic, computational fluid dynamics, and finite-element modeling were performed for a novel floating membrane reservoir system design for closed-loop pumped storage hydropower application. The conceptual design, which is now protected under an invention disclosure with a patent pending, offers a potential low-cost, low-impact solution to address the high costs, long investment return periods, and environmental disruptions encountered with traditional pumped storage development while offering modularity to enable replication at many locations. Prior to physical tests on a prototype, this paper documents the response analysis and modeling completed to simulate hydraulic and structural performance under different reservoir deployment and alignment arrangements, evaluate system stability, and refine the conceptual design. The results indicate that the excitation frequency from vortex shedding is at least an order of magnitude lower than the water sloshing frequencies in the reservoir, the structural natural frequency of the entire reservoir, and the vibrational frequencies of the side membranes, although excitation frequencies from other sources could cause mechanical resonance under certain conditions. To control destabilizing effects and prevent rocking motion and vibration, the authors conclude that the design could be improved by including a support structure around the floating reservoir, which could also provide floating-membrane containment, improve safety, and facilitate vertical reservoir movement. These conclusions, based on hydrodynamic and structural response modeling, help define specifications for upcoming full-scale prototype construction, deployment, and testing. This study demonstrates standard modeling technique application to an innovative design for which similar applications have not been previously evaluated. As a result, the refined design is capable of improving the scalability and feasibility of pumped storage hydropower in the United States and will be considered for commercialization following prototype testing.","ASCE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The steps taken to address stakeholder concerns through impact hypotheses and field studies are not always transparent. We have designed a Checklist of River Function Indicators to facilitate stakeholder discussions during hydropower licensing and to support more transparent, holistic, and scientifically informed hydropower environmental analyses. Based on a database of environmental metrics collected from hydropower project studies documented by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the International Hydropower Association, the Low Impact Hydropower Institute, and peer-reviewed scientific literature, our proposed Checklist of River Function Indicators contains 51 indicators in six categories. We have tested the usefulness of the Indicators by applying them to seven hydropower projects documented by FERC. Among the case study projects, 44 of the 51 Indicators were assessed according to the FERC documentation. Although each hydropower project presents unique natural resource issues and stakeholder priorities, the proposed Indicators can provide a transparent starting point for stakeholder discussions about which ecological impacts should be considered in hydropower planning and relicensing assessments.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Ruby; Voisin, Nathalie; Payn, Rob","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 58 GEOSCIENCES; global; reservoir geometry; storage‐area‐depth profile; Earth system models","Reservoir storage-area-depth relationships are the most important factors controlling thermal stratification in reservoirs and, more broadly, the water, energy and biogeochemical dynamics in the reservoirs and subsequently their impacts on downstream rivers. However, most land surface or earth system models do not account for the gradual changes of reservoir surface area and storage with the changing depth, inhibiting a consistent and accurate representation of mass, energy and biogeochemical balances in reservoirs. Here we present a physically coherent parameterization of reservoir storage-area-depth dataset at the global scale. For each reservoir, the storage-area-depth relationships were derived from an optimal geometric shape selected iteratively from five possible regular geometric shapes that minimizes the error of total storage and surface area estimation. We applied this algorithm to 6,800 reservoirs included in the Global Reservoir and Dam database (GRanD). The relative error between the estimated and observed total storage is no more than 5% and 50% for 66% and 99% of all GRanD reservoirs, respectively. More importantly, the storage-depth profiles derived from the approximated reservoir geometry compared well with remote sensing based estimation at 40 major reservoirs from previous studies, and ground-truth measurements for 34 reservoirs in the United States and China. Furthermore, the new global reservoir storage-area-depth dataset is critical for advancing future modeling and understanding of reservoir processes and subsequent effects on the terrestrial hydrological, ecological and biogeochemical cycles at the regional and global scales.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In terrestrial and aquatic systems, barriers to movement can modify population and community dynamics at local or regional scales. This research contrasted life history traits related to lifespan with habitat fragmentation to determine impacts on species population genetic structure in the Neuse River Basin, USA. For this, we simulated gene flow among evenly-spaced populations in a river network and tracked individual and population genetics for 200 years. The modeled scenarios represent a full cross between five life history strategies and four riverscapes representing varying degrees of fragmentation. The five life history strategies include species (based on freshwater mussels) with average lifespans ranging from 10 to 50 years and age at maturity from 2 to 6 years. The movement landscapes included a (1) panmictic, (2) stepping-stone landscape allowing movement to only neighboring populations during each dispersal event, (3) partially-fragmented landscape divided by dams currently in the network, and (4) fully-fragmented landscape. Results suggest species with shorter lifespans have higher population genetic structure in fragmented landscapes than species with longer lifespans. Additionally, species with shorter lifespans in highly fragmented landscapes may be harboring genetic degradation or decline as allele fixation and loss. Although anthropogenic fragmentation of many river systems is only 100–200 years old, the simulation indicates that species can respond genetically in that period of time. Moreover, the time frame of the simulation suggests that genetic impacts of habitat fragmentation in some species present in the Neuse River Basin may not yet be manifesting and restoration activities could be successful.","Springer","","Hydro Research Foundation, Evergreen, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"An Ensemble Optimization Framework for Coupled Design of Hydropower Contracts and Real-Time Reservoir Operating Rules","Sahu, Reetik Kumar; McLaughlin, Dennis B.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY","Often, revenues from hydropower generation depend on the operator's ability to provide firm power in the presence of uncertain inflows. The primary options available for optimizing revenue are negotiation of a firm power contract before operations begin and adjustment of the reservoir release during operations. Contract and release strategy optimization are closely coupled and most appropriately analyzed with stochastic real-time control methods. Here we use an ensemble-based approach to stochastic optimization that provides a convenient way to construct nonparametric revenue probability distributions to explore the implications of uncertainty. The firm power contract is a simplified bilateral fixed price agreement that partially insulates operator and buyer from price fluctuations. The release control laws and firm energy target are jointly optimized to maximize the operator's expected revenue. Revenue probability distributions and related spill performance statistics indicate that predictive operating strategies such as stochastic dynamic programming and model predictive control can give significantly better performance than standard deterministic operating rules. The performance obtained from batch optimization with perfect inflow information establishes a convenient upper bound on potential revenue and provides a baseline for assessing the significance of differences between real-time operating strategies. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the benefits of predictive operational strategies are greatest for reservoirs with medium nondimensional residence times and less important for reservoirs with large residence times. Overall, probabilistic analysis of the coupled hydropower contract-operations problem provides a realistic way to assess revenue and risk for reservoirs that must provide firm power when inflows are uncertain.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Their performance as proton conductors depends critically on the properties of acceptor dopants. Here, we use first-principles calculations to study the role of acceptors and point defects in incorporating protons through an oxygen-vacancy-mediated process. For CaZrO<sub>3</sub>, we find that Zr<sub>Ca</sub> antisites suppress formation of oxygen vacancies. Other intrinsic point defects are shown not to hinder performance. Common unintentional impurities, such as C and N, are not good acceptors but can incorporate in other configurations. Our results show that the effectiveness of common dopants such as Sc and Y is limited by self-compensation due to their incorporation on the ""wrong"" cation site, where they act as donors. We demonstrate that using alkali metal dopants overcomes this problem, as the formation energy of compensating donors is very high. Alkali metal dopants also have low binding energies for protons, reducing their tendency to act as traps and hence enhancing proton conductivity. As a result, our guidelines for choosing acceptor dopants and optimizing synthesis conditions can greatly improve the efficacy of these proton-conducting oxides as solid-state electrolytes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States); Univ. of California, Santa Barbara, CA (United States).

"Overlooked trade-offs of environmentally protective hydropower operation: Impacts to ancillary services and greenhouse gas emissions","Rand, Joseph","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Hydropower; Relicensing; Environmental constraints; Electricity markets; Ancillary services; Greenhouse gas; Cost-benefit analysis","The relicensing of large hydropower projects in the United States often enforces environmental constraints such as minimum instream flows. These requirements can reduce hydropower's negative environmental impacts but may come at a cost of reduced electric generation and revenue. During the federal hydropower relicensing process, participants negotiate these environmental and economic trade-offs based on coarse models, often conflating impacts on generation and revenue, overlooking ancillary services (AS) markets, and ignoring potential greenhouse gas (GHG) implications. Using a case study of a 362-MW hydropower project in California, this research conducts higher resolution modelling to compare energy generation, AS provision, revenue, and GHG impacts of two hydropower operating regimes. The environmentally protective regime reduces average generation by 6% but increases AS provision by 2%. Total average revenue decreases by 3.5% under environmental constraints using current electricity prices (and by only 1.1% when modelled with projected 2030 electricity prices), indicating that generation impacts should not be equated with revenue impacts during relicensing. In the California electricity market, this reduced hydropower generation is replaced primarily by natural gas, resulting in an estimated 30,000 additional tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted annually. Furthermore, these positive and negative externalities are not adequately examined in the hydropower relicensing process.","Wiley","","Hydropower Foundation, Littleton, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Non-stationary hydropower generation projections constrained by environmental and electricity grid operations over the western United States","Zhou, Tian (ORCID:0000000315824005); Voisin, Nathalie; Fu, Tao","13 HYDRO ENERGY","In the western United States, 27% of electricity demand is met by hydropower, so power system planners have a key interest in predicting hydropower availability under changing climate conditions. Large-scale projections of hydropower generation are often simplified based on regression relationships with runoff and they are not always ready to inform power system models due to the coarse time scale (annual) or limited number of represented power plants. We developed an enhanced process-based hydropower model to predict future hydropower generation by addressing the commonly under-represented constraints, including (1) the ecological spills, (2) penstock constraints to provide flexibility in electricity operations, and (3) biases in hydro-meteorological simulations. We evaluated the model over the western United States under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and ten downscaled global circulation models. At the annual time scale, potential hydropower generation is not projected to change substantially, except in California. At the seasonal time scale, systematic shifting of the generation patterns can be observed in snowmelt-dominated regions. These projected annual and regional trends are comparable to other regression-based relationships. However, the representation of more complex operations and constraints tend to reduce the uncertainties inherent to climate projections at seasonal scale. In the Pacific Northwest region where hydropower is the dominant electricity source, our predicted future change of hydropower generation is about 10% less than the regression-based projections in spring and summer. The model can also capture the seasonal non-stationary in hydrologic changes. The spatio and temporal scales of the model, increased accuracy and quantification of uncertainty allow one to use the products to inform power system models toward supporting energy sector planning activities and water-energy trade-offs.","IOP Publishing","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To address this need, we conducted a literature review to extract and analyze a swath of environmental metrics related to previous hydropower projects. Our examination of several U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing documents, several certification documents prepared by the Low Impact Hydropower Institute and the International Hydropower Association, and a set of peer-reviewed journal articles led to creation of a database of > 3000 current environmental metrics related to hydropower projects in 231 locations worldwide. Information recorded for each environmental metric was used to map the comprehensiveness and consistency of environmental measurements gathered across primary categories, dam life cycle stages, spatial scales and locations. We found that a majority of environmental metrics were related to water quantity and water quality, a large number of metrics were related to biota and biodiversity, and relatively few metrics were related to the categories of geomorphology, land cover, connectivity and fragmentation, and infrastructure and design. However, the categories of environmental metrics represented in each type of literature varied significantly. Forty-five subcategories of environmental metrics emerged from our analysis, thereby suggesting a potential envelope of environmental measurements that might be used to improve efficiency in evaluating the potential environmental effects of new U.S. hydropower projects.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, we propose a framework combining technical and economic indicators to analyze primary frequency control (PFC) on a timescale of seconds. We develop a model integrating hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical subsystems to characterize efficiency loss, wear and fatigue, regulation mileage, and frequency quality. We evaluate burden relief strategies under three idealized remuneration schemes for PFC, inspired by those used in Sweden, the USA, and China, respectively. We show how burden and compensation vary under future scenarios of renewable power systems.

"Numerical investigation of vorticity and bubble clustering in an air entraining hydraulic jump","Witt, Adam; Gulliver, John S.; Shen, Lian","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 42 ENGINEERING; air entrainment; bubble cluster; hydraulic jump; multiphase simulations; shear layer; vortices","In this paper, a high resolution computational fluid dynamics model is used to simulate a steady air entraining laboratory scale hydraulic jump. A detailed examination of shear layer instabilities reveals the dynamic relationship between spanwise vortices, free surface fluctuations, and air–water spatial patterns. Spanwise vortices generated at the toe roll-up under a variable depth roller, creating large free surface fluctuations through high velocity water ejections in the roller. The mean shear layer elevation and free surface elevations periodically alternate between positive and negative correlation throughout the roller, driven by dynamic vortex transport. Vortices descending towards the lower wall create an upwelling of non-bubbly fluid into the shear layer that contributes to regions of decreased bubble concentration between vortices. The position of a strong shear layer at the location of maximum air entrainment, directly above the jump toe, leads to highly aerated vortices that influence bubble behavior. Bubbles breakup quickly after entrainment at the toe and bubble clusters are observed most frequently below and at the end of the roller where bubble breakup and energy dissipation are diminished. Finally, the dominant separation angle of clustered bubbles is independent of downstream distance and aligns closely with the direction of initial shear, suggesting bubble clustering is a remnant of bubble breakup.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"How a large project was halted by the lack of a social Licence to operate: Testing the applicability of the Thomson and Boutilier model","Jijelava, David; Vanclay, Frank","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; LICENSES; PERFORMANCE; SOCIAL IMPACT","Highlights: • The lack of a Social Licence to Operate (SLO) can halt a project. • Resettlement is a significant issue in getting a Social Licence to Operate. • Legitimacy, credibility and trust are key concepts of Social Licence to Operate. • Project proponents can and should utilise the concept of Social Licence to Operate. • Earning a SLO requires considered effort and commitment from project proponents. - Abstract: We explore why having a Social Licence to Operate (SLO) is essential for large projects. We analyse the Khudoni Hydroelectric Power Plant in the Svaneti region of Georgia, which was halted in 2013 after much social protest. We assess why the project lacked a SLO and what lessons can be learnt from this experience. Using the Thomson and Boutilier model of SLO as our analytical framework, we elaborate its key elements – legitimacy, credibility and trust – in the context of dam and hydropower projects and assess where the Khudoni project failed. We conclude that the project lacked legitimacy, with local communities not seeing any social justification for the project. The credibility of the project and proponent was weak amongst the local population, and trust was absent at all phases of the project. We conclude that the concept of social licence to operate has the potential to encourage project proponents to consider and implement activities which will lead to better outcomes for all parties. We believe there is a strong business case for companies to take the concept seriously. Improving social performance will assist projects in gaining a social licence to operate and grow.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2018.07.001","","","","United States","2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 73; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 31-40","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195925518300581; TRN: US19W4086071160","10.1016/J.EIAR.2018.07.001","","2020-11-04T00:00:00Z","22826059","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22826059","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","73"

However, there are institutional challenges to wider adoption of off-grid solutions. Combining a multi-level perspective with project funding data from the Kenyan and Tanzanian energy sectors, we assess the extent to which these new off-grid technologies have been incorporated into the existing energy regimes in both countries. Using a qualitative assessment of academic literature and official documents, and a quantitative assessment of energy investments, we find that although international development agencies have provided financial support for niche, off-grid companies, both global donors and the regime electricity sector operators in Kenya and Tanzania continue to favor on-grid and grid extension activities. While landscape influences on both countries are similar, we find that differences within the institutional regimes result in different development pathways for off-grid niches. In Kenya, unbundling and privatization efforts have attracted private investment in both on- and off-grid projects. Finally, Tanzania has more relaxed regulations for off-grid power producers, and a clearer regulatory framework for allowing off-grid operators to impose cost-reflective tariffs, which creates a supportive environment for niche innovation.","Elsevier","","Hydropower Foundation, Littleton, CO (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

However, in practice, realizing all the potential hydropower resource is limited by various factors, including environmental effects and related mitigation requirements. That is why hydropower regulatory requirements frequently call for targets to be met regarding fish injury and mortality rates. Hydropower Biological Evaluation Toolset (HBET), an integrated suite of software tools, is designed to characterize hydraulic conditions of hydropower structures and provide quantitative estimates of fish injury and mortality rates due to various physical stressors including strike, pressure, and shear. HBET enables users to design new studies, analyze data, perform statistical analyses, and evaluate biological responses. In this paper, we discuss the features of the HBET software and describe a case study that illustrates its functionalities.

"Modeling underwater noise propagation from marine hydrokinetic power devices through a time-domain, velocity-pressure solution","Hafla, Erin; Johnson, Erick; Johnson, C. Nathan; Preston, Leiph; Aldridge, David; Roberts, Jesse D.","13 HYDRO ENERGY","Marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices generate electricity from the motion of tidal and ocean currents, as well as ocean waves, to provide an additional source of renewable energy available to the United States. These devices are a source of anthropogenic noise in the marine ecosystem and must meet regulatory guidelines that mandate a maximum amount of noise that may be generated. In the absence of measured levels from <i>in situ</i> deployments, a model for predicting the propagation of sound from an array of MHK sources in a real environment is essential. A set of coupled, linearized velocity-pressure equations in the time-domain are derived and presented in this paper, which are an alternative solution to the Helmholtz and wave equation methods traditionally employed. Discretizing these equations on a three-dimensional (3D), finite-difference grid ultimately permits a finite number of complex sources and spatially varying sound speeds, bathymetry, and bed composition. The solution to this system of equations has been parallelized in an acoustic-wave propagation package developed at Sandia National Labs, called Paracousti. This work presents the broadband sound pressure levels from a single source in two-dimensional (2D) ideal and Pekeris wave-guides and in a 3D domain with a sloping boundary. Furthermore, the paper concludes with demonstration of Paracousti for an array of MHK sources in a simple wave-guide.","Acoustical Society of America","","Sandia National Lab.

"Rapid high density cryogenic pressure vessel filling to 345 bar with a liquid hydrogen pump","Petitpas, Guillaume; Moreno-Blanco, Julio; Espinosa-Loza, Francisco; Aceves, Salvador M.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 08 HYDROGEN; Cryo-compressed; Liquid hydrogen; Liquid pump; High-density","Cryogenic pressurized hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) vessels promise maximum storage density with potential to enabling practical H<sub>2</sub> vehicles with maximum driving autonomy and minimum cost of ownership. This paper adds a more complete evaluation of the benefits of cryogenic vessel technology by establishing a methodology for evaluating fill density for any initial vessel thermodynamic state. This is accomplished by assessing 24 cryogenic pressure vessel fill experiments with a liquid hydrogen (LH<sub>2</sub>) pump manufactured by Linde and installed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, CA) campus. The LH<sub>2</sub> piston pump takes LH<sub>2</sub> from the station Dewar at near ambient pressure (3 bar) and very low temperature (24.6 K) and pressurizes it to the vessel pressure in two stages of compression, up to 875 bar, although the rating of the cryogenic vessel used for these experiments limits fill pressure to 345 bar. Experiments spanned initial vessel temperatures from ambient to 22 K, enabling pump testing over a broad range of conditions. Experimental results validate many of the virtues that make LH<sub>2</sub> pumping a promising technology for H<sub>2</sub> dispensing, both for filling cryogenic as well as ambient temperature vessels: high throughput (1.67 kg/min, 100 kg/h), unlimited capacity for back to back refueling, low electricity consumption at the station due to high density of LH<sub>2</sub> minimizing compression work, and highest fill density, up to 80 g/L (estimated) when dispensing cryogenic hydrogen at 700 + bar. Analysis of the experiments shows that fill density can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (±0.7 g/L) by assuming 10 kJ/kg K cryogenic vessel inlet entropy (pump delivery hose outlet entropy). Fill lines are finally generated on a H<sub>2</sub> phase diagram, producing charts that can be used for rapidly determining fill density for any vessel condition at the moment of fill initiation.","Elsevier","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

"Persistent and transient cost efficiency—an application to the Swiss hydropower sector","Filippini, Massimo; Geissmann, Thomas; Greene, William H.","32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING, POLICY, AND ECONOMY; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; Efficiency measurement; Stochastic frontier analysis; Persistent and transient cost efficiency; Hydropower","Electricity prices on the European market have decreased significantly over the past few years, resulting in a deterioration of Swiss hydropower firms’ competitiveness and profitability. One option to improve the sector’s competitiveness is to increase cost efficiency. The goal of this study is to quantify the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency of individual firms by applying the generalized true random effects (GTRE) model introduced by Colombi et al. (Journal of Productivity Analysis 42(2): 123–136, 2014) and Filippini and Greene (Journal of Productivity Analysis 45(2): 187–196, 2016). Applying this newly developed GTRE model to a total cost function, the level of cost efficiency of 65 Swiss hydropower firms is analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2013. A true random effects specification is estimated as a benchmark for the transient level of cost efficiency. The results show the presence of both transient as well as persistent cost inefficiencies. The GTREM predicts the aggregate level of cost inefficiency to amount to 21.8% (8.0% transient, 13.8% persistent) on average between 2000 and 2013. These two components differ in interpretation and implication. From an individual firm’s perspective, the two types of cost inefficiencies might require a firm’s management to respond with different improvement strategies. The existing level of persistent inefficiency could prevent the hydropower firms from adjusting their production processes to new market environments. From a regulatory point of view, the results of this study could be used in the scope and determination of the amount of financial support given to struggling firms.","Springer","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

This paper demonstrates a co-simulation based on AS-PSH units between penstock hydrodynamics and power system events in a real-time environment. Co-simulation provides an accurate insight into the dynamic and transient operation of AS-PSH connected to a bulk power system network. The two modes of operation of AS-PSH presented in this paper are turbine and pump modes. A general philosophy of operating in turbine mode is prevalent in the field when the prices of electricity are high and in the pumping mode when prices are low.

Here we explore the possible consequences of these impacts for the electricity supply sector at the global scale. Regional hydropower projections are developed by forcing a coupled global hydrological and dam model with downscaled, bias-corrected climate realizations. Consequent impacts on power sector composition and associated emissions and investment costs are explored using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We find that climate-driven changes in hydropower generation may shift power demands onto and away from carbon intensive technologies. This then causes significantly altered power sector CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in several hydro-dependent regions, although the net global impact is modest. For drying regions, we estimate a global, cumulative investment need of approximately one trillion dollars (±$500 billion) this century to make up for deteriorated hydropower generation caused by climate change. Total investments avoided are of a similar magnitude across regions projected to experience increased precipitation. Investment risks and opportunities are concentrated in hydro-dependent countries for which significant climate change is expected. Various countries throughout the Balkans, Latin America and Southern Africa are most vulnerable, whilst Norway, Canada, and Bhutan emerge as clear beneficiaries.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The need for high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality models within optimization schemes is driven by improved computational capabilities, increased requirements to meet specific points of compliance with greater resolution, and the need to optimize operations of not just single reservoirs but systems of reservoirs. This study describes an important advancement for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. The predictive power of the high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 is successfully emulated by an artificial neural network, then integrated into a genetic algorithm optimization approach to maximize hydropower generation subject to constraints on dam operations and water quality. This methodology is applied to a multipurpose reservoir near Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The model successfully reproduced high-fidelity reservoir information while enabling 6.8% and 6.6% increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations for dissolved oxygen (DO) limits of 5 and 6 mg/L, respectively, while witnessing an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO constraints. Exploration of simultaneous temperature and DO constraints revealed capability to address multiple water quality constraints at specified locations. Here, the reduced computational requirements of the new modeling approach demonstrated an ability to provide decision support for reservoir operations scheduling while maintaining high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality information as part of the optimization decision support routines.","American Geophysical Union (AGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

This article provides a systematic review of the impacts from policy, climate change and Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus on hydropower development at global scale. Asia, Africa and Latin America are hotspots promoting hydropower development with capacity expansion, while Europe and North America focus on performance improvement and environment impacts mitigation. Climate change is projected to improve gross hydropower potential (GHP) at high latitude of North Hemisphere and tropical Africa and decrease that in the US, South Africa and south and central Europe. Analysis from W-E-F nexus highlights the importance of integrated approaches as well as cross-sectoral coordination so as to improve resources use efficiency and achieve sustainable hydropower development. In conclusion, these three factors together shape the future of hydropower and need to be considered for planning and operation purpose.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Potential for natural evaporation as a reliable renewable energy resource","Cavusoglu, Ahmet-Hamdi; Chen, Xi; Gentine, Pierre; Sahin, Ozgur","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Renewable energy; Devices for energy harvesting; Hydrology","About 50% of the solar energy absorbed at the Earth’s surface drives evaporation, fueling the water cycle that affects various renewable energy resources, such as wind and hydropower. Recent advances demonstrate our nascent ability to convert evaporation energy into work, yet there is little understanding about the potential of this resource. Here in this paper we study the energy available from natural evaporation to predict the potential of this ubiquitous resource. We find that natural evaporation from open water surfaces could provide power densities comparable to current wind and solar technologies while cutting evaporative water losses by nearly half. We estimate up to 325 GW of power is potentially available in the United States. Strikingly, water’s large heat capacity is sufficient to control power output by storing excess energy when demand is low, thus reducing intermittency and improving reliability. Our findings motivate the improvement of materials and devices that convert energy from evaporation.","Nature Publishing Group","","Columbia Univ., New York, NY (United States)","USDOE; National Science Foundation (NSF)","","United States","2017-09-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Nature Communications; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 1","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 617","","","SC0007999; SC0014203","Journal ID: ISSN 2041-1723; PII: 581","10.1038/s41467-017-00581-w","","2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","1425942","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1425942","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1425942","Nature Communications","1","8"

For each testing mode and candidate controller, performance metrics quantifying energy capture (ability of a controller to maximize power), variation in torque and rotation rate (related to drive train fatigue), and variation in thrust loads (related to structural fatigue) are quantified for two purposes. First, for metrics that could be evaluated across all testing modes, we considered the accuracy with which simulation or laboratory experiments could predict performance at full scale. Second, we explored the utility of these metrics to contrast candidate controller performance. For these turbines and set of candidate controllers, energy capture was found to only differentiate controller performance in simulation, while the other explored metrics were able to predict performance of the full-scale turbine in the field with various degrees of success. Finally, effects of scale between laboratory and full-scale testing are considered, along with recommendations for future improvements to dynamic simulations and controller evaluation.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA (United States); Ocean Renewable Power Company, Portland, ME (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Added-mass effects on a horizontal-axis tidal turbine using FAST v8","Murray, Robynne E.; Thresher, Robert; Jonkman, Jason","13 HYDRO ENERGY; marine and hydrokinetic turbine; natural frequency; added mass; turbulence; design tool; FAST","Added mass on tidal turbine blades has the potential to alter the blade dynamic response, such as natural frequencies and vibration amplitudes, as a response to blade acceleration. Currently, most aeroelastic design tools do not consider such effects as they are complex and expensive to model, and they are not an intrinsic part of most blade-element momentum theory codes, which are commonly used in the tidal energy industry. This article outlines the addition of added-mass effects to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's design tool FAST v8. A verification is presented for a spring-mass system with an initial displacement, and a case study is performed for the Reference Model 1 20-m-diameter tidal turbine. For the 20-m-diameter turbine, it was shown that the natural frequency of vibration is reduced by 65% when added mass is considered. Further, the thrust loads are increased by 2.5% when the blades are excited by a 5% step increase in inflow velocity when added mass is considered. This decrease can have a significant impact on the overall turbine design, as it is important to design the blades with a natural frequency so that they are not excited by the rotor speed and its harmonics, wherein aerodynamic excitation can lead to fatigue damage. However, it was shown that when turbulent inflow with an intensity of 20% was modeled, there was almost no impact on the loads and blade displacement with added-mass effects except for a small difference in the fatigue response of the blade to turbulent load fluctuations.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The model turbine is based on the U.S. Department of Energy Reference Model 1 (RM1), with the blade geometry modified to reproduce the design <em>C<sub>p</sub></em>–TSR performance curve of the RM1 at the flume scale Reynolds numbers (5 × 10<sup>4</sup>–10 × 10<sup>5</sup>). The performance and wake structure of a 45:1 scale turbine were measured using a load cell (torque applied on shaft) and a magnetic angular encoder (rotor rpm), and by planar particle image velocimetry, respectively. The details of the rotor flow field and three-dimensional wake evolution are analyzed from the numerical solution of the RANS equations solved around a computational model of the turbine. The comparison of experimental and numerical results highlights the strengths and limitations of the experimental and numerical analyses in the characterization of HAHT. Useful guidelines for developing experimental flume scale data and using them for validating numerical tools, as well as for performing a similar type of analysis and design validation of full scale devices as pilot projects start to go in the water in the United States, are provided.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Oregon State Univ., Corvallis, Oregon (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2017-08-21T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 4","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 044504","","","FG36-08GO18179; EE0003283","Journal ID: ISSN 1941-7012","10.1063/1.4999600","","2018-10-05T00:00:00Z","1474283","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1474283","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1474283","Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy","4","9"
"Development and Implementation of an Optimization Model for Hydropower and Total Dissolved Gas in the Mid-Columbia River System","Witt, Adam; Magee, Timothy; Stewart, Kevin; Hadjerioua, Boualem; Neumann, David; Zagona, Edith; Politano, Marcela","13 HYDRO ENERGY; air entrainment; goal programming; hydropower; system optimization; successive linear programming; total dissolved gas","Managing energy, water, and environmental priorities and constraints within a cascade hydropower system is a challenging multiobjective optimization effort that requires advanced modeling and forecasting tools. Within the mid-Columbia River system, there is currently a lack of specific solutions for predicting how coordinated operational decisions can mitigate the impacts of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation while satisfying multiple additional policy and hydropower generation objectives. In this study, a reduced-order TDG uptake equation is developed that predicts tailrace TDG at seven hydropower facilities on the mid-Columbia River. The equation is incorporated into a general multiobjective river, reservoir, and hydropower optimization tool as a prioritized operating goal within a broader set of system-level objectives and constraints. A test case is presented to assess the response of TDG and hydropower generation when TDG supersaturation is optimized to remain under state water-quality standards. Satisfaction of TDG as an operating goal is highly dependent on whether constraints that limit TDG uptake are implemented at a higher priority than generation requests. According to the model, an opportunity exists to reduce TDG supersaturation and meet hydropower generation requirements by shifting spillway flows to different time periods. In conclusion, a coordinated effort between all project owners is required to implement systemwide optimized solutions that satisfy the operating policies of all stakeholders.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Hydroacoustic Assessment of Behavioral Responses by Fish Passing Near an Operating Tidal Turbine in the East River, New York","Bevelhimer, Mark; Scherelis, Constantin C.; Colby, Jonathan; Adonizio, Mary Ann","13 HYDRO ENERGY","An important environmental issue facing the marine and hydrokinetic energy industry is whether fish that encounter underwater energy devices are likely to be struck and injured by moving components, primarily rotating turbine blades. The automated analysis of nearly 3 weeks of multibeam hydroacoustics data identified about 35,000 tracks of fish passing a tidal turbine in the East River, New York. These tracks included both individual fish and schools during periods with the turbine absent, the turbine present and operating, and the turbine present but not operating. The density of fish in the sampled area when the turbine was absent was roughly twice the density observed when the turbine was in place, particularly when the turbine was operating. This suggests that some avoidance occurred before fish were close enough to the turbine to be observed by the hydroacoustics system. Various measures of swimming behavior (direction, velocity, and linearity) were calculated for each track and evaluated for indication of behavioral responses to turbine presence and operation. Fish tracks were grouped based on tidal cycle, current velocity, and swimming direction and were evaluated with respect to turbine presence and operation and with respect to distance from the turbine. Nonparametric tests (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and multivariate analysis (canonical discriminant analysis) found significant differences among groups with respect to turbine presence and operation, suggesting that some fish responded to the turbine by adjusting swimming behavior, such as making small adjustments to swimming direction and velocity as they passed near the turbine. We found no evidence that fish were being struck by rotating blades, but there did appear to be large-scale avoidance initiated out of the range of the hydroacoustics detection system. Furthermore, more study is needed to determine whether such avoidance behavior has significant ramifications for normal fish movement patterns, bioenergetics, seasonal migrations, and predator exposure.","Taylor & Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Regional water consumption for hydro and thermal electricity generation in the United States","Lee, Uisung; Han, Jeongwoo; Elgowainy, Amgad; Wang, Michael","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 32 ENERGY CONSERVATION, CONSUMPTION, AND UTILIZATION; water consumption factor; hydropower; thermoelectricity; life-cycle analysis; allocation; regional analysis","Water is an essential resource for most electric power generation technologies. Thermal power plants typically require a large amount of cooling water whose evaporation is regarded to be consumed. Hydropower plants result in evaporative water loss from the large surface areas of the storing reservoirs. This paper estimated the regional water consumption factors (WCFs) for thermal and hydro electricity generation in the United States, because the WCFs of these power plants vary by region and water supply and demand balance are of concern in many regions. For hydropower, total WCFs were calculated using a reservoir’s surface area, state-level water evaporation, and background evapotranspiration. Then, for a multipurpose reservoir, a fraction of its WCF was allocated to hydropower generation based on the share of the economic valuation of hydroelectricity among benefits from all purposes of the reservoir. For thermal power plants, the variations in WCFs by type of cooling technology, prime mover technology, and by region were addressed. The results show that WCFs for electricity generation vary significantly by region. Finally, the generation-weighted average WCFs of thermoelectricity and hydropower are 1.25 (range of 0.18–2.0) and 16.8 (range of 0.67–1194) L/kWh, respectively, and the generation-weighted average WCF by the U.S. generation mix in 2015 is estimated at 2.18 L/kWh.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed fueling protocol J2601 for light-duty HFCEVs to ensure safe vehicle fills while maximizing fueling performance. This study employs a physical model that simulates and compares the fueling performance of two fueling methods, known as the “lookup table” method and the “MC formula” method, within the SAE J2601 protocol. Both the fueling methods provide fast fueling of HFCEVs within minutes, but the MC formula method takes advantage of active measurement of precooling temperature to dynamically control the fueling process, and thereby provides faster vehicle fills. Here, the MC formula method greatly reduces fueling time compared to the lookup table method at higher ambient temperatures, as well as when the precooling temperature falls on the colder side of the expected temperature window for all station types. Although the SAE J2601 lookup table method is the currently implemented standard for refueling hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the MC formula method provides significant fueling time advantages in certain conditions; these warrant its implementation in future hydrogen refueling stations for better customer satisfaction with fueling experience of HFCEVs.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This study considers the system identification and model validation process based on data collected from a wave tank test of a model-scale wave energy converter. Experimental design and data processing techniques based on general system identification procedures are discussed and compared with the practices often followed for wave tank testing. The general system identification processes are shown to have a number of advantages. The experimental data is then used to produce multiple models for the dynamics of the device. These models are validated and their performance is compared against one and other. Furthermore, while most models of wave energy converters use a formulation with wave elevation as an input, this study shows that a model using a hull pressure sensor to incorporate the wave excitation phenomenon has better accuracy.","MDPI AG","","Sandia National Lab.

D.; Ng, Jia Yi; Galelli, Stefano","13 HYDRO ENERGY; hydropower; climate change; water resources; dams; global; water-energy nexus","Here, an important and plausible impact of a changing global climate is altered power generation from hydroelectric dams. Here we project 21st century global hydropower production by forcing a coupled, global hydrological and dam model with three General Circulation Model (GCM) projections run under two emissions scenarios. Dams are simulated using a detailed model that accounts for plant specifications, storage dynamics, reservoir bathymetry and realistic, optimized operations. We show that the inclusion of these features can have a non-trivial effect on the simulated response of hydropower production to changes in climate. Simulation results highlight substantial uncertainty in the direction of change in globally aggregated hydropower production (~–5 to + 5% change in mean global production by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario, depending on GCM). Several clearly impacted hotspots are identified, the most prominent of which encompasses the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. In this region, hydropower production is projected to be reduced by approximately 40% on average by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. After accounting for each country's dependence on hydropower for meeting its current electricity demands, the Balkans countries emerge as the most vulnerable (~ 5–20% loss in total national electricity generation depending on country). On the flipside, a handful of countries in Scandinavia and central Asia are projected to reap a significant increase in total electrical production (~ 5–15%) without investing in new power generation facilities.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In a hydrologic process such as evaporation, the water content will ultimately be reduced below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation determined from experiments. This is problematic since the derived closure relationships cannot predict the associated capillary pressures for these states. We demonstrate that the irreducible wetting-phase saturation is an artifact of the experimental design, caused by the fact that the boundary pressure difference does not approximate the true capillary pressure. Using averaging methods, we compute the true capillary pressure for fluid configurations at and below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation. Results of our analysis include a state function for the capillary pressure expressed as a function of fluid saturation and interfacial area.</p>","European Geosciences Union (EGU)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

L.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; acoustic telemetry; juvenile salmon; environmental impact; freshwater ecology","Acoustic telemetry is one of the primary technologies for studying the behavior and survival of fishes throughout the world. The size and performance of the transmitters is still the key limiting factor despite that considerable effort has been expended to understand the biological effects of implantation of acoustic transmitters in yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon. The newly developed injectable transmitter is the first active acoustic tag that can be implanted via injection instead of surgery. It also lasts more than four times longer than the commercially-available transmitters. A two-part field study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the injectable transmitter and its effect on the survival of implanted fish. The injectable transmitter performed well and similarly to the other commercially-available transmitters tested. Snake River subyearling Chinook salmon smolts implanted with the injectable tag had a higher survival probability from release to each of 11 downstream detection arrays than concurrent releases of fish surgically implanted with commercially-available tags. In addition, reach-specific survival estimates were significantly higher for the injectable group in three of the eleven reaches examined. Overall, the injectable group had a 0.263 (SE = 0.017) survival probability over the entire 500 km study area compared to 0.199 (0.012) for the surgically implanted group. The differences in survival may have been caused by warm water temperatures and higher rates of infection experienced by the surgically implanted group due to the presence of sutures acting as an attachment site for pathogens. The reduction in size and ability to implant the new transmitter via injection has further reduced the tag or tagging effect bias associated with studying small fishes. As a result, the information gathered with this new technology is helping minimize the impact of dams on fish, leading to more environmentally sustainable energy systems.","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Modeling Total Dissolved Gas for Optimal Operation of Multireservoir Systems","Politano, Marcela; Castro, Alejandro; Hadjerioua, Boualem","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Basins; Sensitivity analysis; Dissolved gases; Rivers and streams; Entrainment; Environmental issues; Hydro power; Reservoirs; Dams","One important environmental issue of hydropower in the Columbia and Snake River Basins (Pacific Northwest region of United States) is elevated total dissolved gas (TDG) downstream of a dam, which has the potential to cause gas bubble disease in affected fish. Gas supersaturation in the Columbia River Basin primarily occurs due to dissolution of bubbles entrained during spill events. This paper presents a physically based TDG model that can be used to optimize spill operations in multireservoir hydropower systems. Independent variables of the model are forebay TDG, tailwater elevation, spillway and powerhouse discharges, project head, and environmental parameters such as temperature and atmospheric pressure. The model contains seven physically meaningful experimental parameters, which were calibrated and validated against TDG data collected downstream of Rock Island Dam (Washington) from 2008 to 2012. In conclusion, a sensitivity analysis was performed to increase the understanding of the relationships between TDG downstream of the dam and processes such as air entrainment, lateral powerhouse flow, and dissolution.","ASCE","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Water supply as a constraint on transmission expansion planning in the Western interconnection","Tidwell, Vincent C. (ORCID:000000024954897X); Bailey, Michael; Zemlick, Katie M.; Moreland, Barbara D.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Here, consideration of water supply in transmission expansion planning (TEP) provides a valuable means of managing impacts of thermoelectric generation on limited water resources. Toward this opportunity, thermoelectric water intensity factors and water supply availability (fresh and non-fresh sources) were incorporated into a recent TEP exercise conducted for the electric interconnection in the Western United States. The goal was to inform the placement of new thermoelectric generation so as to minimize issues related to water availability. Although freshwater availability is limited in the West, few instances across five TEP planning scenarios were encountered where water availability impacted the development of new generation. This unexpected result was related to planning decisions that favored the development of low water use generation that was geographically dispersed across the West. These planning decisions were not made because of their favorable influence on thermoelectric water demand; rather, on the basis of assumed future fuel and technology costs, policy drivers and the topology of electricity demand. Results also projected that interconnection-wide thermoelectric water consumption would increase by 31% under the business-as-usual case, while consumption would decrease by 42% under a scenario assuming a low-carbon future. Except in a few instances, new thermoelectric water consumption could be accommodated with less than 10% of the local available water supply; however, limited freshwater supplies and state-level policies could increase use of non-fresh water sources for new thermoelectric generation. Results could have been considerably different if scenarios favoring higher-intensity water use generation technology or potential impacts of climate change had been explored. Conduct of this exercise highlighted the importance of integrating water into all phases of TEP, particularly joint management of decisions that are both directly (e.g., water availability constraint) and indirectly (technology or policy constraints) related to future thermoelectric water demand, as well as, the careful selection of scenarios that adequately bound the potential dimensions of water impact.","IOP Publishing","","Sandia National Lab.

"Integrating a reservoir regulation scheme into a spatially distributed hydrological model","Zhao, Gang; Gao, Huili; Naz, Bibi S; Kao, Shih -Chieh; Voisin, Nathalie","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; reservoir; DHSVM; water resources; operation rules","During the past several decades, numerous reservoirs have been built across the world for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation, municipal/industrial water supplies, and hydropower generation. Consequently, timing and magnitude of natural streamflows have been altered significantly by reservoir operations. In addition, the hydrological cycle can be modified by land-use/land-cover and climate changes. To understand the fine-scale feedback between hydrological processes and water management decisions, a distributed hydrological model embedded with a reservoir component is desired. In this study, a multi-purpose reservoir module with predefined complex operational rules was integrated into the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). Conditional operating rules, which are designed to reduce flood risk and enhance water supply reliability, were adopted in this module. The performance of the integrated model was tested over the upper Brazos River Basin in Texas, where two U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoirs, Lake Whitney and Aquilla Lake, are located. The integrated DHSVM was calibrated and validated using observed reservoir inflow, outflow, and storage data. The error statistics were summarized for both reservoirs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Using the weekly reservoir storage for Lake Whitney as an example, the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and the Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) were 0.85 and 0.75, respectively. These results suggest that this reservoir module holds promise for use in sub-monthly hydrological simulations. Furthermore, with the new reservoir component, the DHSVM provides a platform to support adaptive water resources management under the impacts of evolving anthropogenic activities and substantial environmental changes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Projected impacts of climate change on hydropower potential in China","Liu, Xingcai; Tang, Qiuhong; Voisin, Nathalie; Cui, Huijuan","13 HYDRO ENERGY; hydropower; climate change; China; modeling; water resources management","<p>Hydropower is an important renewable energy source in China, but it is sensitive to climate change, because the changing climate may alter hydrological conditions (e.g., river flow and reservoir storage). Future changes and associated uncertainties in China's gross hydropower potential (GHP) and developed hydropower potential (DHP) are projected using simulations from eight global hydrological models (GHMs), including a large-scale reservoir regulation model, forced by five general circulation models (GCMs) with climate data under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Results show that the estimation of the present GHP of China is comparable to other studies; overall, the annual GHP is projected to change by -1.7 to 2 % in the near future (2020–2050) and increase by 3 to 6 % in the late 21st century (2070–2099). The annual DHP is projected to change by -2.2 to -5.4 % (0.7–1.7 % of the total installed hydropower capacity (IHC)) and -1.3 to -4 % (0.4&ndash;1.3 % of total IHC) for 2020–2050 and 2070–2099, respectively. Regional variations emerge: GHP will increase in northern China but decrease in southern China – mostly in south central China and eastern China – where numerous reservoirs and large IHCs currently are located. The area with the highest GHP in southwest China will have more GHP, while DHP will reduce in the regions with high IHC (e.g., Sichuan and Hubei) in the future. The largest decrease in DHP (in %) will occur in autumn or winter, when streamflow is relatively low and water use is competitive. Large ranges in hydropower estimates across GHMs and GCMs highlight the necessity of using multimodel assessments under climate change conditions. This study prompts the consideration of climate change in planning for hydropower development and operations in China, to be further combined with a socioeconomic analysis for strategic expansion.</p>","European Geosciences Union (EGU)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Organizing environmental flow frameworks to meet hydropower mitigation needs","McManamay, Ryan A.; Brewer, Shannon K.; Jager, Henriette I.; Troia, Matthew J.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; dams; river; regulation; environmental flow; policy; hydrology; hydropower; stream ecology; fish; mitigation","The global recognition of the importance of natural flow regimes to sustain the ecological integrity of river systems has led to increased societal pressure on the hydropower industry to change plant operations to improve downstream aquatic ecosystems. However, a complete reinstatement of natural flow regimes is often unrealistic when balancing water needs for ecosystems, energy production, and other human uses. Thus, stakeholders must identify a prioritized subset of flow prescriptions that meet ecological objectives in light of realistic constraints. Yet, isolating aspects of flow regimes to restore downstream of hydropower facilities is among the greatest challenges of environmental flow science due, in part, to the sheer volume of available environmental flow tools in conjunction with complex negotiation-based regulatory procedures. Here, we propose an organizational framework that structures information and existing flow paradigms into a staged process that assists stakeholders in implementing environmental flows for hydropower facilities. The framework identifies areas where regulations fall short of the needed scientific process, and provide suggestions for stakeholders to ameliorate those situations through advanced preparation. We highlight the strengths of existing flow paradigms in their application to hydropower settings and suggest when and where tools are most applicable. In conclusion, our suggested framework increases the effectiveness and efficiency of the e-flow implementation process by rapidly establishing a knowledge base and decreasing uncertainty so more time can be devoted to filling knowledge gaps. As a result, the framework provides the structure for a coordinated research agenda to further the science of environmental flows related to hydropower environments.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Therefore, our objective was to create a comprehensive database of mitigation required at non-federal hydropower projects and provide a synthesis of available mitigation data. Mitigation data was collated for over 300 plants licensed or relicensed from 1998 through 2013. We observed that the majority of FERC mitigation requirements deal with either hydrologic flows or recreation and that hydropower plants in the Pacific Northwest had the highest number of requirements. Our data indicate opportunities exist to further explore hydropower mitigation in the areas of environmental flows, fish passage, and water quality. Lastly, connecting these data with ecological outcomes, actual flow data, and larger landscape level information will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation and ultimately inform regulators, managers, and planners.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The effect of these non-homogeneous regions on the velocity measurement of an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) is investigated. By using a numerical model of an ADCP operating in a velocity field calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the errors due to the spatial variation of the flow velocity are identified. The numerical model of the ADCP is referred to herein as a Virtual ADCP (VADCP). Two scenarios are modeled in the numerical analyses presented. Firstly the measurement error of the VADCP is calculated for a single instrument adjacent to the short converging intake of the powerhouse. Secondly, the flow discharge through the forebay is estimated from a transect of VADCP instruments at dif- ferent distances from the powerhouse. The influence of instrument location and orientation are investigated for both cases. A velocity error of over up to 94% of the reference velocity is calculated for a VADCP modeled adjacent to an operating intake. Qualitative agreement is observed between the calculated VADCP velocities and reference velocities by an offset of one intake height upstream of the powerhouse.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, performance of motor control under torque command, current command or speed command differed. In one of the EEMs evaluated, the power take off controller tracks the maximum power-point of the turbine in response to turbulence.

"Classification of US hydropower dams by their modes of operation","McManamay, Ryan A.; Oigbokie, II, Clement O.; Kao, Shih -Chieh; Bevelhimer, Mark S.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; dam; hydrology; hydropower; stream ecology; hydrologic modeling","A key challenge to understanding ecohydrologic responses to dam regulation is the absence of a universally transferable classification framework for how dams operate. In the present paper, we develop a classification system to organize the modes of operation (MOPs) for U.S. hydropower dams and powerplants. To determine the full diversity of MOPs, we mined federal documents, open-access data repositories, and internet sources. W then used CART classification trees to predict MOPs based on physical characteristics, regulation, and project generation. Finally, we evaluated how much variation MOPs explained in sub-daily discharge patterns for stream gages downstream of hydropower dams. After reviewing information for 721 dams and 597 power plants, we developed a 2-tier hierarchical classification based on 1) the storage and control of flows to powerplants, and 2) the presence of a diversion around the natural stream bed. This resulted in nine tier-1 MOPs representing a continuum of operations from strictly peaking, to reregulating, to run-of-river, and two tier-2 MOPs, representing diversion and integral dam-powerhouse configurations. Although MOPs differed in physical characteristics and energy production, classification trees had low accuracies (<62%), which suggested accurate evaluations of MOPs may require individual attention.

However, little is known about the electric system impacts under extreme climate event such as drought. Vulnerability assessments are usually performed for a baseline water year or a specific drought, which do not provide insights into the full grid stress distribution across the diversity of climate events. In this paper we estimate the impacts of the water availability on the electricity generation and transmission in the Western US grid for a range of historical water availability combinations. We softly couple an integrated water model, which includes climate, hydrology, routing, water resources management and socio-economic water demand models, into a grid model (production cost model) and simulate 30 years of historical hourly power flow conditions in the Western US grid. The experiment allows estimating the grid stress distribution as a function of inter-annual variability in regional water availability. Results indicate a clear correlation between grid vulnerability (as quantified in unmet energy demand and increased production cost) for the summer month of August and annual water availability. There is a 3% chance that at least 6% of the electricity demand cannot be met in August, and 21% chance of not meeting 0.5% of the load in the Western US grid. There is a 3% chance that at least 6% of the electricity demand cannot be met in August, and 21% chance of not meeting 0.1% or more of the load in the Western US grid. The regional variability in water availability contributes significantly to the reliability of the grid and could provide trade off opportunities in times of stress. This paper is the first to explore operational grid impacts imposed by droughts in the Western U.S. grid.","Elsevier","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Todd; Flecker, Alexander S.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; classification; hydropower; stream ecology; water; dams; Ecuador; Colorado","Assessing spatial variation in hydrologic processes can help to inform freshwater management and advance ecological understanding, yet many areas lack sufficient flow records on which to base classifications. Seeking to address this challenge, we apply concepts developed in data-rich settings to public, global data in order to demonstrate a broadly replicable approach to characterizing hydrologic variation. The proposed approach groups the basins associated with reaches in a river network according to key environmental drivers of hydrologic conditions. This initial study examines Colorado (USA), where long-term streamflow records permit comparison to previously distinguished flow regime types, and the Republic of Ecuador, where data limitations preclude such analysis. The flow regime types assigned to gages in Colorado corresponded reasonably well to the classes distinguished from environmental features. The divisions in Ecuador reflected major known biophysical gradients while also providing a higher resolution supplement to an existing depiction of freshwater ecoregions. Although freshwater policy and management decisions occur amidst uncertainty and imperfect knowledge, this classification framework offers a rigorous and transferrable means to distinguish catchments in data-scarce regions. The maps and attributes of the resulting ecohydrologic classes offer a departure point for additional study and data collection programs such as the placement of stations in under-monitored classes, and the divisions may serve as a preliminary template with which to structure conservation efforts such as environmental flow assessments.","Wiley","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A fish-eye view of riverine hydropower systems. Understanding the biological response to turbine passage","Pracheil, Brenda M.; DeRolph, Christopher R.; Schramm, Michael P.; Bevelhimer, Mark S.","13 HYDRO ENERGY","One-way connectivity maintained by fish passing through hydropower turbines in fragmented rivers can be important to population dynamics, but can introduce a new and significant source of mortality due to turbine-associated mortality. Sources of mortality during downstream turbine passage can come from several sources including blade strike, shear forces, cavitation, or pressure decreases, and parsing the contributions of these individual forces is important for advancing and deploying turbines that minimize these impacts to fishes. We used a national hydropower database and conducted a systematic review of the literature to accomplish three goals: (1) report on the spatial distribution of turbine types and generation capacities in the USA, (2) determine fish mortality rates among turbine types and fish species and (3) examine relationships between physical forces similar to those encountered during fish turbine passage and fish injury and mortality. We found that while Francis turbines generate 56% of all US hydropower and have the highest associated fish mortality of any turbine type, these turbines are proportionally understudied compared to less-common and less injury-associated Kaplan turbines, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. While juvenile salmonid species in actual or simulated Kaplan turbine conditions were the most commonly studied, the highest mortality rates were reported in percid fishes passing through Francis turbines. Also, although there are several mechanisms of turbine-associated injury, barotrauma was the most commonly studied with swim bladder rupture, exopthalmia, eye gas bubbles, and prolapsed cloaca being the most serious symptoms associated with rapid pressure decreases. Future studies should focus on understanding which species are most at-risk to turbine passage mortality and, subsequently, increasing the diversity of taxonomy and turbine types in evaluations of turbine mortality.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"The social impacts of dams: A new framework for scholarly analysis","Kirchherr, Julian; Charles, Katrina J., E-mail: katrina.charles@ouce.ox.ac.uk","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; SOCIAL IMPACT","No commonly used framework exists in the scholarly study of the social impacts of dams. This hinders comparisons of analyses and thus the accumulation of knowledge. The aim of this paper is to unify scholarly understanding of dams' social impacts via the analysis and aggregation of the various frameworks currently used in the scholarly literature. For this purpose, we have systematically analyzed and aggregated 27 frameworks employed by academics analyzing dams' social impacts (found in a set of 217 articles). A key finding of the analysis is that currently used frameworks are often not specific to dams and thus omit key impacts associated with them. The result of our analysis and aggregation is a new framework for scholarly analysis (which we call ‘matrix framework’) specifically on dams' social impacts, with space, time and value as its key dimensions as well as infrastructure, community and livelihood as its key components. Building on the scholarly understanding of this topic enables us to conceptualize the inherently complex and multidimensional issues of dams' social impacts in a holistic manner. If commonly employed in academia (and possibly in practice), this framework would enable more transparent assessment and comparison of projects.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.02.005","","","","United States","2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 60; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 99-114","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)30033-0; TRN: US16R4802033747","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.02.005","","2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","22589259","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22589259","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","60"

This paper presents the first systematic review of the literature on the social impacts of dams. For this purpose, we built a sample of 217 articles published in the past 25 years via key word searches, expert consultations and bibliography reviews. All articles were assessed against an aggregate matrix framework on the social impact of dams, which combines 27 existing frameworks. We find that existing literature is highly biased with regard to: perspective (45% negative versus 5% positive); dam size (large dams are overrepresented); spatial focus (on the resettlement area); and temporal focus (5–10 years ex-post resettlement). Additionally, there is bias in terms of whose views are included, with those of dam developers rarely examined by scholars. These gaps need to be addressed in future research to advance our knowledge on the social impact of dams to support more transparency in the trade-offs being made in dam development decisions. - Highlights: • Very first systematic review of the research on dams' social impact • Biases in the literature identified, e. g. large dams over-studied, too much focus solely on resettlement area impacts • Implications of these biases for understanding of the topic are discussed.","","Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2016.02.007","","","","United States","2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 60; Other Information: Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 115-125","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK; PII: S0195-9255(15)30084-6; TRN: US16R4803033748","10.1016/J.EIAR.2016.02.007","","2017-04-24T00:00:00Z","22589260","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22589260","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","60"

Power systems with considerable amounts of flexible hydro power potentially offer easier integration of variable generation, e.g., wind and solar. However, there exist operational constraints to ensure mid-/long-term security of supply while keeping river flows and reservoirs levels within permitted limits. In order to properly assess the effective available hydro power flexibility and its value for storage, a detailed assessment of hydro power is essential. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the weather-dependent hydrological cycle, regulation constraints on the hydro system, and uncertainty of internal load as well as variable generation (wind and solar), this assessment is complex. Hence, it requires proper modeling of all the underlying interactions between hydro power and the power system, with a large share of other variable renewables. A summary of existing experience of wind integration in hydro-dominated power systems clearly points to strict simulation methodologies. Recommendations include requirements for techno-economic models to correctly assess strategies for hydro power and pumped storage dispatch. These models are based not only on seasonal water inflow variations but also on variable generation, and all these are in time horizons from very short term up to multiple years, depending on the studied system. Another important recommendation is to include a geographically detailed description of hydro power systems, rivers' flows, and reservoirs as well as grid topology and congestion.","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Hydropower developers and operators desire tools to better anticipate mitigation requirements, while natural resource managers and regulators need tools to evaluate different mitigation scenarios and order effective mitigation. Here we sought to examine the feasibility of using a suite of multidisciplinary explanatory variables within a spatially explicit modeling framework to fit predictive models for future environmental mitigation requirements at hydropower projects across the conterminous U.S. Using a database comprised of mitigation requirements from more than 300 hydropower project licenses, we were able to successfully fit models for nearly 50 types of environmental mitigation and to apply the predictive models to a set of more than 500 non-powered dams identified as having hydropower potential. The results demonstrate that mitigation requirements have been a result of a range of factors, from biological and hydrological to political and cultural. Furthermore, project developers can use these models to inform cost projections and design considerations, while regulators can use the models to more quickly identify likely environmental issues and potential solutions, hopefully resulting in more timely and more effective decisions on environmental mitigation.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

North America has significant in-stream energy resources, and hydrokinetic electric power technologies to harness those resources have the potential to make a significant contribution to U.S. electricity needs by adding as much as 120 TWh/year from rivers alone to the present hydroelectric power generation capacity. Additionally, tidal and ocean current resources in the U.S. respectively contain 438 TWh/year and 163 TWh/year of extractable power. Among their attractive features, in-stream hydrokinetic operations do not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions or other air pollution and have less visual impact than wind turbines. Since these systems do no utilize dams the way traditional hydropower systems typically do, their impact on the environment will differ, and a small but growing number of studies support conclusions regarding those impacts. Furthermore, potential environmental impacts include altered water quality, altered sediment deposition, altered habitats, direct impact on biota, and navigability of waterways.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Furthermore, the updated techniques can be used to estimate the total undeveloped hydropower potential across all regions, and may eventually help identify further hydropower opportunities that were previously overlooked. To enhance the characterization of higher energy density stream-reaches, this paper explored the sensitivity of geospatial resolution on the identification of hydropower stream-reaches using the geospatial merit matrix based hydropower resource assessment (GMM-HRA) model. GMM-HRA model simulation was conducted with eight different spatial resolutions on six U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 8-digit hydrologic units (HUC8) located at three different terrains; Flat, Mild, and Steep. The results showed that more hydropower potential from higher energy density stream-reaches can be identified with increasing spatial resolution.

"Spatial design principles for sustainable hydropower development in river basins","Jager, Henriëtte I.; Efroymson, Rebecca A.; Opperman, Jeff J.; Kelly, Michael R.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Freshwater reserve design; Hydroelectric power; Network theory; Optimization; Regulated rivers; River portfolio; Spatial decisions","How can dams be arranged within a river basin such that they benefit society? Recent interest in this question has grown in response to the worldwide trend toward developing hydropower as a source of renewable energy in Asia and South America, and the movement toward removing unnecessary dams in the US. Environmental and energy sustainability are important practical concerns, and yet river development has rarely been planned with the goal of providing society with a portfolio of ecosystem services into the future. We organized a review and synthesis of the growing research in sustainable river basin design around four spatial decisions: Is it better to build fewer mainstem dams or more tributary dams? Should dams be clustered or distributed among distant subbasins? Where should dams be placed along a river? At what spatial scale should decisions be made? We came up with the following design principles for increasing ecological sustainability: (i) concentrate dams within a subset of tributary watersheds and avoid downstream mainstems of rivers, (ii) disperse freshwater reserves among the remaining tributary catchments, (iii) ensure that habitat provided between dams will support reproduction and retain offspring, and (iv) formulate spatial decision problems at the scale of large river basins. Based on our review, we discuss trade-offs between hydropower and ecological objectives when planning river basin development. We hope that future testing and refinement of principles extracted from our review will define a path toward sustainable river basin design.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"Role of surface oxygen-to-metal ratio on the wettability of rare-earth oxides","Khan, Sami; Azimi, Gisele; Yildiz, Bilge; Varanasi, Kripa K.","13 HYDRO ENERGY","Hydrophobic surfaces that are robust can have widespread applications in drop-wise condensation, anti-corrosion, and anti-icing. Recently, it was shown that the class of ceramics comprising the lanthanide series rare-earth oxides (REOs) is intrinsically hydrophobic. The unique electronic structure of the rare-earth metal atom inhibits hydrogen bonding with interfacial water molecules resulting in a hydrophobic hydration structure where the surface oxygen atoms are the only hydrogen bonding sites. Hence, the presence of excess surface oxygen can lead to increased hydrogen bonding and thereby reduce hydrophobicity of REOs. Herein, we demonstrate how surface stoichiometry and surface relaxations can impact wetting properties of REOs. Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and wetting measurements, we show that freshly sputtered ceria is hydrophilic due to excess surface oxygen (shown to have an O/Ce ratio of 3 and a water contact angle of ~15°), which when relaxed in a clean, ultra-high vacuum environment isolated from airborne contaminants reaches close to stoichiometric O/Ce ratio (~2.2) and becomes hydrophobic (contact angle of ~104°). Further, we show that airborne hydrocarbon contaminants do not exclusively impact the wetting properties of REOs, and that relaxed REOs are intrinsically hydrophobic. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the role of surface relaxation on the wettability of REOs.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Northwest Energy Innovations, Portland, OR (United States); Hydro Research Foundation, Evergreen, MA (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"Evaluation of behavior and survival of fish exposed to an axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine","Amaral, Stephen V.; Bevelhimer, Mark S.; Čada, Glenn F.; Giza, Daniel J.; Jacobson, Paul T.; McMahon, Brian J.; Pracheil, Brenda M.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","Previous studies have evaluated fish injury and mortality at hydrokinetic (HK) turbines, but because these studies focused on the impacts of these turbines in situ they were unable to evaluate fish responses to controlled environmental characteristics (e.g., current velocity and light or dark conditions). In this study, we used juvenile hybrid Striped Bass (HSB; Striped Bass <i>Morone saxatilis</i> White Bass <i>M. chrysops</i>; N D 620), Rainbow Trout <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i> (N D 3,719), and White Sturgeon <i>Acipenser transmontanus</i> (N D 294) in a series of laboratory experiments to (1) evaluate the ability of fish to avoid entrainment through an axial-flow HK turbine, (2) evaluate fish injury and survival associated with turbine entrainment, and (3) compare the effects of different HK turbines on fish. We found that the probability of turbine entrainment was species dependent and highest for HSB. Across species, current velocity influenced entrainment probability. Among entrained fish, observed survival rates were generally >0.95. The probability of injury for surviving entrained fish only differed from that for nonentrained fish for Rainbow Trout and in general was not >0.20. The probability of injury following entrainment was greater only for HSB, although there were no differences in injury rates between fish that were turbine entrained and those that were not, suggesting that injuries were not turbine related. Taking turbine entrainment, survival, and injury estimates together allowed us to estimate the probability of a randomly selected fish in a population proximate to an HK turbine surviving passage or remaining uninjured after passage. For species and current velocities for which there was a significant effect due to entrainment, we estimated, for instance, that HSB had a survival probability of 0.95 and that Rainbow Trout and White Sturgeon had a >0.99 probability of survival. By combining these estimates with those from previous studies, we derived total passage survival probabilities >0.90 but generally approaching 1.00 across different HK turbine types, fish species, and fish lengths.","Taylor and Francis","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

"A multi-scale spatial approach to address environmental effects of small hydropower development","McManamay, Ryan A.; Samu, Nicole M.; Kao, Shih -Chieh; Bevelhimer, Mark S.; Hetrick, Shelaine C.","54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; geospatial; landscape planning; energy development","Hydropower development continues to grow worldwide in developed and developing countries. While the ecological and physical responses to dam construction have been well documented, translating this information into planning for hydropower development is extremely difficult. Very few studies have conducted environmental assessments to guide site-specific or widespread hydropower development. Herein, we propose a spatial approach for estimating environmental effects of hydropower development at multiple scales, as opposed to individual site-by-site assessments (e.g., environmental impact assessment). Because the complex, process-driven effects of future hydropower development may be uncertain or, at best, limited by available information, we invested considerable effort in describing novel approaches to represent environmental concerns using spatial data and in developing the spatial footprint of hydropower infrastructure. Furthermore, we then use two case studies in the US, one at the scale of the conterminous US and another within two adjoining rivers basins, to examine how environmental concerns can be identified and related to areas of varying energy capacity. We use combinations of reserve-design planning and multi-metric ranking to visualize tradeoffs among environmental concerns and potential energy capacity. Spatial frameworks, like the one presented, are not meant to replace more in-depth environmental assessments, but to identify information gaps and measure the sustainability of multi-development scenarios as to inform policy decisions at the basin or national level. Most importantly, the approach should foster discussions among environmental scientists and stakeholders regarding solutions to optimize energy development and environmental sustainability.","Springer","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

A standard empirical orthogonal function method extracts dominant spatial patterns from time series of the reanalysis data. The results show strong zonal structures in the winds and saturation of swells across the ocean basins, but these dominant features obscure the periodicity of the climate cycles. Implementation of the Fourier transform removes non-oscillatory signals in the wind and waves for elucidation of cyclic features through the empirical orthogonal function method. A systematic analysis illustrates the dominant modes and their periodicity in the three major ocean basins. The North Atlantic dominates the variability in the entire ocean basin with a broad range of intra-seasonal signals. The Indian and Pacific are strongly influenced by inter-annual cycles of the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Antarctica Oscillation. Here, these two oceans have strong components in the period of 50-90 days that have similar spatial structure to those of 2-5 years period suggesting linkage between the two frequency components.","American Geophysical Union","","Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

This may correspond to practical or legal limitations, such as the cost of long submarine power cables or the extent of Exclusive Economic Zones. Because some environmental effects predicted under large-scale OTEC scenarios exhibit a strong asymmetry among major oceanic basins, numerical experiments where the OTEC domain is restricted to such specific areas are also conducted. Results suggest that in all cases, a rate of about 0.2 TW per Sverdrup of OTEC deep cold seawater is sustained when overall OTEC net power peaks. At that juncture, temperature profiles in the OTEC implementation areas are affected in similar ways, while the strength of the Thermohaline Circulation roughly doubles. Overall geographical constraints simply defined by distance to shore, given the model’s 1° horizontal resolution, produce global OTEC net power maxima of 12–14 TW. In such cases, OTEC net power density approximately increases in inverse proportion to the OTEC implementation area. Limiting OTEC development to the Indo-Pacific yields results similar to the global case with a maximum proportional to the implementation area (12 TW), but simulations restricted to the Atlantic behave quite differently. In the latter case, OTEC net power peaks a little over 5 TW. In conclusion, it is estimated that producing half the predicted power maxima would substantially limit large-scale environmental temperature changes in each case.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

"An Assessment of Global Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Resources With a High-Resolution Ocean General Circulation Model","Rajagopalan, Krishnakumar; Nihous, Gérard C.","13 HYDRO ENERGY; Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC); ocean general circulation model","Global rates of ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) are assessed with a high-resolution (1 deg × 1 deg) ocean general circulation model (OGCM). In numerically intensive simulations, the OTEC process is represented by a pair of sinks and a source of specified strengths placed at selected water depths across the oceanic region favorable for OTEC. Results broadly confirm earlier estimates obtained with a coarse (4 deg × 4 deg) OGCM, but with the greater resolution and more elaborate description of key physical oceanic mechanisms in the present case, the massive deployment of OTEC systems appears to affect the global environment to a relatively greater extent. The maximum global OTEC power production drops to 14 TW, or about half of previously estimated levels, but it would be achieved with only one-third as many OTEC systems. Environmental effects at maximum OTEC power production are generally similar in both sets of simulations. The oceanic surface layer would cool down in tropical OTEC regions with a compensating warming trend elsewhere. Some heat would penetrate the ocean interior until the environment reaches a new steady state. A significant boost of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC) would occur. Although all simulations with given OTEC flow singularities were run for 1000 years to ensure stabilization of the system, convergence to a new equilibrium was generally achieved much faster, i.e., roughly within a century. Here, with more limited OTEC scenarios, a global OTEC power production of the order of 7 TW could still be achieved without much effect on ocean temperatures.","ASME","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

In juvenile Chinook salmon, the main mechanism for injury is thought to be expansion of existing gases (particularly those present in the swim bladder) and the rupture of the swim bladder ultimately leading to exopthalmia, emboli and hemorrhaging. In fish that lack a swim bladder, such as lamprey, the rate and severity of barotraumas due to rapid decompression may be reduced however; this has yet to be extensively studied. Another mechanism for barotrauma can be gases coming out of solution and the rate of this occurrence may vary among species. In this study, juvenile brook and Pacific lamprey acclimated to 146.2 kPa (equivalent to a depth of 4.6 m) were subjected to rapid (<1 sec; brook lamprey only) or sustained decompression (17 minutes) to a very low pressure (13.8 kPa) using a protocol previously applied to juvenile Chinook salmon. No mortality or evidence of barotraumas, as indicated by the presence of hemorrhages, emboli or exopthalmia, were observed during rapid or sustained decompression, nor following recovery for up to 120 h following sustained decompression. In contrast, mortality or injury would be expected for 97.5% of juvenile Chinook salmon exposed to a similar rapid decompression to these very low pressures. Additionally, juvenile Chinook salmon experiencing sustained decompression died within 7 minutes, accompanied by emboli in the fins and gills and hemorrhaging in the tissues. Thus, juvenile lamprey may not be susceptible to barotraumas associated with hydroturbine passage to the same degree as juvenile salmonids, and management of these species should be tailored to their specific morphological and physiological characteristics.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fish passing by the turbine blade may experience rapid decompression, the severity of which can be highly variable and may result in a number of barotraumas. The mechanisms of these injuries can be due to expansion of existing bubbles or gases coming out of solution; governed by Boyle’s Law and Henry’s Law, respectively. This paper combines re-analysis of published data with new experiments to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of injury and mortality for fish experiencing rapid decompression associated with hydroturbine passage. From these data it appears that the majority of decompression related injuries are due to the expansion of existing bubbles in the fish, particularly the expansion and rupture of the swim bladder. This information is particularly useful for fisheries managers and turbine manufacturers, demonstrating that reducing the rate of swim bladder ruptures by reducing the frequency of occurrence and severity of rapid decompression during hydroturbine passage could reduce the rates of injury and mortality for hydroturbine passed juvenile salmonids.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

One route of passage of particular concern is through hydro turbines, in which fish may be exposed to a range of potential injuries, including barotraumas from rapid decompression. The change in pressure from acclimation to exposure (nadir) has been found to be an important factor in predicting the likelihood of mortality and injury for juvenile Chinook salmon undergoing rapid decompression associated with simulated turbine passage. The presence of telemetry tags has also been shown to influence the likelihood of injury and mortality for juvenile Chinook salmon. This research investigated the likelihood of mortality and injury for juvenile Chinook salmon carrying telemetry tags and exposed to a range of simulated turbine passage. Several factors were examined as predictors of mortal injury for fish undergoing rapid decompression, and the ratio of pressure change and tag burden were determined to be the most predictive factors. As the ratio of pressure change and tag burden increase, the likelihood of mortal injury also increases. The results of this study suggest that previous survival estimates of juvenile Chinook salmon passing through hydro turbines may have been biased due to the presence of telemetry tags, and this has direct implications to the management of hydroelectric facilities. Realistic examples indicate how the bias in turbine passage survival estimates could be 20% or higher, depending on the mass of the implanted tags and the ratio of acclimation to exposure pressures. Bias would increase as the tag burden and pressure ratio increase, and have direct implications on survival estimates. It is recommended that future survival studies use the smallest telemetry tags possible to minimize the potential bias that may be associated with carrying the tag.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Over the last two decades, many in-field, laboratory, and modeling technologies have been developed or improved to better understand the mechanisms of fish injury and mortality and to identify turbine design and operation alternatives to reduce such impacts. In 2010, representatives of DOE and the US Department of Interior, and USACE signed a memorandum of understanding to work more closely to develop sustainable hydropower. One of their major objectives is to increase hydropower generation using low-impact and environmentally sustainable approaches. Given the recent scientific and technological advances that have decreased the environmental impact of hydropower and the need to aggressively facilitate development of low impact hydropower, we think it is indeed time to initiate a science-based green certification program that includes rigorous criteria for environmental protection but does not exclude hydropower based on size only.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fish passing through hydroturbines experience a rapid decrease in pressure as they pass by the turbine blade and the severity of this decompression can be highly variable. This rapid decrease in pressure can result in injuries such as swim bladder rupture, exophthalmia, and emboli and hemorrhaging in the fins and tissues. However, recent research indicates that the presence of a telemetry tag (acoustic, radio, inductive) implanted inside the coelom of a juvenile salmon increases the likelihood that the fish will be injured or die during turbine passage. Thus, previous research conducted using telemetry tags implanted into the coelom of fish may have been inaccurate. Thus, a new technique is needed to provide unbiased estimates of survival through turbines. This research provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of a neutrally buoyant externally attached acoustic transmitter. Both nontagged fish and fish tagged with a neutrally buoyant external transmitter were exposed to a range of rapid decompressions simulating turbine passage. Juvenile Chinook salmon tagged with a neutrally buoyant externally attached acoustic transmitter did not receive a higher degree of barotrauma than their nontagged counterparts. We suggest that future research include field-based comparisons of survival and behavior among fish tagged with a neutrally buoyant external transmitter and those internally implanted with transmitters.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Population modeling and other analyses to support Pacific salmon recovery efforts have assumed that the survival of juvenile salmonids during the transportation experience was 98%. To estimate survival during barge transport from Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River to a release area downstream of Bonneville Dam, a distance of 470 km, we used a novel adaptation of a release-recapture model with acoustic-tagged yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) smolts. A total of 1,494 yearling Chinook salmon were surgically implanted with Juvenile Salmon Acoustic Telemetry System (JSATS) acoustic transmitters and passive integrated transponders (PIT) and divided into three groups. The three tagged groups consisted of; (1) a group which was released into the raceway with the population of fish which were later loaded into transportation barges (R{sub B}), (2) a group which was held in a net-pen suspended within the general barge population until 5-6 h prior to barge evacuation, at which time they were confirmed to be alive and then released into the general barge population (R{sub A}), and (3) to validate a model assumption, a group which was euthanized and released into the barge population 2-8 h prior to barge evacuation (R{sub D}). Six replicates of these groups were loaded onto fish transport barges that departed Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River between 29 April and 13 May, 2010. Acoustic receiver arrays between 70 and 220 km downstream of the barge evacuation site were used to detect tagged fish and served as the basis for estimation of survival within the barge. Tag-life-corrected estimates of reach survival were calculated for barged and control fish in each of the six replicate trials. The ratio of survival from release to Rkm 153 for barged fish relative to control fish provided the estimate of within-barge survival. The replicate survival estimates ranged from 0.9503 (SE = 0.0253) to 1.0003 (SE = 0.0155). The weighted average of the replicate estimates of within-barge survival was computed to be = 0.9833 (SE = 0.0062). This study provides the first documentation that assumed survival of 98% inside barges during yearling Chinook salmon smolt transport appears to be justified. Survival of other species or stocks by barge or for any species/stock by truck remains unknown.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, fish screens may actually be harmful to fish if they become impinged on the surface of the screen or become disoriented due to poor flow conditions near the screen. Recent modifications to the vertical barrier screens (VBS) at the Bonneville Dam second powerhouse (B2) intended to increase the guidance of juvenile salmonids into the juvenile bypass system (JBS) have resulted in high mortality and descaling rates of hatchery subyearling Chinook salmon during the 2008 juvenile salmonid passage season. To investigate the potential cause of the high mortality and descaling rates, an in situ water velocity measurement study was conducted using acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADV) in the gatewell slot at Units 12A and 14A of B2. From the measurements collected the average approach velocity, sweep velocity, and the root mean square (RMS) value of the velocity fluctuations were calculated. The approach velocities measured across the face of the VBS varied but were mostly less than 0.3 m/s. The sweep velocities also showed large variances across the face of the VBS with most measurements being less than 1.5 m/s.

However, it is not known whether a single suture will sufficiently hold the incision closed when fish are decompressed and when outward pressure is placed on the surgical site during turbine passage through hydroelectric dams. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of single-suture incision closures on five response variables in juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that were subjected to simulated turbine passage. An acoustic transmitter (0.43 g in air) and a passive integrated transponder tag (0.10 g in air) were implanted in each fish; the 6-mm incisions were closed with either one suture or two sutures. After exposure to simulated turbine passage, none of the fish exhibited expulsion of transmitters. In addition, the percentage of fish with suture tearing, incision tearing, or mortal injury did not differ between treatments. Expulsion of viscera through the incision was higher among fish that received one suture (12%) than among fish that received two sutures (1%).

Here in Part 2, we describe how the JSATS cabled system was employed as a reference sensor network for detecting and tracking juvenile salmon. Time-of-arrival data for valid detections on four hydrophones were used to solve for the three-dimensional (3D) position of fish surgically implanted with JSATS acoustic transmitters. Validation tests demonstrated high accuracy of 3D tracking up to 100 m from the John Day Dam spillway. The along-dam component, used for assigning the route of fish passage, had the highest accuracy; the median errors ranged from 0.06 to 0.22 m, and root mean square errors ranged from 0.05 to 0.56 m at distances up to 100 m. For the case study at John Day Dam during 2008, the range for 3D tracking was more than 100 m upstream of the dam face where hydrophones were deployed, and detection and tracking probabilities of fish tagged with JSATS acoustic transmitters were higher than 98%. JSATS cabled systems have been successfully deployed on several major dams to acquire information for salmon protection and for development of more “fish-friendly” hydroelectric facilities.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Using a 30 year record of reanalysis data, the spatial gradients of atmospheric variables related to precipitation formation are identified around the reservoir shoreline for 92 large dams of North America. Our study reports that large dams influence local climate most in Mediterranean, arid and semi-arid climates, while for humid climates the influence is least. During the growing season, large dams in Mediterranean climates increase CAPE 2-3 times near the reservoir compared to the non-growing season. Clear spatial gradients of CAPE, specific humidity and surface evaporation are also observed around the fringes between the reservoir shoreline and further from these dams. Because of the increasing correlation observed between higher percentile of rain and CAPE, our findings point to the possibility of storm intensification in impounded basins of the Mediterranean and arid climates of the United States.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Dam operators and design engineers are thus faced with the task of making those hydroelectric facilities more ecologically friendly through changes in hydro-turbine design and operation. Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County, Washington, applied for re-licensing from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to replace the 10 turbines at Wanapum Dam with advanced hydropower turbines that were designed to increase power generation and improve fish passage conditions. We applied both deterministic and stochastic blade-strike models to the newly installed turbine and an existing turbine. Modeled probabilities were compared to the results of a large-scale live fish survival study and a sensor fish study under the same operational parameters. Overall, injury rates predicted by the deterministic model were higher than experimental rates of injury while those predicted by the stochastic model were in close agreement with experiment results. Fish orientation at the time of entry into the plane of the leading edges of the turbine runner blades was an important factor contributing to uncertainty in modeled results. The advanced design turbine had slightly higher modeled injury rates than the existing turbine design; however, there was no statistical evidence that suggested significant differences in blade-strike injuries between the two turbines and the hypothesis that direct fish survival rate through the advanced hydropower turbine is equal or better than that through the conventional turbine could not be rejected.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

To bolster and improve reliability-based structural design, a stochastic model of transient pressures is developed for water conveyance systems in hydropower plants. The statistical characteristics and probability distributions of key factors in boundary conditions, initial states and hydraulic system parameters are analyzed based on a large record of observed data from hydro plants in China; and then the statistical characteristics and probability distributions of annual maximum waterhammer pressures are simulated using Monte Carlo method and verified by the analytical probabilistic model for a simplified pipe system. In addition, the characteristics (annual occurrence, sustaining period and probability distribution) of hydraulic loads for both steady and transient states are discussed. Illustrating with an example of penstock structural design, it is shown that the total waterhammer pressure should be split into two individual random variable loads: the steady/static pressure and the waterhammer pressure rise during transients; and that different partial load factors should be applied to each individual load to reflect its unique physical and stochastic features. Particularly, the normative load (usually the unfavorable value at 95-percentage point) for steady/static hydraulic pressure should be taken from the probability distribution of its maximum values during the pipe's design life, while for waterhammer pressure rise, as the second variable load, the probability distribution of its annual maximum values is used to determine its normative load.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Here, a brief review of this body of work suggests that the so-called finite-time thermodynamics approach, for which the value of maximum isentropic power remains indeterminate, is not consistent with engines operating at a constant mass flow rate of working fluid. Predictive formulas are further tested with a well documented and carefully instrumented experimental Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant. With small temperature differences, OTEC cycles can be well approximated as endoreversible engines. The accuracy and practicality of one set of formulas for working fluid temperatures and isentropic power is clearly demonstrated.","Fundamental Research and Development International","","Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI (United States)","USDOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Renewable Power Office.

In this paper 24 one-dimensional binary fish passage models are reviewed and refined to clarify their 25 origins and applications. For uniform flow, a simple exhaustion-threshold (ET) model 26 equation is derived that predicts the flow speed threshold in a fishway or velocity barrier 27 that causes exhaustion at a given maximum distance of ascent. Flow speeds at or above 28 the threshold predict failure to pass (exclusion). Flow speeds below the threshold predict 29 passage. The binary ET model is therefore intuitive and easily applied to predict passage 30 or exclusion. It is also shown to be consistent with the distance-maximizing model. The 31 ET model s limitation to uniform flow is addressed by deriving a passage model that 32 accounts for nonuniform flow conditions more commonly found in the field, including 33 backwater profiles and drawdown curves. Comparison of these models with 34 experimental observations of volitional passage for Gambusia affinis in uniform and 35 nonuniform flows indicates reasonable prediction of binary outcomes (passage or 36 exclusion) if the flow speed is not near the threshold flow velocity. More research is 37 needed on fish behavior, passage strategies under nonuniform flow regimes and 38 stochastic methods that account for individual differences in swimming performance at or 39 near the threshold flow speed. Future experiments should track and measure ground 40 speeds of ascending fish to test nonuniform flow passage strategies and to improve model 41 predictions. Stochastic models, such as Monte-Carlo techniques, that account for 42 different passage performance among individuals and allow prediction of the percentage 43 of fish passing would be particularly useful near flow speed thresholds where binary 44 passage models are clearly limited.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In this study, we developed empirical models to explain fish species richness in subbasins of the Arkansas White Red River basin as a function of discharge, elevation, climate, land cover, water quality, dams, and longitudinal position. We used information-theoretic criteria to compare generalized linear mixed models and identified well-supported models. Subbasin attributes that were retained as predictors included discharge, elevation, number of downstream dams, percent forest, percent shrubland, nitrate, total phosphorus, and sediment. The random component of our models, which assumed a negative binomial distribution, included spatial correlation within larger river basins and overdispersed residual variance. This study differs from previous biodiversity modeling efforts in several ways. First, obtaining likelihoods for negative binomial mixed models, and thereby avoiding reliance on quasi-likelihoods, has only recently become practical. We found the ranking of models based on these likelihood estimates to be more believable than that produced using quasi-likelihoods. Second, because we had access to a regional-scale watershed model for this river basin, we were able to include model-estimated water quality attributes as predictors. Thus, the resulting models have potential value as tools with which to evaluate the benefits of water quality improvements to fish.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Even as these turbines find important applications in small-scale energy generation using micro-hydro, the relationship between the layout of blade profile, geometry and turbine performance continues to be poorly characterized. The experimental results presented here help understand the relationship between exit tip angle, discharge through the turbine, shaft power, and efficiency. The modification was implemented on two different propeller runners and it was found that the power and efficiency gains from decreasing the exit tip angle could be explained by a theoretical model presented here based on classical theory of turbomachines. In particular, the focus is on the behaviour of internal parameters like the runner loss coefficient, relative flow angle at exit, mean axial flow velocity and net tangential flow velocity. The study concluded that the effects of exit tip modification were significant. The introspective discussion on the theoretical model's limitation and test facility suggests wider and continued experimentation pertaining to the internal parameters like inlet vortex profile and exit swirl profile. It also recommends thorough validation of the model and its improvement so that it can be made capable for accurate characterization of blade geometric effects.

This study evaluated neurobehavioral, hormonal, and reproductive effects in rat offspring perinatally exposed to a widely used pentabrominated commercial mixture, DE-71. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were exposed to 0, 1.7, 10.2, or 30.6 mg/kg/day DE-71 in corn oil by oral gavage from gestational day 6 to weaning. DE-71 did not alter maternal or male offspring body weights. However, female offspring were smaller compared with controls from postnatal days (PNDs) 35-60. Although several neurobehavioral endpoints were assessed, the only statistically significant behavioral finding was a dose-by-age interaction in the number of rears in an open-field test. Developmental exposure to DE-71 caused severe hypothyroxinemia in the dams and early postnatal offspring. DE-71 also affected anogenital distance and preputial separation in male pups. Body weight gain over time, reproductive tissue weights, and serum testosterone concentrations at PND 60 were not altered. Mammary gland development of female offspring was significantly affected at PND 21. Congener-specific analysis of PBDEs indicated accumulation in all tissues examined. Highest PBDE concentrations were found in fat including milk, whereas blood had the lowest concentrations on a wet weight basis. PBDE concentrations were comparable among various brain regions. Thus, perinatal exposure to DE-71 leads to accumulation of PBDE congeners in various tissues crossing blood-placenta and blood-brain barriers, causing subtle changes in some parameters of neurobehavior and dramatic changes in circulating thyroid hormone levels, as well as changes in both male and female reproductive endpoints.

We explore this issue by examining the specific case of fish migration and dams on the Mekong river. We determine that dams on the Mekong mainstem and major tributaries will have a major impact on the basin's fisheries and the people who depend upon them for food and income. We find no evidence that current moves towards dam construction will stop, and consider two scenarios for the future of the fisheries and other ecosystems of the basin. We conclude that major investment is required in innovative technology to reduce the loss of ecosystem services, and alternative livelihood strategies to cope with the losses that do occur","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Model performance evaluation in ungauged basins is an important research topic. In this study, we propose a framework for developing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) input data, including hydrography, terrain, land use, soil, tile, weather, and management practices, for the Upper Mississippi River basin (UMRB). We also present a performance evaluation of SWAT hydrologic budget and crop yield simulations in the UMRB without calibration. The uncalibrated SWAT model ably predicts annual streamflow at 11 USGS gauges and crop yield at a four-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) scale. For monthly streamflow simulation, the performance of SWAT is marginally poor compared with that of annual flow, which may be due to incomplete information about reservoirs and dams within the UMRB. Further validation shows that SWAT can predict base flow contribution ratio reasonably well. Compared with three calibrated SWAT models developed in previous studies of the entire UMRB, the uncalibrated SWAT model presented here can provide similar results. Overall, the SWAT model can provide satisfactory predictions on hydrologic budget and crop yield in the UMRB without calibration. The results emphasize the importance and prospects of using accurate spatial input data for the physically based SWAT model. This study also examines biofuel-biomass production by simulating all agricultural lands with switchgrass, producing satisfactory results in estimating biomass availability for biofuel production.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The goal of this study is to develop hydraulically optimized propeller turbines for the micro hydro range with a particular focus on ease of manufacture. This paper presents a wide range of geometrical optimization steps carried out on a propeller runner, whose blades have been designed using the free vortex theory, and operating with a gross head from 1.5 to 2 m and discharge of approximately 75 l/s. It further illustrates 3 stages of geometrical modifications carried out on the runner with an objective of optimizing the runner performance. These modifications comprised of changes to the tip angles (both at the runner inlet and exit) as well as the hub angles (at the runner inlet) of the runner blades. The paper also presents an interesting theoretical methodology to analyze the effects of each optimization stage. This method looks at the relative changes to shaft power and discharge at constant head and speed and gives wonderful insight as to how the internal parameters like Euler shaft work and runner hydraulic losses are behaving with respect to each optimization stage. It was found that the performance of the runner was very sensitive to changes to exit tip angle. At two levels of modification, the discharge increased in the range of 15-30%, while shaft power increased in the range of 12-45%, thus influencing the efficiency characteristics. The results of the runner inlet tip modification were very interesting in that a very significant rise of turbine efficiency was recorded from 55% to 74% at the best efficiency point, which was caused by a reduced discharge consumption as well as a higher power generation. It was also found that the optimization study on a propeller runner has reasonably validated the estimates of the free vortex theory despite small deviations. The final runner configuration demonstrated a maximum efficiency of 74% ({+-}1.8%), which is very encouraging from the perspectives of micro hydro application. The paper concludes with recommendations of a series of optimization steps to increase the efficiency of the runner. It also recommends the attempt of Computational Fluid Dynamics both as a validation and optimization tool for future research on propeller runners.

We have previously documented that a single dose of 15 mg/Kg DBP to pregnant mice late in gestation (GD 17) produces an aggressive T-cell lymphoma as well as lung and liver cancer in offspring. The current study examines the chemopreventative properties of chlorophyllin (CHL) and chlorophyll (Chl) in this transplacental carcinogenesis model. Pregnant B6129SF1 females, bred to 129S1/SvIm males, received purified diets incorporated with either 2000 ppm CHL, 2000 ppm Chl, or 10% freeze-dried spinach beginning at gestation day 9. Lymphoma-dependent mortality was not significantly altered by maternal consumption of any of the diet and little effect on lung tumor burden in mice surviving to 10 months of age was observed. However, co-administration of CHL at 380 mg/Kg with DBP by gavage (molar ratio of 10:1, CHL:DBP) provided significant protection against DBP initiated carcinogenesis. Offspring born to dams receiving CHL co-gavaged with DBP exhibited markedly fewer lymphoma-dependent mortalities (p< 0.001). The degree of protection by CHL, compared to controls dosed with DBP in tricaprylin (TCP) as the vehicle, were less marked, but still significant. Co-administration of CHL (TCP as vehicle) also reduced lung tumor multiplicity in mice by approximately 50% and this was observed throughout the study (p< 0.005). This is the first demonstration that CHL can provide potent chemoprotection in a transplacental carcinogenesis model and supports a mechanism involving complex-mediated reduction of carcinogen uptake.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Studies were designed to establish correlation metrics between Sensor Fish device measurements and live fish injuries by conducting concurrent releases in a range of turbulent shear flows. Comparisons were made for two exposure scenarios. In the fast-fish-to-slow-water scenario, test fish were carried by the fast-moving water of a submerged turbulent jet and exposed into the standing water of a flume. In the slow-fish-to-fast-water scenario, test fish were introduced into a turbulent jet from standing water through an introduction tube placed just outside the edge of the jet. Motion-tracking analysis was performed on high-speed, high-resolution digital videos of all the releases at water jet velocities ranging from 3 to 22.9 m · s<sup>-1</sup>. Velocities of the Sensor Fish were very similar to those of live fish, but maximum accelerations of live fish were larger than those by Sensor Fish for all the nozzle velocities of both cenarios. A 10% probability of major injury threshold was found to occur at sensor fish accelerations of 513 and 260 (m · s<sup>-2</sup>) for the fast-fish-to-slow-water and slow-fish-to-fast-water scenarios, respectively. The findings provide a linkage between laboratory experiments of fish injury, field survival studies, and numerical modeling.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fish passage engineers attempt to modify the hydrothermal behavior at reservoirs through structural and operational modifications and often use hydrodynamic simulations to guide their actions. Simulation of key hydrothermal processes such as (a) development of a stable two-layer stratified system, (b) density-driven currents over a reservoir length scale, and (c) discharge hydraulics near the power generation and fish collection intakes requires highly specialized models applied at differing temporal and spatial scales. A staged modeling approach is presented that uses external coupling of models at varying temporal scales and spatial resolution to simulate the entire hydraulic regime from the mouth of the reservoir at the upstream end to the discharge at the dam. The staged modeling approach is illustrated using a case study where structural modifications were evaluated to improve reservoir stratification and density-driven currents. The model results provided input and valuable insight in the development of a new structure design and configuration for effective fish collection near the forebay of a high-head dam.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Several methods have been developed to predict the best efficiency of pumps running as turbines but their results are not in good coincidence with experimental data for all pumps. Therefore, study and investigation of hydraulic behavior of pumps in reverse operation can be useful. In this study, the best efficiency point of an industrial centrifugal pump running as turbine was achieved using a theoretical analysis. This method tries to estimate hydraulic components of reverse (turbine) mode using direct (pump) mode. In the next step, the pump was simulated in direct and reverse modes by computational fluid dynamics. 3D full Navier-Stokes equations were solved using FineTurbo V.7 flow solver. Using numerical results, complete characteristic curves of the pump in direct and reverse modes were obtained. For experimental verification of theoretical and numerical results, the pump was tested as a turbine in a test rig. All required parameters were measured to achieve complete characteristic curves of the reverse pump. The theoretical and numerical results were compared with experimental data and some other methods.

Full energy chains were considered because accidents can take place at every stage of the chain. Comparative analyses for the years 1969-2000 included a total of 1870 severe ({&gt;=} 5 fatalities) accidents, amounting to 81,258 fatalities. Although 79.1% of all accidents and 88.9% of associated fatalities occurred in less developed, non-OECD countries, industrialized OECD countries dominated insured losses (78.0%), reflecting their substantially higher insurance density and stricter safety regulations. Aggregated indicators and frequency-consequence (F-N) curves showed that energy-related accident risks in non-OECD countries are distinctly higher than in OECD countries. Hydropower in non-OECD countries and upstream stages within fossil energy chains are most accident-prone. Expected fatality rates are lowest for Western hydropower and nuclear power plants; however, the maximum credible consequences can be very large. Total economic damages due to severe accidents are substantial, but small when compared with natural disasters. Similarly, external costs associated with severe accidents are generally much smaller than monetized damages caused by air pollution.","","","","","","United States","2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Human and Ecological Risk Assessment; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 5","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 947-973","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1080-7039; HERAFR; TRN: 090200266","10.1080/10807030802387556","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","21126129","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21126129","","Human and Ecological Risk Assessment","5","14"

One of the most devastated of these natural systems is the Tigris-Euphrates watershed that over the past three decades has witnessed the construction of over 60 engineering projects that eliminated seasonal flooding, reduced natural flow and dramatically reduced the areal extent (1966: 8000 km{sup 2}; 2002: 750 km{sup 2}) of the Mesopotamian Marshes downstream. We constructed a catchment-based continuous (1964-1998) rainfall runoff model for the watershed (area: 10{sup 6} km{sup 2}) using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to understand the dynamics of the natural flow system, and to investigate the impacts of reduced overall flow and the related land cover and land use change downstream in the marshes. The model was calibrated (1964-1970) and validated (1971-1998) against stream flow gauge data. Using the calibrated model we calculated the temporal variations in the average monthly flow rate (AMFR), the average monthly peak flow rate (AMPFR), and annual flow volume (AFV) of the Tigris and Euphrates into the marshes at a location near Al-Basrah city (31{sup o}N, 47.5{sup o}E) throughout the modeled period. Model results indicate that the AMPFR (6301 m{sup 3}/s) and average annual flow volume (AAFV: 80 x 10{sup 9} m{sup 3}/yr) for period A (10/1/1965-09/30/1973), preceding the construction of the major dams is progressively diminished in periods B1 (10/1/1973-09/30/1989; AMPFR: 3073 m{sup 3}/s; AAFV: 55 x 10{sup 9} m{sup 3}/yr) and B2 (10/1/1989-09/30/1998; AMPFR, 2319 m{sup 3}/s; AAFV: 50 x 10{sup 9} m{sup 3}/yr) that witnessed the construction of the major dams (B1: Keban, Tabqa, Hamrin, Haditha, Mosul, Karakaya; B2: Ataturk) due to the combined effects of filling artificial lakes, evaporation and infiltration of impounded water and its utilization for irrigation purposes. To investigate the impacts of reduced flow on the areal extent of the marshes, we examined the variation in marsh size extracted from temporal satellite data (1966, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987) acquired around the same approximate time period (July to September) of the year versus simulated AFV for the period preceding the onset (1987) of major local engineering projects (e.g., Crown of Battles River, Loyalty to the Leader Canal, Mother of Battles River) in and around the investigated marshes. Results indicate that the areal extent of the Central and Al-Hammar marshes (e.g., 1966: 7970 km2, 1977: 6680 km2, 1984: 5270 km2) decreases with a decrease in AFV (e.g., 1966: 60.8 x 109 m3, 1977: 56.9 x 109 m3, 1984: 37.6 x 109 m3). Using a relationship that describes the impact of reduced AFV on the areal extent of the marshes, we evaluated the impact of additional reductions in flow that will result from the implementation of the planned engineering projects on the Tigris-Euphrates system over the next few years. Upon completion of the ongoing South Eastern Anatolia project, with projected reductions in AFV exceeding 5 x 10{sup 9} m{sup 3}/yr, the sustainable marshes in the Central and Al-Hammar area will be reduced by at least an additional 550 km{sup 2}.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Managing phase effects due to reservoir operation and the associated amplification of daily maximum temperatures in the downstream reaches remains a challenge. An analytical approach derived from a one-dimensional heat advection and dispersion equation with surface heating in the form of equilibrium temperature was developed to examine the potential for restoration of natural stream temperatures. The analytical model was validated with observed temperature data collected in the Clackamas River, Oregon, and was used to highlight key downstream temperature behaviour characteristics. Mean stream temperatures below the dam are relatively stable and upon deviating from natural stream mean temperatures, return asymptotically to their natural state. In contrast, the amplitudes of daily temperature variation are highly sensitive to the phase differences induced by the dam and could nearly double in natural amplitude within the first 24 h. The analysis showed that restoring average stream temperatures to natural levels through structural and operational modifications at the dam may not be sufficient as phase-induced temperatures maximums would continue to persist","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Flow systems composed of a heterogeneous porous media, as well as discrete fracture networks, have been cited as examples of systems that can exhibit episodic fl ow. Episodic outfl ow events are significant because relatively large volumes of water can move rapidly through an unsaturated system, carrying water and contaminants to depth greatly ahead of a wetting front predicted by a one-dimensional, gravity-driven diff usive infiltration model. In this study, we model the behavior of water flow through a sand column underlain by an impermeable-walled macropore. Relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships were developed that capture the complex interrelationships between the macropore and the overlying porous media that control fl ow out of the system. The potential for episodic flow is assessed and compared to results of conventional modeling approaches and experimental data from the literature. Model results using coupled matrix–macropore relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships capture the behavior observed in laboratory experiments remarkably well, while simulations using conventional relative permeability and capillary pressure functions fail to capture some of the observed fl ow dynamics. Capturing the rapid downward movement of water suggests that the matrix-macropore capillary pressure and relative permeability functions developed have the potential to improve descriptions of fl ow and transport processes in heterogeneous, variably saturated media.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Previous research during one spawning season (2000) suggested that these species selected spawning habitats based on differences in hyporheic temperature and vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) with the river. In this study, we confirmed the spatial segregation of spawning based on hyporheic characteristics over four years (2001–2004) and examined the effects of load-following operations (power generation to meet short-term electrical demand) at Bonneville Dam on hyporheic function and characteristics. We found that during the study period, hyporheic temperature and VHG in chum salmon spawning areas were highly variable during periods of load-following operation when river levels fluctuated. In contrast, hyporheic water temperature and VHG within chum spawning areas fluctuated less when river levels were not changing due to load-following operation. Variable temperature and VHG could affect chum and fall Chinook salmon spawning segregation and incubation success by altering the cues each species uses to select redd sites. Alterations in site selection would result in a breakdown in the spatial segregation of spawning between chum and fall Chinook salmon, which would expose earlier spawning fall Chinook eggs to a greater risk of dislodgement from later spawning chum salmon. Additional research will be required to fully assess the effects of load-following operations on the hyporheic environment and spawning and incubation success of chum and fall Chinook salmon downstream from Bonneville Dam.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In this paper, several centrifugal pumps (N{sub s} &lt; 60 (m, m{sup 3}/s)) were tested as turbines. Using experimental data, some relations were derived to predict the best efficiency point of a pump working as a turbine, based on pump hydraulic characteristics. Validity of the presented method was shown using some referenced experimental data. Two equations were presented to estimate the complete characteristic curves of centrifugal pumps as turbines based on their best efficiency point. Deviations of suggested method from experimental data were considered and discussed. Finally, a procedure was presented for selecting a suitable pump to work as a turbine in a small hydro-site.

"Effects of river discharge on hyporheic exchange flows in salmon spawning areas of a large gravel-bed river","Hanrahan, Timothy P","13 HYDRO ENERGY; AVAILABILITY; DAMS; FLOOD CONTROL; HYDRAULICS; IRRIGATION; MANAGEMENT; PLANNING; PRODUCTION; PUMPING; RIVERS; SALMON; SNAKES; TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS; TURBULENCE; WATER; WATER RESOURCES; hyporheic exchange; gravel-bed rivers; temperature","The flow magnitude and timing from hydroelectric dams in the Snake River basin of the Pacific northwestern United States is managed in part for the benefit of salmon. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of current Hells Canyon Dam discharge operations on hydrologic exchange flows between the river and riverbed in Snake River fall Chinook salmon spawning areas. Interactions between river water and pore water within the upper 1 m of the riverbed were quantified through the use of self-contained temperature and water level data loggers suspended inside of piezometers. The data were recorded at 20 min intervals over a period of 200 days when the mean daily discharge was 218–605 m3 s–1, with hourly stage changes as large as 1.9 m. Differences in head pressure between the river and riverbed were small, often within ±2 cm. Measured temperature gradients in the riverbed indicated significant interactions between the surface and subsurface water. Neither hydraulic nor temperature gradients at most sites were significantly affected by either short- or long-term changes in discharge operations from Hells Canyon Dam. Only 2 out of 14 study sites exhibited acute flux reversals between the river and riverbed resulting from short-term, large magnitude changes in discharge. The findings suggest small-scale piezometric head differences play a minor role in the hydrologic exchange between the river and riverbed at the study sites. The processes controlling hydrologic exchange at the study sites are likely to be bedform-induced advective pumping, turbulence at the riverbed surface, and large-scale hydraulic gradients along the longitudinal profile of the riverbed. By incorporating the knowledge of hydrologic exchange processes into water management planning, regional agencies will be better prepared to manage the limited water resources among competing priorities that include salmon recovery, flood control, irrigation supply, hydropower production, and recreation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

It has been used to identify the locations and operations where conditions are severe enough to injure or kill fish. During the design process, a set of governing equations of motion for the device was derived and simulated in order to understand the design implications of instrument selection and placement within the body of the device.

Its housing is constructed of clear polycarbonate plastic. It is 24.5 mm in diameter and 90 mm in length, weighs about 43 grams, similar to the size and density of a yearling salmon smolt. The relative errors of both the linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements were determined to be less than 5% from laboratory acceptance tests.

Male CD (Sprague-Dawley derived) rats at postnatal day (PND) 5 were dosed with chlorpyrifos (CPF, 1 mg/kg) using different routes of exposure, vehicles, and single vs. divided doses. Blood concentrations of CPF and its primary metabolite, trichloropyridinol (TCP), were measured at multiple times through 24 h. Groups included: single gavage bolus vs. divided gavage doses in corn oil (1 vs 3 times in 24 h), single gavage bolus vs. divided gavage doses in rat milk, and subcutaneous administration in DMSO. These data were compared with lactational exposure of PND 5 pups from dams exposed to CPF in the diet at 5 mg/kg/day for four weeks or published data from dams exposed to daily gavage with CPF at 5 mg/kg/day. Maternal blood CPF levels were an order of magnitude lower from dietary exposure than gavage (1.1 vs 14.8 ng/g), and blood CPF levels in PND 5 pups that nursed dietary-exposed or gavage-exposed dams were below the limit of detection. Single gavage doses of 1 mg/kg CPF in corn oil vehicle in pups resulted in CPF blood levels of 49 ng/g, and in milk vehicle about 9 ng/g. Divided doses led to lower peak CPF levels. A bolus dose of 1 mg/kg CPF in DMSO administered sc appeared to have substantially altered pharmacokinetics from orally administered chlorpyrifos. To be meaningful for risk assessment, neonatal studies require attention to the exposure scenario, since route, vehicle, dose and frequency of administration result in different systemic exposure to the test chemical and its metabolites.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Cost-effective implementation of bio-indexing requires the use of tools such as numerical and physical turbine models to generate hypotheses for turbine operations that can be tested at prototype scales using live fish. Numerical deterministic and stochastic blade strike models were developed for a 1:25-scale physical turbine model built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the original design turbine at McNary Dam and for prototype-scale original design and replacement minimum gap runner (MGR) turbines at Bonneville Dam's first powerhouse. Blade strike probabilities predicted by both models were comparable with the overall trends in blade strike probability observed in both prototype-scale live fish survival studies and physical turbine model using neutrally buoyant beads. The predictions from the stochastic model were closer to the experimental data than the predictions from the deterministic model because the stochastic model included more realistic consideration of the aspect of fish approaching to the leading edges of turbine runner blades. Therefore, the stochastic model should be the preferred method for the prediction of blade strike and injury probability for juvenile salmon and steelhead using numerical blade-strike models.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The river stage changes in response to operations of dams on the Columbia River. Piezometers were installed in the hyporheic zone to facilitate long term, high frequency measurement of water and uranium fluxes into the Columbia River in response to fluctuating river stage. In addition, measurement of the water level in the near shore unconfined aquifer enhanced the understanding of the relationship between fluctuating river stage and uranium flux. The changing river stage caused head fluctuations in the unconfined aquifer, and resulted in fluctuating hydraulic gradient in the hyporheic zone. Further, influx of river water into the unconfined aquifer caused reduced uranium concentration in near shore groundwater as a result of dilution. Calculated water flux through the hyporheic zone ranged between 0.3 and -0.5 L/min/m2.

GBD results from exposure to gas supersaturated water created by discharge over dam spillways. Spill typically creates a downstream plume of water with high total dissolved gas supersaturation (TDGS) that may be positioned along either shore or mid-channel, depending on dam operations. We obtained spatial data on fish migration paths and migration depths for 228 adult spring and summer Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, during 2000. Migration paths were compared to output from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and dissolved gas model to estimate the potential for GBD expression and to test for behavioral avoidance of the high TDGS plume in unrestrained fish migrating under field conditions. Consistent with our previous estimates using single-location estimates of TDGS, we observed salmon swam sufficiently deep in the water column to receive complete hydrostatic compensation 95.9% of time spent in the Bonneville tailrace and 88.1% of the time in the Ice Harbor tailrace. The majority of depth uncompensated exposure occurred at TDGS levels > 115%. Adult spring and summer Chinook salmon tended to migrate near the shoreline. Adults moved into the high dissolved gas plume as often as they moved out of it downstream of Bonneville Dam, providing no evidence that adults moved laterally to avoid areas with elevated dissolved gas levels. The strong influence of dam operations on the position of the high-TDGS plume and shoreline-orientation behaviors of adults suggest that exposure of adult salmonids to high-TDGS conditions may be minimized using operational conditions that direct the plume mid-channel, particularly during periods of high discharge and spill. More generally, our approach illustrates the potential for combined field and modeling efforts to estimate the fine-scale environmental conditions encountered by fishes in natural and regulated rivers.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The culvert was set up in a test bed constructed to examine juvenile salmon passage success in various culvert types. The test culvert was 12.2 m long and 1.83m in diameter and set at a 1.14% slope. The corrugations were 2.54 cm deep by 7.62 cm peak to peak with a 5° right handed pitch. Tailwater elevation was adjustable with a stop-log system and was set slightly above the water surface level at the culvert exit. Cross-sectional grids of ADV measurements were taken at discharges of 28, 57, 113, 227, and 453 lps at 9 locations within the culvert barrel and just inside the headwater and tailwater tanks. Results indicated that the spiral corrugations caused asymmetries in the velocity and turbulence distributions creating a Reduced Velocity Zone (RVZ) on the right side of the culvert as seen looking upstream, which small fish could utilize to aide their upstream passage. Velocity and turbulence magnitudes in the RVZ were found to be less than in mid-channel or on the left of the culvert, and the difference became greater at increased flow rates. In addition, lateral and vertical velocity components within the RVZ were small relative to the downstream axial component, while lateral and vertical turbulence intensities were comparable to the axial component. Vorticity was found to be largest in amplitude near the culvert walls, and changed sign left of the culvert centerline. Inlet loss coefficients were calculated as well and ranged from 0.32 to 0.42. Relationships between velocity and turbulence intensity in the RVZ and average velocity were developed, which may be useful for evaluating the conditions under which the barrel of a culvert is passable for juvenile fish.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"The quality of Portuguese Environmental Impact Studies: The case of small hydropower projects","Pinho, Paulo; Maia, Rodrigo; Monterroso, Ana","13 HYDRO ENERGY; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; REVIEWS","In most Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) systems environmental authorities can stop an EIA process by refusing the respective EIA Report, on the grounds of technical or methodological insufficiencies identified in the review procedure. However, often times, it cannot be taken for granted that, once an EIA Report is formally accepted, as part of an EIA process, its quality standard is, consistently, of a satisfactory level. This paper summarises the results of a one-year research project aimed at assessing the quality of EIA studies carried out for small hydropower plants in Portugal. An extensive survey was carried out to analyse all EIA Reports that were the basis of successful EIA processes involving this kind of small scale projects, under the old and the new national EIA legislation, that is, over the last two decades. Often times unnoticeable to the general public and the media, located in isolated areas upstream secondary rivers, these projects are likely to generate some significant environmental impacts, in particular on the aesthetics value and character of local landscapes and on pristine ecological habitats. And yet, they are usually regarded as environmental friendly projects designed to produce emission free energy. The design of the evaluation criteria benefited from the literature review on similar research projects carried out in other EU countries. The evaluation exercise revealed a number of technical and methodological weaknesses in a significant percentage of cases. A set of simple and clear cut recommendations is proposed twofold: to improve the current standard of EIA practice and to strengthen the role of the so called EIA Commissions, at the crucial review stage of the EIA process.","","","","","","United States","2007-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.eiar.2006.10.005; PII: S0195-9255(06)00127-2; Copyright (c) 2006 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 189-205","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; EIARDK; TRN: US07R2388001359","10.1016/j.eiar.2006.10.005","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20972041","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20972041","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","3","27"

Floodplain backwaters, both permanent and temporary, are nursery areas for age 0+ fish and stable isotope studies indicate that much of the productivity that supports fish larvae is autochthonous to these habitats (Herwig et al. 2004). Limiting access by fish to floodplain habitat for feeding, spawning and nursery habitat is one of the problems noted with dams that regulate flow in rivers and is considered to be important as an argument to remove dams and other flow regulating structures from rivers (Shuman 1995; Bednarek 2001). While there have been a number of studies in the literature about the use of floodplain habitat for fish reproduction (Copp 1989; Killgore & Baker 1996; Humphries, et al. 1999; Humphries and Lake 2000; Crain et al. 2004; King 2004) there have been only a few studies that examined this aspect of stream ecology in more than a cursory way. The study reported here was originally designed to determine whether the Department of Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site was having a negative effect on fish reproduction in the Savannah River but its experimental design allowed examination of the interactions between the river, the floodplain and the tributaries entering the Savannah River across this floodplain. This study is larger in length of river covered than most in the literature and because of its landscape scale may be in important indicator of areas where further study is required.","","","Savannah River Site (SRS), Aiken, SC (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2007-03-05T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrobiologia","","Medium: ED","","WSRC-MS-2007-00051","DE-AC09-08SR22470","TRN: US201006%%992","","","2010-04-15T00:00:00Z","972199","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/972199","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/972199","Hydrobiologia","",""

The spatial variability and complexity of surface water and riverbed temperature gradients results in emergence timing predictions that are likely to have large errors. The objectives of this study were to quantify the thermal heterogeneity between the river and riverbed in fall Chinook salmon spawning areas and to determine the effects of thermal heterogeneity on fall Chinook salmon emergence timing. This study quantified river and riverbed temperatures at 15 fall Chinook salmon spawning sites distributed in two reaches throughout 160 km of the Snake River in Hells Canyon, Idaho, USA, during three different water years. Temperatures were measured during the fall Chinook salmon incubation period with self-contained data loggers placed in the river and at three different depths below the riverbed surface. At all sites temperature increased with depth into the riverbed, including significant differences (p<0.05) in mean water temperature of up to 3.8°C between the river and the riverbed among all the sites. During each of the three water years studied, river and riverbed temperatures varied significantly among all the study sites, among the study sites within each reach, and between sites located in the two reaches. Considerable variability in riverbed temperatures among the sites resulted in fall Chinook salmon emergence timing estimates that varied by as much as 55 days, depending on the source of temperature data used for the estimate. Monitoring of riverbed temperature gradients at a range of spatial scales throughout the Snake River would provide better information for managing hydroelectric dam operations, and would aid in the design and interpretation of future empirical research into the ecological significance of physical riverine processes.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The ratio of the maximum density fluctuations to the maximum fluid velocity increased more rapidly at low velocities than at high velocities. The ratio of the maximum density fluctuations in the dense phase to its maximum velocity was on the order of the inverse of the sound speed.

Concerns for restoring natural flow regimes have increased requirements for ""run-of-river"" (ROR) operation. It is widely believed that such restrictions (1) are mandated to protect aquatic biota, (2) decrease hydropower generation per unit flow, and (3) decrease energy revenue. In this study, we tested these three assumptions by reviewing hydropower projects that changed from peaking to ROR operation as a result of license modifications. ROR was often prescribed in states with strong water quality certification requirements and migratory fish species. Although benefits to aquatic resources were frequently cited, changes were often motivated by other considerations. When testing the second assumption, we found that the overall change in annual generation across projects was not significant, and much smaller than the effect of climate. However, we detected a significant decrease in generation efficiency at one-quarter of hydropower projects. When testing the third assumption, we found the expected decrease in flow during peak demand at seven of ten projects. At the remaining projects, diurnal fluctuations actually increased due to operation of upstream storage projects. We discuss the economic implications of these results, including both producer costs and ecological benefits. Regional- or national-scale studies of hydropower regulation are long overdue. Public dissemination of flow data, license provisions, and monitoring data would facilitate regional scale studies like this one, while increasing regulatory transparency and providing feedback to decision makers.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Although water temperature declines and dissolved oxygen increases soon after spawning, these temperature and dissolved oxygen levels do not meet the water quality standards established by the states of Oregon and Idaho for salmonid spawning. Our objective was to determine if temperatures from 13 to 17 C and dissolved oxygen levels from 4 to greater than 8 mg O2/L during the first 40 days of incubation followed by declining temperature and rising dissolved oxygen affected survival, development, and growth of Snake River fall Chinook salmon embryos, alevins, and fry. During the first 40 days of incubation, temperatures were adjusted downward approximately 0.2 C/day and oxygen was increased in increments of 2 mg O2/L to mimic the thermal and oxygen regime of the Snake River where these fish spawn. At 40 days post-fertilization, embryos were moved to a common exposure regime that followed the thermal and dissolved oxygen profile of the Snake River through emergence. Mortality of fall Chinook salmon embryos increased markedly at initial incubation temperatures equal to or greater than 17?C, and a rapid decline in survival occurred between 16.5 C and 17 C, with no significant difference in survival at temperatures less than or equal to 16.5 C. Initial dissolved oxygen levels as low as 4 mg O2/L over a range of initial temperatures from 15 to 16.5 C did not affect embryo survival to emergence. There were no significant differences across the range of initial temperature exposures for alevin and fry size at hatch and emergence. The number of days from fertilization to eyed egg, hatch, and emergence was highly related to temperature and dissolved oxygen; it took from 6 to 10 days longer to reach hatch at 4 mg O2/L than at saturation and up to 24 days longer to reach emergence. In contrast, within each dissolved oxygen treatment, it took about 20 days longer to reach hatch at 13 C than at 16.5 C (no data for 17 C) and up to 41 days longer to reach emergence. Overall, this study indicates that exposure to water temperatures up to 16.5 C will not have deleterious impacts on survival or growth from egg to emergence if temperatures decline at a rate of greater than or equal to 0.2 C/day following spawning. Although fall Chinook salmon survived low initial dissolved oxygen levels, the delay in emergence could have significant long-term effects on their survival. Thus, an exemption to the state water quality standards for temperature but not oxygen may be warranted in the Snake River where fall Chinook salmon spawn.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An SFO is a non-turbine, water-efficient passage route with an overflow structure through which flow and fish pass over a dam. Our review covered 69 SFOs in Europe and North America. We identified five main types of SFOs ? low-flow bypass/sluices, high-flow sluices, forebay collectors, powerhouse retrofits, and surface spills. Most low-flow bypass/sluices are sited in Europe and on the east coast of North America, where mean annual project discharge and hydropower production for the dams we reviewed were 95 m3/s and 15 MW, respectively. The other four SFO types are found at dams on the west coast of North America with 2184 m3/s mean annual discharge and 788 MW mean output. A conceptual framework based on fish behavior and hydraulics for different regions of a hydropower project was developed to evaluate SFO performance. For all SFO types, fish collection efficiency averaged 54%, with an average effectiveness ratio of 17:1 (fish to inflow). Surface flow outlet technology can meet the goal of concurrent anadromous fish protection and hydropower generation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

A total of 1,392 samples were analyzed from 45 sample locations throughout 11 major river drainages. We found that levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation varied extensively. The Salt River drainage, which is representative of the least impacted migration corridors in Idaho, had the highest levels of genetic diversity and low levels of genetic differentiation. High levels of genetic differentiation were observed at similar or smaller geographic scales in the Portneuf River, Raft River, and Teton River drainages, which are more altered by anthropogenic disturbances. Results suggested that Yellowstone cutthroat trout are naturally structured at the major river drainage level but that habitat fragmentation has altered this structuring. Connectivity should be restored via habitat restoration whenever possible to minimize losses in genetic diversity and to preserve historical processes of gene flow, life history variation, and metapopulation dynamics. However, alternative strategies for management and conservation should also be considered in areas where there is a strong likelihood of nonnative invasions or extensive habitat fragmentation that cannot be easily ameliorated.","","","Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2006-05-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 135","","Medium: ED; Size: 711-726","","P107452","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-8487; TAFSAI; R&D Project: 199800200; TRN: US200825%%573","10.1577/T05-147.1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","941568","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/941568","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/941568","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","","135"

Electrodes from EMG transmitters were surgically implanted in the red muscle of fish captured at Bonneville Dam and output from the tags was calibrated to defined swim speeds for each fish in a tunnel respirometer. The fish were then released below Bonneville Dam and radio-tracked as they migrated through the tailraces, fishways, and forebays of the dam. On average, the rate of aerobic energy used by spring Chinook salmon was significantly higher when they were moving through tailraces (1.27 kcal•kg-1•h-1) than when they were moving through other parts of the dam. Specifically, the rate of aerobic energy use for fish in tailraces was 14% higher than that used by fish in fishways (1.11 kcal•kg-1•h-1) and 27% higher than the rate used by fish in forebays (1.00 kcal•kg-1•h-1). Most (80%) of the aerobic energy used by fish to pass this dam was expended in the tailrace (25.5 kcal/kg), while only 18% (5.6 kcal/kg) and 2% (0.6 kcal/kg) were used in the fishways and forebays.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Evaluation of an Unsuccessful Brook Trout Electrofishing Removal Project in a Small Rocky Mountain Stream.","Meyer, Kevin A; Lamansky, Jr., James A.; Schill, Daniel J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 54 ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES; ABUNDANCE; EVALUATION; MORTALITY; PERSONNEL; REMOVAL; ROCKY MOUNTAINS; TROUT; WATERSHEDS","In the western United States, exotic brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis frequently have a deleterious effect on native salmonids, and biologists often attempt to remove brook trout from streams by means of electrofishing. Although the success of such projects typically is low, few studies have assessed the underlying mechanisms of failure, especially in terms of compensatory responses. A multiagency watershed advisory group (WAG) conducted a 3-year removal project to reduce brook trout and enhance native salmonids in 7.8 km of a southwestern Idaho stream. We evaluated the costs and success of their project in suppressing brook trout and looked for brook trout compensatory responses, such as decreased natural mortality, increased growth, increased fecundity at length, and earlier maturation. The total number of brook trout removed was 1,401 in 1998, 1,241 in 1999, and 890 in 2000; removal constituted an estimated 88% of the total number of brook trout in the stream in 1999 and 79% in 2000. Although abundance of age-1 and older brook trout declined slightly during and after the removals, abundance of age-0 brook trout increased 789% in the entire stream 2 years after the removals ceased. Total annual survival rate for age-2 and older brook trout did not decrease during the removals, and the removals failed to produce an increase in the abundance of native redband trout Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri. Lack of a meaningful decline and unchanged total mortality for older brook trout during the removals suggest that a compensatory response occurred in the brook trout population via reduced natural mortality, which offset the removal of large numbers of brook trout. Although we applaud WAG personnel for their goal of enhancing native salmonids by suppressing brook trout via electrofishing removal, we conclude that their efforts were unsuccessful and suggest that similar future projects elsewhere over such large stream lengths would be costly, quixotic enterprises.","","","Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2006-01-26T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: North American Journal of Fisheries Management; Journal Volume: 26","","Medium: ED; Size: 849-860","","P107451","","R&D Project: 199800200; TRN: US200825%%572","10.1577/M05-110.1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","941567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/941567","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/941567","North American Journal of Fisheries Management","","26"

Large numbers of live fry were captured from the redds between March 9 and May 18, 2003. Estimated survival from egg to fry for these redds, which were all subjected to some degree of dewatering during the incubation and post-hatch intragravel rearing period, ranged from 16.1 to 63.2 percent and averaged 27.8 percent (assuming 4,500 eggs/redd).

Hatchery-reared fall chinook salmon (93-128 mm in length) were introduced into the top portion of a submerged, 6.35-cm diameter water jet at velocities ranging from 12.2 to 19.8 m•s-1, with a control group released at 3 m•s-1. Injuries typical of turbine passed fish, including eye damage, opercle damage, bruising, loss of equilibrium, lethargy, and mortality were observed and recorded. Three-dimensional trajectories were generated for four locations (nose, head, centroid, tail) on each fish released. Time series of velocity, acceleration, force, jerk, and bending angle were computed from the 3-dimensional trajectories of the centroid using finite-difference methods. The onset of minor, major and fatal injuries occurred at nozzle velocities of 12.2 13.7 and 16.8 m•s-1, respectively, corresponding to exposure strain rates of 683, 761, and 933 s-1. Opercle injuries occurred at 12.2 m•s-1 nozzle velocity, while eye injuries, bruising, and loss of equilibrium were common at speeds of 16.8 m•s-1 and above. Of the computed dynamic parameters, acceleration showed the strongest predictive power for eye and opercle injuries and overall injury level, and it may provide the best potential link between laboratory studies of fish injury, field studies designed to collect similar data in situ, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model output.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Movement, swimming speed, and oxygen consumption of juvenile white sturgeon in response to changing flows, water temperatures, and light level in the Snake River, Idaho","Geist, David R; Brown, Richard S; Cullinan, Valerie I; Brink, Steve R; Lepla, Kenneth B; Bates, Phil; Chandler, James A","13 HYDRO ENERGY; IDAHO; RIVERS; FLUCTUATIONS; HABITAT; JUVENILES; OXYGEN; CONSUMPTION RATES; FLOW RATE; DAMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; FISHES","The flow of the Snake River downstream of Hells Canyon Dam, Idaho, frequently fluctuates as the dam responds to power production requirements. These flow fluctuations have the potential to increase the energy used by individual juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) that move to avoid unfavorable habitat or that alter their swimming speeds to maintain position over a range of velocities. Following swimming respirometry experiments, a field study using electromyogram (EMG) and sonic telemetry evaluated whether sturgeon were being negatively affected by operations of Hells Canyon Dam during three study periods where flows were artificially fluctuated (247 to 856 m3/s), held high and stable (438 to 600 m3/s), or held low and stable (275 to 284 m3/s). Respirometry results confirmed that oxygen consumption of juvenile sturgeon increased with swim speed and was temperature dependent, and when corrected for fish mass, ranged from 140.2 to 306.5 mg O2 kg-1 h-1. The telemetry study showed that movements and activity levels, as measured by swimming speeds and oxygen consumption, of sturgeon were variable among fish and across study periods. When flows were held low and stable, sturgeon movement increased while activity levels decreased when compared to the study periods when flows were variable or were high and stable. Although the overall trend was for activity levels to be less during the study period when flows were low and stable, the majority of differences between study periods appeared to be due to differences in water temperature and light levels that changed during the three-month investigation. The results suggest high flows, even those of relatively short durations such as what occurs during load-following operations, restrict the movement of juvenile sturgeon, but do not result in an increase of energy expenditure, possibly because of morphological and behavioral adaptations to living in a high-velocity environment. This may have significant implications to sturgeon survival by altering foraging behavior or inter and intra-specific competition.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The method is applied to simulate incompressible swirling flow in a typical hydroturbine draft tube, which consists of a strongly curved 90 degree elbow and two piers. The governing equations are solved with a second-order-accurate, finite-volume, dual-time-stepping artificial compressibility approach for a Reynolds number of 1.1 million on a mesh with 1.8 million nodes. The geometrical complexities of the draft tube are handled using domain decomposition with overset (chimera) grids. Numerical simulations show that unsteady statistical turbulence models can capture very complex 3D flow phenomena dominated by geometry-induced, large-scale instabilities and unsteady coherent structures such as the onset of vortex breakdown and the formation of the unsteady rope vortex downstream of the turbine runner. Both URANS and DES appear to yield the general shape and magnitude of mean velocity profiles in reasonable agreement with measurements. Significant discrepancies among the DES and URANS predictions of the turbulence statistics are also observed in the straight downstream diffuser.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The system was deployed following a randomized study design to record fall Chinook salmon spawning activity during day and night periods in two index areas downstream of Wanapum Dam on the Columbia River in Washington, USA. One index area was a deepwater spawning area located (river kilometer (rkm) 663) in 9 to 11 m of water. The other index site was a moderate depth mid-channel bar, where water depths ranged from 2.5 to 6 m. The acoustic system was used to collect spawning activity data during free-drifts in a boat through the index areas. Spawning activity was defined as digs per minute from underwater sound recordings. Fall Chinook salmon spawning activity in the Wanapum Dam tailrace was influenced by daylight and river discharge. Results showed there was a substantial amount of spawning activity occurring during both daylight and darkness. However, there was significantly more spawning activity during daylight than at night in both index areas. Spawning activity was also affected by flow. Project discharge had a pronounced non-linear effect on spawning activity. Spawning activity was generally highest at project discharges between 1,700 and 2266 m3 sec-1 in both spawning areas, with reduced activity as discharge increased to between 3,400 and 4,250 m3 sec-1. We concluded that fall Chinook salmon spawning activity in highly variable environments was affected more by flow (and velocity) than by daylight.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Surface flow bypasses were recommended in several regional salmon recovery plans as a means to increase passage survival of juvenile salmonids at Columbia and Snake River dams. A prototype surface flow bypass, called the SBC, was retrofit on Lower Granite Dam and evaluated from 1996 to 2000 using biotelemetry and hydroacoustic techniques. In terms of passage efficiency, the best SBC configurations were a surface skimmer (99 m3/s [3,500 cfs], three entrances 5 m wide, 5 m deep and one entrance 5 m wide, 15 m deep) and a single chute (99 m3/s, one entrance 5 m wide, 8.5 m deep). They each passed 62 ? 3% (95% confidence interval) of the total juvenile fish population that entered the section of the dam with the SBC entrances (Turbine Units 4-5). Smooth entrance shape and concentrated surface flow characteristics of these configurations are worth pursuing in designs for future surface flow bypasses. In addition, a guidance wall in the Lower Granite Dam forebay diverted the following percentages of juvenile salmonids away from Turbine Units 1-3 toward other passage routes, including the SBC: run-at-large 79 ? 18%; hatchery steelhead 86%; wild steelhead 65%; and yearling chinook salmon 66%. When used in combination with spill or turbine intake screens, a surface flow bypass with a guidance wall can produce a high level (&gt; 90% of total project passage) of non-turbine passage and provide operational flexibility to fisheries managers and dam operators responsible for enhancing juvenile salmonid survival.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

In the stochastic approach, the properties of porous media are treated as random functions with statistics obtained from field measurements. Several studies indicate that hydrological properties depend on the scale of measurements or support scales, but most stochastic analysis does not address the effects of support scale on stochastic predictions of subsurface processes. In this work we propose a new approach to study the scale dependence of stochastic predictions. We present a stochastic analysis of immiscible fluid–fluid displacement in randomly heterogeneous porous media. While existing solutions are applicable only to systems in which the viscosity of one phase is negligible compare with the viscosity of the other (water–air systems for example), our solutions can be applied to the immiscible displacement of fluids having arbitrarily viscosities such as NAPL–water and water–oil. Treating intrinsic permeability as a random field with statistics dependant on the permeability support scale (scale of measurements) we obtained, for one-dimensional systems, analytical solutions for the first moments characterizing unbiased predictions (estimates) of system variables, such as the pressure and fluid–fluid interface position, and we also obtained second moments, which characterize the uncertainties associated with such predictions. Next we obtained empirically scale dependent exponential correlation function of the intrinsic permeability that allowed us to study solutions of stochastic equations as a function of the support scale. We found that the first and second moments converge to asymptotic values as the support scale decreases. In our examples, the statistical moments reached asymptotic values for support scale that were approximately 1/10000 of the flow domain size.

Accordingly, the size of a fish entrainment zone (FEZ) is often of interest to fisheries managers and facility operators. This study developed a new technique to map the FEZ, defined here as the region immediately upstream of a portal where the probability of fish movement toward the portal is greater than 90%. To map the FEZ, we applied a Markov chain analysis to fish movement data collected with an active tracking sonar. This device locks onto and follows a target, recording positions through a set of volumetric cells comprising the sampled volume. The probability of a fish moving from one cell to another was calculated from fish position data, which was used to populate a Markov transition matrix. We developed and applied the technique using data on salmon smolts migrating near the ice/trash sluiceway at The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River. The FEZ of the sluiceway entrance in 2000 as determined with this procedure was approximately 5 m across and extended 6-8 m out from the face of the dam in the surface layer 2-3 m deep. In conclusion, using a Markov chain analysis of fish track data we were able to describe and quantify the FEZ of the sluiceway at The Dalles Dam. This technique for FEZ mapping is applicable to other bioengineering efforts aimed at protecting fish populations affected by water withdrawals.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2004-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fisheries Research; Journal Volume: 69; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 2004","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 349-358","","PNWD-SA-6170","AC05-76RL01830","TRN: US200503%%183","10.1016/j.fishres.2004.06.007","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15010774","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15010774","","Fisheries Research","3","69"

Thirty-six timed-pregnant rats were randomly assigned to each of three treatment groups: two groups exposed to a far-field RF Iridium signal and a third group that was sham exposed. Exposures were chosen such that the brain SAR in the fetuses was 0.16 W/kg. Whole-body far-field exposures were initiated at 19 days of gestation and continued at 2 h/day, 7 days/week for dams and pups after parturition until weaning ({approx}23 days old). The offspring (700) of these dams were selected, 90 males and 90 females for each near-field treatment group, with SAR levels in the brain calculated to be as follows: (1) 1.6 W/kg, (2) 0.16 W/kg and (3) near-field sham controls with an additional 80 males and 80 females as shelf controls. Confining, head-first, near-field exposures of 2 h/day, 5 days/week were initiated when the offspring were 36 + 1 days old and continued until the rats were 2 years old. No statistically significant differences were observed among treatment groups for number of live pups/litter, survival index and weaning weights, nor were there differences in clinical signs or neoplastic lesions among the treatment groups. The percentages of animals surviving at the end of the near-field exposure were not different among the male groups. In females a significant decrease in survival time was observed for the case control group.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Irrigation diversions in the western United States were developed in the late 1800?s and early 1900?s with little regard to how they might affect fish populations. Fish screens were installed on some diversions beginning in the 1930's but were often ineffective. Beginning in the 1980's a ''modern-era'' fish screening program was initiated in the Yakima River basin in Washington State. A systematic phased approach was employed, with federal funding, to replace antiquated screens and to install screens where there had not previously been any. Also during this time, the federal and state agencies responsible for protecting the fish resources developed criteria to guide the design of these facilities. These criteria, developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency Fisheries (formerly the National Marine Fisheries Service) and adopted by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, dictate the limits of physical metrics such as approach velocity for fish screens facilities. To determine whether the investment in fish screen facilities were paying dividends in terms of the fish protection they were designed and built to achieve, the in-situ evaluation of these facilities was required. Scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) developed methods for evaluating these new fish screen facilities as they came ''on-line'' to document whether the facilities were designed, constructed, operated and maintained to be within the fish passage criteria. Because the fish protection criteria were developed to guide facility engineering and design, researchers had to interpret the criteria in terms of how they would be applied to data from the field to determine whether a specific facility was operated within criteria. PNNL uses a combination of water velocity measurements, visual inspection, and underwater videography to determine whether fish screen sites are within the fish protection criteria. This annual evaluation schedule (most sites are evaluated three times/year) is a vital tool to ensure that the large capital investment (over $75 Million USD) is being operated and maintained to protect fish.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Fish were exposed to a submerged jet of water with exit velocities adjustable from 0 to 21.3 m/sec. The exposure strain rates for our tests ranged from 0 to about 1100 sec-1. The greatest strain rate tested is beyond rates expected in most natural fish habitat or during passage through the turbine intake of a hydroelectric dam. The rate of strain experienced by test fish varied based on a change in distance or scale of 1.8 cm, the approximate width of the fish tested. Turbulence intensity in the area of the jet where fish were subjected to the shear environment was +3 to 6% of the estimated exposure strain rate. Injuries and mortalities increased with increasing strain rates. There were no significant injuries to any fish subjected to rates of strain !U500 sec-1. American shad were the most susceptible to injury after being subjected to a shear environment while steelhead and rainbow trout were the most resistant. Fish exposed head first to the jet had higher injury/mortality rates than fish introduced tail first. Our studies reinforce past conclusions that a one-time exposure to shear environments exceeding a change in velocity of 15 m/sec over 1.8 cm is harmful to juvenile fish. The associated exposure strain rate for these velocities is ~850 sec-1 at a measurement scale of Dy = 1.8 cm.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Management agencies are currently evaluating the feasibility of reintroducing anadromous fish upriver of Chief Joseph Dam. We evaluated the physical characteristics of potential fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning habitat in the upper section of Chief Joseph Reservoir. The objective of this study was to estimate the quantity and location of potential spawning habitat, and secondly to determine the redd capacity of the area based on spawning habitat characteristics. We used a geomorphic approach to first identify specific segments with the highest potential for spawning. The suitability of these segments for spawning was then estimated through the use of empirical physical data and modeled hydraulic data. We estimated 5% (48.7 ha) of the study area contains potentially suitable fall chinook salmon spawning habitat. Potential spawning habitat is primarily limited by water too deep and secondly by water velocities too low, the combination of which results in 20% (9.6 ha) of the potential spawning habitat being characterized as high quality. Estimates of redd capacity within potential spawning habitat range from 207? 1599 redds, based on proportional use of potential habitat and varying amounts of channelbed used by spawning salmon.

The investigation involved one year of laboratory study and one year of field study at Bonneville Dam. The objectives of the laboratory study, reported here, were to (1) measure active rates of oxygen consumption of adult spring chinook salmon at three water temperatures over a range of swimming speeds; (2) estimate the Ucrit of adult spring chinook salmon; and (3) monitor EMGs of red and white muscle in the salmon over a range of swimming speeds. Future papers will report on the results of the field study. Our results indicated that the rate of oxygen consumption and red and white muscle activity in adult spring chinook salmon were strongly correlated with swimming speed over a range of fish sizes and at three different temperatures. Active oxygen consumption increased linearly with swim speed before leveling off at speeds at or above Ucrit. This pattern was similar at each water temperature and indicated that fish were approaching their maximal aerobic oxygen consumption at higher swim speeds. Modeling showed that temperature, but not size or sex, influenced the relation between V02 and swim speed, thus a V02-swim speed model based on temperature (but independent of sex and size) should be a biologically relevant way of estimating the energy use of fish in the wild.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2003-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fish Biology; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 1 Oct 2003","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 970-989","","PNNL-SA-37165","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-1112; JFIBA9; 400403209; TRN: US200415%%346","10.1046/j.1095-8649.2003.00217.x","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15007367","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15007367","","Journal of Fish Biology","4","63"

We investigated the responses of fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) to these two stresses, singly and in combination, in the laboratory. Fish were exposed to total dissolved gas levels of 100%, 120%, or 135% of saturation while being held at either surface or 30 ft of pressure. Some of these fish were then subjected to decreases in pressure simulating passage through a Kaplan turbine under “worst case” (to 0.1 atmospheres) or more “fish friendly” (to 0.5 atmospheres) scenarios. Surface- and depth-acclimated Chinook salmon and bluegill, with no exposure to dissolved gas above ambient levels, were subjected to decreases in pressure simulating passage through a bulb turbine under “worst case” (to 0.68 atmospheres) or more “fish friendly” (to 1.0 atmospheres) scenarios. Bluegill, the most pressure-sensitive among the three species, incurred injuries that ranged from mild (internal hemorrhaging) (bulb turbine) to death (Kaplan turbine). For each type of turbine passage, bluegill acclimated to 30 ft depth and subjected to the more severe pressure nadir were more susceptible to injury/death. However, even control bluegill (i.e., not subjected to simulated turbine passage) experienced mild to moderate injury from rapidly ascending from 30 ft of pressure to surface pressure. The dissolved gas level had only a small additive effect on the injury/death rate of bluegill subjected to simulated Kaplan turbine passage. Thus, while physoclistous fish, such as bluegill, appear to be susceptible to injury from any rapid pressure decrease, those that are most severe (e.g., Kaplan turbine passage) are likely to be most injurious. Chinook salmon and rainbow trout were much less susceptible than bluegill to death/injury from simulated Kaplan turbine passage, and Chinook salmon incurred no visible injuries from simulated bulb turbine passage under any scenario. Acclimation to 30 ft depth had little additional effect on the injury/death rate of Chinook salmon and rainbow trout subjected to Kaplan turbine passage. However, these species were much more susceptible to acute gas bubble trauma than bluegill, particularly those acclimated at surface pressure at 120% or 135% of saturation. Consequently, it would be advantageous to develop advanced turbines that operate efficiently under more “fish friendly” pressure regimes and to reduce the amount of gas supersaturation.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Impacts of the Columbia River Hydroelectric System on Mainstem Habitats of Fall Chinook Salmon","Dauble, Dennis D; Hanrahan, Timothy P; Geist, David R; Parsley, Michael J","13 HYDRO ENERGY","Salmonid habitats in mainstem reaches of the Columbia and Snake rivers have changed dramatically during the past 60 years because of hydroelectric development and operation. Only about 13 and 58% of riverine habitats in the Columbia and Snake rivers, respectively, remain. Most riverine habitat is found in the upper Snake River; however, it is upstream of Hells Canyon Dam and not accessible to anadromous salmonids. We determined that approximately 661 and 805 km of the Columbia and Snake rivers, respectively, were once used by fall chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha for spawning. Fall chinook salmon currently use only about 85 km of the mainstem Columbia River and 163 km of the mainstem Snake River for spawning. We used a geomorphic model to identify three river reaches downstream of present migration barriers with high potential for restoration of riverine processes: the Columbia River upstream of John Day Dam, the Columbia-Snake-Yakima River confluence, and the lower Snake River upstream of Little Goose Dam. Our analysis substantiated the assertion that historic spawning areas for fall chinook salmon occurred primarily within wide alluvial floodplains once common in the mainstem Columbia and Snake rivers. These areas possessed more unconsolidated sediment, more bars and islands, and had lower water surface slopes than areas not extensively used. Because flows in the mainstem are now highly regulated, the pre-development alluvial river ecosystem is not expected to be restored simply by operational modification of one or more dams. Establishing more normative flow regimes, specifically sustained peak flows for scouring, is essential to restoring the functional characteristics of existing, altered habitats. Restoring production of fall chinook salmon to any of these reaches also requires that population genetics and viability of potential seed populations (i.e., from tributaries and tailrace spawning areas, and hatcheries) be considered.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

The Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) is a high-resolution imaging sonar that obtains near video-quality images for the identification of objects underwater. Developed originally for the Navy by the University of Washington?s Applied Physics Laboratory, it bridges the gap between existing fisheries assessment sonar and optical systems. Traditional fisheries assessment sonars detect targets at long ranges but cannot record the shape of targets. The images within 12 m of this acoustic camera are so clear that one can see fish undulating as they swim and can tell the head from the tail in otherwise zero-visibility water. In the 1.8 MHz high-frequency mode, this system is composed of 96 beams over a 29-degree field of view. This high resolution and a fast frame rate allow the acoustic camera to produce near video-quality images of objects through time. This technology redefines many of the traditional limitations of sonar for fisheries and aquatic ecology. Images can be taken of fish in confined spaces, close to structural or surface boundaries, and in the presence of entrained air. The targets themselves can be visualized in real time. The DIDSON can be used where conventional underwater cameras would be limited in sampling range to &lt; 1 m by low light levels and high turbidity, and where traditional sonar would be limited by the confined sample volume. Results of recent testing at The Dalles Dam, on the lower Columbia River in Oregon, USA, are shown.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

During field tests the range of calculated mean entry velocities was 9.3-13.7 m/s for two high flow outfall discharges (28.3 and ~70.2 m3/s) and two tailwater elevations. Mortality of balloon-tagged hatchery spring chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juveniles in the field tests was <1% at entry velocities of 9.3 m/s and 13.7 m/s. Injury rates during both field tests were also less than 1%. At a high velocity flume in a laboratory, small (87-100 mm FL) and large (135-150 mm FL) hatchery fall chinook salmon were exposed to velocities ranging from 0.0 to 24.4 m/s in a fast-fish-to-slow-water scenario. Jet entry velocities up to 15.2 m/s provided benign passage conditions for all sizes of juvenile salmonids tested. Based on our results, we concluded that a jet entry velocity up to 15.2 m/s should safely pass juvenile salmon at high flow outfalls, contingent upon site-specific, post-construction verification studies.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

Female 129/SvJ metallothionein-knockout (MT1,2KO) and metallothionein-normal (MTN) mice received drinking water containing trace amounts of {sup 109}CdCl{sub 2} (0.15 ng Cd/ml; 0.074 {mu}Ci {sup 109}Cd/ml). {sup 109}Cd and MT in maternal, fetal, and pup tissues were measured on gestation days 7, 14, and 17 and lactation day 11. In dams, MT influenced both the amount of {sup 109}Cd transferred from intestine into body (two- to three-fold higher in MT1,2KO than MTN dams) and tissue-specific {sup 109}Cd distribution (higher liver/kidney ratio in MT1,2KO dams). Placental {sup 109}Cd concentrations in MT1,2KO dams were three- and seven-fold higher on gestation days 14 and 17, respectively, than in MTN dams. Fetal {sup 109}Cd levels were low in both mouse types, but at least 10-fold lower in MTN fetuses. MT had no effect on the amount of {sup 109}Cd transferred to pups via milk; furthermore, 85--90% of total pup {sup 109}Cd was recovered in gastrointestinal tracts of both types, despite high duodenal MT only in MTN pups. A relatively large percentage of milk-derived intestinal {sup 109}Cd was transferred to other pup tissues in both MT1,2KO and MTN pups (14 and 10%, respectively). These results demonstrate that specific sequestration of cadmium by both maternal and neonatal intestinal tract does not require MT. Although MT decreased oral cadmium transfer from intestine to body tissues at low cadmium exposure levels, MT did not play a major role in restricting transfer of cadmium from dam to fetus via placenta and to neonate via milk.","","","Argonne National Lab.

We hypothesized that measurements of water depth, substrate size, and water velocity alone would not explain the separation in spawning areas and began a 2-year investigation of physicochemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone. We found that chum salmon spawned in upwelling water that was significantly warmer than the surrounding river water. In contrast, fall chinook salmon constructed redds at downwelling sites where there was no difference in temperature between the river and its bed. Understanding the specific features that are important for chum salmon and fall chinook salmon redd site selection at Ives Island will be useful to resource managers attempting to maximize available spawning habitat for these species within the constraints imposed by other water resource needs.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2002-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: North American Journal of Fisheries Management; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: 1 Nov 2002","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1077-1085","","PNNL-SA-35782","AC06-76RL01830","400480000; TRN: US200416%%5","10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<1077:PCOTHZ>2.0.CO;2","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15002423","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15002423","","North American Journal of Fisheries Management","4","22"

Sites sampled in the 1980s were relocated in 1999-2000 by using maps and photographs or by finding original site-boundary stakes, so that the same reach of stream was sampled during both periods. Abundance of Yellowstone cutthroat trout longer than 10 cm did not change, averaging 41 fish/100 m of stream during both the 1980s and 1999-2000. The proportion of the total catch of trout composed of Yellowstone cutthroat trout also did not change, averaging 82% in the 1980s and 78% in 1999-2000. At the 48 sites where size structure could be estimated for both periods, the proportion of Yellowstone cutthroat trout that were 10-20 cm long declined slightly (74% versus 66%), but the change was due entirely to the shift in size structure at the Teton River sites. The number of sites that contained rainbow trout O. mykiss or cutthroat trout 3 rainbow trout hybrids rose from 23 to 37, but the average proportion of the catch composed of rainbow trout and hybrids did not increase (7% in both the 1980s and 1999-2000). Although the distribution and abundance of Yellowstone cutthroat trout have been substantially reduced in Idaho over the last century, our results indicate that Yellowstone cutthroat trout abundance and size structure in Idaho have remained relatively stable at a large number of locations for the last 10-20 years. The expanding distribution of rainbow trout and hybrids in portions of the upper Snake River basin, however, calls for additional monitoring and active management actions.","","","Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Portland, OR (United States)","USDOE","","United States","2002-05-23T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: North American Journal of Fisheries Management; Journal Volume: 23","","Medium: ED; Size: 149-162","","P107453","","R&D Project: 199800200; TRN: US200825%%574","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","941573","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/941573","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/941573","North American Journal of Fisheries Management","","23"
"Visualizing Long-Term Patterns of Water Temperature","Kickert, Ronald N; Dauble, Dennis D","13 HYDRO ENERGY; aquatic ecology; fish; Columbia River","Long-term patterns in river water temperature are relevant to questions pertaining to fish welfare and hydroelectric dam operations. Yet, in fish biology and watershed hydrology, the typical ways in which river water temperature data are displayed do not readily and easily show the long-term patterns in the data. We use different styles of displaying such data so that changes of river water temperature over time can readily be seen from various perspectives. One such approach is to display the fourth dimension, time, split into two dimensions, with water temperature data shown as a three dimensional response surface that is color-coded according to various levels of temperature. This includes a version that shows long term patterns at levels above a threshold which is significant for the welfare of some fish species. For example, at Bonneville Dam, Oregon, along the Lower Columbia River, the average daily water temperature from USGS sources for 62 years, from 1938 to 1999, shows an increasing pattern, from mid-July to mid-September, in the number of days exceeding 21 C, a critical level for some salmonids.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

An enhanced-oxygen environment was used to maintain sufficient difference between saturation and upstream dissolved oxygen concentrations to reduce the experimental uncertainty. The variation in the deficit ratio r as a function of tailwater depth H was evaluated by using unit discharges q of 167, 334, and 502 m{sup 3}/hr{center_dot}m and weir heights W of 0.54, 1.04, and 1.36 m. A semitheoretical equation for predicting r as a function of jet Froude number F{sub J}, drop height h, and H was fitted to observed values by nonlinear regression analysis. An assumed value of 0.667 for maximum H/h (found in the literature) proved acceptable. We concluded that tailwater depths are important to predict oxygen transfer at low-drop weirs, but that designing for optimum tailwater depth to maximize oxygen transfer may not be as important as was previously thought, because large optimum ranges for H/h were observed in this study.","","","Argonne National Lab.

Its novel and unique-designed architecture consists of uniformed, well-defined and oriented nanorods of Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) of 50 nm in diameter and 500nm in length and homogeneously distributed nonaggregated monodisperse spherical nanoparticles of Eskolaite (alpha-Cr2O3) of 250 nm in diameter. This alpha-Fe2O3 alpha-Cr2O3 nanocomposite thin film is obtained by growing, directly onto transparent polycrystalline conducting substrate, an oriented layer of hematite nanorods and growing subsequently, the eskolaite layer. The synthesis is carried out by a template-free, low-temperature, multilayer thin film coating process using aqueous solution of metal salts as precursors. Almost 100 percent of the light is absorbed by the composite film between 300 and 525 nm and 40 percent at 800 nm which yields great expectations as photoanode materials for photovoltaic cells and photocatalytic devices.","","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"The Use of PIT Tagging to Estimate Juvenile Fall Chinook Salmon Migration Time Through the Priest Rapids Project Area on the Columbia River","Wahl, R; McMichael, Geoffrey A","13 HYDRO ENERGY; ADULTS; COLUMBIA RIVER; DAMS; DATA ANALYSIS; JUVENILES; MONITORS; SALMON","We are in the process of evaluating how the Priest Rapids Project (PRP, located north of the Hanford reach on the Columbia River) affects populations of wild, fall Chinook salmon that are produced. One part of this project involves using mark-recapture technique to monitor fall juvenile Chinook movement in the area. A passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology was used to document migration timing out of the influence of the PRP, and track fish through downstream dams as they make their way to the ocean. On June 6 and 7, 2000, we tagged 1083 fall Chinook sub-yearlings above and below Wanapum Dam, subsequently detecting them as they began to pass through downstream dams. As of 9 August 2000, 122 fish had been detected in one or more of the dams downstream of the PRP. A mean migration time for tagged the fish of 5.5 km/day below the McNary dam and 4.5 km/day above the McNary Dam. The mean migration rate between McNary Dam and John Day Dam was 21.4 km/day. Back calculation, indicated the mean date of departure for juveniles tagged in the pool above Wanapum Dam was July 16, 2000, while juveniles tagged below Wanapum Dam was July 1, 2000. Because fish are still being detected at the dams only preliminary conclusions can be attempted. Since the peak of migration time for these fish seems to have passed, the time when these fish most likely left the PRP area can also be estimated. Data analysis will continue analysis, and hopefully some of the adult returns will be measured as they come through the dams throughout the duration of the project.","","","Pacific Northwest National Lab., Richland, WA (US)","US Department of Energy (US)","","United States","2000-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Undergraduate Research; Journal Volume: 1; Other Information: PBD: 1 Dec 2000","","Medium: X; Size: vp.","","PNWD-SA-4661","AC06-76RL01830","TRN: US200404%%174","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","15001433","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/15001433","","Journal of Undergraduate Research","","1"

These CMPs, which include 29 small-diameter (below 107 cm) CMPs and 32 large-diameter (above 107 cm) CMPs, are located within a 10 km{sup 2} area encompassing the Van Normal Complex in the Northern San Fernando Valley, in Los Angeles, California. During the Northridge earthquake, ground movements were extensively recorded within the study area. Twenty-eight of the small-diameter CMPs performed well while the 32 large-diameter CMPs underwent performances ranging from no damage to complete collapse. The main cause of damage to the large-diameter CMPs was found to be the large ground strains. Based on this unprecedented data set, the factors controlling the seismic performance of the 32 large-diameter CMPs were identified and framed into a pseudostatic analysis method for evaluating the response of large diameter flexible underground pipes subjected to ground strain. The proposed analysis, which is applicable to transient and permanent strains, is capable of describing the observed performance of large-diameter CMPs during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It indicates that peak ground velocity is a more reliable parameter for analyzing pipe damage than is peak ground acceleration. Results of this field investigation and analysis are useful for the seismic design and strengthening of flexible buried conduits.","","","Dept. of Water and Power, Los Angeles, CA (US)","","","United States","2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 126; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 2000","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 28-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1090-0241; JGGEFK; TRN: IM200007%%343","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2000)126:1(28)","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20006287","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20006287","","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","1","126"

In turn, this causes large pressure and subpressure oscillations in turbine hydraulic system and it must be evaluated to avoid mechanical failures. In this context, this work analyses the discrete hydraulic systems with emphasis on hydraulic parameter analysis. The simulation used was developed based on analog mathematical models of transient phenomenon equations and on a hydro turbine model. The results were obtained by using a nonlinear analog-digital simulation method. Comparisons between results of a theoretical simulation of a literature example using the characteristics method and the results obtained with the present method are presented.

Compatibility for deflection and load transfer of adjacent panels was an integral part in designing individual structural slurry wall panels to behave as a system of panels. Design of the structural slurry walls utilized the computer program RIDO to analyze the deflection, shear, and moment under construction and operation conditions. Structural requirements for the design based on the RIDO analyses were checked using STAAD-III. A third program (SOILSTRUCT) was used to verify the 2D global deformation of the proposed structural slurry wall system. Analyses and design had to be completed in a short 9-month time frame.

Complicating constraints are relaxed by multipliers which are usually updated by a subgradient method (SGM). The SGM suffers from slow convergence caused by the non-differentiable characteristics of dual functions. This paper presents an algorithm that utilizes the Bundle Trust Region Method (BTRM) to update the multipliers within the Lagrangian relaxation framework. The BTRM is shown to converge faster than the SGM as well as other bundle type methods in optimizing non-differentiable dual functions. The application of BTRM for solving hydro subproblems results in greatly improved convergence over the SGM. Comparing BTRM with another bundle type method in updating the high level multipliers shows that better solution can be obtained by BTRM.","","","Univ. of Connecticut, Storrs, CT (US)","","","United States","1999-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1999","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1355-1361","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; ITPSEG; TRN: IM200010%%34","10.1109/59.801896","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20013166","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20013166","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)","4","14"

The Dual-Head Multibeam Sonar is an emerging technology for fisheries applications that addresses that requirement. It has two principal advantages over traditional hydroacoustic techniques: (1) it allows for simultaneous large-volume coverage of a region of interest, and (2) it affords 3-D tracking capability. The use of Dual-Head Multibeam Sonar in this study resulted in unprecedented insight into fine-scale smolt behavior upstream of a prototype surface collector at Bonneville Dam first powerhouse in 1998. Our results indicated that outmigrant juvenile salmon had an increased likelihood of milling or holding. This discovery will lead to better design criteria for future bypass and collector systems. Future fisheries multibeam sonar systems will likely be fully integrated systems with built-in real time tracking capability. These systems may be used to track targets relative to physical guidance structures or other behavior modifying stimuli such as light, turbulent flow, electrical/magnetic fields, or low-frequency sound and vibration.

Here, the authors present a second-order Godunov method for computing unsteady, one-dimensional wave problems with a fracture and cavitation in coupled solid-water-gas systems. The method employs a hydro-elasto-plastic body, the Tait equation, and the ideal gas law for solid, water, and gaseous phases, respectively, and models both fractures and cavities as vacuum zones with distinct borders. The numerical approach utilizes a Lagrangian formulation in conjunction with local solid-water-gas-vacuum Riemann problems, which have unique solutions and can be solved efficiently. The various phases are treated in a unified manner and no supplementary interface conditions are necessary for tracking material boundaries. Calculations are carried out for Riemann problems, wave propagation and reflection in a water-rock-air system, and spallation and cavitation in an explosion-steel-water-gas system. It is shown that the Godunov method has high resolution for shocks and phase interfaces, clearly resolves elastic and plastic waves, and successfully describes onset and propagation of fracture and cavitation zones.","","","","","","United States","1999-05-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Computational Physics; Journal Volume: 151; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 20 May 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 790-815","","","","Journal ID: JCTPAH; ISSN 0021-9991; TRN: IM9931%%168","10.1006/jcph.1999.6220","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355648","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355648","","Journal of Computational Physics","2","151"

Pregnant mice (with nest box) and non-pregnant mice (without nest box) each twice received a solution of 109CdCl2 by gavage. Dams with nest boxes fastidiously urinated and defecated outside the nest box. The percentage of gavage 109Cd dose recovered in dam feces was the same after the first gavage (mean6SE, with nest box through parturition, 95%66%; n=5) as after the second gavage (mean6SE, without nest box, 95%66%; n=5). Weights and percentage weight gain of mouse dams were independent of housing conditions (metabolic cage with next box vs. conventional polycarbonate caging). Furthermore, pup growth and survival were unaffected by the inclusion of the nest box or by its removal at 1 week after birth. Therefore, the described nest box provides for the first time a way to quantitatively collect excreta from mouse dams through pregnancy, parturition, and the early postnatal period. Additional experiments are needed to test its application to other animal species and strains of mice, including those with poor mothering behavior.","","","Argonne National Lab.

"Ranking procedure on maintenance tasks for monitoring of embankment dams","Andersen, G R; Chouinard, L E; Bouvier, C; Back, W E","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; MAINTENANCE; MONITORING; REPAIR; SAFETY ANALYSIS; FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS; COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN","A multistep strategy for the prioritization of maintenance and repair funds for the monitoring of embankment dams is proposed wherein the most important device in the worst condition is preferred. The strategy involves determining the importance of each device (in terms of dam safety) and measuring its condition through field inspections. A condition definition for each device is developed in terms of its ability to function optimally in its diagnostic role. Relative importance of the monitoring devices is defined in terms of diagnostic value and proceeds by considering: (1) the failure modes and their conditional probabilities; (2) adverse conditions and their conditional probabilities; (3) indicators that provide information on these adverse conditions and their relative diagnostic value; and (4) monitoring devices that are used to assess the presence of the indicators and their relative diagnostic value. A panel of dam safety experts is used to answer the questions necessary to implement this methodology through a process of expert elicitation. An interactive DOS-based C++ computer program has been developed to assist in the expert elicitation necessary to implement this methodology.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 247-259","","","","Journal ID: JGGEFK; ISSN 1090-0241; TRN: IM9926%%90","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1999)125:4(247)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350281","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350281","","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","4","125"

The purpose was to ensure optimum operation of the reservoir system, recognizing that needs, demands, and values change over time. The review resulted in a five-year, $50 million program to improve the quantity and quality of releases from 20 dams in the Tennessee Valley. TVA worked with state and federal resource agencies to define minimum flow and dissolved oxygen targets for each tailwater. Facilities and operating procedures were designed and installed to meet the target conditions. This paper describes the facilities, operating procedures, and performance of the reservoir release improvements. Alternative approaches, monitoring requirements, operational problems, and costs are discussed. Results from four years of operation are presented.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1-17","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: IM9926%%88","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1999)125:1(1)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350279","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350279","","Journal of Energy Engineering","1","125"

Complete collapse of the dam by overtopping was prevented through quick action of the dam owner by dumping clayey gravel on the lowest sections of the dam crest and opening the bottom outlet of the reservoir, thus efficiently lowering the water level. After the damages were sufficiently established and alternatives for restoration of the dam were evaluated, it was decided to construct a diaphragm wall through the damaged core in the central dam part as the impermeable dam element and to rebuild the central clay core at the dam abutments. Reconstruction works are described.","","","","","","United States","1999-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 280-288","","","","Journal ID: JGGEFK; ISSN 1090-0241; TRN: IM9926%%91","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1999)125:4(280)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","350282","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/350282","","Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering","4","125"

Public health interest largely has focused on vector-borne diseases, such as schistosomiasis, associated with reservoirs and irrigation projects. Large dams also influence health through changes in water and food security, increases in communicable diseases, and the social disruption caused by construction and involuntary resettlement. Communities living in close proximity to large dams often do not benefit from water transfer and electricity generation revenues.

Full penetration and partial penetration cut-offs were created at Ertan with jet-grouting techniques. Dewatering between the cofferdams and behind the cut-offs was successful and was maintained for more than 2 years against 40--70 m of water heads. This paper describes in detail the design rationale and main features, as well as the construction methods of both cut-offs.

"Leveling reliability in systems with large hydro resources","Gonzalez, C; Juan, J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; LOAD MANAGEMENT; INTERCONNECTED POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; RELIABILITY; DECISION MAKING; PLANNING","Reliability analysis of a generating system is established in terms of the reliability characteristics of the different units in the system and in terms of the demand of energy to be satisfied. When the analysis is performed for the long-term (one year or more duration periods), the maintenance needs of thermal units as well as the time distribution of resources for units with energy restrictions, must also be taken into account. This paper describes a method for determining the optimal strategy for allocating the yearly energy resulting from random water inflows to the different subperiods of a year so that the reliability for all the subperiods is leveled. A characteristic feature of the method is that the uncertainty inherent in forecasting future available hydroenergy is transferred to the reliability index. The procedure is illustrated by an example prepared using the Spanish generating system.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 23-28","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9915%%22","10.1109/59.744479","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","330506","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330506","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","14"
"Scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints","Guan, X; Svoboda, Al; Li, C","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; PLANNING; POWER GENERATION","An optimization-based algorithm is presented for scheduling hydro power systems with restricted operating zones and discharge ramping constraints. Hydro watershed scheduling problems are difficult to solve because many constraints, continuous and discrete, including hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs have to be considered. Restricted or forbidden operating zones as well as minimum generation limits of hydro units result in discontinuous preferred operating regions, and hinder direct applications of efficient continuous optimization methods such as network flow algorithms. Discharge ramping constraints due to navigational, environmental and recreational requirements in a hydro system add another dimension of difficulty since they couple generation or water discharge across time horizon. The key idea of this paper is to use additional sets of multipliers to relax discontinuous operating region and discharge ramping constraints on individual hydro units so that a two-level optimization structure is formed. The low level consists of a continuous discharge scheduling subproblem determining the generation levels of all units in the entire watershed, and a number of pure integer scheduling subproblems determining the hydro operating states, one for each unit. The discharge subproblem is solved by a network flow algorithm, and the integer scheduling problems are solved by dynamic programming with a small number of states and well-structured transitions. The two sets of subproblems are coordinated through multipliers updated at the high level by using a modified subgradient algorithm. After the dual problem converges, a feasible hydro schedule is obtained by using the same network flow algorithm with the operating states obtained, and operating ranges modified to guarantee satisfaction of ramping constraints.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1999-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 126-131","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9915%%25","10.1109/59.744500","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","330509","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/330509","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","14"

The issue arises because peak irrigation demands may not coincide with periods of peak demand for power. Water released for irrigation in the spring reduces the reservoir head and diminishes the capacity to generate power during summer peak demands. The optimization model is applied to irrigation districts in central California. Results show considerable deviation between the actual and the optimal allocations. Suboptimal behavior is linked to the districts` failure to articulate clear property rights to the scarce water resources.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; Journal Volume: 36; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 295-313","","","","Journal ID: JEEMDI; ISSN 0095-0696; TRN: IM9904%%78","10.1006/jeem.1998.1047","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","302290","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/302290","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management","3","36"

This desire is most likely to be present when the dispute exhibits ripeness and each party believes a bargained solution is the most cost-effective way to resolve differences. Structured interviews of participants in six Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hydropower licensing consultations were conducted to determine the level of need to negotiate for each party. The findings indicate that a need to negotiate is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for success. Several factors were associated with a need to negotiate: a weak BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement); a salient issue; participants` sense of efficacy; a sense of inevitability; professional roles encouraging negotiation; and disputes about facts as opposed to disputes about values. Participants` need to negotiate fluctuated throughout the process and intensified when questions were ripe: i.e., critical issues were debated or the regulatory process required action.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 877-886","","","","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 98:010668","10.1007/s002679900155","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659020","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659020","","Environmental Management","6","22"

Information exists on the microhabitat characteristics that define suitable salmon spawning habitat. However, traditional spawning habitat models that use these characteristics to predict available spawning habitat are restricted because they can not account for the heterogeneous nature of rivers. The authors present a conceptual spawning habitat model for fall chinook salmon that describes how geomorphic features of river channels create hydraulic processes, including hyporheic flows, that influence where salmon spawn in unconstrained reaches of large mainstem alluvial rivers. Two case studies based on empirical data from fall chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River are presented to illustrate important aspects of the conceptual model. The authors suggest that traditional habitat models and the conceptual model be combined to predict the limits of suitable fall chinook salmon spawning habitat. This approach can incorporate quantitative measures of river channel morphology, including general descriptors of geomorphic features at different spatial scales, in order to understand the processes influencing redd site selection and spawning habitat use. This information is needed in order to protect existing salmon spawning habitat in large rivers, as well as to recover habitat already lost.","","","","USDOE Bonneville Power Administration, Portland, OR (United States)","","United States","1998-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep-Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 655-669","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 98:010516","10.1007/s002679900137","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","655410","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/655410","","Environmental Management","5","22"

In particular, the electromechanical behavior of the overall turbine-alternator system, with respect to the electrical interconnected grid, may be theoretically studied, by using dynamic simulation models perfected with suitable details. The control systems performances can also be easily checked and fine-tuned, in presence of small and large perturbations, both in normal and in emergency operating conditions. The simulator STAR, which has been successfully used also for the specialists training, can be effectively considered as a real turbine-alternator system. In fact its inputs may be directly connected to the interfaces of the excitation system and turbine governor; moreover, the simulator provides in output the process variables with the suitable format requested by the different control apparatuses. The paper describes the main design topics of the STAR simulator, as mainly regards its hardware and software architecture and the model framework of the turbine (steam, hydro or gas), alternator (with static and rotating exciter) and grid interconnection.

Scoping can exert a strong influence in shaping a relevant impact assessment and increasing the probability of a process that satisfies stakeholders. This article explores key challenges facing scoping processes conducted in highly pluralistic settings. Elements of a notable case study--the scoping process conducted in 1992 for the proposed Great Whale Hydroelectric project in Northern Quebec--are discussed to illustrate innovative approaches. When used as a design process, scoping can ensure that EA reflects the different value sets and cultures that are at play, particularly where diverse knowledge systems and ways of describing environmental components and impacts exist. As it sets the stage for subsequent steps in the EA process, scoping needs to be a sufficiently broad umbrella that accommodates diverse approaches to identifying, classifying, and assessing impacts.","","","","","","United States","1998-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 18:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 351-369","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK","10.1016/S0195-9255(98)00013-4","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","6873954","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6873954","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","","18:4"

Accurate prediction of the jet trajectory and temperature dilution are necessary if discharge structures are to be designed to meet the appropriate standards. A modified version of the integral Fan-Brooks model has been used to calculate the horizontal penetration of inclined thermal buoyant water jets. The classical densimetric Froude number F{sub 0} is substituted by a Froude number F{sub a} based on the thermal expansion coefficient of water. Using the above model, a new equation is derived which can predict the horizontal penetration of the thermal jet at a given Froude number F{sub a} and discharge angle.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 561-569","","","","Journal ID: IHMTDL; ISSN 0735-1933; TRN: IM9820%%41","10.1016/S0735-1933(98)00043-8","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","624074","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/624074","","International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer","4","25"
"Design of small, hard-shell overflow dams on compressible foundations","Huang, B; Gu, S","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; CHINA; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; FOUNDATIONS","Considering the peculiarities of small hydropower station construction, the province of Hebei, China, has creatively built a series of hard-shell overflow dams on compressible foundations designed to meet the different geographic and geological characteristics of the sites. Structurally, locally collected stones are used as dam filter; then concrete or reinforced concrete is used to form a hard-shell overflow face slab. In upstream seepage control design, natural sealing methods are used to replace the artificial upstream blanket designs, in consideration of the river flow condition of high sediment density and high suspended sediment concentration. Based on the riverbed foundation characteristics and the hydrological properties, synthetic energy dissipation methods are used instead of the usual still plunge pool methods to simplify the dam structure and to reduce the construction cost. This is a theoretical study commissioned by the Hebei Bureau of Water Resources on the design of hard-shell overflow dams that have been constructed on compressible foundations. The major technical problems of constructing hard-shell dams on compressible foundations are (a) dam body stability and face slab structure stress analysis; (b) the influence of the settlement of the foundation and dam body on the face slab and the superstructure; (c) downstream energy dissipation and erosion control measures; and (d) seepage damage control measures of the dam body and foundation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 20-32","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: 98:005767","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1998)124:1(20)","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","619613","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/619613","","Journal of Energy Engineering","1","124"

"A new long-term hydro production scheduling method for maximizing the profit of hydroelectric systems","Yu, Z; Sparrow, F T; Bowen, B H","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; LOAD MANAGEMENT; SCHEDULES; PROFITS; THERMAL POWER PLANTS; CALCULATION METHODS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS","This paper presents a new long-term hydrothermal production scheduling method. The proposed method maximizes the profit of hydroelectric plants, based on the monthly energy requirement of the system, instead of minimizing the production cost of thermal units. It is shown that different forms of composite thermal marginal costs will lead to the same hydro production schedule. Thus a linear marginal cost, the simplest form, is sufficient for long-term hydrothermal scheduling. A linear hydro marginal profit is also sufficient for this purpose. An immediate conclusion is that an actual composite thermal cost function, which is complicated by thermal unit availability, may not be needed for the long-term optimal hydrothermal scheduling. Due to this simplification, traditional long and mid-term hydrothermal scheduling, a complicated problem, becomes easier to solve. The method can be used by the owners of independent hydro plants in a region for long-term hydroelectric scheduling under both deregulation and competition. A case study shows that the model allocates successfully and efficiently the hydroelectric resources to peak demand periods with negligible computation time.","","","","","","United States","1998-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 13; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 66-71","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9815%%60","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","605728","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/605728","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","13"

The objective of the survey was the detection in the switchyard foundations of subsurface cavities or other anomalous conditions that could threaten the stability of the switchyard structures. The survey consisted of 288 gravity stations in the downstream switchyard and 347 stations in the upstream switchyard. Significant anomalous areas in the switchyards were selected on the basis of residual gravity anomaly maps. These results were prioritized and used to guide an exploratory drilling program to investigate the cause of the anomalies. Highest-priority boring location recommendations were in negative gravity anomaly areas, since negative anomalies could be caused by actual cavities or low-density zones that might represent incipient cavity formation. Remaining boring locations were in positive anomaly areas for verification purposes. The results of the borings confirm the presence of cavities and soft zones indicative of cavity formation.","","","","","","United States","1998-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 63; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 95-103","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9814%%176","10.1190/1.1444331","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","599952","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/599952","","Geophysics","1","63"

The new design technique enhances fuzzy controllers with self-learning capability for achieving prescribed control objectives in a near optimal manner. The controller has flexibility for accepting more sensory information, with the main goal to improve the generator unit transients, by adjusting the exciter input, the wicket gate and runner blade positions. The developed ANFIS controller whose control signals are adjusted by using incomplete on-line measurements, can offer better damping effects to generator oscillations over a wide range of operating conditions, than conventional controllers. Digital simulations of hydropower plant equipped with low-head Kaplan turbine are performed and the comparisons of conventional excitation-governor control, state-feedback optimal control and ANFIS based output feedback control are presented. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and the robustness of the acquired neuro-fuzzy controller, the controller has been implemented on a complex high-order non-linear hydrogenerator model.","","","","","","United States","1997-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 375-381","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9813%%54","10.1109/60.638941","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","603825","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/603825","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","12"

This paper concentrates on the solution methodology for hydro subproblems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints. Continuous reservoir dynamics and constraints, discontinuous operating regions, discrete operating states, and hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs are considered in an integrated fashion. The key idea is to substitute out the reservoir dynamics and to relax the reservoir level constraints by using another set of multipliers, making a hydro subproblem unit-wise and stage-wise decomposable. The optimal generation level for each operating state at each hour can be obtained simply by minimizing a single variable function. Dynamic programming is then applied to optimize the operating states across the planning horizon with a small number of well-structured transitions. A modified subgradient algorithm is used to update multipliers. After the dual problem converges, the feasible solution to the hydro power subsystem is obtained by using a network flow algorithm, with operating states obtained in the dual solutions, and possibly adjusted by heuristics. Numerical testing based on practical system data sets show that this method is efficient and effective for dealing with hydrothermal systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1775-1780","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9804%%9","10.1109/59.627890","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","563876","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/563876","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","12"

The harmonic distortion level at each bus of the power plant was very high. Especially, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current at the lighting feeder reached up to 184%, so that power fuses were burned out. At first a 5 mH reactor was inserted in the SFC feeder and a 5th order and high pass filter was installed. However, the harmonic distortion levels were still too high, but there is no space for additional higher-order filters. Finally, the SFC is fed with an individual transformer, and the harmonic disturbance problem is avoided.

Load demand as well as generation, transmission and interchange operational constraints are satisfied. Hydroelectric generation characteristics are described in detail. Power loss in hydroelectric generation is associated with a reduction in turbine-generator efficiency and effective water head. The latter is due to an increase in tailrace elevation and penstock head loss. Power loss upon transmission is calculated as a quadratic function of active power flow, as represented in a DC load flow model. The predispatch model was evaluated under typical operational conditions, achieving significant savings with respect to actual operation.","","","","","","United States","1997-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1220-1227","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9746%%23","10.1109/59.630464","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","538098","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/538098","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","3","12"

"Hungry water: Effects of dams and gravel mining on river channels","Kondolf, G M","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; HABITAT; SALMON; RIVERS; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS; SEDIMENTS","Rivers transport sediment from eroding uplands to depositional areas near sea level. If the continuity of sediment transport is interrupted by dams or removal of sediment from the channel by gravel mining, the flow may become sediment-starved (hungry water) and prone to erode the channel bed and banks, producing channel incision (downcutting), coarsening of bed material, and loss of spawning gravels for salmon and trout (as smaller gravels are transported without replacement from upstream), Gravel is artificially added to the River Rhine to prevent further incision and to many other rivers in attempts to restore spawning habitat. It is possible to pass incoming sediment through some small reservoirs, thereby maintaining the continuity of sediment transport through the system. Damming and mining have reduced sediment delivery from rivers to many coastal areas, leading to accelerated beach erosion. Sand and gravel are mined for construction aggregate from river channel and floodplains. In-channel mining commonly causes incision, which may propagate up- and downstream of the mine, undermining bridges, inducing channel instability, and lowering alluvial water tables. Floodplain gravel pits have the potential to become wildlife habitat upon reclamation, but may be captured by the active channel and thereby become instream pits. Management of sand and gravel in rivers must be done on a regional basis, restoring the continuity of sediment transport where possible and encouraging alternatives to river-derived aggregate sources. 80 refs., 17 figs.","","","","","","United States","1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 533-551","","","","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 98:000535-0002","10.1007/s002679900048","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","567935","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/567935","","Environmental Management","4","21"

The combined hydrothermal unit commitment problem is solved by a decomposition and coordination approach. Thermal unit commitment is solved using a conventional Lagrangian relaxation technique. The hydro system is divided into watersheds, which are further broken down into reservoirs. The watersheds are optimized by Network Flow Programming (NFP). Priority-list-based Dynamic Programming is used to solve the Hydro Unit Commitment (HUC) problem at the reservoir level. A successive approximation method is used for updating the marginal water values (Lagrange multipliers) to improve the hydro unit commitment convergence, due to the large size and multiple couplings of water conservation constraints. The integration of the hydro unit commitment into the existing Hydro-Thermal Optimization (HTO) package greatly improves the quality of its solution in the PG and E power system.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 764-769","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9730%%22","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492144","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492144","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"
"Variable splitting applied to modelling of start-up costs in short term hydro generation scheduling","Nilsson, O; Sjelvgren, D","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; COST ESTIMATION; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; POWER GENERATION; START-UP; OPERATION; SCHEDULES","In this paper a mixed-integer hydro electric power model for short-term planning is discussed. The purpose of the model is to represent the generation characteristic of the hydro plants accurately. In the modelling part the paper focuses on two requests stated from power producers in an earlier study. First, it is desirable to operate on points with good efficiency. Second, start-ups and shut-downs of the units should not be carried out too often, since this is related to a cost. The problem is decomposed into a subproblem for each hydro power plant by relaxing the power balance equation and using variable splitting. The advantage of this relaxation is that the authors can use network programming and dynamic programming methods, which have proved to work well for power system planning issues. The relaxation used in this work has not been applied in the field before. The master problem is solved by a subgradient technique. Finally, a numerical example from a part of the Swedish power system illustrates the technique.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: DN: Presented at the 1996 IEEE/PES summer meeting, July 28--August 1, 1996, Denver, CO (US); PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 770-775","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9730%%23","10.1109/59.589678","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","492145","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/492145","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","12"

Gate inspection was initiated in response to a failure of similar gates at Folsom Dam. The approach involved measuring the actual forces on the gates and comparing them to original model study parameters, rather than the traditional method of building a hydraulic model. Measurement and visual inspection was completed in one day and had no effect on migration flows. Two problems with the thrust bearing cooling system are described. First, whenever a generating unit was taken off line, cooling water continued circulating and lowered oil temperatures. The second problem involved silt buildup in flow measuring device tubes on the cooling water system. Modifications to correct cooling system problems and associated costs are outlined.","","","","","","United States","1997-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 16; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. SR22-SR26","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 97:003019-0007","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","535178","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/535178","","Hydro Review","2","16"

These generators suffered from numerous water leaks at and around the bar water connections, resulting in a significant number of forced repair outages that were increasing in frequency. The US Bureau of Reclamation, in conjunction with the Bonneville Power Administration, decided to overhaul these machines. The design from Siemens Power Corp. provided state-of-the-art materials and included a rating increase from 700 to 805 MW, which would make these three machines the highest output single-unit hydrogenerators in the world. The upgrade was to be accomplished with only the replacement of the stator components; there would be no changes to the rotating element. The cost for all three machines is approximately $27.5 million. This project is described in this paper.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Welding Journal; Journal Volume: 76; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 27-30","","","","Journal ID: WEJUA3; ISSN 0043-2296; TRN: IM9722%%259","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","471136","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/471136","","Welding Journal","3","76"

It is shown that the adaptive technique, in this case genetic algorithm based, was capable of identifying the hydrogenerator system and following plant parameter changes while the plant operated under conditions of sufficient frequency excursions. These conditions include off-line and isolated network operation where effective control is critical.","","","","","","United States","1997-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 7. biennial IEEE conference on electromagnetic field computation, Okayama (Japan), 18-21 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 60-65","","CONF-9603111-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9720%%335","10.1109/60.577281","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","465120","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/465120","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","12"

"Hydro unit start-up costs and their impact on the short term scheduling strategies of Swedish power producers","Nilsson, O; Sjelvgren, D","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; POWER SYSTEMS; START-UP; ECONOMICS; OPERATION","This paper is about start-up costs of hydro power units. In the introduction the authors address three questions about start-ups of hydro power units: What causes the costs in the start-up? How much does a start-up cost? How do start-ups effect the short-term scheduling strategies of power producers in Sweden? In order to answer these questions, they have interviewed employees working with generation planning at the eight largest power producers in Sweden. They found five aspects causing start-up costs: Loss of water during maintenance; wear and tear of the windings due to temperature changes during the start-up; wear and tear of mechanical equipment during the start-up; malfunctions in the control equipment during the start-up; and loss of water during the start-up. The aspects causing the largest costs are maintenance due to the wear and tear and the unavailability and personnel costs due to malfunctions in the control equipment. The cost of lost water is usually small. The authors` conclusions are the following: (1) Start-ups cost. The cost will depend on the nominal power of the unit and the unit model. (2) The majority of the power producers consider start-ups in their planning. (3) There is a need for better knowledge about start-up cost. (4) There is a need for planning software which considers start-up costs of hydro units.","","","","","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 38-44","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9727%%52","10.1109/59.574921","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","484884","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/484884","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","1","12"
"Analytical model for particle migration within base soil-filter system","Indraratna, B; Vafai, F","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; CRACK PROPAGATION; EROSION; LEAKS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; FOUNDATIONS; MECHANICAL FILTERS; PORE PRESSURE","Cracking of impervious dam cores can occur due to differential settlement, construction deficiencies, or hydraulic fracturing. When leakage occurs through a cracked core, leakage channels may erode. The studies referred to in this paper have mostly found that for gradients typical of dams, erosion in cracks or other leakage channels usually occurs quickly and clogs the filter in the area of the crack, which is beneficial in practice. This study highlights a mathematical (analytical) model simulating the filtration phenomenon applicable to a base soil-filter system, incorporating the hydraulic conditions and the relevant material properties such as porosity, density, friction angle, and the shape and distribution of particles. The model is founded on the concept of critical hydraulic gradient derived from limit equilibrium considerations, where the migration of particles is assumed to occur under applied hydraulic gradients exceeding this critical value. The rate of particle erosion, and hence, the filter effectiveness is quantified on the basis of mass and momentum conservation theories. By dividing the base soil and filter domains into discrete elements, the model is capable of predicting the time-dependent particle gradation and permeability of each element, thereby the amount of material eroded from or retained within the system. Laboratory tests conducted on a fine base material verify the validity of the model. The model predictions are also compared with the available empirical recommendations, including the conventional grading ratios.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1997-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 123; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 100-109","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9715%%304","10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(1997)123:2(100)","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","452272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/452272","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","2","123"

This escalation of commitment transcends both sectorial and national boundaries. Preeminent examples include controversial nuclear projects in the US, hydroelectric projects like the Three Gorges Dam in China, and transport projects like the Chunnel and the Concorde. In this article, the authors examine the experience of Hydro-Quebec with the Great Whale Project. They argue that Hydro-Quebec escalated its commitment even after serious questions emerged about its environmental impacts and economic feasibility, because of (1) its earlier success with large projects, (2) its engineering culture`s norms for consistency, and (3) its role in the government`s desire for economic and cultural autonomy. Finally, they discuss the changes that are necessary to break commitments to such projects.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 19-38","","","","Journal ID: EIARDK; ISSN 0195-9255; TRN: 98:003663","10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00073-X","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","571672","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/571672","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review","1","17"

According to Synergics` president Wayne Rogers, the alliance was created out of a familiar frame of reference. For the past 15 years. Synergics has had a strong and ongoing vendor-owner relationship with Voith, Rogers says. However, a closer examination of today`s hydropower industry from a macro perspective reveals potential markets are becoming increasingly competitive as well as international.

"Effective risk management","Ball, C J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 29 ENERGY PLANNING AND POLICY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; CONSTRUCTION; FINANCING; RISK ASSESSMENT; PROGRAM MANAGEMENT","Most independent power financial proposals contain one or more elements of a non-recourse nature. Traditionally, this means prospective lenders will not have a substantial corporate credit or state guarantee standing behind a project loan, which forces attention to be focused on a single asset as the security and debt repayment source. While this major risk remains present, if properly understood, uncertainty can be mitigated and managed, including financial and development hazards inherent in hydropower projects. The specific risk points that a project developer or sponsor must satisfy from the lender`s purposes are numerous. However, they can be grouped primarily into seven key risk areas: project profile, site securing, power sales agreements, government agreements, in-service management, construction and insurance. While a developer strives for a minimum internal rate of return of at least 20 percent, the lender`s expectations are much more modest. Often, developers need to place themselves in the proverbial shoes of the other entity, namely the independent lender, whose only attraction may be some interest, fee income and placement of capital in a safe investment which provides a return in an orderly and uninterrupted manner. Only then is it possible to objectively view and effectively manage the risks mentioned earlier.","","","","","","United States","1997-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan-Feb 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 32-34","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 97:002896-0006","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","518408","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/518408","","Independent Energy","1","27"

Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers, tributaries to the San Joaquin River, California. The authors evaluated the planning, design and performance of the Riffle 1B reconstruction on the Merced River. This typical of the nine individual riffle reconstructions completed to date. involving excavation of the existing channel bed (here, to 0.6 m) and back-filling with smaller gravels believed to be more suitable for salmon spawning. Project documents were reviewed, agency staff interviewed, and field surveys conducted to document channel conditions in 1994 for comparison with the project as constructed in 1990. The project planning and design did not consider the site`s geomorphic context nor processes of erosion and sediment transport under the current flow regime. As a consequence, spawning-sized gravel placed in the channel was scoured and transported through the site at a flow with a return period of 1.5 years. The need for spawning habitat enhancement in the Merced River is questionable, but if such projects are to be built, the authors recommend that the project planning and design consider the site`s geomorphic context and acknowledge the need for and provide funds for project maintenance, and that the performance of completed projects be systematically monitored and evaluated. 32 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 899-912","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 97:001163-0001","10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0899:SSHROT>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","486442","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/486442","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","6","125"
"Hydropower, adaptive management, and biodiversity","Wieringa, M J; Morton, A G","13 HYDRO ENERGY; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; DECISION MAKING; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS; REMEDIAL ACTION; RIVERS","Adaptive management is a policy framework within which an iterative process of decision making is allowed based on the observed responses to and effectiveness of previous decisions. The use of adaptive management allows science-based research and monitoring of natural resource and ecological community responses, in conjunction with societal values and goals, to guide decisions concerning man`s activities. The adaptive management process has been proposed for application to hydropower operations at Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, a situation that requires complex balancing of natural resources requirements and competing human uses. This example is representative of the general increase in public interest in the operation of hydropower facilities and possible effects on downstream natural resources and of the growing conflicts between uses and users of river-based resources. This paper describes the adaptive management process, using the Glen Canyon Dam example, and discusses ways to make the process work effectively in managing downstream natural resources and biodiversity. 10 refs., 2 figs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: Managing for biodiversity: emerging ideas for the electric utility industry conference, Williamsburg, VA (United States), 19-20 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 831-840","","CONF-960329-","","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 96:006484-0006","10.1007/BF01205963","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","420425","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420425","","Environmental Management","6","20"
"Dams and downstream aquatic biodiversity: Potential food web consequences of hydrologic and geomorphic change","Power, M E; Dietrich, W E; Finlay, J C","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; RIVERS; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS","Responses of rivers and river ecosystems to dams are complex and varied, as they depend on local sediment supplies, geomorphic constraints, climate, dam structure and operation, and key attributes of the biota. Therefore, {open_quotes}one-size-fits-all{close_quotes} prescriptions cannot substitute for local knowledge in developing prescriptions for dam structure and operation to protect local biodiversity. One general principle is self-evident: that biodiversity is best protected in rivers where physical regimes are the most natural. A sufficiently natural regime of flow variation is particularly crucial for river biota and food webs. We review our research and that of others to illustrate the ecological importance of alternating periods of low an high flow, of periodic bed scour, and of floodplain inundation and dewatering. These fluctuations regulate both the life cycles of river biota and species interactions in the food webs that sustain them. Even if the focus of biodiversity conservation efforts is on a target species rather than whole ecosystems, a food web perspective is necessary, because populations of any species depend critically on how their resources, prey, and potential predators also respond to environmental change. In regulated rivers, managers must determine how the frequency, magnitude, and timing of hydrologic events interact to constrain or support species and food webs. Simple ecological modeling, tailored to local systems, may provide a framework and some insight into explaining ecosystem response to dams and should give direction to mitigation efforts. 78 refs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 6; Conference: Managing for biodiversity: emerging ideas for the electric utility industry conference, Williamsburg, VA (United States), 19-20 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov-Dec 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 887-895","","CONF-960329-","","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 96:006484-0010","10.1007/BF01205969","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","420429","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420429","","Environmental Management","6","20"
"A coordinated approach for real-time short term hydro scheduling","Tufegdzic, N; Frowd, R J; Stadlin, W O","20 FOSSIL-FUELED POWER PLANTS; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; POWER SYSTEMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; OPERATION; ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; TASMANIA","The paper describes a coordinated approach to short-term hydro scheduling and dispatch that has been developed as a part of the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission`s (HEC) new Energy Management System (EMS), which is being delivered by Landis and Gyr Energy Management. Tasmania`s hydro generation system consists of 40 reservoirs in six river catchments. The daily water release for each plant is scheduled using the HEC`s mid-term operation policy. The Hydro Scheduling and Commitment (HSC) function schedules the hydro units on a half hourly basis so that the allocated water release maximizes the energy production. This maximization of energy production is achieved by maximizing the head and this ensures that operation is always as close as possible to maximum efficiency. Mixed Integer Linear Programming is used with a detailed model of the interconnected hydro system to determine the half-hourly operation schedule. The Hydro Economic Dispatch (HED) function is used to implement the schedules produced by HSC in the real-time operation. The HED also uses a detailed model of the hydro system with a Linear Programming algorithm to ensure that each unit operates as close as possible to its head-dependent theoretical maximum efficiency point while meeting the desired storage levels specified by the HSC solution. HSC and HED have been tested against a number of operational scenarios and when it is fully integrated within the new EMS it is expected to yield annual stored energy savings up to 0.5% through more efficient hydro-electric system operation. It is expected to also provide additional savings by fostering improvements to the mid-term operating plan.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1698-1704","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%11","10.1109/59.544630","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","435353","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435353","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"

In addition to economic considerations, oscillatory stability of the system as affected by the operation of pumped-storage units is of major concern. To achieve a secure as well as economical dispatching schedule for the pumped-storage units, differential dynamic programming is first employed to reach a preliminary schedule in which total fuel cost of the thermal units over the study period is minimized. Oscillatory stability analysis of the system under the preliminary schedule is then performed by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for all electromechanical modes. Sensitivities of the eigenvalues for the poorly-damped inter-area mode with respect to individual generator outputs are evaluated. Then a systematic approach based on linear programming is presented to refine the preliminary schedule in order to improve the damping for the inter-area mode. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by short term operational planning of Taiwan power system.","","","","National Science Council, Taipei (Taiwan, Province of China)","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) Winter meeting, Baltimore, MD (United States), 21-25 Jan 1996; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1705-1710","","CONF-960111-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9710%%12","10.1109/59.544631","","2016-05-11T00:00:00Z","435354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/435354","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","11"

Because of the very small and relatively flat land area of Singapore, a conventional surface pumped storage plant is not feasible. A pumped storage plant can be constructed here by siting the upper reservoir in one of the many abandoned granite quarries and by placing the lower reservoir and the powerhouse underground in the Bukit Timah granite, which is sound, massive and impervious. The capital costs for a pumped storage plant could be the same as those of an oil-fired plant of a comparable size. When the very high cost of land in Singapore is taken into account, an underground pumped storage scheme for peaking purposes becomes attractive. 7 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 485-489","","","","Journal ID: TUSTEQ; ISSN 0886-7798; TRN: 97:001726-016","10.1016/S0886-7798(96)00035-1","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","447225","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/447225","","Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology","4","11"

The Cotingo Dam illustrates the difficulty of translating into practice the principles of economic and environmental assessment. Examination of the financial arguments for the Cotingo Dam indicates that justifications in this sphere are insufficient to explain why the project is favored over other alternatives and points to political factors as the best explanation of the project`s high priority. Strong pressure from political and entrepreneurial interest groups almost invariably dominates decision making in Amazonia. The analysis indicates the inherent tendency of the present system to produce decisions in favor of large construction projects at the expense of the environment and local peoples. The requirements intended to assure proper weight for these concerns, such as the report on environmental impacts (RIMA) and the public hearing, fail to serve this role.

As the first step of prediction, the authors constructed the scenario from an estimation of the cavity generation rate to the prediction of impact force spectrum, including the estimations of collapsing cavity number and impact pressure. The prediction was compared with measurements of impact force spectra on a partially cavitating hydrofoil. A good quantitative agreement was obtained between the prediction and the experiment. However, the present method predicted a larger effect of main flow velocity than that observed.

Abundance of northern squawfish with transmitters peaked in July, appeared to be inversely related to river discharge, and occurred after most juvenile salmonids had moved past Lower Granite Dam. Distributions of northern squawfish in the tailrace varied between and within years and shifted in relation to changing flow patterns, water temperatures, and diel cycles, but northern squawfish consistently used low-velocity habitats. Changes in distribution and abundance of northern squawfish in the tailrace suggest that juvenile salmonids migrating in the spring and early summer will be less affected by predation than juveniles migrating later in the summer. Northern squawfish did not concentrate downstream from an infrequently used juvenile bypass outfall, but several individuals were repeatedly found 30 m upstream from the bypass outfall, near the continuous discharge from a large pipe. Northern squawfish habituation to the predictable discharge suggests that predation could become a problem at the bypass outfall if it were used regularly to return juvenile migrants to the river. 40 refs., 8 figs.","","","","","","United States","1996-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 780-793","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 97:000405-0001","10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0780:MONSIT>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","459036","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/459036","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","5","125"

Welding of the runners produces considerable gases that must be removed from the area for safety reasons. While it is possible to utilize portable ventilating equipment and air packs (if required). By closing the manways to the penstock and opening the manways to the draft tube, an updraft is created which takes the gases away from personnel and out vents in the penstock. This has been used several times at Libby Dam without any need for portable ventilation or breathing equipment.","","","","","","United States","1996-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 5; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 108","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 96:004797-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","381257","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/381257","","Hydro Review","5","15"

Both the Los Angeles Dam and North Dike of the LAR slightly moved and settled, and sustained small superficial cracks. The North Dike underwent a noticeable increase in seepage, without significantly impeding normal reservoir operations. The Northridge Earthquake uplifted and shifted the foundation of the LAR by 30 cm, and provided the authors with a unique example of tectonic effects on embankments. In contrast to the LAR, which performed well, the nearby rolled fill dike of the Power Plant Tailrace slowly failed by piping due to transverse cracks and differential lateral spreading induced by liquefaction.

In 1994, these earth dams, which were out of service and retained only a few meters of water, extensively cracked and settled due to the liquefaction of their hydraulic fill. The Lower San Fernando Dam moved over 15 cm upstream as the hydraulic fill liquefied beneath its upstream slope. The Upper San Fernando Dam moved even more and deformed in a complicated three-dimensional pattern.

The viscous flow in the rotating field can be simulated well in the design flow operating condition as well as in the off-design conditions in which a strong vortex occurs due to the separation near the leading edge. Because the code employs an implicit algorithm and a wall function near the wall, it does not require a large CPU time. It can therefore be used on a small computer such as the desk-top workstation, and is available for use as a design tool. The same kind of algorithm that is used for compressible flows has been found to be appropriate for the simulation of complex incompressible flows in the field of turbomachinery.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 285-291","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9634%%28","10.1115/1.2817375","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","267956","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/267956","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","2","118"

The generating facilities include a mix of nuclear, fossil-fired, and hydroelectric units. Not unlike other utilities, advanced maintenance welding technology is crucial to maintain the equipment in the most reliable, safe, and economic manner. Since the late 1970s, one focus at Ontario Hydro has been the ability to weld repair heavy section components without postweld heat treatment (PWHT). Temper-bead procedures developed by Ontario Hydro have been used successfully for over a decade to repair carbon steel components. Recently, considerable efforts have been spent to expand the scope of the temper-bead techniques and other self-tempering welding techniques for low-alloy steel, P4 (1.25Cr-0.5Mo) and P5A (2.25Cr-1Mo) materials. To perform successful repairs in these components, it is essential to understand the welding metallurgy of these materials and welding process variables.

In fact it is well known that soil permeability varies randomly from point to point in space and an improved earth dam model should incorporate this variability. In this paper the soil permeability in an earth dam of variable geometry is viewed as a weakly stationary spatially random field following a lognormal distribution with prescribed mean, variance, and spatial correlation structure. The mean and variance of the total flow rate through the dam and free surface drawdown are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. A simplified empirical approach to the prediction of the mean and variance of the flow rate is presented to allow these quantities to be approximated easily and without resorting to simulation.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 427-436","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9646%%338","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1996)122:6(427)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","390053","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/390053","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","6","122"

A combination of limnological sampling, experimentation, and simulation modeling was used to assess effects of lake fertilization and kokanee reduction on growth and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon. Juvenile sockeye salmon from a broodstock of this endangered species are being introduced into the lakes from 1995 to 1998. Results of our analyses indicated that several lakes were suitable for receiving broodstock progeny. Field experimentation and simulation modeling indicated that lake fertilization, coupled with a program of kokanee reduction, provided the management option most likely to enhance the survival of stocked juvenile sockeye salmon. Simulation models that encompass physiological requirements, ecological interactions, and life-history consequences could be used as templates to help develop recovery plans for other endangered fishes. 4 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fisheries; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 18-25","","","","Journal ID: FISHDN; ISSN 0363-2415; TRN: 96:006219-0001","10.1577/1548-8446(1996)021<0018:SGAPOE>2.0.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404798","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404798","","Fisheries","6","21"

The particular runner was originally repaired in 1990 with the application of a layer of beaded epoxy to areas of severe cavitation on the suction side of the blades on the upper runner. A year later, the runner was inspected, with no damage to the epoxy. In June of 1994, the runner was again inspected, and this and the most recent inspection shows that the epoxy coating is holding up well. The last inspection did show the beginnings on some erosion of the repair material. Based on this long-term series of inspections, maintenance recommendations are set forth.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 59","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 96:004056-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","376804","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/376804","","Hydro Review","3","15"

By applying the tabu search, a decomposition method and taking into account the nonlinearity of time varying starting costs, an effective algorithm is proposed to increase the computing accuracy of the dynamic scheduling process. The proposed approach may start from any traditional scheduling method proposed earlier, and improve the sub-optimal solution by a neighborhood search method. In this regard, additional constraints can be added to the problem formulation which provides a fast scheduling or rescheduling solution to large scale hydro-thermal systems. The results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and reliable.","","","","","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 968-974","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9633%%209","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","264273","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264273","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","11"
"Genetic aided scheduling of hydraulically coupled plants in hydro-thermal coordination","Chen, P H; Chang, H C","24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; OPERATION; POWER SYSTEMS; THERMAL POWER PLANTS; CHINA","Scheduling of hydraulically coupled plants (HCPs) has been reckoned as one of the most difficult parts of the problem of hydro-thermal coordination. This paper presents an efficient approach to the 24-hour ahead generation scheduling of HCPs based on the genetic algorithm (GA). In this paper, the difficult water balance constraints caused by hydraulic coupling are embedded and satisfied throughout the proposed encoding and decoding algorithm. The optimal schedules of both HCPs and thermal units are concurrently obtained within the evolutionary process of artificial chromosomes. Significantly, neither reservoir successive approximation nor hydro-thermal iteration is needed. The proposed approach is applied to an actual utility system of three HCPs and 22 thermal units with great success. Results show that the new approach obtains a more highly optimal solution than the conventional dynamic programming with successive approximation (DPSA) method.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 11; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: May 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 975-981","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9633%%210","10.1109/59.496183","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","264274","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/264274","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","2","11"

The size of the problem and the structure of the constraints are adequate for the use of decomposition techniques and parallel computation tools. The authors present computational results for both sequential and parallel implementation versions of the codes, running on a cluster of workstations.

Second, both inviscid and viscous three-dimensional flow analyses have been made, so as to predict the flow behavior in the same domain. Comparison of the measured pressure distributions to the predicted pressure distributions has been made to study the usefulness of the present simulations. It can be pointed out that a global analysis which includes a runner flow passage, except runner blades, is necessary to predict the three-dimensional flow characteristics and that inviscid flow analysis has the capability of good prediction for flow without separation. Viscous flow analysis gives similar results, though it is necessary to investigate further the improvement of prediction accuracy. Flow characteristics around the stayvanes and the guidevanes are also discussed.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 110-115","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9618%%102","10.1115/1.2817487","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","215421","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/215421","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","1","118"

"Analysis of potential impacts to resident fish from Columbia River System Operation alternatives","Geist, D R; Vail, L W; Epstein, D J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; COLUMBIA RIVER; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; FISHES; POPULATION DYNAMICS; WATER RESERVOIRS; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; DAMS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS","The US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bonneville Power Administration initiated the Columbia River System Operation Review (SOR) in 1990. The SOR will assist agencies in comparing the benefits and risks to Columbia River uses and natural resources from alternative strategies for using Columbia River water. Focusing on 14 federal dams within the basin, the agencies are attempting to improve on the efficient and coordinated use of the Columbia River system. An initial screening of all potential strategies of reservoir operation was necessary to reduce the number of possibilities to a limited set for detailed analysis. To that end, the Resident Fish Work Group of the SOR developed spreadsheet models capable of assessing the impacts of different management strategies on resident fish at six storage reservoirs. The models include biological, physical, and hydrological relationships important to resident fish specific to each reservoir. Alternatives that kept the reservoirs near full pool and held stable during the growing season resulted in positive benefits to resident fish at all locations modeled. Conversely, alternatives designed to improve anadromous fish survival with increased instream flow generally had a negative impact on the resident fish in the reservoirs modeled. The models developed for resident fish in the screening analysis phase of the SOR were useful in assessing the relative impact to resident fish from a large number of alternatives. The screening analysis demonstrated that future analytical efforts must consider trade-offs among river uses/resource groups, among reservoirs throughout the basin, and among resident fish species within a reservoir.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 20; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 275-288","","","AC06-76RL01830","Journal ID: EMNGDC; ISSN 0364-152X; TRN: 96:002233-0001","10.1007/BF01204012","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","244009","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/244009","","Environmental Management","2","20"

The principal goals of this exercise were to define depths to the bedrock, bedrock relief, geologic structures, define the nature of the superficial deposit, and select probable minor and major axes for hydroelectric power dams. The aeromagnetic map shows that the basement rocks trend roughly northeast-southwest, which correlates with the strike of foliation measurements made on rock outcrops along the river channel. A network of cross cutting lineaments, suspected to be faults/fractures that trend approximately northeast/southwest and northwest/southeast, was also delineated from the magnetic map. The depths to the bedrock estimated from resistivity depth sounding data at site 1 generally vary from 1--53.1 m. Depths to the bedrock estimated at site 2 range from 1.9--19.5 m. The superficial deposit varies from clay to sandy clay, to clayey sand (with boulders in places), and to sand and laterite. The bedrock relief is relatively flat and gently undulates along most of the traverses, with an overall dip towards the river channel. Traverses E-F or I-J at site 1 and K-L at site 2 are probable dame axes. These traverses are characterized by relatively thin overburden thicknesses and rock heads dipping toward the river channel, thereby reducing the likelihood of water seepages from the flanks of the proposed dam axes.","","","","","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysics; Journal Volume: 61; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar-Apr 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 349-356","","","","Journal ID: GPYSA7; ISSN 0016-8033; TRN: IM9619%%115","10.1190/1.1443963","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","218394","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/218394","","Geophysics","2","61"

This type of turbine, although primarily an impulse type, is suitable for operation at low and medium heads. This article describes the effect of using different sizes of draft tubes on the performance of a 5-kW cross-flow turbine. An effort is made to arrive at an optimum size for the particular turbine tested, as the existing draft tube (203 mm) had an adverse effect on the performance at higher heads. The study involved variation of different performance parameters such as output, efficiency, runaway speed, and speed ratio for four different cases, viz., without the draft tube and with three different sizes of draft tubes (203, 250, and 300 mm) in the head range 3--9 m. The investigation shows that a properly sized draft tube enhances the efficiency of a cross-flow turbine over the entire space of its operation.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; Journal Volume: 18; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 143-149","","","","Journal ID: EGYSAO; ISSN 0090-8312; TRN: IM9619%%325","10.1080/00908319608908755","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","218604","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/218604","","Energy Sources","2","18"

Axisymmetric specimens of dense Cambria sand were tested in drained triaxial compression tests between confining pressures of 0.05 and 52 MPa. Drained triaxial extension tests between confining pressures of 0.25 and 52 MPa were also performed. As the confining pressure is increased, it was found that the stress-strain curve, and volumetric and axial strains to failure rapidly increased at a certain stress magnitude. This was shown to be directly related to a rapid increase in particle crushing. Beyond a certain higher value of stress magnitude, the stress-strain curves steepen, and the volumetric and axial strains to failure decrease. This was also shown to be directly related to the cessation of particle crushing and is typified by a zero rate of volume change at failure. The Mohr-Coulomb secant friction angle was found to be related to the rate of volume change at failure, whether the soil was dilatant or highly contractive and subject to large amounts of particle crushing.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 109-119","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9616%%183","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1996)122:2(109)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","207855","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207855","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","2","122"

The apparatus was instrumented with strain gauges such that lateral soil stresses, and therefore K{sub 0}, could be inferred from measured circumferential strains. Three different initial densities of quartz, Cambria, and gypsum sands were tested and it was found that the effect of initial density was eliminated at high stress magnitudes. This stress magnitude was higher for mineralogically harder grains than for softer grains. The inferred values of K{sub 0} for the mineralogically harder Cambria sand was found to be constant at high pressures, but slightly below that indicates by Jaky`s equation. However, the softer gypsum sand indicated increasing values of K{sub 0} as the stress magnitude increased. This apparently was caused by inelastic, viscous flow during shearing.","","","","","","United States","1996-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 122; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 147-155","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9616%%185","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1996)122:2(147)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","207857","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/207857","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","2","122"

Two types of soil structures are considered. First is the case in which the gas inclusions, of size much smaller than the average particle size, are entrapped in the water phase. Second is the case in which the comparatively larger gas bubbles are embedded in the saturated soil skeleton. The fluid phases are assumed to be separated by boundaries across which discontinuities in pressure exist due to surface tension. The soil is treated as a three-phase composite medium and the mechanical properties are described in terms of average stress/strain measures in all constituents.

"Fuzzy learning decomposition for the scheduling of hydroelectric power systems","Saad, M; Bigras, P; Turgeon, A; Duquette, R","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING; QUEBEC; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; NEURAL NETWORKS","This paper presents a nonlinear multivariable fitting model to decompose the optimal policies obtained by dynamic programming of a unique aggregated reservoir. The nonlinear functions are generated using radial basis functions (RBF) neural networks. In this method the potential energy of all the reservoirs in the hydropower system is added to form one equivalent reservoir. The operating policy of the equivalent reservoir is determined by stochastic dynamic programming, and finally the operating rules of each reservoir are determined using RBF neural networks. To improve the multivariable representation of the data, a series of piecewise RBF neural networks is determined using clustering analysis. A fuzzy clustering approach is used to determine the RBF`s parameters. This approach has the advantages of being fast and simple to implement with well-established convergence properties. It also has a good representation of the covariance matrix, since all the data belong to all the classes at the same time with different membership grades. A comparison with the back propagation learning and principal components techniques is also reported for Quebec`s La Grande River installations. As a result, the proposed approach gives satisfactory operating rules compared with principal component analysis, and the CPU time is reduced by a factor of 15 to 20 compared with the back propagation technique.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; Journal Volume: 32; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 179-186","","","","Journal ID: WRERAQ; ISSN 0043-1397; TRN: 96:002056-0003","10.1029/95WR02971","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","263021","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/263021","","Water Resources Research","1","32"

"Response of spawning lake sturgeons to change in hydroelectric facility operation","Auer, N A","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; RIVERS; FLOW RATE; VARIATIONS; FISHES; REPRODUCTION","Spawning of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens was documented from 1987 to 1992 below the Prickett hydroelectric facility on the Sturgeon River, a tributary to Portage Lake, Michigan. Lake sturgeons were captured at the spawning site with dip nets during periods of reduced flow. A change in the spawning characteristics of the population was noted that corresponded to a changed in the operation of the hydroelectric facility. In 1987 and 1988 the facility operated in a peaking mode, which resulted in large daily fluctuations in river flows. The years 1989 and 1990 were years of transition, and in 1991 and 1992 the facility released near run-of-the-river (ROR) flows. Under near-ROR flows, which were more natural, adult lake sturgeons spent 4-6 weeks less at the spawning sites, 74% more fish were observed, weights were greater due to a 68% increase in number of females, and fish had increased reproductive readiness. The change in flow regime was the result of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relicensing action. The positive response observed in lake sturgeon spawning activity that resulted from the change of facility operation to near-ROR flows should be beneficial to the survival and perpetuation of this population. Similar results may be experienced in other lake sturgeon waters affected by manipulated flow regimes. 28 refs., 5 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 125; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 66-77","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 96:005649-0002","10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0066:ROSLST>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","387354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/387354","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","1","125"

However, most hydro plants owned by investor-owned utilities are scheduled for relicensing over the next two decades by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) - a process that can take five to seven years, requires extensive studies, and often involves contentious litigation - an ordeal that can dampen a hydro project`s market advantage. But, with competitive forces nipping at their heels, hydro utilities are working hard to avoid the delay and expense of the relicensing process. And in some cases, to expedite the renewal process, utilities are reaching settlements with environmental advocates, recreational groups, and public agencies that change the way they operate powerplants. This paper discusses these issues and some specific cases.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electrical World; Journal Volume: 210; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 42-44","","","","Journal ID: ELWOA3; ISSN 0013-4457; TRN: 96:001831-038","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","196661","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/196661","","Electrical World","1","210"

In Asia, traditional approaches for fish protection can be relatively expensive. This is especially true at projects with high variations in the headwater, as it generally is difficult to design a fishway for such projects that are both economic and do not require manual operation. Two categories of fishways usually are used at projects with varying elevations of headwater. One is the vertical slot-type fishway, which features a series of baffles with slots and orificies. When headwater variation is extremely high, only the second category, the mechanical fishway, is applicable.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review Worldwide; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Aut 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 32-33","","","","Journal ID: XZ491N; TRN: 96:002210-0005","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","258880","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/258880","","Hydro Review Worldwide","4","3"

"Looking ahead: Trends in hydro business opportunities","Byers, W","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER; SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS; POLITICAL ASPECTS; BRAZIL; ENERGY SOURCE DEVELOPMENT; INDIA; TURKEY","Changing government policies and economic forces are presenting new opportunities and challenges for hydropower developers and suppliers. To highlight some of the trends, HRW examines the business picture in three key countries: India, Brazil, and Turkey. Indian utilities have nearly 24,000 megawatts (MW) of installed hydro capacity, almost one-fourth of the country`s generating capability. Hydro plants produced almost 70 million megawatt-hours of electricity in 1993, an increase of nearly 40 percent from ten years before. Growth shows in installed power generation capacity for all generations resources, including hydro, in India from 1950 to 1992. Experts estimate another 40,000 to 100,000 MW of hydro could be developed in India, based on today`s economics and technology. There is a significant interest among Indian energy planners and prospective project developers in turning the country`s hydro potential into reality. Hydropower has played an important role in Brazil`s economy during this century. Electricity provided the primary fuel for a remarkable 600 percent expansion of the Brazilian economy in the 1970`s and 1980`s- and in Brazil, electricity means hydro. Hydro accounted for more than 97 percent of the 250 million megawatt-hours (MWH) of electricity Brazilians consumed in 1994. Brazilian energy planners believe the outlook for future growth in hydro generating reserves is as bright as its past. Economic reforms and a strong commitment by the national government to water resources development have sparked new interest in Turkey as a source of substantial hydropower business opportunities. Among other developments, new tenders are scheduled for elements of the huge Southeastern Anotolia Project (GAP). The Turkish government also has initiated a new private power development program that will include an initial group of six hydro projects.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review Worldwide; Journal Volume: 3; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 10-11","","","","Journal ID: XZ491N; TRN: 96:002208-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","272723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/272723","","Hydro Review Worldwide","3","3"

Hydropower, among other things, is threatening the peace and safety of the once unencumbered spawning waters of the Columbia and Snake Rivers. And while the salmon/hydropower debate has been raging for some time, recent events have turned the heat up more than ever. After attempting various plans to help save the fish from the hazards of industrialization, the government finally listed some of the salmon as endangered in 1991. The listing gave the fish fighting power which they had not had before, but also created a serious conflict. The hydropower which is blamed for depleting the salmon numbers creates much of the energy for the northwestern United States. If the hydropower is altered to save the fish, energy rates will rise dramatically. Debates rage throughout Idaho, Washington, Oregon, and Montana, as well as in Washington D.C., about what should be done. The United States Congress has created the Northwest Power Planning Council (Council) to remedy the situation. The Council`s mandate is to save the fish, while ensuring an adequate and economical power supply for the region. The Council was created in 1980, and at that time crafted a program which has been amended several times. The most recent amendment occurred in 1992 in response to the endangered listing. Environmental groups looked at the 1992 amendments and immediately filed suit, claiming that the amendments were not good for the fish. In Northwest Resource Information Center, Inc., v. Northwest Power Planning Council, the Ninth Circuit held for the environmentalists, claiming that the Council had failed to listen to the environmental voices.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy, Natural Resources amp Environmental Law; Journal Volume: 15; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 473-499","","","","Journal ID: JENLFS; ISSN 1053-377X; TRN: 97:000059-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","441434","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/441434","","Journal of Energy, Natural Resources amp Environmental Law","2","15"

Consequently, we today must focus our attention on the middle of the next century, which is connected with the possibility of the exhaustion of organic fuels.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 6, 4(Jun 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 315","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:001897-0001","10.1007/BF02447846","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","223641","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223641","","Hydrotechnical Construction","6","29"

There are a number of small hydro plants under development in the region, but since reservoirs are not constructed in the region, their output is limited by stream flow and is not adequate to supply the base load needs. The time-dependent energy needs of a large collective farm is used as an example, with the biogas installation being fueled from the organic refuse from the collective itself. It is felt that the optimal combination of energy installations for the area is the hydroelectric/biogas installation for remote customers.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 6, 9-11(Jun 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 321-323","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:001897-0003","10.1007/BF02447848","","2016-05-10T00:00:00Z","223643","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223643","","Hydrotechnical Construction","6","29"

The frequency response from the turbine-gate position to the machine power is measured at given steady-state operating conditions, and a structured model is fitted to the response. The fitting process is based on a nonlinear optimization method that provides numerical robustness. This approach allows one to fine tune and validate existing models or to identify a model without initial theoretical analysis. Theoretical development of the approach is discussed and results are presented for a 115-MVA unit at the Mt.

As such, they can be brought on line very quickly to support system load requirements. However, one of the effects of making a rapid transition from synchronous condenser operation to turbine/governor operation is an initial reverse power flow into the machine. This reverse power flow can be very undesirable at a time when the system is calling for load support. On weak or isolated systems, this reverse power flow can lead to objectionable voltage and frequency dips in the system. With the proper utilization of a static frequency converter (SFC) and its associated controls and auxiliary switchgear systems, the reverse power flow resulting from a transition from synchronous condenser operation can be eliminated. This paper will describe the method by which an SFC system can be used to make this rapid load response in pumped-storage plants without incurring a reverse power flow and to provide additional instantaneous short term power to support the grid.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 694-699","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9625%%217","10.1109/60.475841","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","237892","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/237892","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","10"

The adaptive controller is to operate in real time to improve the generating unit transients through the exciter input, the guide vane position and the runner blade position. The new design procedure is based on self-organization and the predictive estimation capabilities of neural-nets implemented through the cluster-wise segmented associative memory scheme. The developed neural-net based controller (NNC) whose control signals are adjusted using the on-line measurements, can offer better damping effects for generator oscillations over a wide range of operating conditions than conventional controllers. Digital simulations of hydropower plant equipped with low head Kaplan turbine are performed and the comparisons of conventional excitation-governor control, state-space optimal control and neural-net based control are presented. Results obtained on the non-linear mathematical model demonstrate that the effects of the NNC closely agree with those obtained using the state-space multivariable discrete-time optimal controllers.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: 1995 IEEE Power Engineering Society summer meeting, Portland, OR (United States), 23-27 Jul 1995; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 760-767","","CONF-950727-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9625%%226","10.1109/60.475850","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","237901","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/237901","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","10"

Data were collected over 2 years at 11 sampling stations during ice-free seasons. The recorded emission fluxes were compared to water column depth, type of flooded soil, inundation history, and wind exposure. Most of the benthic fluxes measured for both gases were similar to those measured at the air-water interface. Unusual sampling conditions (e.g., strong winds, water columns less than one meter deep, or flooded peatland mats floating at the surface) resulted in above average emission fluxes. Preliminary analyses indicate that these higher emissions may be an important factor in calculating atmospheric emissions for large reservoirs. Emission fluxes at the water-air interface were determined to be controlled by molecular diffusion. Concentration profiles of the dissolved gases clearly demonstrated that oxidation and/or horizontal advection are controlling factors of atmospheric release. Neither benthic emission nor soil type appeared to control emissions of methane or carbon dioxide from the reservoirs. By rough approximation, it was proposed that hydroelectric reservoirs emit greenhouse gases on a much smaller scale than conventional thermal power plants producing equivalent amounts of energy. 51 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Global Biogeochemical Cycles; Journal Volume: 9; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 529-540","","","","Journal ID: GBCYEP; ISSN 0886-6236; TRN: 96:002389-0009","10.1029/95GB02202","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","244070","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/244070","","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","4","9"

This reprogramming was made possible owing to the use of state-of-the-art digital electronics. The new control scheme, which focuses on using the total flow of water ot the turbine rather than manipulating individual needle positions, is an appropriate solution for other high-head hydroelectric plants with impulse turbines encountering similar problems.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 44-50","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 96:004188-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","381161","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/381161","","Hydro Review","7","14"

In civil structures such as a dam or power plant, if an expanding crack goes unnoticed, it carries the potential for disaster. However, detecting expansion in cracks in concrete is difficult because cracks move much like glaciers-very slowly. One simple device, a relative block movement detector invented by the author while an engineer at the Tennessee Valley Authority, can measure contraction, expansion, and movement. A second simple instrument for detecting movement, of less certain origin, is called a {open_quotes}ball-in-a-box{close_quotes} device. The relative block movement detector can monitor movement at the joint of two poured slabs, such as in the roadway of a dam. A clamping mechanism is bolted to one side of a crack, holding a bar that extends across the crack into the center of a square box bolted on the other side of the crack. The position of the bar provides a measure of any movement of two slabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 80","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 96:004188-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","381163","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/381163","","Hydro Review","7","14"

The proposed methodology can be applied to ridges and valleys in isotropic or anisotropic rock masses subject to gravity or to combined gravitational and tectonic loading. The analytical solutions are two-dimensional and assume plane or generalized plane strain. They can be used to substitute existing design charts for pressure tunnels based on the finite-element method. It is found that the safe alignment of unlined pressure tunnels depend greatly on the extent of tensile regions in valley walls, which itself depends on parameters such as valley geometry, the degree of rock anisotropy, the orientation of the planes of rock anisotropy, and the in-situ loading conditions (gravity, gravity and tectonic).","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 12; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 879-885","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9606%%112","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1995)121:12(879)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","175969","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/175969","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","12","121"

"Recovery of a warmwater fish assemblage after the initiation of a minimum-flow release downstream from a hydroelectric dam","Travnichek, V H; Maceina, M J; Bain, M B","13 HYDRO ENERGY; FISHES; SPECIES DIVERSITY; POPULATION DYNAMICS; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS; RIVERS; FLUCTUATIONS; FLOW RATE","Artificial fluctuations in streamflow caused by hydroelectric power dams can degrade fish habitat and reduce the abundance and diversity of riverine fish faunas. Increased minimum water releases and reduced fluctuations in discharge may mitigate these effects. In this study, we compared shoreline fish abundance and diversity before and after an enhanced flow regime was implemented on the Tallapoosa River (Alabama) downstream of a hydroelectric dam. Before the minimum-flow regime, only eight species of fish were collected 3 km downstream from the dam, and all were classified as macrohabitat generalists. After the minimum flow was initiated, species richness 3 km below the dam more than doubled, and over half of the species collected were classified as fluvial specialists. Fish community response to the enhanced flow was not as great at a site 37 km downstream from the dam, where species richness was similar between the two periods. However, more species classified as fluvial specialists were collected after the minimum flow regime than before enhanced flows at this site. Additionally, relative abundance of species classified as fluvial specialists increased from less than 40% of fish collected before enhanced flows to over 80% after minimum flows began. Our results suggest that the enhanced flow regime provided conditions supporting a relatively abundant and diverse fish assemblage more reflective of a riverine system. 40 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 836-844","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 96:005683-0001","10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0836:ROAWFA>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","387362","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/387362","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","6","124"
"Differences in the dynamics and potential production of impounded and unimpounded white sturgeon populations in the lower Columbia River","Beamesderfer, R C.P.; Rien, T A; Nigro, A A","13 HYDRO ENERGY; COLUMBIA RIVER; AQUATIC ORGANISMS; FISHES; POPULATION DYNAMICS; WATER RESERVOIRS; FISHERIES; COMPARATIVE EVALUATIONS","White sturgeons Acipenser transmontanus were sampled in three lower Columbia River reservoirs from 1987 to 1991 to describe population dynamics, the ability of these stocks to sustain harvest, and differences among reservoir and unimpounded populations. Significant differences were observed among reservoirs in white sturgeon abundance, biomass, size composition, sex ratio, size of females at maturity, growth rate, condition factor, and rate of exploitation. No differences among reservoirs were detected in fecundity, natural mortality rate, or longevity, in part because of sampling difficulties. Recruitment rates and densities in reservoirs were inversely correlated with growth rate, condition factor, and size of females at maturity. Differences in population dynamics resulted in substantial differences in sustainable yields. Maximum yields per recruit were predicted at annual exploitation rates between 5 and 15%. Most characteristics of reservoir populations were less than or equal to optima reported for the unimpounded lower river; as a result, yield per recruit, reproductive potential per recruit, and the number of recruits were less in reservoirs than in the unimpounded river. Comparisons with pristine standing stocks suggest that the unimpounded river may approximate preimpoundment conditions for white sturgeon. We conclude that potential yield from impounded populations has been reduced by dam construction, which restricts populations to river segments that may not include conditions optimal for all life stages. Alternatives for enchancement of reservoir populations might include improved passage at dams, increased spring flow to improve spawning success, transplants from productive populations, hatchery supplementation, and more intensive harvest management. 54 refs., 7 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 857-872","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 96:005683-0002","10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0857:DITDAP>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","387363","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/387363","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","6","124"

The system comprises four plants with an unusual high coupling, held by two different utilities. Even though government regulations established operation guide lines, utilities have their own interests. A multi-objective framework is adopted to study the operation of the system. Dynamic programming is used to find optimal solutions, with an implementation based on the concept of differential dynamic programming. A case study shows the possibility of obtaining energetic gains with the adoption of non-conventional operation rules and the need of negotiation to avoid wasting energy.","","","","","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: DN: Paper presented at the 1993 IEEE/ASME International Joint Power Generation Conference, Kansas City, MO (US), October 17--20, 1993; PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1750-1755","","","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9553%%86","10.1109/59.476038","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","137084","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/137084","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","10"

These models are applicable to objects whose dynamic characteristics can be fully described by considering their profile cross-sections (dams, coastal slopes, wave breakers).

The problem is first decomposed into a thermal subproblem and a hydro subproblem by relaxing the supply-demand constraints. The thermal subproblem is solved analytically. The hydro subproblem is further decomposed into a set of smaller problems that can be solved in parallel. Extended differential dynamic programming and mixed coordination are used to solve the hydro subproblem. Two problems are tested and the results show that the new approach performs well under a simulated parallel processing environment, and high speedup is obtained. The method is then extended to handle unpredictable changes in natural inflow by utilizing the variational feedback nature of the control strategy. A quick estimate on the impact of an unpredictable change on total cost is also obtained. Numerical results show that estimates are accurate, and unpredictable change in natural inflow can be quickly and effectively handled.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Conference: Winter meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, New York, NY (United States), 29 Jan - 2 Feb 1995; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 2021-2028","","CONF-950103-","","Journal ID: ITPSEG; ISSN 0885-8950; TRN: IM9603%%203","10.1109/59.476071","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","160621","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/160621","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","4","10"

The applied numerical procedure is based on the coupling of the boundary element and the vortex particle method and is supplemented by two different procedures for the evaluation of the viscous-inviscid interaction and the boundary layers developed on the vanes. The cinematic conditions at every point of the flowfield are calculated first; however, special attention is paid to the prediction of the torque acting on the cascade and, namely, the variation of the torque during the rotation of the guidevanes, as compared with the torque corresponding to the steady state.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 468-472","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9546%%130","10.1115/1.2817285","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","118729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/118729","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","3","117"

A specially instrumented hydrofoil of elliptic planform and a NACA 0015 cross section was tested at flow velocities up to 20 m s{sup {minus}1}, at various values of cavitation index. Although pit sizes were measured on a soft aluminum insert, pitting rate was not measured directly but was inferred from direct measurement of impulsive pressures on the surface of the hydrofoil and by monitoring accelerometers mounted at the base of the hydrofoil. Cavitation noise was also measured by a hydrophone positioned in the water tunnel test section. Air was injected through small holes in the leading edge of the foil. Air injection was found to be very effective in minimizing erosion as inferred from all three cavitation erosion detection techniques.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 498-504","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9546%%134","10.1115/1.2817290","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","118733","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/118733","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","3","117"

Kima drain wastewaters exhibit high concentrations of dissolved salts, particularly close to where the waste of the Kima factory enters, but decrease substantially near the end of the Kima drain. The reason is the dilution factor, aeration, sedimentation, oxidation reductions, and the biochemical effects. A slight increase of the dissolved solids (DS) in the Nile river water at the Kima drain does not effect the Nile river water quality, as the regeneration of the Nile water continuously (the Nile River receives 200 Mm{sup 3}/d of fresh water from the High Dam Lake) prevents the accretion of the concentrations of metals and anions.

The objectives of this experiment were to provide a database for comparison with three-dimensional, turbulent flow computations, to evaluate engineering models, and to improve the physical understanding of many of the phenomena involved in this complex flow field. This summary paper briefly describes the experimental facility, as well as the experimental techniques--such as flow visualization, static-pressure measurements, laser Doppler velocimetry, and both slow- and fast-response pressure probes. Then, proceeding from the inlet to the exit of the pump, the paper presents highlights of experimental measurements and data analysis, giving examples of measured physical phenomena such as endwall boundary layers, separation regions, wakes, and secondary vortical structures.

"Surface roughness effects on induced flow and frictional resistance of enclosed rotating disks","Poullikkas, A","42 ENGINEERING NOT INCLUDED IN OTHER CATEGORIES; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS; FRICTION; ENERGY LOSSES; CALCULATION METHODS; ROUGHNESS","Disk friction losses in a pump are caused by the fluid flow in the gap between the impeller and the casing wall. The classical method of determining these losses is by using a thin plain disk rotating in a close fitting close casing. Rotating disks can be classified in two broad categories: (1) Free disk, a disk which rotates in a fluid mass of infinite extent and initially at rest. When the disk is rotating fluid is drawn axially toward the disk and is centrifuged off its periphery as a spinning boundary layer. There is no angular momentum in the approach flow so the friction torque is equal to the angular momentum cast off in the boundary layer. (2) Enclosed disk, a disk which rotates within a chamber of finite dimensions. When the disk is rotating the whirling flow cast off its periphery eventually returns to the disk retaining some of its angular momentum. For this reason the friction torque on enclosed disks is less than that on free disks. This investigation concerns the latter case which includes the kinds of conditions encountered in centrifugal machinery where problems of disk friction torque and power loss are related to the circulation and secondary flows induced by the rotating elements.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 526-528","","","","Journal ID: JFEGA4; ISSN 0098-2202; TRN: IM9546%%137","10.1115/1.2817294","","2016-04-29T00:00:00Z","118736","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/118736","","Journal of Fluids Engineering","3","117"

In this paper, the authors will further illustrate the capabilities of computer-aided graphical methods with a view to their incorporation into modern testing practices. Using synthetic short-circuit data obtained from an exact solution of the network equations of known machines, it is first shown that use of the proposed software leads to satisfactory parameters in a number of realistic situations, including those where sub-subtransient effects are present. When faced with real data, it is shown that pre-filtering, without phase distortion, is often necessary and some useful tools are suggested for carrying this out. A thorough investigation of the automatic graphical method applied to three machines, differing widely in design, suggests that the new software is robust enough to be used on a regular basis, either in the field or in the design office. Using the Takeda and Adkins K-factor, derived graphically from the field current oscillogram, even a full second-order network is possible, matching the underlying phenomena, as seen from both the rotor and stator.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: Winter meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, New York, NY (United States), 29 Jan - 2 Feb 1995; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 407-414","","CONF-950103-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9601%%26","10.1109/60.464861","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","147920","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/147920","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","10"

Using a number of basic building blocks widely available in commercial spreadsheet and matrix analysis software, it has proved possible to develop a new approach combining graphic displays and interactive processing. This allows a relatively inexperienced user to execute a full analysis and calculate reactances and time constants in less than three hours, starting from the raw data. Upper and lower peak time-constant envelopes are fitted using high-order polynomials or spline interpolation procedures. The latter are then used in compliance with IEEE and IEC recommendations to determine numerical values of T{prime}{sub d}, T{double_prime}{sub d}, x{prime}{sub d}, x{double_prime}{sub d} and T{sub a} by graphical and heuristic reasoning. Initially, simulated data was used to validate the new software and assess the effect of different time-scale decoupling windows on the parameter estimates. Despite its simplifying hypotheses and other inherent pitfalls discussed in the article, the present graphical method, the authors believe, should continue to be used, particularly as it is simple and fast enough to be applied directly in the field for test validation, or quick initialization of more advanced estimation procedures.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: Winter meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, New York, NY (United States), 29 Jan - 2 Feb 1995; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 399-406","","CONF-950103-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9601%%25","10.1109/60.464860","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","147919","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/147919","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","10"

Functional testing of these limiters before they are placed into commercial service is recommended. The Bureau of Reclamation routinely performs functional testing to determine the actual settings and operational characteristic of these limiters as part of excitation system commissioning tests on its hydroelectric generators. This paper will discuss the purpose and practice of functionally testing these limiters.","","","","","","United States","1995-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: Winter meeting of the IEEE Power Engineering Society, New York, NY (United States), 29 Jan - 2 Feb 1995; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 538-542","","CONF-950103-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9601%%36","10.1109/60.464879","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","147930","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/147930","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","3","10"
"Navigation lock sets new standards: Cost-cutting legacy","","42 ENGINEERING NOT INCLUDED IN OTHER CATEGORIES; 13 HYDRO ENERGY; INLAND WATERWAYS; EXCAVATION; NAVIGATION; DAMS; COST; CIVIL ENGINEERING; POLLUTION ABATEMENT; WEST VIRGINIA","A navigation lock under construction in West Virginia broke ground itself in a big way, but its greatest imprint will be vast cost savings elsewhere. That will amount to many hundreds of millions of dollars as design innovations developed during its construction are applied elsewhere. The project also taught the Army Corps of Engineers a stern lesson on how to handle-or avoid-a serious, unexpected toxic waste problem. Correcting that situation held up the lock work. The twin Winfield Locks and Dam on the Kanawha River are the busiest in the U.S. inland waterway system, registering well over 20,000 lockages a year. Heaviest traffic is barge tows coming down from the heart of West Virginia`s low-sulfur coal mining area into the Ohio River. Each 56x360-ft chamber can accomodate only one modern jumbo barge at a time, says Mark D. Kessinger, a civil engineer with the Army Corps of engineers` Huntington district. Typical five-barge tows are broken up and usually take three-and-a-half hours to lock through, even with helper boats. Under adverse conditions, that may be five hours. And often several tows wait in line for as long as 24 hours to make the 28-ft lift or drop. The Corps says that equates to a loss in benefits to shippers of $17 million a year. Its new 110x800-ft lock on the landside of the two existing ones will handle entire tows, three jumbo barges long by three wide. Phased construction of the $277-million lock began in 1990, but has been delayed a year and a half by discovery of contamination on the newly acquired portion of the site.","","","","","","United States","1995-08-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: ENR; Journal Volume: 235; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: 14 Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 56-61","","","","Journal ID: ENRRE5; ISSN 0891-9526; TRN: 95:007644-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","160027","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/160027","","ENR","7","235"

Six seismic refraction traverses were run on the ground surface, inside the exploratory tunnels and between tunnels and the ground surface. The results provided information about the low-velocity surface layer parameters and the stress relief zones on the walls of all the tunnels in which seismic tomography tests were performed. Ultrasonic tests, conducted both in situ and in the laboratory, enabled the determination of the ratio V{sub P}/V{sub S} and the Poisson`s ratio calculation. From the tomography data analysis and the geological interpretation of the results, three main velocity zones, ranging between 3,500 and 4,000, 3,000 and 3,500 and less than 3,000 m/s, were detected in each tunnel. High-velocity zones were found to be compatible with the hard rockmass of gneiss-schist material, while moderate velocities are closely related to jointed and fractured zones. Finally, low-velocity zones were well correlated with weathered gneiss-schist material.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Prospecting; Journal Volume: 43; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 779-792","","","","Journal ID: GPPRAR; ISSN 0016-8025; TRN: IM9552%%231","10.1111/j.1365-2478.1995.tb00280.x","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","136688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/136688","","Geophysical Prospecting","6","43"

Large-scale applications of habitat measures are planned to manage the risks caused to chinook salmon by potential reductions in habitat quality associated with the reduction of flows. The reduction of flows result from the planned diversion of an additional portion of the upper Nechako River drainage. Experimental placements of debris structures and channel modifications were conducted from 1988 to 1993. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized debris structures, particularly the sweepers and rail-debris catchers installed in 1991, and fry density was similar to sparse natural debris cover. Channel modifications, point bars, and a side channel were durable, but were not as well utilized by young chinook. Physical assessment indicated that durability was medium to high where debris catchers and bundles withstood peak flows of 250--283 m{sup 3}/s.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 52-72","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: 95:018777","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1995)121:2(52)","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","94374","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94374","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","121"

Utility companies, government agencies, and research communities in Canada, the US, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia were surveyed as part of a Canadian Electrical Association study to evaluate the effectiveness of water release as a mitigation. Respondents identified only 28 projects in which water was released specifically to protect fish habitats. Fewer than half of these projects (12) were judged as being effective. Six case histories with preimpact assessment and postimpact monitoring were reviewed. In four cases fish habitat or fish populations or both were maintained; in two cases they were not. The effectiveness of water release differed among rivers and fish species, and was greatest when designed to meet the habitat requirements of each life-history stage. A review of the literature did not support the theory that a particular fraction of the mean annual flow provides the bet fish habitat. Although smaller changes in the flow regime had smaller effects, increasing minimum flows above those historically observed did not necessarily increase fish production.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 81-88","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: 95:018779","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1995)121:2(81)","","2016-04-28T00:00:00Z","94376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94376","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","121"

The Nechako Reservoir was created by the construction of the Kenney Dam in Nechako Canyon, a natural barrier to salmon migration. The Nechako River downstream of Nechako Canyon supports important runs of sockeye and chinook salmon. This additional diversion of Nechako River flow creates the potential of high water temperatures and increased thermal stress to migrating sockeye salmon enroute to their spawning grounds in Nechako River tributaries. To achieve specific downstream water temperature objectives during sockeye salmon migration each summer, a two-level outlet facility adjacent to Kenney Dam is to be constructed to release cooling water at 10 C to the Nechako River. Results of mathematical modeling of Nechako River water temperatures show that, based on specified design criteria, a maximum Kenney Dam release of 167 m{sup 3}/s at 10 C would be required to meet the downstream water temperature objectives.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 73-80","","","","Journal ID: JLEED9; ISSN 0733-9402; TRN: 95:018778","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1995)121:2(73)","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","94375","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94375","","Journal of Energy Engineering","2","121"

Many factors have contributed to the decline, including overharvest, loss of habit, degradation of water quality, and construction of dams. Many measures have been implemented to reduce the impact of the dams, but additional measures are being considered. Lowering water-surface elevations behind four lower Snake River dams has been proposed as a measure to improve juvenile salmonid survival. The Corps of Engineers has determined preliminary costs, schedules, and required modifications for several drawdown alternatives.

The rate of aging depends on the quality of the designs, technology of construction, and operating conditions. The effects of aging are determined both visually and instrumentally. When analyzing these on-site data, it is necessary to establish the cause-effect relations among changes in the parameters controlling the loads and scheme of static behavior of the dam-foundation system.

Theoretical investigations confirmed considerable opening of the contact joint both in nonoverflow and in powerhouse sections. Other conditions being equal, the length of the zone of opening of the contact joint in the powerhouse sections is 2-3 meters greater than in the nonoverflow sections. In the winter period, the zone of opening in the powerhosue sections reaches the grout curtain, while in the summer period, the opening is about half as much. Such opening of the joint, together with decompressions of the foundation, leads to an increase in the uplift pressure, increase of seepage discharges, and decrease of safety against shearing. Calculations showed that the zone of opening of the contact joint can be followed by a closed joint zone with displaced surfaces (sliding zone). The size of the zone depends on many factors and requires further refinements, but in any event, this zone can completely enter the second column.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 29; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 2, 11-13(Feb 1995)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 73-76","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:004792-0003","10.1007/BF01544999","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","379319","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/379319","","Hydrotechnical Construction","2","29"

In these applications, an attractive candidate is the slip power recovery system comprising of doubly excited induction machine or doubly excited brushless reluctance machine and PWM converters with a dc link. In this paper, a flexible active and reactive power control strategy is developed, such that the optimal torque-speed profile of the turbine can be followed and overall reactive power can be controlled, while the machine copper losses have been minimized. At the same time, harmonics injected into the power network has also been minimized. In this manner, the system can function as both a high-efficient power generator and a flexible reactive power compensator.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 472-478","","","","Journal ID: ITPEE8; ISSN 0885-8993; TRN: IM9551%%196","10.1109/63.391945","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","131597","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/131597","","IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","4","10"

The tested method---an attraction flow system---is an alternative to screens. In this system, entrances are strategically located above turbine intakes. This takes advantage of the natural tendency for juvenile salmonids to occupy the upper portion of the water column as they move downstream. Fish attracted to the channel by the water flow into the slots are passed to the tailrace, thus avoiding the turbines.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 96-102","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 95:008865-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","229763","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/229763","","Hydro Review","4","14"

It is a virtual certainty that any power generating facility using cooling water for its processes will eventually require underwater maintenance. Since the first days of large-scale electric generation, underwater maintenance projects have involved some form of diving activity. In the days of the hard-hat divers, the technology was primitive and the hazards even more significant. Consequently, project engineers would plan diving operations very carefully, and diving was viewed as a method of last resort. Fortunately, improvements in diving technology have removed much of the worry over worker safety and cost issues. Power plants routinely employ independent diving companies to provide maintenance, repair and inspection services.

It differs markedly from the classical approach in which international financial institutions such as the World Bank have funded such projects. Financing these traditional projects included recovering costs during a 50 year period and paying low interest rates. In contrast, an independent hydropower project takes a hard economic analysis and seeks a purely economic goal. Private developers want a faster and higher return on investment, typically 20%, which raises financing costs and power rates. These pressures have engineering firms grabbing at competitive solutions in their role with projects. This includes scaling down engineering, sourcing globally, networking with vendors and suppliers around the world, and forming alliances, among other ways of upping cost effectiveness. Overall, the costs of hydropower projects are declining as engineers learn to execute projects more cost effectively.","","","","","","United States","1995-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; Journal Volume: 25; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jul-Aug 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 70-73","","","","Journal ID: IDPEEW; ISSN 1043-7320; TRN: 95:005490-0011","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","90983","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/90983","","Independent Energy","6","25"

"Efficiency based optimal control of Kaplan hydrogenerators","Schniter, P; Wozniak, L","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; HYDRAULIC TURBINES; SPEED REGULATORS; CONTROL; CONTROL SYSTEMS; POWER DEMAND; OPTIMIZATION","This paper investigates an optimal strategy for controlling the speed response of Kaplan hydrogenerating systems to decreases in load. Typically, primary control gates restrict to redirect water through the turbine to stabilize and transfer the system to operating point demand. The adjustable turbine blade angle is used to return to maximum operating efficiency at the new load level. The over-speed reduction is limited by the conduit`s ability to withstand the over-pressure caused by the flow restriction at the turbine. A control scheme using gates and blades simultaneously and independently is developed. The initial action of the proposed control moves the gates and blades in opposite directions at maximum rates in an effort to reduce efficiency without altering flow, thus quickly decreasing the generated power while affecting the pressure minimally. The final control action moves the gears and blades simultaneously to restore maximum efficiency operation at the new power level demand. Similarities are found when comparing the efficiency based control to the Bang-bang and Linear Quadratic Regulator results of optimal control theory, though attempting to apply either of these methods directly to this problem is impractical. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional gate-dominant control in minimizing turbine over-speed and speed settling time under prescribed load change and conduit pressure limits. However, in its present form, the design is found to be more sensitive to system nonlinearities than its conventional counterpart.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers/Power Engineering Society (IEEE/PES) summer meeting, San Francisco, CA (United States), 24-28 Jul 1994; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 348-353","","CONF-940702-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9538%%76","10.1109/60.391902","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","94103","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/94103","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","2","10"

The results by this method are then compared with data on existing hydro-power stations and the results planned by expert engineers to show that this new computational method is superior.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Resources Technology; Journal Volume: 117; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 125-132","","","","Journal ID: JERTD2; ISSN 0195-0738; TRN: IM9533%%418","10.1115/1.2835328","","2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","82960","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/82960","","Journal of Energy Resources Technology","2","117"
"Diagnostic system monitors gearboxes at hydro plant","","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; HYDRAULIC TURBINES; GEARS; MONITORING; MAINTENANCE","This article describes how, by applying real-time, tooth-by-tooth vibration ``imaging,`` this system detects gear-tooth defects -- such as pitting and cracking. To keep Swan Falls hydroelectric generating station in service, Idaho Power Co constructed a new two-unit, open-pit-turbine powerhouse. Swan Falls, Kuna, Idaho, the oldest on the Snake River, services southern Idaho and parts of Oregon -- one of 17 hydroelectric plants maintained by the utility. The hydro units use speed increasers (gearboxes) so higher-speed generators are possible. To monitor these gearboxes, engineers at Swan Falls required a continuous on-line predictive maintenance system. The system monitors the planetary step-up gearboxes in the two main 12.5-MW pit turbine/generators. In some Idaho Power plants with a similar hydro turbine/generator design, the gearboxes have experienced major failures, leading to hundreds of thousands of dollars in collateral damage.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power (New York); Journal Volume: 139; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 100","","","","Journal ID: POWEAD; ISSN 0032-5929; TRN: IM9540%%162","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","100688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/100688","","Power (New York)","6","139"
"Environmental impact assessment in practice: A gender critique","Kurian, P A; ","13 HYDRO ENERGY; INDIA; DAMS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY","The author evaluates the extent to which environmental impact assessment (EIA) as conceptualized by EIA systems is a gendered process. Through a discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with bureaucrats, technocrats, and activists involved with the Sardar Sarovar dam project in India, the author examines the practice of EIA in a Third World country. She uses a theoretical framework, informed by a theory of gender, to evaluate the interviews. In practice, EIA is marked by gender biases that ignore the gender-specific nature of impacts. Such biases distort the impact assessment process, making environmental sustainability difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Professional; Journal Volume: 17; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 167-178","","","","Journal ID: EPROD9; ISSN 0191-5398; TRN: 95:023665","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","118660","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/118660","","Environmental Professional","2","17"

This was done at considerable cost in the form of lost revenue. As a result, an alternative method of lowering water temperature was developed and it has successfully lowered water temperatures downstream from hydroelectric facilities by using flexible rubber curtains. This innovative technology is aiding the survival of endangered fish populations. This article outlines the efforts and discusses the implementation of this method at several hydroelectric facilities in the area.","","","","","","United States","1995-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; Journal Volume: 14; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 56-63","","","","Journal ID: HYREE8; ISSN 0884-0385; TRN: 95:008484-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","229759","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/229759","","Hydro Review","3","14"

An ambitious, $2.4 billion undertaking, known as the Mt. Hope project, may help the metropolitan area - and the entire Mid-Atlantic Ozone Transport Region (OTR) - attain ozone compliance. The project includes a new 2,000-MW electricity storage facility, which would allow thermal power plants in the region to run more efficiently and reduce NO{sub x} and VOC emissions, especially at times of critical ozone levels. The Mt. Hope project is the subject of a recent study that analyzed, potential reductions in ozone precursors from project implementation. According to the study, NO{sub x} emissions could be reduced by up to 50 tons per day and $91 million per year could potentially be saved if the project is implemented. Advanced pumped storage (APS) improves significantly on the conventional method. The Mt. Hope project, for example, is expected to consume only 22% more electricity than it generates. APS facilities are designed to switch from power-receiving to power-generating modes frequently in response to demand - up to 20 times a day in the Mt. Hope design. 1 ref., 1 fig.","","","","","","United States","1995-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Air Pollution Consultant; Journal Volume: 5; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May-Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1.19-1.20","","","","Journal ID: APOCEH; ISSN 1058-6628; TRN: 96:000596-008","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","159655","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/159655","","Air Pollution Consultant","3","5"

Understanding what factors affect straying could help in the development of procedures for controlling the influence of specific stocks on nearby populations. We explore the effects of release date and the transportation of juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha on straying by adults from two Columbia River hatcheries. Early and late releases from Washougal Hatchery produced much higher straying levels than intermediate release dates, and this pattern was consistent among brood years. Fish reared at Grays River Hatchery and released from Washougal Hatchery strayed significantly more than local fish of the same brood year and release data. Our results and those from previous studies indicate that the sequence of imprinting events is characterized by the combination of the time at which the fish experience given locations and the physiological state of the fish at that time. Changes in release date and transportation disrupt the sequence and timing of these events, with varying effects on homing. Hatchery rearing and release techniques can sometimes be modified to control straying and minimize the impact of hatchery fish on other hatchery and wild stocks. 46 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; Journal Volume: 124; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: May 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 308-320","","","","Journal ID: TAFSAI; ISSN 0002-8487; TRN: 95:005625-0001","10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0308:FATHOF>2.3.CO;2","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","90909","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/90909","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society","3","124"

The results of four hydropower licensing consultations are reported. Key participants were interviewed to ascertain the level of technical clarity present during the consultations and the degree to which the consultations were successful. Technical clarity appears to be a prerequisite for successful outcomes. Factors that enhance technical clarity include simple project design, new rather than existing projects, precise definition of issues, a sense of urgency to reach agreement, a sense of fairness among participants, and consistency in participation.

A technique is developed to evaluate soil shear stress-strain histories directly from the free-field downhole accelerations. These histories are used to estimate variation of soil shear moduli and material damping characteristics with shear strain amplitude, and to assess the effects of pore pressure buildup. Soil stiffness properties are found to compare satisfactorily with those obtained through laboratory tests conducted by the University of California, Davis; the National Taiwan University; and the University of Texas at Austin. Pore pressure buildup appears to be accompanied by a reduction in soil stiffness. The information obtained in this study demonstrates that downhole accelerometer and pore pressure arrays offer a direct effective means of evaluating seismic soil properties.","","","","","","United States","1995-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Apr 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 363-378","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9519%%60","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1995)121:4(363)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","37137","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/37137","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","4","121"

The purpose of this research is to determine the magnitudes of generator winding I{sup 2}R losses under ascertain frequency range so as to improve the efficiency of the hydro unit operation at non-rated head and output power. The generator winding additional I{sup 2}R losses and harmonic interference, are investigated by using the EMTDC program and other subordinate programs. The overall study shows that the generator winding power losses will be increased as the operating frequency decreases under the condition of a fixed generator output. The magnitude of increased losses, though, will not exceed 8--10% of generator total winding I{sup 2}R losses under normal system operating conditions. Harmonic interference, on the other hand, will become more severe in both the AC and DC systems, as compared to fixed frequency operation. Active or on line tuning harmonic filters may be considered for a particular variable frequency operation scheme being implemented.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers/Power Engineering Society (IEEE/PES) summer meeting, San Francisco, CA (United States), 24-28 Jul 1994; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 133-139","","CONF-940702-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9520%%486","10.1109/60.372578","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","40291","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40291","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","10"

The approach is unique in the sense that the nonlinear characteristics of the turbine are first modeled as multiplicative uncertainties, and an optimal robust governor is designed by taking into account such uncertainties explicitly. The advantage of this approach is that the designed governor will guarantee the stability and the performance of the speed control loop for the entire turbine operating range. The performance of the new governor is shown to be superior to that of the conventional PID controller during large load disturbances. The resulting governor is only a third order. Hence, it has the same level of complexity as any other electrical-hydraulic governor in use today.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers/Power Engineering Society (IEEE/PES) summer meeting, San Francisco, CA (United States), 24-28 Jul 1994; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 188-194","","CONF-940702-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9520%%491","10.1109/60.372586","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","40296","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40296","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","10"

If the disturbance occurs as a pulse, recover to the ecosystems`s original condition often occurs. However, if the disturbance is sustained and causes complete loss of critical habitat elements, ecological integrity cannot be maintained. Because running water ecosystems are so intimately tired to physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur throughout the catchment restoration is a complex and difficult task. Restoration and rehabilitation projects on small streams and rivers have been common practice for many years; however, restoration and rehabilitation projects for large river systems are far less common, and there is little ability to predict success or monitor recovery. Renewal of physical and biological interactions between the main channel, backwaters, and flood plains is central to rehabilitation.

When a fixed gain controller is used to regulate such a process, globally stable system response can be achieved only at the expense of degraded off design-point performance. This paper considers the application of an adaptive control methodology that allows the controller gains to automatically adjust to changing process variables and thereby provide uniform closed loop response over a wide range of operating conditions. Preliminary findings derived from a calculated plant model, and a standard recursive identification technique, indicate that the adaptive system provides desirable dynamic response despite changes in system operating dynamics, maintaining stable operation in situations where constant gain schedules fail.","","","","","","United States","1995-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 10; Journal Issue: 1; Conference: 1994 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers/Power Engineering Society (IEEE/PES) summer meeting, San Francisco, CA (United States), 24-28 Jul 1994; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 162-168","","CONF-940702-","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9520%%487","10.1109/60.372582","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","40292","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/40292","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","1","10"

Such actions can dramatically improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people living in remote villages in the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The environmentally benign nature of renewable resource utilization and the potability of exploiting locally available resources with the consequent growth of job opportunities are some of the many benefits that can accrue by the deployment of IRES. Even small amounts of energy can be very beneficial in remote rural areas of developing countries with no grid connection as compared to the massive urban sprawls in both developed and developing countries.

"Dynamic response of concrete-faced rockfill dams to strong seismic excitation","Uddin, N; Gazetas, G","13 HYDRO ENERGY; DAMS; SEISMIC EFFECTS; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; STRESS ANALYSIS; CALCULATION METHODS; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; RISK ASSESSMENT; FAILURES","A dynamic plane-strain finite-element study of the response of a typical 100-m-tall concrete-faced rockfill (CFR) dam to strong seismic shaking is presented. The rockfill is modeled as an equivalent-linear material, whose strain-dependent shear modulus is proportional to the square root of the confining pressure. Coulomb`s friction law governs the behavior of the interface between face slab and dam, and slippage is allowed to occur whenever the seismic shear tractions exceed the pertinent frictional capacity. Two sets of historic accelerograms, with peak ground accelerations (PGA) of about 0.40g and 0.60g, respectively, are used as excitation. Numerical results highlight key aspects of the seismic response of CFR dams with emphasis on the internal forces developing in the slab. It is shown that slab distress may be produced only from axial tensile forces, developing due mainly to the rocking component of dam deformation. For the 0.60g shaking tensile stresses that are much higher than the likely tensile strength of concrete develop in the slab. The presented results do not account for potentially detrimental three-dimensional (3D) narrow-canyon effects.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; Journal Volume: 121; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 185-197","","","","Journal ID: JGENDZ; ISSN 0733-9410; TRN: IM9520%%115","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1995)121:2(185)","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","39921","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/39921","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering","2","121"

It also accelerates the time of occurence of individual phases of the intrasecular cycle.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 8, 9-12(Aug 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 421-426","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:004793-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","379332","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/379332","","Hydrotechnical Construction","8","28"
"Hydraulic resistance of vegetated channels","Borovkov, V S; Yurchuk, M","13 HYDRO ENERGY; RIVERS; HYDROLOGY; PLANT GROWTH; DIAGRAMS; FLOW MODELS; RUSSIAN FEDERATION; EXPERIMENTAL DATA","Vegetation of river and canal channels can have serious consequences of a hydraulic nature. For example, vegetation of canals protects the bed and side slopes of canals from erosion, increases the non-eroding velocities in the canal, and can serve as a cheap method of stabilizing the slopes of hydraulic structures. On the other hand, vegetation can reduce the channel capacity. As a result, a prediction of changes in the hydraulic elements of flows in connection with the degree of vegetation of its channel is necessary for improving methods of hydraulic calculations of vegetated canals. This article reports on experimental investigations on two hydraulic flumes in which artificial methods and naturally grown wheat were utilized to simulate the vegetation. An analytic method is presented to calculate the flow resistance, and the results are compared to the experimental data with excellent agreement.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 8, 16-19(Aug 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 432-438","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:004793-0005","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","379334","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/379334","","Hydrotechnical Construction","8","28"

Laboratory investigations were carried out on a large experimental device at the Central Asian Irrigation Research Institute to determine this. The junction of two rectangular horizontal plumes was constructed on this device. The investigations showed that the joining of two open channel flows is accompanied by alternate squeezing of one flow by the other, as a result of which considerable deformation of the water surface occurs. Backwaters occur in the upper stretch of the main channel and in the tributary, and transverse slants of the water surface form at the junction below it.","","","","","","United States","1995-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1995; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 8, 13-15(Aug 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 427-431","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 96:004793-0004","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","379333","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/379333","","Hydrotechnical Construction","8","28"

However, most would agree that the debate over hydropower development revolves around jurisdictional distribution and the authority to regulate development. For all practical purposes, hydroelectric licensing has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission`s (FERC`s or Commission`s) exclusive domain. The prevailing assumption after the Supreme Court`s interpretation of the Federal Power Act (FPA) in First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative v. FPC was that the Federal Power Commission (FPC), now FERC, possessed ultimate authority over the regulation of hydropower development. This presumption was reaffirmed in California v.

In New Jersey, lawmakers passed legislation providing $1.7 million in loans for engineering studies on high-hazard dams. Similarly in Minnesota, lawmakers approved legislation providing $1.6 million for repair or removal of dams. In Colorado, new legislation creates an emergency dam repair cash fund for state engineers to cover costs of emergency actions. In South Carolina, the General Assembly passed major amendments to the Dams and Reservoirs Safety Act. The amendments require that dam owners notify the state within 30 days after title to a dam is transferred, and stipulate that owners of high-hazard and significant hazard dams prepare emergency action plans. The state also may require normal maintenance on a dam; previously, the dam had to be declared unsafe before and order could be issued.

The research included narrowing the range of the number of blades, the determination of the impact of the first-stage exit angle, and the effect of flow stream spreading on the performance of the cross-flow turbine. The results indicate an optimum number of blades that would produce maximum efficiency of the turbine, and a clear trend of the effect of the first-stage exit angle and flow stream spreading on the efficiency. For the best nozzle-runner combination, the maximum efficiency closest to the discharge averaged maximum efficiency is determined to be 92%, with an uncertainty of [+-] 2.4%.

Many engineers are not familiar with probabilistic concepts, and it has been difficult to incorporate concepts of reliability into practice. Also, there is confusion over what reliability and probability of failure mean. The most effective applications of probabilistic methods are those involving relative probabilities of failure or illuminating the effects of uncertainties in the parameters. Attempts to determine the absolute probability of failure are much less successful. The paper describes how probabilistic descriptions of soil parameters can be derived from field and laboratory data and applied in stability analysis. The first-order, second-moment approach is explored and applied to the design of embankment dams. The example illustrates the relative contributions of uncertainties about different parameters to the reliability of the embankment. Reliability analysis is especially useful in establishing design values of factors of safety representing consistent risks for different types of failure.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:12","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2180-2207","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1994)120:12(2180)","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6670553","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6670553","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","120:12"

Both sinusoidal and real earthquake ground motions are used as excitation, and Coulomb's friction law governs sliding along any point of the rigid-plastic tensionless interface. It is found that only when the dominant excitation frequencies lie in the proximity of the fundamental dam frequency will the permanent deformation from the decoupling assumption exceed appreciably the single-step value.

The results also show that the new control system improves low frequency oscillation damping of longitudinal power systems.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 9:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1949-1955","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; CODEN: ITPSEG","10.1109/59.331455","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6597688","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6597688","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","9:4"
"The Clean Water Act and federally licensed utilities","Behnke, J; Dondis, H","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; LICENSING REGULATIONS; LAWSUITS; STATE GOVERNMENT; LEGAL ASPECTS; US FERC; AESTHETICS; FISHES","A recent decision by the US Supreme Court, in PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Department of Ecology, 128 L. Ed. 29 716 (1994), seriously threatens to erode the traditional federal jurisdiction over interstate utilities, and to accrete a substantial, if not predominant, role for the states in the authorization of projects that may discharge into navigable waters. In Jefferson County, the petitioner, a city and local utility district, proposed to build a hydroelectric project along the Dosewallips River in Washington State. The project was to be licensed by the FERC under the FPA, but the license could not be granted without a water quality certification issued by Washington State under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, better known as the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq. (CWA). The petitioner applied for a water quality certification from the State of Washington Department of Ecology, which issued the certification but imposed a number of conditions, including a minimum stream-flow requirement. The petitioner appealed the conditions through the state courts to the US Supreme Court, taking the position that under the CWA and the FPA, states can impose water quality standards that can be numerically quantified, but cannot regulate stream flows. The Supreme Court rules that the State Department of Ecology`s action in imposing water flow conditions fell within its powers under the CWA, and that the state therefore had imposed proper conditions for issuance of a license under the FPA.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fortnightly; Journal Volume: 132; Journal Issue: 20; Other Information: PBD: 1 Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 42-46","","","","Journal ID: FRTNE8; TRN: 95:000577-0006","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","88675","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/88675","","Fortnightly","20","132"

Throughout its 70-year existence, the Littlerock Dam in Southern California's Angeles National Forest has been a subject of the San Andreas Fault, could this 28-arch dam withstand any major movement from that fault line, much less the big one'' Working with the state's Division of Safety of Dams, Woodward-Clyde Consultants, Oakland, Calif., performed stability and stress analyses to find the answer. The evaluation showed that, as feared, the dam failed to meet required seismic safety criteria, principally due to its lack of lateral stability, a deficiency inherent in multiple-arch dams. To provide adequate seismic stability the authors developed a rehabilitation design centered around the use of roller-compacted concrete (RCC) to construct a gravity section between and around the downstream portions of the existing buttresses. The authors also proposed that the arches be resurfaced and stiffened with steel-fiber-reinforced silica fume. The alternative design would have required filling the arch bays between the buttresses with mass concrete at a cost of $22.5 million. The RCC buttress repair construction, scheduled for completion this fall, will cost about $13 million.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Civil Engineering (New York, 1983); (United States); Journal Volume: 64:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 60-62","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-7024; CODEN: CIEGEK","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6954802","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6954802","","Civil Engineering (New York, 1983); (United States)","","64:9"

Turbine models were constructed with three different numbers of blades, three different angles of water entry to the runner, and three different inner-to-outer diameter ratios. Nozzles were also constructed for the experiments to match the three different angles of water entry to the runner. A total of 27 runners were tested with the three nozzles. The results of the experiments clearly indicated that efficiency increased with increase in the number of blades. Moreover, it was determined that an increase in the angle of attack beyond 24 deg does not improve the maximum turbine efficiency. In addition, as a result of these experiments, it was determine that for a 24 deg angle of attack 0.68 was the most efficient inner-to-outer diameter ratio, whereas for higher angles of attack the maximum efficiency decreases with an increase in the diameter ratio from 0.60 to 0.75.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Fluids Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 116:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 545-550","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0098-2202; CODEN: JFEGA4","10.1115/1.2910311","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6896786","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6896786","","Journal of Fluids Engineering; (United States)","","116:3"

The paper examines transient phenomena on connection of induction generators at close to synchronous speed in determining whether costly system reinforcement may be avoided thus making many uneconomic developments viable while satisfying constraints of permissible voltage dip if the transient phenomena is taken duly into account. More use of renewable energy in electricity supply thus receding greenhouse gas emissions from fossil plant will therefore result. Parameters of significance in evaluating voltage dip due to direct connection of induction generators running at close to synchronous speed which are studied include (1) effective resistance of stator together with system resistance and reactance of effective infinite supply, (2) rotor circuit parameters, (3) speed of generator on connection, and (4) equivalent inertia of rotor and turbine. Results depicted in Tables an din Time Response demonstrate relative importance of the parameters on voltage dip. It is concluded that costly system reinforcement may be avoided if detailed simulations are performed where dynamics and transients are fully modeled in assessing magnitude and duration of voltage dip. The analysis is based on a detailed induction generator model with single and double rotor bar simulation using Park's equations with simulation of rotor dynamics on connection of the generator to the electrical supply.","","","","","","United States","1994-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 9:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 460-465","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE4","10.1109/60.326463","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6827843","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6827843","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","9:3"

Fracturing of the toe of a dam, especially a gravity-arch dam, is accompanied by an increase of shear stresses in the rock under it to values exceeding the design values, and owing to fracturing of the rock below the dam foundation deformation movements of the dam toward the lower pool increase markedly, moreover, the greater amount, the more considerable the depth of fracturing below the dam foundation. As a result the tensile stresses in the rock in front of the dam increase to values exceeding the allowable, which intensifies cracking of this rock zone to a greater depth, the deeper the fracturing of the rock beyond the dam. Owing to this, the stress state of the foundation directly under the dam, accompanied by a decrease of the bearing capacity of the rock and increase of its deformation with loss of the required seepage strength, worsens.","","","","","","United States","1994-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1994; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 2, 27-34(Feb 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 85-94","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 95:000883-0004","10.1007/BF01545845","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","62926","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/62926","","Hydrotechnical Construction","2","28"

Of them, 480, or 40% were constructed and are being operated by federal or national agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, Tennessee Valley Authority, etc. These dams make up only a small percentage of the 67,000 dams in the USA. The majority of these dams are not under federal jurisdiction, therefore the dams are managed under city, state, or federal decrees pertaining to nonfederal dams. For the federal dams, the federal government gives clear guidelines pertaining to safety service; surveys and design; construction; operation and maintenance; and a model program for dam safety staffs. The author states that inspection of dams by national institutions or staffs is necessary from the start of design and during their entire time of their existence, and should be established by law.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1994; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 1, 26-30(Jan 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 31-35","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 94:008228-0005","10.1007/BF01545097","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","35445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/35445","","Hydrotechnical Construction","1","28"

The main information on the degree of safety of a structure is obtained by comparing information about the actual state of the structure obtained on the basis of measurements in key zones of the structure with the predicted state on basis of the design model used when designing the structure for given conditions of external actions. Numerous, from hundreds to thousands, string type transducers are placed in large HSs. This system of transducers monitor the stress-strain rate, seepage, and thermal regimes. These measurements are supported by the State Standards Committee which certifies the accuracy of the checking methods. To improve the instrumental monitoring of HSs, the author recommends: Calibration of methods and means of reliable diagnosis for each measuring channel in the HS, improvements to reduce measurement error, support for the system software programs, and development of appropriate standards for the design and examination of HSs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jul 1994; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 1, 14-17(Jan 1994)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 15-19","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 94:008228-0002","10.1007/BF01545094","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","35442","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/35442","","Hydrotechnical Construction","1","28"

This led to more than 3,000 EIA documents being prepared and officially submitted up to 1992. More recently, a new act, the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, was introduced in 1992. As a consequence, some aspects of environmental legislation have been improved including the EIA process, which is expected to be more effective under the new act. This article examines the development and implementation of the EIA process in Thailand and its effectiveness in the context of its performance as an environmental management tool. The strengths and weaknesses of the EIA process under the original act are analyzed and compared to the new act, using two case studies in order to gain an insight into the EIA system. The first is the Second Stage Expressway in Bangkok, and the second is the Pak Mun Hydroelectric Dam project in Ubon Rachathani, a northeastern province of Thailand. EIAs for these projects were originally submitted according to the requirements of the old act. Both are public projects that have aroused controversy for different environmental reasons, although final decisions have been made facilitating the implementation of these projects. Finally, the article presents some suggestions for improving the content and procedures for the EIA system in Thailand.","","","","","","United States","1994-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Impact Assessment Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 14:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 271-294","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0195-9255; CODEN: EIARDK","10.1016/0195-9255(94)90023-X","","2016-05-26T00:00:00Z","7259192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7259192","","Environmental Impact Assessment Review; (United States)","","14:4"

A major portion of these structures utilize earth auxiliary spillways to pass major flood flows around the dam. Despite their widespread successful use, the processes by which these spillways resist failure are only imperfectly understood. Design procedures and criteria (US Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1956, 1973, 1985) have tended to be empirical and based on limited data. Therefore, the USDA, SCS and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) developed a research and field data acquisition program with the goals of improving the understanding of the erosional processes involved and developing new criteria for design and analysis. This paper's analysis considers the attack threshold above which the headcut advance would be expected to take place. This analysis represents a portion of the DAES team effort carried out by the authors in consultation with other team members. The relations developed may be used to estimate conditions under which headcuts would be expected to become unstable.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin of the Association of Engineering Geologists; (United States); Journal Volume: 31:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 277-280","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-5691; CODEN: AEGBBU","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7231905","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7231905","","Bulletin of the Association of Engineering Geologists; (United States)","","31:2"

Before construction of the hydroelectric dams, the sediment discharge rate was approximately 70 x 10[sup 6] t/yr. The sharp reduction in sediment load is largely a result of the dams near the mouths of the Yesil Irmak and Kizil Irmak rivers. Before the construction of dams, Turkish rivers contributed approximately one third of the total amount of sediment received by the Black Sea from all surrounding rivers. The life-span of the major reservoirs varies from approximately only one century (Yesil Irmak river reservoirs) to several thousand years (Sakarya river reservoirs).

A desire to gain the ability to evaluate hydrogenerator governors (speed controllers) in forms completely equivalent to that which could be used to control actual hydrogenerators is the primary motivation for this work. The simulator is designed so that one linear system nay be conceptualized as an error controller while the second system may be thought of as a plant under control. The simulator is specialized in that it allows direct entry of the hydrogenerator system parameter values of one of two linearized hydrogenerating system plant models. An option to enter the gains of a generic PID controller also exists. This PID controller may be utilized to simulate a governor for a hydrogenerator, thus allowing the real-time simulation of a closed-loop speed-controlled hydrogenerating system. Simulation accuracy is established by comparing computed results to those computed by an accepted standard'' software package.

The values of different survey methods and monitoring organisms used in this document are evaluated following 10 years of fauna monitoring and research subsequent to the preparation of the EIS. The pilot fauna reconnaissance was found to be of little value, although the associated literature review formed an integral part of the EIS. Over 95% of all amphibian, reptile and bird species recorded at Olympic Dam were confirmed or predicted to occur in the EIS. Mammal predictions were less accurate because of the sparse populations and irruptive nature of several arid-zone species. Prediction and monitoring of rare species were demonstrably difficult. The Olympic Dam Project EIS was found in general to be an accurate and useful document.

A series of modeling criteria are suggested that aim at compelling modelling work with current data, explicitly represent the current understanding of a system, include considerations of variability, and address predictive uncertainty. Models which do so provide a rigorous framework for the comparison of alternative courses of action. As an example of the methodology, the problems associated with the fishway design, highlighting the required statistical analysis and insights, are discussed. Comparison of the modelling results to those gained from operational experience with real fishways were used to validate model results and ensure model credibility. The models were then used to examine the effect of design on interactions between pools in fishways as a means of selecting the designs which minimized migration stress. 15 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Management; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: May 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 67-77","","","","Journal ID: JEVMAW; ISSN 0301-4797; TRN: 96:003595-0003","10.1006/jema.1994.1034","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","258884","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/258884","","Journal of Environmental Management","1","41"

Recently, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) required a hydropower project in Virginia to install a $400,000 fishway as a condition of receiving its license. The noteworthiness of this event lies in the fact that there is currently no possibility of anadromous fish reaching the project. The project is located at the third dam upstream from the mouth of the river, above two dams with no fishway facilities to allow fish to bypass these dams. FERC's apparent concern was that fishways might one day be built at the intervening dams. In the end, FERC authorized the mothballing of this fishway until such time as anadromous fish could reach the dam, if ever. Everyone recognizes the need for fishways that allow the movement of anadromous fish, such as salmon, upstream and downstream past hydropower dams. However, recent hydropower licensing experiences emphasize the need for a reasoned approach based upon feasibility and sound objectives for fish resources. When single projects are made to install expensive fishways in circumstances not supported by objectives or when fishway requirements appear to be limited only be the project's ability to bear the cost, these requirements take on the guise of a penalty to make up for perceived past damage to the resource. Congress and the public will want to pay close attention to any such tendency because such a penalty raises the cost of electricity generated by hydropower facilities with questionable gain.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 84-87","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7248524","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7248524","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:4"

The experiments included measurements of torque, rotational speed, flow rate, and total head in physical models of turbines and nozzles. One physical parameter (flow rate) and six geometric parameters of the turbine were investigated: the angle of water entry to the runner, diameter ratio, number of blades, flow-stream spreading, runner aspect ratio, and blade exit angle. A total of 39 runners and 11 nozzles were tested in 75 different combinations. Analysis performed on the results identified the impact of the different parameters on the turbine efficiency. The results indicate that with careful selection of the cross-flow turbine parameters, efficiencies as high as 88.0% with an uncertainty of [+-]2.4% can be achieved. This is considered an improvement over the claimed maximum efficiency reported in the literature.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-34","","","AC21-89MC26255","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9402; CODEN: JLEED9","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1994)120:1(17)","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7157678","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7157678","","Journal of Energy Engineering; (United States)","","120:1"

This type of plant can also substantially increase the effective capacity of existing transmission lines and improve the performance of thermal generating units. The Mt. Hope Waterpower Project, planned for Rockaway Township, NJ, 35 miles west of New York City, lies strategically adjacent to major load centers at the eastern end of the PJM control area and near the interconnection point with the New York Power Pool (NYPP). This location also is in an area deficient in significant generating facilities. Maximum design capacity of the project is 2000 MW, provided by six reversible pump/turbines, each with a nominal 340-MW rating. The upper reservoir, with a surface area of only 60 acres, provides 5000 acre-ft of active storage volume - equivalent to 10 GWh of nominal energy storage. The Mt.

This is particularly true in Argentina, where recent operating concession and ownership arrangements with CMS Generating Co. and Duke Energy Corp. for the country's two largest hydropower projects are the latest developments in Argentina's effort to develop private power. By the end of last year, Argentina had opened more than 7,000 MW of generation assets to privatization. In July, Hidroelectrica Norpatagonia S.A. (Hidronor) sold the 1,320 MW El Chocon project located on the Limay River in southwestern Argentina to the Hidroinvest S.A. consortium composed of CMS Generating Co., Chilean electric company Empressa Nacional de Electridad (Endesa), the Argentina province of Neuquen, BEA Associates and Sawgrass Limited of Spain. CMS holds about 15 percent of the ownership interest in El Chocon, a two-unit facility consisting of the 1,200 MW El Chocon station and the 120 MW Aroyito station on the Limay River. The plants will be operated by CMS according to a 30-year concession agreement. The other Argentine consortium that made financial headlines at the end of 1993 was Hidronenquen S.A., an international group of investors consisting of Duke Energy, Chilgener S.A. of Chile and TransAlta Energy of Canada. This consortium was awarded majority ownership and operation of Hidroelectrica Piedra del Aguila S.A., a 1,400 MW facility also on the Limay River, 62 miles upstream from the El Chocon station. The Emerging Marks Growth Fund Inc. and the New World Investment Fund, based on Los Angeles, Calif., are financial investors for the consortium's $272 million bid, which was selected in November by the government. Hidronenquen S.A. assumed ownership and operation of the complex in December 1993.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 70-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6994867","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6994867","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:3"

The laboratory study has focused on riprap degradation under wave attack, and on the influence of fine blocks incorporated into riprap. Unlike flatter riprap, steep riprap is characterized by a low rate of damage until a point of acceleration, after which damage progresses rapidly. At that stage, damage is characterized by sliding and crumbling, which results in an upward propagation of damage toward the crest. The inclusion of a portion of small blocks into the riprap significantly reduces the stability of seep riprap. This detrimental effect is gradually reduced as the riprap slope becomes flatter.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 514-527","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1994)120:3(514)","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","7235614","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7235614","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","120:3"

Adaptive control strategies attempt to address the robustness issue by optimizing control parameters as changes occur in the plant. This paper investigates the genetic algorithm as one possible means of adaptively optimizing the gains of a proportional-plus-integral hydrogenerator governor. Previous work has shown that the genetic algorithm can effectively optimize the control parameters for a fixed plant. An enhanced version of the genetic algorithm, using the notions of diploidy and dominance, can be used to address the robustness issue. Here, changes in the conduit time constant as well as load constant are considered. It is shown that the genetic algorithm can effectively follow changes in the plant parameters, producing optimal control parameters in an adaptive environment.","","","","","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 9:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 179-185","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE4","10.1109/60.282490","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","7169824","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7169824","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","9:1"

Cores from other areas of the lagoon show little metal loading. Metal loading followed the closure of the Aswan High Dam, the availability of abundant cheap electricity, and the development of major power-based industries. Industrial wastes containing potentially toxic metals are dumped into the Nile delta drain system. The load carried by Bahr El-Baqar drain discharges into the Ginka subbasin, which acts as a sink and results in metal loading of the sediment deposited there. Further development of aquaculture in this subbasin, of food-stuff agriculture on recently reclaimed lagoon bottom, or where irrigation waters come from Bahr El-Baqar drain or its discharge should be halted or strictly limited until potentially toxic metals in the drain waters and sediment are removed and polluted input drastically reduced. This environmental assessment of heavy metals in aquaculture or agriculture development should extend to other waterbodies in the northern Nile delta, particularly Idku lagoon and Lake Mariut, where industrial metal-bearing wastes discharge into the waterbodies. 21 refs., 7 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1994-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Geology and Water Sciences; Journal Volume: 23; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Mar 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 89-98","","","","Journal ID: EGWSEI; ISSN 0177-5146; TRN: 95:005128-0002","10.1007/BF00766981","","2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","90804","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/90804","","Environmental Geology and Water Sciences","2","23"

Reduced load growth, forecasting uncertainty, and growing concerns about the economic, environmental, and social effects of energy decisions encouraged changes in the way system planning is conducted. At BC Hydro, the focus has shifted from development of large, capital-intensive hydroelectric projects toward options that provide smaller, less expensive, and more flexible additions to its system. Under a program called Resource Smart, existing hydro plants - which produce more than 95 percent of the utility's annual generation - are being rehabilitated and upgraded. Operating procedures also are being overhauled, and a variety of other measures are being implemented to gain more energy out of current resource inventories. BC Hydro does plan to add new generating units - but only at existing power plants or dams without hydroelectric facilities. The guiding principle is: every cost-effective project at an existing facility should be at least underway before the utility applies for regulatory approval to build its next major hydroelectric project at an undeveloped site. Since Resource Smart began, BC Hydro has added more than 920,000 megawatt-hours-per-year in energy gains. These additions have cost an average 0.7 cent per kilowatt-hour, just one-eighth of the marginal cost of acquiring that same supply from new hydro plants.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 8:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 10-19","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7202786","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7202786","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","8:1"

The stress redistribution analysis was conducted under fully undrained condition to consider the effects of strain-softening behavior of liquefied materials. The reconsolidation analysis was conducted using Biot's theory to consider the effects of dissipation of excess pore-water pressures. The results reveal that the delayed pore-water pressure response and deformation may be due to the redistribution of stresses and pore-water pressures.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 274-289","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1994)120:2(274)","","2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","5074777","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5074777","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","120:2"

The world theoretical, technical, and economic hydropower potential of rivers is evaluated. Global aspects of interest in construction of hydroelectric stations and actual construction of pumped-storage stations is discussed. It is concluded that: (1) A comparable evaluation of hydropower resources for continents and countries should be made on the basis of the technical hydropower potential and not the economic potential, which depends to a greater extent on the specific economic development for each country at a given time. (2) Works on developing hydro resources are being actively carried out in a number of developed and developing countries by constructing small hydroelectric stations, but the main role in their development is played by the construction of large and medium hydroelectric stations. (3) Due to the active construction of pumped-storage stations in a number of countries, the number of hours of use of the installed capacity has a clear tendency toward a decrease. 11 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","1994-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotechnical Construction; Journal Volume: 27; Journal Issue: 8; Other Information: PBD: Feb 1994; TN: Translated from Gidrotekhnicheskoe Stroitel`stvo; No. 8, 1-8(Aug 1993)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 435-443","","","","Journal ID: HYCOAR; ISSN 0018-8220; TRN: 94:005823-0001","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","441395","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/441395","","Hydrotechnical Construction","8","27"

Infestations in the Great Lakes region have already reached natural disaster proportions. The invasion shows little sign of subsiding; Michigan's inland waters are the next most likely threatened area. In the southern United States, the mussles' migration has extended about 50 miles deeper than experts had originally predicted. By the year 2000, zebra mussel monitoring and control efforts will cost business and industry $5 billion, according to the federal Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. Estimates of more than $1 million to control mussel fouling are projected for the Great Lakes area alone. While small independent hydropower stations are not as susceptible to zebra mussles as coal or nuclear facilities, there is cause for concern. Infestations can quickly foul hydropower plant components, hampering equipment operation and reducing facility efficiency. In extreme cases, leaving the mussels unchecked can result in stoplog gate flow blockage or false water level gauge readings. Advance prevention is often an effective first-line of defense against this troublesome, rapidly spreading and extremely prolific mollusk. Mussel monitoring efforts should begin a year in advance of when zebra mussels are expected to appear in a given location. Hydropower facility components that come into contact or rely exclusively on raw water are at greatest risk, as are other external components such as embayment walls, screens, trashracks and fish ladders.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5068559","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5068559","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:1"

Owners include the US federal government, provincially owned Canadian utilities, municipalities, irrigation and water conservation groups, rural electric cooperatives, and private developers. Taken together, these new projects offer a telling commentary on trends and issues in the North American hydroelectric industry. A pervasive theme among the 1993 projects is one of making the most of what's available; that is, developing new hydropower capacity at existing structures - existing dams, irrigation canals, water supply conduits. Another is attention to environmental protection and incorporation of power facilities into the natural surroundings. A third is blending the old with the new through redevelopment of abandoned sites and refurbishing used equipment. In addition to these themes, another observation can be made: there is an abundance of diversity in hydro development in North America-diversity in approach, diversity in equipment, and diversity in the developers themselves.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12-20","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5068602","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5068602","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:8"

The benefits Adirondack Hydro offered Niagara Mohawk included savings in revenue requirements for the utility and its ratepayers, savings in avoided cost payments, avoidance of the risk associated with redeveloping the project, an increase in the generation and capacity of the project, and additional revenues for the utility through payments for the lease of the site. In return, Adirondack received a 40-year power purchase contract at competitive prices for any electricity generated by the project and a long-term source of income for the company and its shareholders. The redeveloped Middle Falls project has been generating electricity and providing benefits to Adirondack Hydro, Niagara Mohawk and its ratepayers since 1990. This example demonstrates an alternative for hydropower developers who are finding new project development problematic at best - especially in the United States. Federal regulatory initiatives and new state activism are combining to make greenfield development more difficult. Nevertheless, developers and utilities are exploring market niches for the deployment of new technologies and the opportunities for redevelopment and expanded operation of existing hydroelectric projects. At the same time, the new competitive utility marketplace has caused investor-owned utilities to explore ways to reduce or eliminate operating expenses on their systems in an effort to increase shareholder earnings while decreasing the cost of service. These elements have combined to create opportunities for the redevelopment of utility-owned hydroelectric projects such as was done with the Middle Falls Project.","","","","","","United States","1994-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 24:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 65-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5068666","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5068666","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","24:1"

The cancellation, a senior Hydro-Quebec official claimed, would not jeopardize the future of its controversial Great Whale hydro project in the North. Bu Hydro-Quebec has quietly shoved Great Whale onto the back burner while an environmental review is underway. In the meantime the utility is barreling ahead with another mega-dam. The Ste. Marquerite project planned for north-eastern Quebec is modest by Hydro-Quebec standards, generating less than a third the power of Great Whale. Still, with an 880-megawatt power station and 190 square miles of reservoirs, it is one of the largest hydro projects on any drawing board in North America.

Three Gorges, which has inspired Chinese poets from Li Po (701-762 A.D.) to Chairman Mao, is so revered that its dramatic beauty appears on Chinese $5 and $10 bill. Despite its beauty and cultural significance, however, the gorges area could be destroyed should the Chinese carry out their plans to construct he world`s most powerful hydroelectric dam, and a war is being waged on three continents to keep the steel-and-concrete behemoth from going ahead.

"Floating intake reduces pump damage","Kronig, A","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; INTAKE STRUCTURES; SWITZERLAND","The solution to a costly sand erosion problem at the Grande Dixence hydroelectric project in Switzerland turned out to be as simple as a floating pump. The 726-MW Grande Dixence project drains a 350-square-kilometer reach of the Zermatt and Herens valleys in the southwestern Swiss Alps. About half of the drainage area is covered by active glaciers. Because the glaciers in Zermatt Valley are so low in altitude, their water is collected in Z`mutt Reservoir at the base of the Matterhorn, then pumped up 500 meters for transport to the main Grande Disence Reservoir near Sion. The glacier water is heavily laden with sand. In spite of a gravel pass and a desilter, the 700,000-acubic-meter Z`mutt Reservoir receives large quantities of sand. The sand tends to remain in solution because of the low water temperatures (1 to 2 degrees Centigrade). In the original intake system, the sand would be sucked into the pump intakes, causing extensive erosion to the pump wheels and an expensive yearly program of repair. (Pump damage averaged 200,000 Swiss Francs ($284,000 U.S.) per year between 1980 and 1985.)","","","","","","United States","1993-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review Worldwide; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Win 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 37","","","","Journal ID: XZ491N; TRN: 96:002201-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","245445","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245445","","Hydro Review Worldwide","3","1"

Electricite de France offers ideas useful in seeking this goal. During their long lives, hydropower plants must endure both economic cycles and technological revolutions. To survive, hydro plants designed and built in one era must eventually be re-rationalized within the parameters of another era. At Electricite de France (EDF), we have studied methods for adapting hydropower plants to changing economic and technological conditions. We have undertaken a vast hydro plant refurbishing program, adapting facilities to new criteria dictated by the increased value of peak load generation and by the need for increased power.

"Ozone detection system provides operating benefits","Laakso, J","13 HYDRO ENERGY; OZONE; DETECTION; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; BRITISH COLUMBIA","Ozone plays a paradoxical part in a hydro plant. On the one hand, the colorless gas is a potent threat to safe and efficient operation of generating units. Even small quantities of ozone can hurt plant workers` respiratory systems and corrode generator windings. Looked at from another perspective, however, ozone is a potentially valuable tool for monitoring the condition of generating machinery. Ozone (O{sub 3}) is produced when molecular oxygen (O{sub 2}) decomposes, freeing single oxygen atoms to combine with paired ones. In air-cooled generators, this reaction is triggered by slot discharge, arcing brushes, and other forms of corona activity. Whatever the specific cause, it`s a safe assumption that if any significant level of ozone is present in a hydroelectric plant, something is wrong.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review Worldwide; Journal Volume: 1; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Fal 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 34","","","","Journal ID: XZ491N; TRN: 96:002202-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","245438","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/245438","","Hydro Review Worldwide","2","1"

For decades, the Pacific Northwest has relied upon hydropower as a reliable and economic means of generating electricity. In recent years, however, in the Columbia River Basin, efforts to protect diminishing salmon stocks have taken precedence over the development of new hydropower plants. With that in mind, the Northern Wasco County PUD in Oregon set out to develop a hydroelectric project that not only provided for fish passage, but also took advantage of an existing fishway. The Dalles Dam North Fishway Project began operating in 1991. The project site is a fishway at the US Army Corps of Engineers' The Dalles Lock and Dam.

"Reducing the effect of penstock pressure pulsations on hydro electric plant power system stabilizer signals","Nettleton, L D; Gurney, J H; Bollinger, K E","13 HYDRO ENERGY; 24 POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION; LOW-HEAD HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; ELECTRIC GENERATORS; ON-LINE CONTROL SYSTEMS; AC SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION; HYDRAULIC TURBINES; PRESSURE DEPENDENCE","A characteristic trait of Francis turbines operating at low-head is pressure pulsations that occur during certain load levels of the generator. These stem from pressure variations across the turbine due to pulsating flow in the draft-tube. This surging action of the water column is related to draft-tube geometry and flow-rate of water in the penstock. The pressure pulsations cause torque variations on the turbine and corresponding electric power pulsations. If electric power is used as a feedback signal to the Power System Stabilizer (PSS), then Mvar and terminal voltage pulsations will occur when the generator is operating in the ``rough zone``. This paper describes field test results for investigating feedforward control from the penstock, draft tube and spiral case pressure to reduce the effects of Mw pulsations on PSS output signals. This investigation involved a PSS with generator power as the feedback signal and the PSS tuned for local and inter-area damping.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion; Journal Volume: 8; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 628-631","","","","Journal ID: ITCNE4; ISSN 0885-8969; TRN: IM9412%%350","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","142437","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/142437","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","4","8"

We apply ordinal logistic regression to the ranks using the scores of the attributes as explanatory variables. As expected, we find that higher negative scores are generally associated with greater implicit willingness to pay to avoid the environmental damage tied to the attribute, caused by hydropower development. We derive total (ordinary economic and implicit environmental) costs for each project and find that environmental costs per capacity unit generally are lower than economic costs for projects ranked for early exploitation and higher for projects ranked for later development. Our derived implicit long-run marginal cost curve for Norwegian hydropower development is generally upward sloping, but not uniformly so. 14 refs., 3 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; (United States); Journal Volume: 25:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 201-211","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0095-0696; CODEN: JEEMDI","10.1006/jeem.1993.1043","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","5698766","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698766","","Journal of Environmental Economics and Management; (United States)","","25:3"

Centrifuge studies on three identical models were used to determine the deformation characteristics of earth dams subjected to earthquakes large enough to produce flow slides. These studies suggest that the failure mode is considerably influenced by the reduction in shear strength caused by the void-ratio increase and the subsequent decrease in effective stress at the sand-clay interface. Conventional sliding block analysis does not consider this phenomenon. A simplified method using the concepts of critical-state soil mechanics is presented that may be used to estimate both the reduced shear strength and the redistributed void-ratio at the interface. Values predicted using this method were found to agree well with those observed in the centrifuge experiments. By integrating these quantities into Newmark's sliding block analysis, a better estimate of the permanent displacement of an earth dam may be obtained.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 119:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1717-1731","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1993)119:11(1717)","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5744118","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5744118","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","119:11"

An analytical closed-form solution is used for a dam in a semicylindrical canyon, subjected to obliquely incident harmonic SH waves. The dam is idealized as linearly hysteretic elastic body deforming only in shear, while the canyon is modeled as an elastic half-space. The model accounts in a rigorous way for the wave reflection and diffraction phenomena caused by the presence of the dam-canyon system. It is shown that the motion amplification is considerably less for a dam in flexible canyon than for, a dam in a rigid canyon and that the effects of radiation damping and asynchronous base motion may be very important. For oblique SH waves, the presence of antisymmetric terms in the solution may lead to response substantially higher than that induced by vertically propagating waves. Finally, as the canyon narrowness increases, the amplification at higher frequencies increases significantly for a rigid base, but it may decrease for a flexible base.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 119:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1696-1716","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1993)119:11(1696)","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","5621885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5621885","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","119:11"

The nation's economic growth and competitiveness depends upon an electricity supply that is adequate, dependable and affordable. If all existing accessible and licensable hydropower resources were developed today, an additional 41 billion kWh a year of generation could be achieved immediately from hydropower. However, development of much of the available hydropower resource is not likely to occur. New development is discouraged by the sheer magnitude of regulation and the length and cost of the licensing process. New license applications have fallen from 83 in 1986 to 30 in 1991, and they are still declining. Since 1986, less than one-half of the applications filed resulted in approved licenses and only about 60 percent of the approved licenses were completed to become operating projects. Thus, the probability of a project with a filed license application actually beginning operation is only about 25 percent. During the next 20 years, it is anticipated that coal will meet 86 percent of the additional electricity needed in the United States, with nuclear facilities contributing a small amount of this. Despite hydropower's regulatory and economic impediments, scant research and development support for the technology, and the steady decline in applications for hydropower development over the past 10 years, it is projected that hydropower will continue to contribute as much as wind and solar combined to meet the future US electricity needs, according to the DOE. Creating a level playing field for hydropower and other renewable technologies with respect to regulatory treatment and research support would encourage the immediate development of the hydropower potential that is presently economic and feasible.","","","","","","United States","1993-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 23:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 72, 74-76","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: IDPEEW","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5320239","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5320239","","Independent Energy; (United States)","","23:9"

It started back in the sixties during the battle over Arizona's Glen Canyon Dam. That case purportedly ended in a compromise with the Sierra Club to save the Grand Canyon from hydro development. But once built, the dam played havoc with Colorado River levels, disrupting rafting trips for Grand Canyon tourists. Even Barry Goldwater was later heard to rue the Glen Canyon project. Marc Reisner's 1986 book, Cadillac Desert, galvanized the antihydro faction. A few years later, calls arose for the City of San Francisco to dismantle its O'Shaughnessy Dam across the Hetch Hetchy Valley in the Sierra Nevada, just 15 miles north of famed Yosemite. That move failed. (Maybe San Francisco's oddball reputation had something to do with the result). But now we hear of plans underway to tear down dams on the Elwah River in Washington State's Olympic National Park, to reclaim lost salmon spawning grounds and return the parks to its natural state. This time the dam busters may win. These events are not unconnected. Strung together, they reveal a change in the popular opinion of how rivers, streams, and coastlines contribute to our economic well-being, and how the federal government should manage those economic resources. Federal hydropower control was born to govern our navigable waterways. It grew up as a tool to speed electrification and develop mining and logging. But forces today are seeking to make federal hydropower law more sympathetic to wildlife preservation. They argue that wildlife represents a national economic resource - no less so than timber, minerals, and shipping. This view is winning support from those in high positions, including the Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Elizabeth Moler.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fortnightly; (United States); Journal Volume: 131:19","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-63","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: FRTNE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5068715","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5068715","","Fortnightly; (United States)","","131:19"

For example, in general, the cost of living may be higher in one region compared to another, but for specific cities, that generalization may not always hold true. The same can be said of determining probable maximum precipitation (PMP) values for use in dam safety analyses. PMP values established for a large region (such as the eastern US) may not be appropriate when applied to a specific location within that region. The PMP is determined using observed storms together with meteorological conditions feasible in the geographic area of interest. Knowledge and understanding of the factors that control precipitation in the particular affected region are important. With this in mind, members of the Hydro Users Group in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan teamed with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to fund a regional probable maximum precipitation study. The goal was to minimize the subjectivity and reduce the margins of conservatism in determining PMP values for a particular area. The study provided a new approach to characterizing storm inflow moisture and area climatology that resulted in reduced PMP values for most areas and storm durations of interest. By using these reduced values in dam safety analyses, the requirements for dam owners to strengthen structures and expand spillways are either being reduced or eliminated, amounting to an estimated savings of $35 million in Wisconsin and Michigan.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5208363","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5208363","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:6"

Information from the cavitation and efficiency monitoring systems will provide additional input to probabilistic models for maintenance scheduling to minimize repair costs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 52-58","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5296358","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5296358","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:6"

Over the years, hydro operations and maintenance staff have created new techniques and tools for making the job easier. Responses to an informal survey of O M staff at a sampling of North American hydro plants suggests that the move to all stainless steel runners and the virtually universal use of stainless steel welding alloys in repairs has had a significant positive effect. Specifically, the interval between repairs has widened dramatically, often giving crews the opportunity to repair cavitation damage during routine maintenance of the entire turbine rather than being forced to shut down the unit for emergency work only on the runner.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 24-29","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5296363","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5296363","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:6"

BC Hydro has a comprehensive program to monitor the effects of aging on its network of hydropower dams, and implement the right repair and rehabilitation measures. The program, which involves dozens of members of the utility's engineering staff and millions of dollars in expenses, has proven that techniques are available to compensate for the effects of time on the structure and reliability of dams.

"Karstification at Beskonak dam site and reservoir area, southern Turkey","Degirmenci, M","13 HYDRO ENERGY; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; SITE CHARACTERIZATION; CONSTRUCTION; TURKEY; GEOLOGIC SURVEYS","Beskonak dam and hydroelectric power plant are planned to be constructed on the Koepruecay river, 40 km east of the Antalya city. In the dam site and reservoir area, Koepruecay Conglomerates of Miocene age and the Beskonak Formation (sandstone-claystone) alternating with each other crop out vertically. Koepruecay conglomerates, with the components of limestone fragments and carbonate texture, are karstic and permeable, whereas the Beskonak Formation is impermeable. At the northern edge of the reservoir area, the Olukkoeprue karst springs discharge at a minimum of 30 m{sup 3}/s. These springs discharge mainly through vertical and subvertical joint systems. Intensive superficial karstification developed along the joint systems and the terrane reveals columns of rocks, called {open_quotes}fairy chimneys.{close_quotes} Olukkoeprue springs represent the discharge point for a large and continuous system of underground solution cavities. In the Koepruecay basin, there are numerous karstic features within the conglomerates. Within the reservoir area, Kurukoeprue cave, with a length of 530 m, is an example of these caves developed within the conglomerates. In some parts of the reservoir area, where the groundwater level is lower than the surface-river elevation, a highly developed karstification zone is present within the fluctuation range of groundwater between depths of 40 and 50 m. The above-mentioned Kurukoeprue cave is an active cave developed in the dam site and its vicinity. The solution conduits developed along the system of mostly vertical fractures and joints are interconnected, thus giving rise to a three-dimensional conduit network. On the other hand, a majority of these conduits have clay and calcite filling materials. Karstification in the dam site varies with depths exponentially. Data suggest that karstification has a vertical extention as deep as -220 m. 4 refs., 9 figs.","","","","","","United States","1993-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Geology and Water Sciences; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 111-120","","","","Journal ID: EGWSEI; ISSN 0177-5146; TRN: 95:005134-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","90801","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/90801","","Environmental Geology and Water Sciences","2","22"

Here the authors summarize design, construction and mix-proportion data for these projects and relate some lessons learned from dams that have experienced overtopping flows. In the national dam safety inspection performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1977 to 1981, hydraulic deficiencies led the list of major problems--specifically, the inability of a dam to retain or safely pass the probable maximum flood (PMF). Common solutions for solving a hydraulic deficiency include raising the dam to increase storage, increasing spillway capacity, providing for safe overtopping, breaching the dam, or some combination of the first three choices. Site conditions or high costs frequently make the first two methods infeasible, and functional needs usually make breaching unacceptable. Providing for overtopping protection may be the only reasonable solution. Use of roller-compacted concrete (RCC) for overtopping protection has proven to be an economical and effective way to increase the hydraulic safety of a dam.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Civil Engineering ASCE; (United States); Journal Volume: 63:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 46-49","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-0556; CODEN: CEASE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5808890","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5808890","","Civil Engineering ASCE; (United States)","","63:8"

Many hydro plants are being required to improve protection of fish migrating downstream. This improved protection will be needed at both existing plants and newly developed facilities. By effectively screening fish from hydro plant intakes, fish mortality can be reduced, in many cases, to negligible (less than 3 percent) levels. The Modular Inclined Screen (MIS) and its predecessor, the Eicher Screen, are devices that offer promise for providing needed improvements in fish protection. The Electric Power Research Institute has conducted research on these devices since 1985-from proof-of-principle research to field testing toward commercialization. The MIS is [open quotes]modular[close quotes] so as to provide the design flexibility necessary for applications involving a broad range of water flows. The installed cost of an MIS is estimated to be less than half that of screens designed to meet conventional screening criteria such as a vertical traveling screen. The MIS and the Eicher Screen work on an entirely different principle compared to traditional methods of diverting fish. Traditional methods rely on the fish's ability to sense and to avoid barriers in the water. Consequently, velocities perpendicular to the screen are restricted to a maximum of 0.4 feet per second to accomodate for the fish's swimming ability. With the MIS and Eicher Screen, fish are screened past a hazard and swept through a bypass at high velocity. Swimming ability is not a prerequisite for passage.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 178-180","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5822792","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5822792","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:5"

Reclamation performed a number of temporary repairs before it became evident that the drain system must be rehabilitated. After considering several alternatives for rehabilitation, Reclamation selected stainless steel flexible hose liners for the job. Reclamation is satisfied with the performance of the stainless steel flexible hose liner. The total cost for installing the liners for nine drain lines (for three outlet tubes) was $15,000. Of that, materials cost $7,500, and labor and overhead cost $7,500. The inserts themselves cost from $640 for an 18-foot by 6-inch section.

Modular river management systems can make it easier to resolve water demands while generating the most electricity possible. The modular approach allows various departments and individuals to participate in building the system. Development becomes an interactive process with ideas and suggestions coming from all sources. The model becomes a function of the user rather than having the user adapt to the model. This ability eases acceptance of the module into the daily operation. As confidence in the program is gained, expansion becomes easier. The modular approach also requires a relatively small initial amount of funding. Small steps can be taken as capital is available. This approach puts system models within the reach of many small system owners and operators. Finally, the modular approach allows the user to begin realizing a range of benefits relatively quickly from the system. Those in turn, help him/her justify the economics of future development and expansion.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 34-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5809269","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5809269","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:5"

The fundamental formula has been known for half a century: clouds plus cold plus solid particles equal precipitation. What was not certain until more recently is how that relationship could be effectively used to alter the weather in positive ways. Research and practical experience now show that cloud seeding -- adding tiny solid particles to the right clouds at the right temperature -- works. More pertinent, evidence is mounting that hydropower producers can use well-designed, carefully times seeding programs to increase the amount of water available to their systems and thus enhance electricity generation. Cloud seeding has several advantages as a tool to augment hydroelectric production. Seeding programs typically require no capital investment by the utility or other power producer, and can be started and stopped on relatively short notice. Operating costs usually are less than $10 per acre-foot of additional streamflow. More broadly, the additional water produced for hydro generation has the environmental and community relations benefits of being reusable and less expensive than thermal power alternatives. There also normally are the additional benefits of increased water supplies for other users.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 122-128","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5809386","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5809386","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:5"

Such was the case at B.C. Hydro's 700-MW Peace Canyon Generating Station. At this station, a 175-MW turbine-generator experienced high stator split-phase currents on cold starts and high turbine bearing vibration at high loads. The vibration, measured at 24 mils (0.024 inch) peak to peak, exceeded the as-set turbine bearing clearance of 14 mils (0.014-inch) diametrical. Consequently, the utility derated the machine by 25 MW for a period of approximately seven months. B.C. Hydro contacted Powertech Labs Inc., the utility's applied technology subsidiary, and assigned the task of resolving the problem and restoring the unit to design capacity. Using vibration amplitude and phase vibrations as functions of the unit's rotational speed and load, Powertech investigators concluded that the problem of high vibrations on both the generator and turbine bearings were the result of mechanical unbalance on the generator, an enlarged turbine bearing clearance, and a hydraulic unbalance on the Francis turbine. The first step Powertech investigators took to improve the vibration readings on the generator and turbine was to [open quotes]compromise balance[close quotes] the generator. In this approach, the machine is mechanically unbalanced to counter magnetic unbalance. With the generator unbalance corrected, Powertech investigators recommended that the turbine bearing be inspected and reset to the design clearance of 14 mils (0.014 inch) diametrical. Resetting of the bearing resulted in significantly lower turbine vibration readings at high loads (less than 10 mils).","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 154-155","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","5890669","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5890669","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:5"

When the Control Gorge penstock in southern California ruptured, quick, successful action prevented complications. In the winter of 1991, a break occurred in the lower portion of the 8-foot-diameter Owens River Gorge penstock. The rupture created a vacuum, which caused about 1,500 feet of the pipe upstream of the break to collapse. Investigations by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) indicate that pressure surges in the penstock caused by rapid opening and closing of a turbine bypass-relief valve at the Control Gorge hydro plant and a defective weld at a manway (a small access that leads into the penstock) led to the rupture. Quick emergency repairs were required owing to the limited bypass capability around the penstock, the need for water flow for fish habitat in the lower sections of the Owens River, and water needs for Los Angeles. Within ten days, LADWP employees had temporarily repaired the penstock. In less than five months, workers had replaced the collapsed and ruptured sections, and returned the penstock to full service. The penstock rupture at Owens Gorge caused LADWP to recognize that older hydro plants may have hidden defects that would not have been left in place with current construction and inspection methods. Therefore, additional care should be taken during operation of these plants to avoid placing any unnecessary stresses on plant equipment.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6029436","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6029436","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:5"

A field-tested leak-locations survey, now commercially available, can provide construction quality assurance or solve a leakage problem in lined landfills, impoundments or tanks. A linear leak in a waste containment facility can be costly. The facility owner may face environmental cleanup costs and a loss of revenue while the leakage problem is being solved. Also, a new facility that exceeds the allowable leak rate, as defined in the design/operating permit, may not be accepted by the facility owner until the leakage problem is solved. This start-up delay may cause additional expenses or penalties for the general contractor, liner installer, and design engineering firm. This leak-location method involves connecting an electrical power supply to electrodes placed above and below a geomembrane to detect areas of localized electrical-current flow through leaks in the liner. If there are no leaks in the geomembrane, a very low current will flow across the liner producing relatively uniform voltage distribution in the material above the liner. If the liner has a leak, the current flows through the leak, causing an anomaly in the electrical distribution. Leaks are located by searching for these areas.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Civil Engineering ASCE; (United States); Journal Volume: 63:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 50-53","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0360-0556; CODEN: CEASE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6029562","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6029562","","Civil Engineering ASCE; (United States)","","63:8"

Every winter, ice jams have formed, raising lake levels and inundating upshore vegetation. At five sites by two lakes, the vegetation has remained flooded for about 160 d from mid-winter until spring. To monitor the effects of inundation, species frequency in 10- [times] 10-cm quadrats was recorded on permanent on permanent transects prior to disturbance and again after periods of up to 8 yr. At one site, measurements were made annually for the first 6 yr and again 8 yr after disturbance. Two types of response to winter inundation were distinguished: (1) species showing a steady decrease in frequency and (2) species apparently little affected for a number of years, then suddenly collapsing. Combining the five sites, the common species were classified according to the strength and nature of their response into four groups: (1) nine sensitive species that rapidly declined or disappeared with repeated submergence, (2) six species showing variable negative response, (3) five species showing little response, and (4) one species showing a positive response. The results show that arctic species which are characteristic of dry or moist habitats are intolerant of inundation, even when it occurs outside of the growing season.

The number of data required to estimate objectively the spatial correlation structure of permeability, however, is often prohibitive. The objective of this study was to develop a better understanding of how information about depositional processes can be used to characterize hydrogeological heterogeneity. An outcrop of the fluvial/interfluvial Sierra Ladrones Formation of New Mexico was studied for this purpose. On the basis of previous studies of paleogeography and our own field observations, deposits of the Sierra Ladrones Formation are interpreted as marginal ancestral Rio Grande flood-plain and tributary deposits. Architectural elements were mapped over a 0.16-km[sup 2] peninsular outcrop of Pliocene-Pleistocene deposits of the central Albuquerque Basin. Geostatistical analysis of the architectural-element map data indicates non-orthogonal anisotropy in the horizontal direction. The orientations of the strongest (N30[degree]W) and weakest (N90[degree]E) correlation correspond to the orientation of the tributary system and the ancestral Rio Grande flood plain, respectively. In the vertical direction, the correlation structure exhibits exponential behavior corresponding to the average-element thicknesses. The results demonstrate that information about depositional environment can be used to help to quantify statistically subsurface heterogeneity. 28 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geological Society of America, Bulletin; (United States); Journal Volume: 105:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 998-1007","","","FG04-89ER60843","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7606; CODEN: BUGMAF","10.1130/0016-7606(1993)105<0998:AOTSLF>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-05T00:00:00Z","5639140","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5639140","","Geological Society of America, Bulletin; (United States)","","105:8"

While not identified as a target resource, slope stability and the alteration of sediment supply to creeks and river mainstems significantly affect other resources. The slope stability assessment emphasized the potential for cumulative impacts under disturbed conditions (e.g., road construction and timber harvesting) and a landslide-induced pipeline rupture scenario. In the case of small-scale slides, the sluicing action of ruptured pipeline water on the fresh landslide scarp was found to be capable of eroding significantly more material than the original landslide. For large-scale landslides, sluiced material was found to be a small increment of the original landslide. These results predicted that hypothetical accidental pipeline rupture by small-scale landslides may result in potential cumulative impacts for 12 of the 19 projects with pending license applications in both river basins. 5 refs., 2 tabs.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1993-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Geology and Water Sciences; Journal Volume: 21; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1993","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 212-214","","","","Journal ID: EGWSEI; ISSN 0177-5146; TRN: 95:005132-0002","10.1007/BF00775909","","2016-05-18T00:00:00Z","86436","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/86436","","Environmental Geology and Water Sciences","4","21"

Fewer than 20% of the distributions were bimodal. Although tending to be coarser, spawning gravels had sorting and skewness values similar to other fluvial gravels reported in the literature. The range of gravel sizes used by fish of a given species or length is great, but the relation between fish size and size of gravel can be described by an envelope curve.

The decision to replace a liquid-immersed transformer with a dry-type product has a price: higher unit cost and a need to be more vigilant in detailing transformer specifications. But, whether the change affects only one failed transformer or is part of a plant rehabilitation project, the benefits in safety can be worth it. Voltages on hydroelectric plant auxiliary power systems can range from a 20 kV medium-voltage system to the normal 480-208/120 V low-voltage system. Dry transformers typically are used in such systems to reduce the fire hazard present with liquid-filled transformers. For a hydro plant owner or engineer seeking alternatives to liquid-filled transformers, there are two main kinds of dry-type transformers to consider: vacuum pressure impregnated (VPI) and cast coil epoxy resin. VPI transformers normally are manufactured in sizes up to 6,000 kVA with primary voltage ratings up to 20 kV. Cast coil transformers can be made in sizes from 75 to 10,000 kVA, with primary voltage ratings up to 34,500 V. Although the same transformer theory applies to dry transformers as to liquid-filled units, the cooling medium, air, required different temperature rise ratings, dielectric tests, and construction techniques to ensure reliability. Consequently, the factory and field tests for dry units are established by a separate set of American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards. Cast coil transformers have several important advantages over VPI units.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 68-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6011157","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6011157","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

To avoid premature failures, hydro plant owners operate generators so that the maximum winding temperature (hot spot) is limited to a pre-determined value. In order for operators to monitor winding temperature, generator manufacturers embed several resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) in the armature winding. RTDs typically are placed from one to three elevations in the generator core. However, these elevations may not coincide with the locations of maximum winding temperatures during actual operation. It normally is impractical to embed additional RTDs at other elevations in the winding. A more practical alternative is to measure iron temperatures and air velocities at the outside (back) of the stator core to ensure that generators are being adequately monitored for maximum winding temperature. In a study for the New York Power Authority (NYPA), Power Engineering developed a finite element computer model that allows the use of back-iron temperature and air velocity data to predict internal winding temperatures. The model demonstrates that back-iron temperatures can be used to determine the location of the maximum winding temperature (hot spot). Furthermore, by changing the value of the convective coefficients based on measured air velocities, the model could be updated to determine the hot spot(s) in the pre-upgrade turbine-generators. Generator loading then could be controlled accordingly. Finally, if required, the model could be tailored further by accounting for end turn cooling effects. With changes in geometry, this kind of modeling can be used to predict winding temperatures in other generators.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 78-79","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6011235","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6011235","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is funding preparation and publication of the guidelines. The guidelines are expected to expedite the process for reporting information on dam incidents in a timely and complete manner. Much the same as the health care industry compiles and evaluates data related to the incidence of disease and the benefits of treatment, a single standard for reporting the performance of dams in the US will help create a national information base on the occurrence and consequence of dam incidents. Currently, incidents involving dam performance are not reported on a regular basis. The guidelines will define dam incidents in terms of events of engineering interest that provide insights to the safety and structural or operational integrity of dams. Examples of incidents include the performance of a dam that experiences ground motion from a large earthquake, extreme spillway or dam overtopping, rehabilitations made to satisfy dam safety requirements, embankment sliding of an earthen dam, and improper operations that leads to damage downstream. When an incident occurs, the satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance of a dam will be reported, either by a state dam safety official, the owner of the dam, or the owner's engineer.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 98","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6011404","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6011404","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission compiled the numbers for the latest version of Hydroelectric Power Resources of the United States, a report FERC issues every four years covering both developed and undeveloped capacity at both federal and nonfederal hydro sites. The latest version, expected to be available in the summer of 1993, covers the period from January 1, 1988, to January 1, 1992. The data lists a total developed US hydro capacity as of January 1, 1992, at 91,600 MW, a 3,700-MW (4.2 percent) increase from January 1, 1988. The remaining potential capacity was 73,200 MW, down 2,900 MW from 1988. Pumped storage was not included in data for potential capacity. Over the four-year period, there was a net decline in capacity that was authorized but not necessarily developed. FERC-authorized capacity went down to 55,300 MW from 58,000 MW < a 5 percent decrease. However authorized capacity at federal projects increased to 46,850 MW from 46,000 MW, an increase of nearly 2 percent. Construction was under way on 1,900 MW of FERC-authorized capacity and 350 MW of federal capacity as of January 1, 1992. That is a 39 percent decline in capacity under construction, compared to 3,100 MW of FERC-authorized and 300 MW of federal capacity under way four years before. Total potential conventional hydro capacity (developed and estimated to be available for development) was about 146,700 MW. About 73,500 MW have been developed (50 percent of the total potential).

With that in mind, Reclamation has launched Zebra Mussel Watch, a program aimed at early detection of the mussel in western waters. As part of the watch program, Reclamation suggests attaching one end of a rope to a weight such as a brock, rick, or cinder block, and placing the weight in shallow water to detect the arrival of zebra mussels. Any kind of rope will do, but nylon is preferred because small mussels are easier to distinguish on nylon's smooth surface than on ropes with rough surfaces. Young mussels smaller than the head of a common straight pin are transparent when they first settle and probably will not be visible to the naked eye for several weeks, when they are larger and they take on the appearance of small, dark-colored clams. [Note: over time, algae, bacteria, and debris will cause the rope to darken. So the color of the rope used doesn't make much difference.] Hang a rope in 8 feet or less of well-oxygenated water where wave action will not move the bottom of the rope to any great degree. (Zebra mussels like slow currents and will not attach where the current is moving 4 to 5 feet per second or faster.) Leave the rope in the water two or three weeks to allow microorganisms to grow on it. Young mussels will settle on surfaces that are coated with algae and other microscopic organisms. Then, at two- to three-week intervals, lift the rope and examine it for young mussels. If adults are around, the young eventually will show up. Reclamation believes that by detecting the first arrival of the mussels, it can implement plans to control the spread of the mussels and alert nearby projects to the approaching menace.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 76","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6263981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6263981","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

The project's sole source for filling and operating water, Heath Creek, drains only 15 square miles. Flow in the creek averages just 28 cubic feet per second (cfs). Even though the project area receives an average of 55 inches of precipitation each year, rainfall occurs very unevenly throughout the year. Evaporation from reservoirs frequently exceeds water inflow during the summer and early fall months. Studies showed it could take up to four years just to fill the project's lower reservoir. This limited water supply has made it necessary to conserve the water flowing into the Rocky Mountain Project in every way possible. From design through construction, and continuing into operations, conserving water is vital. The Rocky Mountain Project is designed to capture all of the water Heath Creek collects and to avoid wasting the resource once it's on site. Two auxiliary reservoirs were included in the project design to store water accumulated in wet years for use during drier ones. The project includes three major design features to reduce the seepage through water-retaining structures. The project team made additional modifications in response to conditions that developed in the course of construction.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 35-42","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6263986","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6263986","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

At the time, an abandoned hydroelectric plant near Cuero, Texas, on the Guadalupe River east of San Antonio, seemed an inexpensive way to get his two most costly ingredients: energy and water. He could take water from the river, generate 175 to 200 kilowatt-hours of electricity for his own use, and sell the excess power. The 1.2-MW plant McNeill found had stood idle and in disrepair since 1965 when the owner, Central Power and Light, shut it down after a flood. McNeill bought the plant from the current owners, brothers Ralph and Raleigh Coppedge. The brothers financed McNeill's purchase. He began work on the project, but repeated periods of high water and financial difficulty inhibited progress. Five years later, McNeill teamed with Jimmy Parker, another Texan with an interest and experience in restoring old hydro plants. Together, they formed Cuero Hydroelectric, Inc. During the next four years, they faced floods and solved existing structural problems. They disassembled and repaired the turbines and governors and designed control systems using state-of-the-art technology. Finally, with financial and moral support received from family and friends, they succeeded in bringing the Cuero hydro plant into operation in the winter of 1993.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 44-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6263998","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6263998","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

However, making use of the data was not always easy. The conventional cracked-base analysis method cannot take into account the effects of the dam and foundation stiffnesses. General finite-element software programs for determining dam stability using site-specific data were available, but required a great deal of manipulation, expertise, and time. In early 1987, representatives of utilities, consulting firms, FERC, and federal hydropower producers serving on an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) dam safety advisory committee agreed that a special computer code was needed to bridge the gap between traditional analytical practices and finite-element methods. Consequently, EPRI funded ANATECH Research Corp., a consulting engineer firm in San Diego, California, to develop CG-DAMS. This two-dimensional, finite-element computer code automates the stability analysis process. The menu-driven software prompts the user for input of a specific structure's geometry, loading (using input commands such as reservoir and tailwater elevations), and site-specific material properties in the dam and foundation. The results of the analysis are illustrated in easy-to-use graphical and tabular formats, and can be used to predict crack growth, shear, and normal stresses under normal loading, flood loading, and seismic loading. Although CG-DAMS was designed to respond to FERC's dam stability analysis requirements, it can be useful to any dam owner wanting to make more realistic stability assessments than the conventional cracked-base method that reflect site-specific conditions.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 52-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6203588","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6203588","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","7:4"

The Thomsom Hydroelectric Station is part of the St. Louis River Hydroelectric Project. Following a routine maintenance outage of the 10-MW hydrogenerator to repair a bearing in 1991, Minnesota Power engineers found that oil from the bearing had spilled onto the stator coils, softening and weakening the insulation. Subsequent testing revealed several failed coils. The utility faces two options to return the generator to service: cut out the damaged coils or repair them. Facing a possible stator winding replacement costing $650,000 if simply cutting out the coils did not work, the EPRI guide enabled Minnesota Power to pursue a third solution, repairing the failed coils at a cost of $23,000. The utility chose this option even though the work-replacing two damaged coils and ten surrounding coils with epoxy mica coils-involved a longer outage than cutting out the failed coils would require. Minnesota Power saved $400,000 in replacement power by avoiding the three months of downtime that would be required to replace the entire winding. The utility also saved $650,000 it would have spent to replace the generator winding had it been destroyed.

The system will control the temperature in the river downstream of the project from mid-June through October to benefit resident fish. Presently, Hungry Horse Dam releases frigid water (about 40[degrees]F) from the bottom of the reservoir all year long. This cold water slows fish growth and food chain production for nearly 50 miles downstream. Selectively withdrawing water from various temperature layers in the reservoir behind the dam will warm the water downstream, reproducing the natural temperature regime in the Flathead River. Returning the river to its natural temperatures will aid fish growth efficiently and spawning, improve habitat, and increase insect production. One design consideration for the system involved installing computer-controlled gates that move vertically along the top 20 feet of the trashracks. Other gates, installed farther down along the trashrack, will feature shutters operated by computer. A computer that monitors water temperatures, aquatic life zones, and other factors would determine when to open the gates to introduce water into the river from various reservoir levels. Hydraulic cylinders atop the trashracks would move the gates and/or shutters within the lower gates. Another design consideration includes a hard plastic [open quotes]curtain[close quotes] or panels surrounding the bottommost section of the trashracks.

These parameters which include inductances and induced back emfs are determines for a 75 kVA, 208 V, 400 Hz, two-pole, permanent magnet generator. Two particular stator designs, a toothless stator and a conventional type stator (with iron teeth), are considered. The method which is used to determine these parameters is general in nature and is based on the use of a series of magnetic field solutions. A validation of the computed emf and inductance values based on experimentally obtained data is given in the paper. The results of using these parameters in a state space model in the abc frame of reference to study the effects of a toothless stator design on the PM generator synchronous inductances are presented. Based on that, it is demonstrated that the effects of rotor saliency and armature loading on the machine parameters are minimized in the case of the toothless design.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 8:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 243-250","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE4","10.1109/60.222711","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5901438","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5901438","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","8:2"

Damage to the turbine runner blades, draft tube liner and discharge ring, and sometimes even the runner hub can require extensive welding repair. Typically, each unit develops its own cavitation characteristics that continue throughout the life of the machine. The traditional cavitation repair method is to gouge out the damaged material, then refill the void with a stainless steel. This method is costly and time-consuming, may cause blade distortion, and may result in galvanic corrosion when the stainless steel is applied to carbon steel base materials. What's more, this gouging and filling at temperatures between 2,200 and 2.300[degrees]F within a tenth of a square inch may cause residual stresses in the parent material. One strategy for limiting cavitation effects on turbine components is to overlay the original material with a protective layer. This protective coating will absorb the cavitation load, or at least a portion of it, thus limiting further damage to repaired areas. Typically, an overlay consists of a 1/32-inch or 1/16-inch layer of polymer material (either epoxies or ceramics) and a thin adhesive that bonds the polymer to the turbine steel. A cavitation-induced shock (energy) wave propagates through the polymer material and either reflects or transmits into the steel. (The relative acoustic impedances of the two materials determine whether the shock wave travels into the turbine steel or reflects back through the polymer.) For the overlay to be effective, the shock wave must be reflected, attenuated, or dispersed. typical overlay materials do not reflect, attenuate, or disperse the cavitation shock wave. Polycarbonates, with their unique energy dissipation capabilities, are a good candidate for a protective turbine blade coating.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 64-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6319840","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6319840","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:3"

For example, one of the first tasks for a developer of a proposed hydroelectric site is to collect river flow data for estimating annual energy production. And, once a project is operating, the owner must project is operating, the owner must collect numerous data for monitoring instream flow, reservoir levels, outflow, and dam stability. It is not unusual for data collection sites-such as project intakes-to be quite remote, miles away from roads or telephone lines. In these cases, collecting the data and getting it to a central office for analysis and/or monitoring can pose logistical problems. One option is using a cellular telephone for data collection and transmission. As cellular phone technology improves and more people begin using the equipment, companies are beginning to expand their service areas. These areas are now likely to include many remote hydro sites. The option of using cellular telephone telemetry to obtain needed data from a remote site is readily available and relatively inexpensive. However, in establishing such a system, the user may encounter numerous problems. When engineers from Synergics, Inc., a private hydro developer, installed a cellular phone data collection system, they experienced several complications.

Through rehabilitation, these producers are increasing efficiency and/or capacity at existing facilities that are several decades old. Rewinding a generator or replacing a turbine runner frequently results in performance that not only equals, but surpasses, the capabilities of the equipment when it was new. Rehabilitating existing plants also can be a much more economical way to add capacity than building new facilities. Reclamation, a part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, already has gained 1,372 MW of additional capacity through generator uprates, and should add another 230 MW by 1995. Output of a hydroelectric generator is limited by the capacity of its stator windings. Windings in an old generator frequently can be replaced with higher-capacity windings that occupy the same space. This replacement is possible because modern insulation occupies because modern insulation occupies less space, leaving room for larger windings within the same overall dimensions. Therefore, the need for a hydro plant owner to develop an effective set of technical specifications for generator rewinds is of upmost importance. Specifications should leave little room for debate about the technical abilities required to manufacture and to install required to manufacture and to install the present generation of [open quotes]hard coils[close quotes] (made of two-part, epoxy-type resin). To get the most out of a rewind, the warranty must be longer than one year; and Shrinkage of the material in the iron slot and thermal cycles of the coils cause them to become loose; therefore, the wedging system must be designed to keep the coils tight in the slot, yet flexible enough to allow thermal expansion of the coils during thermal cycling.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 10-14","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6155491","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6155491","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:3"

By extensively modernizing some of these plants, utilities can increase efficiency and equipment ratings and lower operations and maintenance costs, thus improving the use of water resources. However, many utilities do not have staff trained to evaluate potential plant rehabilitation or to compile and present economic justifications for spending money on plant rehabilitation studies and uprating. To address that situation, EPRI published the Hydropower Plant Modernization Guide, a three-volume report released in 1989 covering overall plant modernization, turbine runner replacement and generator rewinding, and automation. For a study of unit uprating at its Snoqualmie Falls Project, on the Snoqualmie River near Seattle, Puget Sound Power and Light Co. turned to this guide for assistance. The utility estimates the report enabled it to avoid $60,000 in consulting fees on the one project.

With this in mind, Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation have worked together to develop consistent safety signage and several for their hydro projects. Although the two utilities sometimes compete for electric customers, they cooperate to ensure the safety to those customers. Both WE and WPS took steps in 1986 to make their operations safer through involvement in the Wisconsin/Michigan Hydro User Group. The organization has 25 members-primarily of electric utilities and paper companies-who operate hydro facilities in the two states. The two areas that the HUG studied in public safety were signs and warning systems. HUG established a sign committee to study how to increase safety of people around hydro plants through signs, explained Ted Handrick, hydro plant superintendent at WPS. The committee's recommendations led to development of a statewide uniform sign system adopted by all HUG members. The committee used Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' guidelines for warning signs and portages in developing the signage standards. HUG members are converting to these new sign standards as they replace old signs and/or install new signs. Notices describing the new signage system have been placed near each hydro plant, at boat landings, and in campgrounds. The signs are mounted well above ground level so they can be seen and easily read by recreationalists. Warning systems, in accordance with HUG warning standards, were installed at WE and WPS hydro facilities. These systems alert nearby recreational users of rapid increases in water flow when generating units are turned on or when spillway gates are opened. Soon after the authors installed equipment to remotely operate its hydro facilities, the utility experienced a dramatic increase increase in intrusion on dams and other structures at the projects.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 40-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6155272","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6155272","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:3"

The test, at the 529-MW Kootenay Canal project, proved the ability of the monitor to detect machine condition faults. The capability to detect changing conditions during normal operation of hydroelectric machines gives hydro plant owners the opportunity to anticipate needed maintenance and ultimately to reduce the number of equipment failures. BC Hydro intends to install bearing condition monitors, as well as windings monitors, brushgear monitors, environmental monitors, and other selected systems in as many as 46 of its hydro generators. BC Hydro analyzed forced outages between 1985 and 1989 in its hydro system to identify which parts of a generating unit resulted in the highest number of hours of outage. From there, the utility has formulated a concept for a machine condition monitoring system. To keep the system cost effective, it will be developed in modules. In this way, users can pick and choose from the available modules to best meet the monitoring needs at specific sites. The test at Kootenay canal focused on the performance of the bearing module. The test demonstrated that a bearing module will be capable of detecting mechanical, magnetic, and hydraulic unbalance; bearing clearance; shaft and bearing alignment; shear pin failure; rotor/stator concentricity; and seal rubs.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 82-83","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6363169","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6363169","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:3"

Now, when a site selected for development includes an area that may be classified as a wetland, the developer quickly discovers the importance of recognizing and protecting these natural habitats. Federal legislation severely limits development of wetland, and most states increase the restrictions with their own wetlands regulations. The difficulty of defining wetlands complicates federal and state enforcement. Land that appears to be dry may in fact be classified as a wetland. So, even if a site appears dry, potential hydro developers must confirm whether or not any jurisdictional wetlands are present. Regulated lands include much more than marshes and swamps. Further complicating the definition of wetlands, a recent court decision found that even artificially created wetlands, such as man-made ponds, may be subject to regulation. Hydro developers must be aware of current regulatory requirements before they consider development of any site that may contain wetlands. To be certain that a site is [open quotes]buildable[close quotes] from the standpoint of wetlands regulation, a developer must verify (with the help of state agencies) that the property does not contain any jurisdictional wetlands. If it does, the regulatory process before development becomes much more complicated. For the short term, uncertainty abounds and extreme caution is in order. Because the regulatory process has become so complex and an agreeable definition of wetlands so elusive, the trend among the Corps and collaborating agencies is to constrict nationwide permits in favor of narrowing the jurisdictional definition of wetlands.","","","","","","United States","1993-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 46-51","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6363248","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6363248","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:3"

This problem can be solved by restoring the proper seal clearances. With this goal in mind, the Bureau of Reclamation began exploring modifications to seal ring design as part of ring replacement studies in 1980. After more than a decade of experimentation, Reclamation now recommends new materials for stationary and rotating seal rings. These materials are gall resistant to each other and to wear. Reclamation also recommends a design featuring an integral seal surface on a turbine runner, instead of a separate rotating seal ring.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-68","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6598585","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6598585","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:2"

Accurate adjustment enables water to flow evenly into each section of the runner. It permits wicket gates to open and close as designed, minimizing water loss and leakage, and extends the life of wicket gate linkages. Typically, wicket gates are checked and adjusted during major maintenance. In the case of a Kaplan runner, uneven flow may unbalance the runner and lead to shaft runout and loss in efficiency. Face-to-face clearances of wicket gates become even more crucial in units operating under high heads, especially Francis turbines and pump-turbines, which work with less water for the amount of power produced and therefore are more dependent on proper flow. In hydro plants without variable frequency converters, brakes must be applied to the generator to shut down a unit. Operators typically wait until the runner is at 60 percent of speed before applying brakes. If wicket gates are leaking water because they are not adjusted to the proper variances, it becomes difficult to bring the machine to a complete stop in a normal manner. Such a condition could be detrimental to the hydroelectric machine, which will continue to rotate after the brakes are applied but without proper lubrication to moving parts. At plants without spherical valves, proper adjustment of wicket gates is critical for shutting off flow during periods when units are shut down. It also benefits units designed to operate in a synchronous condensing mode (where the tailwater below the runner is depressed, the runner spins in air, and the generator is used as a motor). If the wicket gates leak badly as a result of poor adjustment, compressed air must be continually supplied to the unit to keep the tailwater depressed below the runner.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 72-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6848365","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6848365","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:2"

Biologists at the University of Toledo in Ohio report that compounds from the African soapberry plant called lemmatoxins are lethal to zebra mussels. In laboratory tests, researchers have determined 1 to 2 milligrams of purified lemmatoxins per liter will kill the mussels. In field tests, biologist Harold Lee flushed water through a mussel-infested pipe. He found that the berry extract killed mussels in four to eight hours, making continuous treatment of water intake pipes unnecessary, according to a report in New Scientists. The University of Toledo participated in another project, funded by the American Water Works Association Research Foundation. That project team included the cities of Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio, Finkbeiner, Pettis Strout, Ltd. consulting engineers, and researchers from Ohio's Case Western Reserve University.

There is a need for understanding how turbine designs could be altered to improve fish passage conditions, how to retrofit existing units, and how proposed hydro plant operational changes may affect fish survival. The US Army Corps of Engineers has developed a research program to define biologically based engineering criteria for improving fish passage conditions. Turbine designs incorporating these criteria can be evaluated for their effects on fish survival, engineering issues, costs, and power production. The research program has the following objectives: To gain a thorough knowledge of the mechanisms of fish mortality; To define the biological sensitivities of key fish species to these mechanisms of mortality; To develop new turbine design criteria to reduce fish mortality; To construct prototype turbine designs, and to test these designs for fish passage, hydro-mechanical operation, and power production; and To identify construction and power costs associated with new turbine designs.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 54-61","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8; TRN: 93-009684","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6640805","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6640805","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:2"

Current regulatory standards do not recognize these delays, known as time lag. One recent study concludes that the regulatory approach, indeed, is reasonable. In the complete study, Stone Webster researchers evaluated uplift pressures from 17 large concrete gravity dams. Data from eight of the dams were used to study time lag. Uplift was measured as frequently as every 15 minutes at one dam, two times per day at another dam during a flood, and three times per week at six other dams. The study showed that, although there is always a small time lag, the duration of the time lag is generally not sufficient to justify reducing the uplift pressures used in stability calculations.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 47-52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8; TRN: 93-009683","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6640807","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6640807","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:2"

As designed, float switches activate sump pumps that discharge liquids directly into the tailrace. Because the system cannot distinguish between types of liquids, in the event of an oil leak in the hydroelectric plant, oil in the sump could be released into the tailrace. This situation was not environmentally sound and needed to be corrected. The sump system was identified as a problem area in a December 1991 assessment of the plant by a district team that conducted record searches, interviews, and site surveys to determine any areas of environmental non-compliance. To eliminate the potential problem posed by the Truman Power Plant's sump system, the Corps took the initiative to make several improvements. For containment in the event of a spill, the distict installed an oil skimmer for the sump (see the photographs), similar to one used at the Corps Clarence Cannon Dam, also in Missouri. The district also plugged a number of floor drains, and installed speed bumps, similar to those used in parking lots to slow traffic, for spill containment. Additionally, a cartmounted skimmer is available to serve as a mobile spill control unit for spills elsewhere in the plant. Long-term plans call for oil detectors that will automatically turn off the sump's pumps and turn on the skimmer.","","","","","","United States","1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 70-71","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8; TRN: 93-009685","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6635862","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6635862","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:2"

A three-dimensional flow analysis has been made to predict the flow behavior inside the casing and distributor. The physical model employs a two-level approach, comprising of (1) a global model that adequately accounts for the geometry of the spiral casing but smears out the details of the distributor, and represents the multiple airfoils by a porous medium treatment, and (2) a local model that performs detailed analysis of flow in the distributor region. The global analysis supplies the inlet flow condition for the individual cascade of distributor airfoils, while the distributor analysis yields the information needed for modeling the characteristics of the porous medium. Comparisons of pressure and velocity profiles between measurement and prediction have been made to assess the validity of the present approach.

When piles are driven, there are deviations between the theoretical ground locations and the driven locations. Also, piles may not be driven perfectly vertical or exactly at the specified batter. When these deviations occur in adverse combinations, piles can intersect and structural damage can occur. A microcomputer program named CASE-Pile Group-Probabilistic (CPGP) has been developed to provide a probabilistic assessment of the potential for pile interference. The program uses Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of pile interference for an interior pile in a group as a function of pile diameter, length, spacing, camber, batter, and probable placement and alignment errors. Given this probability and layout of the group, another routine provides an estimate of the probability distribution on the number of intersections. Chart solutions are provided for the probability of intersection for uniformly spaced vertical piles.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 119:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 525-542","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1993)119:3(525)","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","6507064","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6507064","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","","119:3"

A single permeable bed is assumed to be bounded by two impermeable beds from above and below and the influence of a reduction in screen efficiency is evaluated. This work arose from design work associated with the Piedra del Aguila hydroelectric project in Argentina in which the left abutment of the dam consisted of an ancient buried river channel filled with a sequence of sand and gravel sediments of varying clay content mixed with layers of volcanic tuff. The outcome of the study is that a practical limit of intercepting 80% of the flow is feasible and that this limit depends strongly upon the efficiency of the drains. All suspected aquifer beds must be drained and drain efficiency should be monitored over time.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bulletin of the Association of Engineering Geologists; (United States); Journal Volume: 30:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 17-31","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0004-5691; CODEN: AEGBBU","10.2113/gseegeosci.xxx.1.17","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","6362571","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6362571","","Bulletin of the Association of Engineering Geologists; (United States)","","30:1"

Reaction to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is mixed among industry leaders. Some see sections of the act as a menace to the hydro industry. Others, however, see glimmers of hope in the passage of the act - not so much for what was included in the final bill, but for what was omitted from the legislation, and the industry's unified effort to eliminate those onerous provisions. Similarly, there are differing views on how this act will affect the industry, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the licensing of hydro projects. Major provisions of the act that will affect the hydro industry include: Amendment of the Federal Power Act (FPA), Section 18, vacating FERC's fishway definition. A reversal of a recent federal court ruling (the Henwood case) that exempted FERC-licensed projects from obtaining right-of-way permits for projects on federal lands. A broadening of the existing ban on development of hydro projects within national parks. Streamlining of the regulatory process to allow project applicants to contract with a third party to complete documents required under the National Environmental Policy Act.

The program, overseen by the Small Business Administration, is a competitive award system for businesses with 500 or fewer employees interested in proposing innovative ideas that meet the government's needs. Projects are funded through the SBIR Program, not agency budgets. The SBIR Program, created by the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982, is designed to assist participating federal agencies in meeting their respective research needs. While stimulating technological innovation, the program also provides qualified small businesses with opportunities to compete for a greater share of federal R D awards. Federal agencies have awarded more than $3.2 billion for more than 25,000 research projects since the program started. The Department of Energy (DOE), National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection Agency are among 11 agencies participating in the program. Agencies designate topics upon which SBIR proposals will be sought; release at least one SBIR solicitation annually; receive and evaluate SBIR proposals; and award SBIR funding agreements, based upon technical and scientific merit and how well the proposals meet the agencies needs. Before leaving office, President Bush signed legislation extending the program to the year 2000 and tripling the federal government's commitment to the program to $1.6 billion annually by 1997. The measure also requires federal agencies with external R D budgets greater than $100 million to allocate an amount - equal to 2.5 percent of the funds they award - to small businesses.

HYdro now provides more than two-thirds of total electric power generated in Latin America and the Caribbean. The only other predominant source used for electric generation is fossil fuels. In this region there are several trends developing. They include: developing more small hydro facilities, opportunities for sharing water resources, an interest in changing the approach to water use regulation, and possibilities for more participation by the private sector.

This amount includes funding for Association of State Dam Safety Officials programs. Bush signed the bill October 6, despite his administration's earlier attempt to terminate the program. Loss of funding for the 1993 fiscal year could have proven devastating to state dam safety programs, as states take their lead from the federal government. Ninety-five percent of the nation's dams are regulated by state dam safety programs, including 2,500 unsafe, high-hazard dams. Funding for the federal program was included in the Veterans Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill (HR 5679). The appropriation included approximately $250,000 to renew a research grant ASDSO will use to fund its popular public awareness workshop program, regional technical seminars, and annual research projects. In addition to urging Congress to fund FEMA's Dam Safety Program, ASDSO is pursuing a long-term plan to see that new federal dam safety legislation is authorized. The 102nd Congress chose not to revise existing dam safety legislation and instead passed a watered-down version of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, extending the Dam Safety Act of 1986 from 1992 to 1994.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 112","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6690718","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6690718","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

Selecting the amount of flow to release downstream of a hydro plant that will provide the maximum habitat protection at the minimum cost can indeed be a guessing game. At Niagara Mohawk, we've developed a computer program called FISHN that gives the user information and insight needed for making reasonable, logical minimum flow decisions. The program gives consideration to both hydrological and biological data when recommending a flow, and does not require the user to intuitively judge the value of habitat.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 66-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6697243","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6697243","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

The Wisconsin Valley Improvement Company (WVIC) used one such computer model to simulate its operation of the Wisconsin River. With the model and other computer spread-sheet programs, WVIC was able to estimate the economic value of hydro-power, recreation, and water quality benefits provided by particular river system operation strategies.

For such studies, engineers use numerical models to determine maximum water depths and discharges that sites downstream of the dam are likely to experience, and when the surge wave will reach those sites. Knowing the maximum water depths and discharges are useful when evaluating potential damage. Knowing when the surge wave will reach a site is useful for planning procedures for emergency evacuation. Researchers at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (the University of Montreal's Engineering School) have developed a numerical model that can be used to solve the spread of the surge wave for areas downstream of the dam that initially may be dry (not yet flooded). For computations involving an advancing or receding wave front on a dry bed, the model guards against values of water depth becoming physically unrealistic, such as a negative value. It also avoids difficulties in computing the flow field when zero water depths are involved, such as when the flood plain is dry. The research group first verified the model by comparing numerically computed results with analytical solutions that are available when certain restrictive assumptions are made. Additionally, satisfactory results were obtained when the model was tested against measurements from an experimental US Army Corps of Engineers' flume in Vicksburg, Miss., and data from the university's Hydrodynamics Laboratory. Even though the measurements were made in flat bed channels, the researchers emphasize that the scheme is not restricted to flat beds. The researchers subsequently tested the model on cases involving terrain with hills and valleys and reported satisfactory results.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 94-95","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6696678","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6696678","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

The magnitude of the surge and its effect on the electrical and hydraulic systems can be predicted by combining model investigations with a mathematical model that incorporates the system characteristics. Multiple vortices and multiple mode shapes complicate the prediction of the draft tube surge characteristics. The transition from one mode shape to another is a function of the swirl in the draft tube. The transition between mode shapes often produces large pressure pulses. Air injection and appurtenances in the draft tube throat can be effective in ameliorating the effects of the draft tube surge. However, these modifications frequently have adverse side effects, such as reduced efficiency of the turbine, and may not function properly at both part load and full load conditions.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 76-86","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6696713","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6696713","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

Hydro, the provincial electric utility of British Columbia, views environmental programs and research projects as an important part of its business. Many of these activities stem from some aspect of hydroelectric generation as the utility relies on 39 reservoirs and 30 hydro stations for the bulk of its electricity production. These programs and research projects are featured in B.C. Hydro's first annual Report on the Environment, which summarizes the utility's work to minimize the effects of operations on the natural and social environment. Some programs and research projects were initiated some years ago, while others are new. B.C.'s environmental programs include environmental audits and fish and wildlife compensation (mitigation) programs. In 1988, the utility and the province's Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks began developing compensation programs to address water license requirements for B.C. Hydro's hydroelectric developments. Today, compensation programs for the Peace and Columbia river area serve as models for future programs. The utility also reports it is reviewing all operating orders for its water system to identify opportunities to make operations more sensitive to environmental concerns. Additionally, work is under way on a preliminary strategy for addressing fish and water quality issues and setting minimum flow requirements. And in an effort to control dust storms, B.C.

The utility says the cancellation will enable it to save as much as $11 billion. Ontario Hydro canceled the contract in December after first seeking a five-year delay in implementing an agreement that called for Ontario Hydro to buy 1,000 MW of power for 20 years, beginning in the year 2000. The agreement had helped justify plans for construction of Manitoba Hydro's proposed 1,390-MW Conawapa generating station, once scheduled for operation in 2001. Ontario Hydro's decision to cancel the agreement, signed in 1989, puts Conawapa on the shelf for the time being, said Glenn Schneider, manager of public affairs for Manitoba Hydro. The project could proceed eventually if other export options emerge, or if domestic needs for additional energy develop within the province, he said. Schneider added it was not immediately known how the decision to shelve the Conawapa project would affect the review of the facility. An environmental review panel has already issued draft guidelines for how the utility should conduct an environmental impact assessment of the project. Ontario Hydro decided to cancel the contract after it learned it would be more costly to postpone the agreement than to terminate it. Ontario Hydro said Manitoba Hydro had sought concessions worth more than $300 million to defer the agreement by five years. In addition, Ontario Hydro has placed all non-utility generation contracts not yet approved on hold, pending the outcome of a review of short- and long-term supply needs and commitments. Ontario Hydro's Board of Directors earlier approved a plan proposed by the utility's senior management to reduce capital expenditures by more than $7 billion over the next ten years.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 102-104","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6696951","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6696951","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

Such was the case at the California Department of Water Resources 440-MW Gianelli Pumping-Generating Plant. The incident occurred July 5, 1991, when operators were bringing Unit 1 into service for generation. Tremendous forces on one of the unit's two rotors sheared ten 3 1/2-inch-diameter spider flange assembly bolts (ASTM A193-B16 steel) on the rotor, deforming bolt holes in both the spider flange and the shaft flange. The flanges, which allow the generator to transmit power through friction, rubbed and galled before the unit came to rest. The sudden shock load also slightly twisted the spider of the rotor, which during normal operation turns at 120 revolutions per minute at head of 190 to 245 feet. During normal operation, operators open a butterfly valve, allowing water to rush from a penstock to turn an impeller, which is connected to the generator rotor. Each of the plant's eight units is equipped with two rotors mounted on the same shaft. As the butterfly valve is gradually opened, speed of the unit increases. When the generator rotor is spinning at 90 percent of synchronous speed, the main unit breaker closes, energizing the stator windings with 13,800 volts. This rapidly accelerates the generator to approximately 98 percent of synchronous speed. The field breaker then closes, energizing the rotor poles with DC current. The rotor current reaches full strength in 2 to 5 seconds. During this time, the poles on the rotor are attempting to fall into step with the stator's rotating magnetic field.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 91-92","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6932981","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6932981","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

An experimental project during the summer of 1992, involving BC Hydro and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, succeeded in reducing the mortality rate of sockeye salmon on their migration up the Somass River from the Alberni Inlet to Great Central Lake on Vancouver Island. The bubbler system cooled the water to aid the migration of hundreds of thousands of fish who were reluctant to continue upstream due to exceptionally warm water temperatures. Participants in the project suspended a large lead-weighted plastic curtain (more than 12 meters tall and extending the length of three football fields) from a series of floats across the outlet of Grand Central Lake.

Hydropower producers are replacing or rehabilitating turbines, uprating old hydro generators, and installing advanced control systems. Estimates indicate that as much as 15,000 MW of new electricall generating capacity can be obtained by rehabilitating existing hydro facilities. The cost of developing this capacity is far less than for building new power projects. In most rehabilitation projects, the existing dam, powerhouse, and access roads are retained; only new mechanical and electrica equipment is required. As a result, these projects often can be accomplished for about half the cost of developing a new thermal plant to provide an equivalent amount of capacity. This new power does not contribute to atmospheric pollution, cause increases in operations and maintenance costs, or create uncertainties about fuel sources. The Bureau of Reclamation, the Salt River Project, the New York Power Authority, and the Tennessee Valley Authority all are either in the midst of major hydro rehabilitation projects or gearing up for future work. This activity indicates a healthy market of hydro products and services for years to come.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 10-14","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6933258","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6933258","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

By reducing the amount of water needed to make concrete, engineers can improve the properties of the hardened product. One group of admixtures known as plasticizers has been used since the 1950s. In the 1970s, a new group of plasticizers known as superplasticizers emerged in North America. Superplasticizers, also known as high-range, water-reducing admixtures (HRWRAs), tend to disperse cement particles in the concrete mix and, therefore, impart extreme flowability (fluidity) to the concrete. Typically, HRWRAs reduce the demand for water beyond that of standard water-reducing admixtures by up to 20 percent. Not only are the superplasticized admixtures used for structural concrete in conventional structures such as bridges and building foundations, increasingly engineers specify their use in concrete for hydroelectric projects, including dams, spillways, prefabricated powerhouses, and tunnels.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 12:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 110","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6933354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6933354","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","12:1"

Manual controls, some of which date back to 1916, have been replaced with what is believed to be the largest programmable logic controller (PLC)-based distributed control system ever assembled. The plant is the primary generating facility of Edison Sault Electric Company. Automation will ultimately cut labor costs by more than $400,000/year. The PLC-based control system uses Modicon 984-120 Compact PLCs at each turbine-generator unit linked together over a Modicon Modbus PLus high-speed local area network. All PLCs can be programmed from one location. The plant also uses a Most Economic Dispatch (MED) computer program as part of the automation package. The software is intended to maximize plant revenue per allotment of water and to minimize the need for operator input in assigning units. The program runs on a hierarchichal personal computer on the local area network.

In the analyses, an undrained elastoplastic model was used to simulate the collapse of liquefied materials. The model is developed based on the critical-state boundary-surface theory, the concept of steady-state strength, and the undrained behavior of liquefiable soils. A triggering condition in terms of a collapse surface was considered in this model. The hyperbolic strain-softening relationship has been introduced to simulate the postpeak behavior of liquefied materials. The analyses have shown that a progressive failure under undrained conditions may explain the observed response of the lower San Fernando dam following the 1971 earthquake. Stress redistribution initiated by the strain softening of liquefied materials is the main reason for undrained flow failures of dams, slopes, and foundations and can occur in a short period ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes. The liquefied zone after stress redistribution may be much larger than the initial liquefied zone caused directly by an earthquake. Therefore, a postearthquake deformation analysis may be essential in liquefaction stability evaluations.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 119:2; Journal Issue: 2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 333-349","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9410; CODEN: JGENDZ","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1993)119:2(333)","","2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","6362555","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6362555","","Journal of Geotechnical Engineering; (United States)","2","119:2"

Now, as described in this article independently developed pumped hydro and several advanced technologies are emerging to help respond to the long-term need for managing peak demand. Not long ago, large, utility-owned, pumped-storage hydroelectric plants were the only commercially viable means of storing electric energy during off-peak hours and boosting output during periods of high demand. Benefits of these facilities include: (1) They allow utilities to operate large base-load stations more economically: (2) they help regulate system-wide frequency and power factor; and (3) they can be activated immediately to supply backup power for short periods when unplanned shutdowns occur. Several factors have combined to drive up the cost and hamper the development of large, utility-owned, pumped-hydro plants, including: (1) lack of readily available sites, (2) more stringent siting and permitting requirements, (3) opposition from environmental groups, (4) scaling back of plans for large, base-load nuclear stations, and (5) the availability of relatively inexpensive gas-turbine-based peaking units. Despite these challenges, independent power developers are now leading a miniresurgence in pumped-hydro planning. The latest projects include several novel design concepts--such as modular and underground units--aimed at overcoming the drawbacks of more conventional facilities. A corresponding trend is the emergence of several other load-leveling options including: (1) compressed-air energy storage (CAES), (2) combustion-turbine inlet-air cooling, and (3) battery energy storage.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power; (United States); Journal Volume: 137:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 55-57","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5929; CODEN: POWEAD","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","5887544","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5887544","","Power; (United States)","","137:1"

These projects and others-completed and placed in service in 1992-can claim a special place in the history books. For each of the 31 hydro projects in North America that began operating in 1992, there's a unique story to tell. Each called upon the time, talent, commitment, ingenuity, and perseverance of those involved in their development. In aggregate, these projects contribute nearly 3,800 MW of clean, renewable electrical capacity that can be used efficiently and cost-effectively to help meet the power demands of customers in the US and Canada.

Since ECPA, the Commission has been very slow and tentative in its approach to licensing hydropower projects under Part I of the Federal Power Act. In that time, the hydropower industry has found itself in an almost impossible situation. It has been burdened with heavy regulatory requirements laden with a consulation process that frequently engenders adversarial conflicts with public interest groups and state and federal agencies. The process leads to a license with too much uncertainty to generally proceed with construction of the proposed project. This article assesses the current status of the hydropower industry so that the industry's future may be realistically assessed. The analysis begins in 1978 when Congress enacted landmark energy legislation that initiated, among other things, a [open quotes]hydro gold rush.[close quotes] What immediately follows is a historical review of this period, which includes a discussion of the response of the environmental community and the consequent legal battles fought in the 1980s.

The model accounts for flow splits at Grand and Navy islands and, more significantly, incorporates the operations of the New York Power Authority and Ontario Hydropower. These involve large-scale diversions and temporary storage of water for power production, resulting in a dispersion-like effect on the breakthrough curves for the tracer at Niagara-on-the-Lake. In comparison with straight through-flow calculations, the model results indicate an increase in mean residence times by up to 25% and decreases in peak concentrations by up to 50%, depending on the time of day the contaminant release occurs. In addition, the model shows the distribution of tracer mass remaining in the system after a typical sampling program, as currently followed in the Niagara River Toxics Management Plan. This allows a determination of optimal timing for sampling in order to maximize mass recovery. The model provides a tool to help understand transport in this complex hydraulic system. 10 refs., 13 refs.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Great Lakes Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 19:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 83-95","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0380-1330; CODEN: JGLRDE","10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71200-9","","2016-05-09T00:00:00Z","6224491","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6224491","","Journal of Great Lakes Research; (United States)","","19:1"
