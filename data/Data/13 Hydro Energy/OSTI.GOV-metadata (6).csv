"State certification of hydroelectric facilities under section 401 of the Clean Water Act","Bogardus, L M","13 HYDRO ENERGY; CLEAN WATER ACTS; EVALUATION; HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; CERTIFICATION; LICENSING; REGULATIONS; COMPLIANCE","The number of hydroelectric facilities in operation increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Congress established incentives to encourage hydropower development. Because hydroelectric projects can cause water quality problems within the impounded water and downstream of the dam, states have required hydroelectric applicants seeking a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to obtain certification, pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), that the project will not violate water quality standards. States have used the certification process as a device to extract improper concessions from license applicants. Some states have used section 401 to consider the impact of hydroelectric projects on factors unrelated to water quality, to condition section 401 certification upon satisfaction of requirements unrelated to water quality and to force FERC to incorporate these conditions into operating licenses. License applicants have challenged these attempts as unlawful expansions of state authority to review federal projects. This dispute between existing and potential hydroelectric plant operators and states may become a critical one in the near future. Licenses for 167 hydroelectric projects expire in 1993. License holders for 158 of these 167 projects filed applications for new licenses with FERC before the statutory deadline expired on December 31, 1991. If there is to be any consistency in these licensing and relicensing proceedings, the courts must reach a consensus on the proper role of the states in hydroelectric project licensing and the applicability of section 401.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Virginia Environmental Law Journal; Journal Volume: 12; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Fal 1992","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 43-101","","","","Journal ID: XZ490W; TRN: 96:002222-0002","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","241220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/241220","","Virginia Environmental Law Journal","1","12"

Environmentalists say that in most cases hydro has left fish high and dry, transformed once-mighty rivers into pathetic streams and destroyed fragile ecosystems. Suddenly hydro is being mentioned in the same breath with coal, oil and nuclear - precisely the fuels hydro, touted early on as an environmentally benign energy source, was to replace. Today environmentalists talk of [open quotes]non-hydro renewables[close quotes] like wind, solar and biomass. Nowhere is this new-found antipathy more apparent than in the recently passed national energy bill. In amendments to the landmark legislation, environmental groups united to overturn Federal Energy Regulatory Committee regulations that had relaxed federal oversight of hydro projects. Also, the groups insured that hydro projects would be prohibited from national recreational and historic areas. And in an energy blueprint sent to President-elect Clinton last month, 40 organizations urged the Arkansas governor to greatly reduce funding of mature energy technologies, one of which was hydropower.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-07T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Daily; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:233","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-2","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0364-5274; CODEN: ENDADJ","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6994853","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6994853","","Energy Daily; (United States)","","20:233"

Hope pumped-storage project in New Jersey has been licensed by FERC. That license will allow a former iron ore mine site to be used in producing a new resource-hydroelectricity. In early August 1992, after more than seven years of effort, the 2,000-MW Mt. Hope Waterpower Project was licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Getting the $1.8 billion pumped-storage project licensed was not an easy task. It involved 54 submittals to FERC, six public meetings, and costs of more than $12 million. Along the way, the project has withstood competing applications, community opposition, and legal battles. Getting a project of this magnitude off the ground is a challenge for even the most experienced developer. The effort was especially challenging for the Halecrest Company, a local family-owned and operated firm with no previous experience in hydroelectric development. When financing became tight, creative ways were found to raise seed capital for the project. When hydroelectric experience was needed, the company developed a world-class corporate team that carried Mt. Hope through the complexities of the licensing process and beyond. With license now in hand, the project developers are ready to move forward with negotiating power sales contracts and securing construction financing. The resulting project will be the second largest pumped-storage facility in the country-second only to the 2,100-MW Bath County project in Virginia. Mt. Hope will take six years to construct and is scheduled to be phased into operation beginning in 1999.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 28-34","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6263841","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6263841","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:7"

Wanapum Dam is part of the Grant County Public Utility District's 1,878-MW Priest Rapids Hydroelectric Project on the Columbia River. The development's ten Kaplan turbines operate under an average 80 feet of head at 85.7 revolutions per minute. In the mid-1980s, Grant County PUD elected to map out the profile irregularities. In the new method applied to units at Wanapum Dam and Priest Rapids developments, eight linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) were mounted on a unistrut bracket. LVDTs, which develop a linear relationship between position and output voltage, consist of two sets of coils wound around a movable core. When one coil is excited with AC voltage, the output of the second coil is proportional to the position of the movable core. Grant County PUD used a DC power supply with LVDTs that contain microelectronics to convert the DC supply voltage to AC, and to convert the output coils' AC signal to DC. The DC output signal is fed to a brush chart, an instrument that records the data. The bracket holding the LVDTs is mounted to the leading edge of one blade and the trailing edge of the adjacent blade. A wheel mounted on the end of each LVDT rolls over any rough areas of the liner. As the turbine is slowly rotated by hand, the LVDT core moves in and out in proportion to the change in the blade-to-liner gap. Mechanics check the gap with feeler gages at a point on the liner that each LVDT will pass over. This makes data directly readable, and equal to the actual gap. This information is used to evaluate grinding requirements for proper running clearances.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 92-93","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6234263","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6234263","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:7"

Engineers and project owners are finding new ways to keep these crucial plant components working into the next century. The issues and methods for rehabilitating existing penstocks differ from the challenges of ddesigning new water conduits. To rehabilitate an existing penstock, one must understand the original design. The original layout and esign of an existing penstock reflects the construction materials, methods, and economics of the time it was built. To efficiently and successfully rehabilitate an existing penstock, planners must understand the limitations of the original design, construction, and material. Hydroelectric project owners can take one of two approaches to penstock rehabilitation: repair or replacement. The repair option includes weld repair and patching of the existing shell or relining the inside of the pipe. Frequently, both repair and replacement are combined to form the optimal solution for a particular penstock. Kleinschmidt Associates, Inc. of Pittsfield, Maine, recently used both the repair and replacement approaches on three penstock rehabilitation projects. These examples demonstrate how different site conditions, design parameters, and owner interests led to various rehabilitation strategies. This article focuses on small (less than 10 MW), low- or medium-head plants with steel penstocks.","","","","","","United States","1992-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6234270","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6234270","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:7"

Water not used for irrigation was spilled over the dam-essentially wasted. Beginning this fall, that wasted water will be used to generate inexpensive, renewable, clean hydropower, thanks to a cooperative agreement between two irrigation canal companies and an investor-owned utility. The Twin Falls Land and Water Co. built Milner Dam at the turn of the century as part of an irrigation development along the Snake River. The structure comprised three earth and rockfill embankments that spanned the river, north to south, connecting two islands with the shores. The original spillway-consisting of 99 wooden slide gates-was built on the southern island. Over decades of use, the island's rock cliff-on which the spillway discharged-had eroded back toward the spillway. In the mid-1980s, leaks along the dam raised concerns about the dam's stability and, consequently, its ability to withstand an earthquake. To ensure safety, the dam had to be rehabilitated. Milner dam, Inc. (a wholly owned company of the Twin Falls Canal and the North Side Canal companies), in partnership with Idaho Power Co., decided to rehabilitate the dam and, at the same time, to add hydroelectric facilities. Under the partnership agreement, Idaho Power will own and operate the new power facilities, and Milner Dam Inc. will own and operate the rebuilt dam and related structures. The developers received a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 1988 to build the hydro project. Four years later, the dam has been rehabilitated and the 58.3-MW power facilities constructed. Turbine-generator testing is under way, and the project's three units should all be on line by the end of October 1992.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498912","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498912","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:6"

Automation at Hungry Horse will eliminate the need for four full-time power plant operators. Between now and then, a transition plan that offers employees choices for retraining, transferring, or taking early retirement will smooth the transition in reducing from five operators to one. The transition plan also includes the use of temporary employees to offset risks of reducing staff too soon. When completed in 1953, the Hungry Horse structure was the world's fourth largest and fourth highest concrete dam. The arch-gravity structure has a crest length of 2,115 feet; it is 3,565 feet above sea level. The four turbine-generator units in the powerhouse total 284 MW, and supply approximately 1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually to the federal power grid managed by the Bonneville Power Administration. In 1988, Reclamation began to automate operations at many of its hydro plants, and to establish centralized control points. The control center concept will increase efficiency. It also will coordinate water movements and power supply throughout the West. In the Pacific Northwest, the Grand Coulee and Black Canyon plants are automated control centers. Several Reclamation-owned facilities in the Columbia River Basin, including Hungry Horse, will be connected to these centers via microwave and telephone lines. When automation is complete, constant monitoring by computer will replace hourly manual readings and equipment checks. Computers also are expected to increase water use efficiency by 1 to 2 percent by ensuring operation for maximum turbine efficiency. Unit efficiency curves for various heads will be programmed into the system.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 30-35","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5570614","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5570614","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:6"

Spare parts and system enhancements are available for as long as the vendor chooses to support the particular version of the hardware. It is possible, however, to build a computer-based control system that is not constrained by any particular hardware, that operates using commercially available software, and that can be upgraded consistent with the state of the art of the computer industry. The system components are drawn from widely available hardware and software products that anyone can buy, use, maintain, and extend.

The plan: Construct a 330-mile-long system of concrete-lined canals, inverted siphons, tunnels, pumping plants, and pipelines to convey water from the Colorado River on Arizona's western border across the state. People scoffed. They said it could never be done. During the fall of 1992, Reclamation will prove those doubters wrong as it completes the New Waddell dam and Waddell Pump-Generating Plant on the Agua Fria River northwest of Phoenix. The Waddell complex will substantially complete the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which will deliver an average of 1.5 million acre-feet of water each year to cities and industries, Indian communities, and farmers. The water will largely replace existing ground water uses and supplement surface water supplies. The CAP also will provide hydroelectric generation, flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. The New Waddell Dam is at the site of the existing Lake Pleasant and Waddell Dam 30 miles northwest of Phoenix. Reclamation built a 5-mile canal, leading from the CAP aqueduct north, to deliver water to the Waddell complex. At the Waddell Pump/Generating Plant, water from the canal will be pumped with four reversible pump/generator units and four pumping-only units into Lake Pleasant during the winter, when energy costs for pumping are low. Water then will be released from the lake into the aqueduct for irrigation and electrical generation during the summer months. Thus, the plant will operate as a [open quotes]seasonal[close quotes] pumped-storage facility. New Waddell Dam will help ensure the CAP's reliability by providing a water supply (the stored water in Lake Pleasant) even if diversions from the Colorado river into the aqueduct have to be temporarily halted. It will also reduce summer pumping requirements from the Colorado River.","","","","","","United States","1992-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 26-28","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5631438","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5631438","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:6"

PHABSIM is used to calculate the physical habitat for aquatic organisms in a stream. The assumption behind the development of this technique is that if the effects of a proposed project on physical habitat are known, one can better understand the effects on aquatic organisms. Thus, a defensible selection of an instream flow requirement can be made.

The idea is being tested in a demonstration project in the northeastern U.S. The hydroelectric industry could experience substantial growth in low-head hydro facilities if a concept now being developed proves successful. This concept aims to enable power developers to generate electricity economically at sites currently not feasible for hydropower because water heads are too low. Many areas of North America are studded with low-head dams that could provide considerable hydro capacity if low-head generation were economically feasible. The six New England states in the US, for example, contain approximately 15,000 dams that have never been used to generate electric power because they impound water with heads ranging from 3 to 13 feet. Conventional facilities are not economically practical for generating electricity at these low heads. However, a promising alternative approach is to use water at these low-head dams to compress air, and then to use the air to power an air turbine-generator that produces electricity. The concept, called hydropneumatic generation, can be visualized by imagining a container, such as a large teacup, inverted and submerged in tidal waters. As the tide rises, the water compresses the air trapped inside the container. When the tide ebbs, the pressure decreases, putting the air into a partial vacuum. If a vent pipe were installed from the container to the atmosphere, air would flow out of the container as the water depth increased, and flow back in as the water depth decreased. Hydropneumatic energy is generated by installing an air-powered turbine to harness the energy of this airflow through the vent pipe. The turbine can be installed to rotate in the same direction at all times, even though the airflow reverses direction.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 76-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498502","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498502","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:5"

One U.S. dam owner used a novel methodology to determine inflow design floods in a multi-dam, multi-river system. Using the methodology for a system of dams, Wisconsin Electric Power Company was able to document the need for dam safety improvements in the basin and to prioritize spillway capacity improvements. Using this methodology, the utility documented that the spillway at Brule Dam could be rehabilitated to pass one-half the probable maximum flood (PMF) and still ensure safety, rather than expanding it to pass the full PMF. Consequently, Wisconsin Electric saved $2.8 million in spillway expansion costs. This methodology can be used for determining spillway capacity requirements for dams in series or systems of dams in branched networks similar to the Upper Menominee system.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 60-66","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498713","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498713","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:5"

Analysis of the results will help determine if drawdowns are a viable long-term alternative in salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. To test the effects of such a process, the Corps of Engineers Walla Walla, Washington, District completed a test drawdown of Little Goose and Lower Granite reservoirs. The Lower Granite Dam, completed in 1975, is about 30 miles downstream from Clarkston, Washington. Little Goose, which began operating in 1970, is another 30 miles downstream from Lower Granite. The Corps constructed both dams for navigation and hydroelectric generation. Each has a generating capacity of 930 MW. While the dams themselves exhibited no damage from the drawdowns, other structures in the area, including roadway and railroad embankments, piers, and boat docks, were damaged. Resident fish and bottom-dwelling organisms died as water levels dropped. The Corps announced it will not conduct another test draw-down in 1993. From this test, the Corps will prepare a supplemental EIS, complete with public comment opportunities, to establish its water management actions for 1993. The final decision on whether drawdowns are a viable long-term alternative to help the salmon is still many months away.

Montana Power's attempt to get all the players in the game led the utility to add an extra step to FERC's three-step consultation process for relicensing a hydro project. The additional step gave the utility an opportunity to learn more about the needs and concerns of the public and resource agencies. Simultaneously, it allowed the public an opportunity to gain a better understanding of Montana Power, the project, relicensing, and hydroelectricity in general. The three steps of FERC's consultation process require the applicant to meet with agencies and the public; to perform studies and write a draft application; and to file a final application with FERC and the consulting agencies. The public is given a chance to make comments about the project at each stage of the process. Montana Power started the relicensing process for its Missouri-Madison Project (FERC No. 2188) in the summer of 1989. The license for the project will expire in November 1994. After completing the meetings with the agencies and the public in the first step, Montana Power decided to add an extra stage of consultation with the agencies and public before writing the draft application.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 35-41","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5631311","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5631311","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:5"

It's important to assess damage to identify all possible problems, and then select the most effective repair solution. The runners on hydroturbines or the impellers on pumps are major components of hydro plants. If these parts of the hydro unit are experiencing problems, the efficient operation of the entire plant can be affected. Runners and impellers degrade, suffer local damage, and may be forced into less than full-range operation. Consequently, operations and maintenance staff at hydro plants should continually monitor runner or impeller performance, analyze how damage is occurring, and assess what can be done to relieve future similar (or worse) problems. When damage to a runner or impeller becomes evident, the most effective maintenance plan is a simple two-step approach: (1) complete a careful assessment of the damage; and (2) choose the most effective method of repair or modification, and proceed. The ultimate goal of this two-step assessment and repair process is to reduce maintenance to a minimum routine, acceptable level.","","","","","","United States","1992-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:5","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 68-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698658","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698658","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:5"

High predation rates occur just below dams. If northern squawfish selectively consume salmonids killed or injured during dam passage, previous estimates of predation mortality may be too high. We conducted laboratory experiments that indicate northern squawfish prefer dead juvenile chinook salmon O. tshawytscha over live individuals. When equal numbers of dead and live chinook salmon were offered to northern squawfish maintained on a natural photoperiod (15 h light: 9 h darkness), significantly more (P < 0.05) dead than live fish were consumed, both in 1,400-L circular tanks and in an 11,300-L raceway (62% and 79% of prey consumed were dead, respectively). When dead and live juvenile chinook salmon were provided in proportions more similar to those below dams (20% dead, 80% live), northern squawfish still selected for dead prey (36% of fish consumed were dead). In additional experiments, northern squawfish were offered a proportion of 20% dead juvenile chinook salmon during 4-h periods of either light or darkness.

These components, including baffle plates and cover plates, sometimes break up or fail due to centrifugal forces, vibration, and/or bending associated with operation, all of which contribute to metal fatigue. Design errors and damage from high velocity water flow can also lead to failure. If components positioned beneath the headcover fail to perform properly, they can cause changes at the top of the runner. This, in turn, can lead to elevated thrust bearing temperatures and, ultimately, bearing damage. The durability of these machine components is an important issue because if a component fails while in service, damage may occur to the headcover and runner. In addition, removing the headcover to repair or replace components in this area of the machine can be a major expense. Operators and maintenance staffs should watch for indications that the cover plate or headcover baffle plate is breaking up. Changes in headcover pressure and in thrust bearing temperatures that cannot be explained otherwise are likely to be the first indication of this kind of trouble.

In the early 1950s, the interconnection of two power companies in Manitoba was accomplished, followed with a very low capacity interconnection with the Ontario Hydro Northwest region. The capacity of interconnections from Manitoba are in excess of 60 percent of the peak load of the Manitoba system and are expected to increase in the future. The authors want to generalize here by saying that the reliability of any system would be improved if it has interconnections of capacity equal to the connected load of the system as each new interconnection was added, the security of the system was improved.

Consequently, a hydroelectric generation must be able to provide fast transient performance regardless of load under any situation. To ensure this type of performance, it is important to understand the mechanics of the generator's voltage regulator so that stability adjustments can be properly attained. Various factors can cause generator instability. These include the characteristics of the voltage regulator, and the generator's field time constants as related to machine speed and size. For optimum performance, the generator's stability network needs to be tuned to match the field time constants of the machine. There are some basic steps in tuning the voltage regulator that should be followed during generator start up. In addition, computer modeling can be used to demonstrate the effect of more or less stability on generator performance.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 66-76","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5462828","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5462828","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:3"

Their findings suggested that turbine bypass systems would provide improved passage conditions for juvenile salmon. In response to these findings, the Corps installed bypass systems at many of its facilities. However, evaluations of salmon after the bypasses were installed indicated that these systems are not completely benign. The bypass system, guidance devices, and tailrace predation can cause variable levels of stress, injury, and mortality. When compared to a favorable turbine environment of deeply submerged runners and low head, certain bypass systems may even reduce survival in some cases. For example, preliminary results of a survival study conducted by biologists at the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) from 1987 through 1990 at Bonneville Dam indicate bypassed juvenile chinook salmon have significantly lower survival rates than those passing through turbines. Consequently, comprehensive analyses of bypass components are necessary to ensure bypass passage improves survival, relative to turbine passage.","","","","","","United States","1992-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 46-56","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5462885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5462885","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:3"

According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in Palo Alto, Calif., 36 of these plants provide approximately 20 gigawatts, or about 3 percent of U.S. generating capacity. During peak-demand periods, utilities are often stretched beyond their capacity to provide power and must therefore purchase it from neighboring utilities. Building new baseload power plants, typically nuclear or coal-fired facilities that run 24 hours per day seven days a week, is expensive, about $1500 per kilowatt, according to Robert Schainker, program manager for energy storage at the EPRI. Schainker the that building peaking plants at $400 per kilowatt, which run a few hours a day on gas or oil fuel, is less costly than building baseload plants.

With extra water comes an opportunity for increasing hydro - one project is underway to add 160 MW of power to an existing 120-MW plant. The California State Department of Water Resources (DWR) completed the initial phase of its State Water Project 20 years ago. However, the state designed into the system provisions for future enlargement to meet anticipated increased water demands. Growth in southern California during the last ten years has been unprecedented. To meet demands for additional water supplies, in 1986 DWR and several of its water contractors signed water contract agreements to enlarge part of the California Aqueduct. This enlargement meant that increased flows would be available to the 120-MW Devil Canyon hydroelectric facility, the southernmost plant along the aqueduct. As a result, DWR is expanding Devil Canyon. The project expansion includes: enlargement of the powerhouse to allow room for two new units of 80 MW each; addition of a second penstock; and the addition of a second, larger afterbay. More than 15 primary contractors have worked on or are working on project contracts totaling more than $82.5 million. When water begins passing through the completed power plant in April 1992, Devil Canyon will be capable of producing an additional 160 MW of electricity.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5570495","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5570495","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:2"

Examples of several such projects illustrate a practical, cost-effective way to meet growing electricity demands. A typical water supply system for a municipality consists of one or more reservoirs of water, a pipeline, and a water treatment plant. As the water flows from the reservoir down to the treatment plant, excess pressure develops. This pressure must be relieved before the water enters the water treatment station and water distribution mains along the city streets. Cities typically use pressure reducing valves to relieve this pressure. An alternative, though, is to convert the pressure to electricity by using small hydroturbines. The power generated by these small hydro units (typically ranging in size from 50 kW to 5 MW) can be used to meet a city's electricity load and/or supply power for water treatment operations. The idea of generating electricity from excess head along the water supply main is not new. However, the concept is viable only if it is cost-effective. Recent advances in the development and installation of mini and micro hydro units, as well as the availability of a wide range of turbines, have made the exploitation of this source of energy possible. The cities of Boulder, Colorado, and Wichita, Kansas, are operating small hydro plants as part of their water distribution system. And, the city of Sitka, Alaska, is building two hydro units along water supply lines that should begin operating in early 1993. These plants are a representative sampling from many municipalities throughout North America that are delivering water and generating electricity at the same time.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 11:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 28-38","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698976","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698976","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","11:2"

As we approach the 21st century, electric energy captured from falling water provides 2.0 trillion kilowatt-hours (21.23 quadrillion Btu), roughly 20% of the world's electric energy. Of the 2.56 billion kilowatts of the world's installed electric generating capacity, hydropower accounts for 24%. Between 1980 and 1989, world generation of hydroelectric power rose from 1.7 trillion kWh to 2.0 trillion kWh. As of January 1, 1988, the US has 90.5 million kW of installed hydro capacity - 70.8 million kW of it under license by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - with annual generation estimated at just under 300 billion kWh. Hydro's share, which not long ago comprised 13% of the nation's total capacity, now is just a 9% share. The US has the option to choose one or another path for hydro. If policy makers are willing to coast on a cushion of cheap natural gas, they will continue to shun hydro and put obstacles in its path. But if they come to regard hydro as an attractive resource - as they did only recently - economically and environmentally, they will encourage more balance in resource policies. Believing that interest in a balanced national resource portfolio will grow, the author reviews the past and suggests a possible future course of reasonable development for hydro. The article concludes with some suggested principles that will be needed if the appropriate balance is to be found.","","","","","","United States","1992-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electricity Journal; (United States); Journal Volume: 5:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12-21","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1040-6190; CODEN: ELEJE","10.1016/1040-6190(92)90007-T","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","7246980","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7246980","","Electricity Journal; (United States)","","5:3"

The basic idea is to use a simpler analytical model as an approximation to a more detailed model in a Monte Carlo simulation scheme. The simulation then deals with the residual, i.e. the difference between the result of the detailed model and of the approximation. In other words, the component of probabilistic indices which can be explained by the analytical model in factored out of the Monte Carlo sampling scheme, which then handles only the unexplained residuals. The proposed scheme is flexible and easy to implement, as no modification of existing analytical models is required. The approach is illustrated in case studies with utility-derived systems in several application areas: composite reliability evaluation, multi-area production costing, chronological production costing with ramping constraints, and operation of a multireservoir hydroelectric system.","","","","","","United States","1992-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 7:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 265-272","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; CODEN: ITPSE","10.1109/59.141713","","2016-04-19T00:00:00Z","5581567","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5581567","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","7:1"

In the US, 22 new plants came on line in 14 states, contributing about 1,200 MW of capacity to the US electrical supply. In Canada, the presence of private power producers was more noticeable than ever before. Eight independent developers in three provinces brought plants on line, contributing nearly 35 MW of capacity. In addition, units at two large, utility-owned projects began generating power, a total of 1,532 MW. The development activity in 1991 indicates positive movement in all segments of the North American hydro industry.

Even though this is a well-known and accepted fact, very little has been done in the direction of quantification of these trade-offs in practical terms mainly considering multireservoir systems and different hydrologic scenarios. This article applies the Constraint Method to evaluate those trade-offs, taking as a case study the CESP (Sao Paulo Power Utility) multireservoir system of the Paranapanema Rive basin, located in southeast Brazil. This paper reveals what and how intense the trade-offs are between the conflicting objectives and serves as a guideline for CESP operational policy.","","","","","","United States","1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Sources; (United States); Journal Volume: 14:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 43-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8312; CODEN: EGYSA","10.1080/00908319208908708","","2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","5647986","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5647986","","Energy Sources; (United States)","","14:1"

The solution of this problem requires a large volume of long-term experimental studies and calculation of the stress-strain state (SSS) of the bed. Successful solution of this problem is governed by both the correct selection of the geochemical model of the bed, and the accuracy with which the rheologic properties of the bed soils and the effectiveness of the adopted computational method are described. Studies conducted in recent years have shown that a rheologic model of the bed in the form of a layer of limited thickness is most optimal. Investigation of clayey soils suggests that a rheologic model where the deformations are logarithmically proportional with time is effective for predicting long-term deformations. A theoretical solution of the problem of predicting the SSS of a soil layer, which is inhomogeneous with respect to depth, under a local load with allowance for the rheologic properties of the soils is proposed below on the basis of these two premises, using Vlasov`s variational method, which ensures sufficient accuracy and practicality. 11 refs., 4 figs.","","","","","","United States","1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering; Journal Volume: 28; Journal Issue: 4; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1992; TN: Translated from Osnovaniya, Fundamenty i Mekhanika Gruntov; No. 4, 21-24(Jul-Aug 1991)","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 184-189","","","","Journal ID: SMFEAF; ISSN 0038-0741; TRN: 95:007425-0003","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","146878","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/146878","","Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering","4","28"

At the Ulla-Forre project, the Norwegian Research Institute of Energy Supply (EFI) and the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) developed an on-line controller to provide real-time control of river flow. By using the controller, the Norwegian State Power Board saved enough water to produce an extra $50,000 (US) worth of electricity a year at the Hylen power station. In 1989, the Ministry of Oil and Energy decided that the strict flow constraints, compared to relaxed constraints, were not contributing to improved environmental conditions, and thus dropped the minimum flow requirements. As a result, the power board discontinued use of the controller. The on-line controller designed for Ulla-Forre was a prototype. Using this version as a model, though, an on-line controller could be developed for any location to aid in meeting streamflow requirements and, at the same time, maximizing revenues. Depending on the complexity, the cost of developing an on-line controller begins at approximately $10,000.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 82-89","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498726","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498726","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

Mitigative measures can be incorporated in dam design and reservoir operation to substantially reduce sediment entrapment, and to improve dissolved oxygen levels by releasing hypolimnetic waters (cold bottom waters) from the reservoir. These measures may also greatly reduce stream bed degradation downstream of the dam and consequent initiation of a new erosion cycle in the tributaries. The Illinois State Water Survey (a division of the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources) investigated the advantages and disadvantages of various storage maintenance measures. In an economic analyses of the methods, the State Water Survey considered and compared the reduction in initial reservoir design storage capacity, cost of installation of sediment entrapment reduction measures, and cost of any dredging operations. The analysis indicates that the cost of incorporating sediment entrapment reduction measures in the design of a dam and reservoir can be justified by a decrease in capital and present worth costs due to the need for smaller initial storage capacity and an absence of dredging costs.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 90-97","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498821","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498821","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

It encouraged Alcan Aluminium Limited to survey the vast water resources in the Pacific Northwest-including the Nechako River and Lake system-that could be harnessed to power aluminum smelters. Through its studies, Alcan determined that, indeed, the area had great hydroelectric potential. The company consequently decided to build an 816-MW hydro station at Kemano in the Kemano Valley and an aluminum smelter at Kitimat, 82 kilometers northwest of the valley. The hydro plant was one of the most advanced and difficult civil engineering projects of its time. To build the project, Alcan constructed a 97-meter-high dam that reversed the flow of the Nechako River and created the Nechako Reservoir, and then drilled and blasted a water tunnel and excavated a powerhouse deep inside Mount DuBose in the Coast Mountains. In 1989, Alcan launched an expansion of the underground hydro project. Although completion of the half-finished project has been delayed temporarily due to controversies over whether a federal environmental review is needed, the work represents a major engineering challenge and illustrates how man successfully conquered the handicaps of a remote location, harsh climate, and rugged terrain to build a massive hydro project.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 24-32","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498870","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498870","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

Monenco Consultants Limited, an engineering firm with its head office in Calgary, Alberta, has evaluated the safety of existing dams at more than 40 water resource developments in the last 20 years. Realizing the complexity of these evaluations, Monenco engineers were interested in developing techniques that would reduce the hours of professional time required for stability calculations, and therefore the cost to the dams owners. The firm eventually developed a microcomputer program for its engineers to use in the stability analysis of concrete gravity dams and two spread-sheets to use with the program for analyzing uplift and internal stresses. Using the computer programs cuts man-hours spent in analysis by about 75 percent and reduces the possibility of error in multiple calculations. Ultimately, the programs allow the engineer to spend more time in detailed analysis of a structure during a safety evaluation and less time performing tedious calculations.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 75-81","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698525","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698525","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

A plumb line (or its optical equivalent) is a practical starting point for aligning the stationary parts of the machine - the generator stator, turbine case, and bearings. This does not mean, though, that the machine parts must be in near-perfect vertical orientation for the machine to perform well. Verticality is sometimes over-emphasized when procedures are undertaken to achieve good machine alignment. If the generator rotor, the connecting shaft, and the turbine runner are centered in stationary parts that are well-aligned along the same axis angle, this angle can depart from true vertical by a significant amount without ill effect. Mechanical balance does not often play a large part in determining how well a generator rotor is centered in the air gap. Magnetic forces are much more important. This is why it is desirable to maintain air gap variations around the machine to less than 5 percent from the average. However, this is sometimes difficult, especially if bearing clearances are large.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 102","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698570","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698570","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

Thus far in the licensing process, both projects have passed environmental scrutiny. Formulating an environmentally acceptable pumped-storage project is a complex process that requires the developer to: identify and document all possible environmental effects; communicate with and respond to resource agencies and the public; and propose measures to mitigate effects and to enhance existing resources. CPS's experience has been that money spent up front in carefully addressing environmental and community issues is a small price to pay for avoiding serious public opposition later on in the licensing process.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42-50","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698803","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698803","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:7"

However, in cases where seals are placed or move too close to the shaft, they may be responsible for unacceptable shaft runout. During runout, the shaft connecting the turbine to the generator moves laterally, subjecting bearings and structural supports to large pulsating forces. This can lead to a breakdown of lubricating oil film, which, in turn, can damage the shaft. No shaft rotates in a perfectly concentric manner. For that reason, all hydroelectric machines exhibit some degree of shaft runout. In cases where unacceptable levels of vibration occur, station and maintenance staff may consider such possible causes as mechanical unbalance, excessive bearing clearances, hydraulic effects, and electrical unbalance. Seals rubbing against the shaft, are also a cause of runout. Maintenance staff often can determine whether seal rub is the cause of shaft runout by observing machine performance. Such machines will make smooth cold starts but as the machine continues to operate, runout becomes more and more pronounced. This characteristic points to a seal rub as a likely cause of the vibration. When localized heat is generated by seals rubbing against a rotating shaft, the heat bends the shaft in the direction of the original runout. The seal rub that produced the temperature rise then worsens, producing additional heat and more deflection. This snowballing effect can continue until the seal rub becomes destructive.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 86","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498478","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498478","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

They all have one common goal, though: to maximize revenue by running the plants as efficiently as possible with minimal operation personnel. The way to reach this goal for many developers has been through automating plant controls. the need to minimize installation and operating costs at these plants initiated an acceptance of automated control in the early 1970s - and computerized control about a decade later - of portions of the power plant that previously required constant human attention or costly mechanical action. However, for plants not operated continuously or with unique requirements, such as prescribed flow rates for fish bypass, complete automation was virtually impossible - appropriate software packages did not exist and the cost of the components was unreasonable. In the last few years, though, advances in microprocessor design and application allowed diverse and previously separate plant functions to be integrated into one overall control system. Integrated computerized controls reduce initial installation costs and allow operators to maximize their effectiveness by operating and monitoring several plants concurrently via remote control. Specifically, using computerized controls can reduce plant engineering and custom software programming expenses - engineering and programming are already incorporated in the control package. The integration of sensing, control, protection, and display functions removes the need and expense of interfacing and installing individual components. Optimizing management of the available water and elmininating on-site operating personnel often results in increased plant revenue. Actual savings vary from plant to plant, depending on labor rates, generation capacity, and other requirements that might prevent elimination of on-site operators.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 62-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5498889","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5498889","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

A new technique using acoustic emissions can detect and monitor cavitation in its early stages, and thus serve as a guide for maintenance scheduling and operational changes. In the mid-1980s, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) sponsored a feasibility study in which full-wave rectification spectral analysis was applied to two Kaplan turbines to process the sound emanating from cavitating blades. (In full-wave rectification spectral analysis, the system electronically manipulates the sound signal in order to bring out certain frequencies - in this case, those associated with cavitation. It is based on a phenomenon similar to the amplitude modulation in an AM radio signal, where a high frequency carrier wave is modulated by the lower frequencies of the sounds being broadcast). The study showed the approach to be a viable means of detecting the onset and severity of cavitation. The Institut de Recherche d'Hydro-Quebec (IREQ) also explored the potential of full-wave rectification spectral analysis in monitoring cavitation in hydroturbines in the mid-1980s. Its study, sponsored by the Canadian Electrical Association, focused on model and full-scale Francis turbines. The IREQ researchers confirmed the applicability of the method used in the EPRI study to large-scale Francis turbines.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 52-60","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5570238","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5570238","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

That act was designed to increase the overall net public benefit from water resources. EPRI sponsored and recently completed an analysis of new licenses for the 39 hydro projects relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from 1984 through 1989. EPRI's objective for the analysis: provide utilities just beginning the relicensing process with insights and lessons learned from recent relicensing decisions. During a four-year period that runs through 1993, almost 200 relicense applications representing over 2,200 MW of capacity have been, or will be, filed with FERC. Utilities own and operate 70 percent of these projects. Richard Hunt Associates of Annapolis, Md., performed the review and analysis for EPRI and prepared an interim report, Lessons Learned in Hydro Relicensing (1984-1989) Trends, Costs, and Recommendations. EPRI plans for the 72-page report, released during the summer, to be updated periodically. Hunt Associates analysis of relicenses issued by FERC from 1984 through 1989 included 27 post-ECPA relicenses for 1987 through 1989. The relicenses were studied to document major issues of concern expressed by resource agencies and FERC. The contractor also documented special articles in the relicenses that required post-license actions and open-ended actions in which FERC reserved the right to make future changes throughout the life of the license.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 101","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5570452","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5570452","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

The 17 original Francis turbine units are in good working order, and the original generators, rewound in the 1940s and 1950s, are operating smoothly. Operating as it did originally, though, means the plant requires extensive human interaction. Operators must be on hand to manually perform all tasks required to start and stop the units. Although the plant's original mechanical governor control equipment is still operable and reliable, it has required more and more maintenance in the last several years. The Keokuk plant is typical of many of the existing hydroelectric facilities in North America-equipment in the plants, though decades old, provides adequate reliability, yet the control schemes are labor intensive. Faced with rising operation and maintenance costs in the mid-1980s, Union Electric Company, who owns and operates Keokuk, began exploring rehabilitation options that would make the plant more efficient. Initial feasibility studies indicated that, by automating the plant's control system, the utility could save hundreds of thousands of dollars each year in manpower costs and, at the same time, improve system monitoring and reduce energy costs. As a result, Union Electric has undertaken major automation projects at both its Keokuk and 60-year-old Osage hydro plants. Advances in electronics during the last five years have led to reliable, cost-effective control systems. By installing these systems, owners of aging hydro facilities can cut operation and maintenance expenses and improve the efficiency of the original generating equipment.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 12-18","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5631412","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5631412","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

Four years of development and field tests conducted by the American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP), Columbus, Ohio, demonstrated that synthesized low frequency sounds can divert warm and cold freshwater adult and juvenile fish. Test results indicate that underwater sound merits further exploration by the hydropower industry as a possible alternative to physically screening power plant intakes and other mitigation measures. The potential effect on the future of the industry is great, since project compatibility with fish is one constraint limiting development of new hydroelectric facilities, according to the US Department of Energy. In a patented process, AEP used sounds from fish such as chinook salmon, steelhead trout, striped bass, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, and gizzard shad to synthesize signals capable of stimulating fish in the most sensitive portion of their hearing range. The process can create either attracting or repelling sound signals - depending on how the user wants to behaviorally guide the fish. So far, AEP has refined its ability to create repelling sounds, and has customized these signals for single or multiple-target species. Although the hearing range of a few fish species has been determined previously in laboratory tests, the data is not comprehensive and doesn't include hearing ranges of many species at various life stages living near AEP's hydro plants.","","","","","","United States","1991-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:6","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 30-43","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5698813","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5698813","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:6"

With this response as a benchmark, various methods are analyzed and implemented, utilizing the pressure signal, to improve upon the response of the system. A state-space observer, is designed to attenuate noise on the pressure signal. Results show that an observer-based controller using all states as input, as compared to the PID controller, improves the transient response of hydrogenerators, is effective at filtering out the noise on the pressure signal, and is more robust to both steady-state pressure and plant parameter variations.","","","","","","United States","1991-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 6:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 414-418","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE","10.1109/60.84315","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5514651","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5514651","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","6:3"

To maintain routine operation and ensure plant safety, they must operate reliably. Therefore, the primary considerations in gate design are reliability, safety, and dependable performance. Throughout the industry, gate designs are sometimes used that don`t meet strict reliability and safety standards. To ensure optimum performance, gate designers and plant owners need to be aware of, and follow, several design considerations.

The implementation is based on a Newton's iterative procedure, with special initial guess and sparsity-based matrix manipulations to obtain improved convergence properties. The strategies are developed using three standard test systems. This paper discusses the question of assigning an equivalent cost to the loss objective component and compare results obtained using two proposed mechanisms. The first is based on results of conventional dispatch using Kron's loss formula and the second uses the bus incremental costs involved in the OPF solution. The effects of varying the relative weights assigned to each objective component on pertinent system variables such as active and reactive power generations as well as voltages are explored.","","","","","","United States","1991-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 6:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1106-1112","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; CODEN: ITPSE","10.1109/59.119253","","2016-04-25T00:00:00Z","5634593","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5634593","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","6:3"

Their estimates were based on measures of daily prey consumption, predator numbers, and numbers of juvenile salmonids entering the reservoir during the April-August period of migration. They estimated the mean annual loss was 2.7 million juvenile salmonids. Northern squawfish were responsible for 78% of the total loss; walleyes accounted for 13% and smallmouth bass for 9%. Twenty-one percent of the loss occurred in a small area immediately below McNary Dam at the head of John Day Reservoir. The authors estimated that the three predator species consumed 14% of all juvenile salmonids that entered the reservoir. Mortality changed by month and increased late in the migration season. Monthly mortality estimates ranged from 7% in June and 61% in August. Mortality from predation was highest for chinook salmon O. tshawytscha, which migrated in July and August. Despite uncertainties in the estimates, it is clear that predation by resident fish predators can easily account for previously explained mortality of out-migrating juvenile salmonids. Alteration of the Columbia River by dams and a decline in the number of salmonids could have increased the fraction of mortality caused by predation over what is was in the past.","","","","","","United States","1991-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 448-458","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-8487; CODEN: TAFSA","10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0448:ELOJST>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","5756085","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5756085","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States)","","120:4"

The northern squawfish Ptychocheilus oregonensis was the most abundant predator (estimated population: 85, 316), followed by smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu (34,954) and walleye Stizostedion vitreum (15,168). Because of uncertainty in sampling and assumption of the mark-recapture estimator, the combined abundance of these three predators could lie between 50,000 and 500,000. They believe, however, that bias is probably negative, and that any errors should result in conservative estimates. Northern squawfish were common reservoir-wide, but large concentrations occurred immediately below McNary Dam near the head of John Day Reservoir. Walleyes were largely restricted to the upper third of the reservoir, whereas the number of smallmouth bass increased progressively downriver. As judged by abundance and distribution, northern squawfish have by far the greatest potential for predation on juvenile salmonids. They also expect predation to be unevenly distributed in time and space as a result of variations in the number and distribution of predators.","","","","","","United States","1991-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 439-447","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-8487; CODEN: TAFSA","10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0439:AADONS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5756087","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5756087","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States)","","120:4"

Consumption rates were estimated from field data on stomach contents and digestion rate relations determined in previous investigations. For each predator, consumption rates varied by reservoir area, month, time of day, and predator size or age. The greatest daily consumption of salmonids by northern squawfish and channel catfish occurred in the upper end of the reservoir below McNary Dam. Greatest daily predation by walleyes and smallmouth bass occurred in the middle and lower reservoir. Consumption rates of all predators were highest in July, concurrent with maximum temperature and abundance of juvenile salmonids. Feeding by the predators tended to peak after dawn and near midnight. Northern squawfish below McNary Dam exhibited this pattern, but fed mainly in the morning hours down-reservoir. The daily ration of total prey fish was highest for northern squawfish over 451 mm fork length, for walleyes 201-250 mm, for smallmouth bass 176-200 mm, and for channel catfish 401-450 mm. Averaged over all predator sizes and sampling months (April-August), the total daily ration (fish plus other prey) of smallmouth bass was about twice that of channel catfish, northern squawfish, and walleyes. However, northern squawfish was clearly the major predator on juvenile salmonids.","","","","","","United States","1991-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 421-438","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-8487; CODEN: TAFSA; TRN: 92-035479","10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0421:ROCOJS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-04-15T00:00:00Z","6031416","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6031416","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States)","","120:4"

Before disassembly, workers measure the distance from the top of the discharge ring to the bottom of the turbine runner, at 10 to 12 locations around the discharge ring. Mechanics then machine steel blocks to the exact measurement for each location. Workers then use the generator's braking system to jack up the generator, and then set the steel blocks in place on the discharge ring. The generator is then lowered onto the jacking block, which supports the rotor. The turbine runner barely touches the steel blocks. The coupling bolts are then removed and the rotor lifted out.

Changes in instream flow requirements can affect energy production, water supply, and recreational opportunities at a project. Therefore, licensees should thoroughly evaluate alternative flow release regimes proposed during relicensing. One hydro project owner in Texas recently used a computer model to evaluate the effects of various instream flow release regimes proposed during the course of relicensing. The computer program allowed the licensee to analyze the effects of each alternative release regime and then bring those effects to the attention of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). As a result, the project's new license (relicense) established a flow release regime that benefits downstream fish and wildlife without causing intolerable harm to other purposes of the project. Traditionally, hydro project owners and resource agencies have used the IFIM methodology to study how changes in instream flow affect habitat. Now, several hydro engineering firms are developing specialized computer programs such as the one for Morris Sheppard Dam to determine effects on reservoir levels and yield and hydroelectric generation, instead of focusing only on habitat effects.","","","","","","United States","1991-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 40-48","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5570354","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5570354","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:3"

As a result, FERC's Division of Dam Safety and Inspections has maintained a keen interest in the recent advances and ongoing research in embankment protection. The foremost mission of FERC's dam safety program is to provide for the general public's safety downstream of dams at hydroelectric projects under FERC jurisdiction. To accomplish this mission, some older dams have had to be modified to meet present-day engineering criteria, particularly with respect to stability and spillway capacity. While dam modifications to ensure the public safety are mandatory, it has always been FERC's policy to allow licensees to pursue the most cost-effective means of modification. However, the traditional approach to meeting FERC's requirement has been to expand or construct structural concrete spillways. Increasing the spillway capacity of a project is often a very expensive repair. On the other hand, using innovative methods of protecting embankments against overtopping is much less expensive and thus can represent tremendous savings for project licensees. Of the 2,200 dams under FERC's jurisdiction, approximately 700 are major embankment structures. Clearly, a cost-effective means to upgrade these dams, where necessary, would have an important effect on the dam safety community.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 52","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5536832","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536832","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

Searching for a cost-effective retrofit, engineers have recently considered placing a protective overlay on the embankment and allowing limited overtopping. This armoring of the embankment protects against damaging and potentially catastrophic erosion caused by steep-slope, high-velocity flow. Embankment armoring is an alternative to the more costly and time-consuming methods of enlarging flood control spillways, raising embankments, or extending outlet control structures. Structural (reinforced) concrete and, more recently, roller-compacted concrete traditionally have been used for embankment armoring to achieve the desired level of performance and stability. However, articulated concrete block revetments (a series of individual blocks placed together to form an overlay) now offer another viable armoring option. An articulated concrete block revetment may be the method that can achieve the desired level of stability for the least cost. Advantages of the method are its low cost compared to conventional protection techniques and its applicability to a wide range of hydraulic conditions.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 54-67","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5536867","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536867","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

Dam owners can use this performance data to select a reliable overtopping protection system for their dams. Some block-type revetment systems have proven reliable for protecting low embankments subjected to small overtopping heads, and many embankment dams have been protected with either soil cement or roller compacted concrete (RCC). Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recently approved the use of RCC for protection of the embankment dam at Southern California Edison's Bishop Creek [number sign]2 hydroelectric plant. As a result of FERC's acceptance of RCC for overtopping protection to add spillway capacity, the utility saved $500,000. Protective systems for high embankment structures currently favor using RCC or slip-formed stepped or smooth concrete deck overlays. Reclamation's near-prototype research program, continuing for the next four years, will extend the present data base for low embankment dams while providing information on scale effects of aeration and dynamic forces associated with high embankment dam protection schemes. This research should provide the confidence needed to apply overtopping protection to high head embankment dams.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 19-30","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5536885","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536885","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

The methods also have examined the project in isolation from the remainder of the power system. However, because of the recent development of sophisticated computerized analytical tools, hydro's environmental and economic effects within the context of an entire power system can now be determined and quantified. With access to this kind of information, policy makers should be able to make better, more fully informed decisions about hydro's value to a generation system. They can then establish operating criteria for hydro facilities that recognize these values. Several new computerized analytical tools can accurately simulate operation of entire utility systems, and even regional grids, and thus provide information regarding not only effects on fish and wildlife, but overall economic and environmental effects of hydro projects within the system.

Addressing recreational issues is also a good way to gain public support for a project. Many people correlate the value of hydro projects with recreation opportunities at the site. Therefore, when recreation issues are treated as a meaningful part of project planning, there is an opportunity to develop public support. In order for applicants to select appropriate recreation plans and demonstrate equal consideration for power production and non-power values, a comprehensive planning approach that begins early in the licensing process is needed.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 32-40","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5590750","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5590750","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

(Conventional hydro currently contributes about 71,800 MW of electricity.) When installing a plant at an existing dam, it is often feasible to connect the plant to the existing outlet works of the dam. To do this, however, typically requires a temporary shutdown of the outlet works during construction. Since most dam owners are required to discharge a minimum flow of water through the outlet works to meet water quality standards, some type of temporary diversion scheme is essential. The Incorporated County of Los Alamos, New Mexico, was recently faced with this situation when constructing a hydroelectric project at an existing US Army Corps of Engineers' dam. The county hired Tudor Engineering Company in Oakland, California, to perform the design for the hydro project, including a water diversion system that temporarily conveyed reservoir discharges over the dam to the river downstream. The diversion was necessary so modifications could be made to the outlet works of the dam where the county was building its 13-MW plant. This system, comprised of pumps mounted on a floating barge in the reservoir, allowed the Corps of Engineers to maintain required instream flows while the outlet works were being modified.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 76-82","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5663014","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5663014","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

Shaft runout, in which the shaft connecting the turbine and the generator moves laterally, can subject bearings and structural supports to large pulsating forces. This can lead to a breakdown of a lubricating oil film, which can cause damage to bearings and the shaft. From the practical standpoint of the owner or operator of a hydro machine, unbalance does not often present a difficult problem to solve. However, solutions do require an understanding of the causes of unbalance. Mechanical unbalance possesses a reliable characteristic that distinguishes it from other causes of shaft runout (for a discussion of monitoring for shaft runout see the Machine Dynamics Notebook in Hydro Review's February 1991 issue). The frequency of the runout or vibration is generally once per revolution of the rotating parts. When total vibration is observed with another dominant frequency, some other cause is at work. Quite often when a vibration problem is investigated on a hydroelectric machine, there will be more than one cause. The contribution of any mechanical unbalance can be readily seen on a spectral plot. Even though the unbalance component of the total vibration may be relatively minor, it is sometimes desirable to reduce it by balancing so that the vibration from other causes becomes more tolerable. This may be done because unbalance is frequently seen as [open quotes]easier to fix[close quotes] than other causes, such as magnetic unbalance. In some cases, an intentional unbalance can be added that will counteract other undesired effects and result in a smoother running machine.","","","","","","United States","1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 86-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5662875","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5662875","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:2"

High-gradient boulder-bed streams have been the sites of relatively few studies of salmonid spawning habitat, although they have geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics - and therefore gravel distributions - that are quite different from the more commonly described lower-gradient channels. The authors documented gravel distribution in seven high-gradient stream reaches in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Gravels occurred only in locations characterized by relatively low shear stress; they formed small pockets in sites of low divergence and larger deposits upstream of natural hydraulic controls. In 1986 (a wet year), all tracer gravels placed in gravel pockets at nine sites on four streams were completely swept away, and substantial scour, fill, and other channel changes occurred at many sites. In 1987 (a dry year), tracer gravels and the channel cross sections were generally stable. Periodic mobility of gravel may explain why brown trout Salmo trutta are more abundant than rainbow trout Oncorhychus mykiss in the study reaches, where high flows occur every May and June during snowmelt. Brown trout are fall spawners, and their fry emerge long before the high snowmelt flows, whereas rainbow trout are spring spawners whose eggs are in the gravel, and thus vulnerable to scour, during snowmelt flows.","","","","","","United States","1991-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States); Journal Volume: 120:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 177-186","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0002-8487; CODEN: TAFSA","10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0177:DASOPS>2.3.CO;2","","2016-05-06T00:00:00Z","5700482","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5700482","","Transactions of the American Fisheries Society; (United States)","","120:2"

A variety of techniques exist to perform this preliminary design testing. In recent years, great progress has been made in the area of numerical simulation of physical phenomena. Sulzer Escher Wyss has been successfully using the computer method of numerical flow simulation to test designers' ideas. The method calculates the fluid flow in a hydraulic turbomachine, effectively simulating the hydraulic performance of a turbine before it is manufactured. The authors have used flow analysis as a theoretical tool -- a numerical test stand -- to aid in the first cut of turbomachinery design and rehabilitation. This way, only the fine tuning must be made in physical tests. This approach provides a fast and cost-effective layout procedure for machine components. However, the reliability of such a numerical test greatly depends on the quality of the method used, as well as on its proper use in terms of correct boundary conditions and accurate interpretation of the results. To aid in interpretation of the data from the flow analysis, the authors have developed a procedure to compress data from the flow calculations and present them in the form of sophisticated computer graphics. In this way, the design engineer can visualize the main relationships, which will aid him or her in making sound decisions regarding the turbine layout procedure. Ultimately, the method has helped optimize the design and rehabilitation of hydraulic machines, while reducing overall time and expense.","","","","","","United States","1991-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 76-88","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5536729","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5536729","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:1"

This approach was recently used at a hydro project in southern Ohio along the Ohio River. Recognizing that each commonly used biological sampling method has strengths and weaknesses, the plant owner, its consultants, and agency representatives decided on a strategy that employed four techniques to study the effects of the project on fish. Combining various monitoring methods provided complementary sampling of fish distributions and behavior in the river and at the dam. In this study, hydroacoustic techniques allowed extensive sampling over time and space. When complemented with species composition information from net sampling, hydroacoustic techniques produced useful information on fish population and entrainment. Radiotelemetry was used to estimate minimum survival rates of fish passing through a dam gate and turbine unit. In combination, the use of hydroacoustics, netting, electrofishing, and radio telemetry provided a complete picture of the fish population at Greenup Dam over three seasons, and facilitated an accurate assessment of the project's effects on fish.","","","","","","United States","1991-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydro Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 64-74","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0884-0385; CODEN: HYREE8","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5662933","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5662933","","Hydro Review; (United States)","","10:1"

The primary causes of these reductions are runner hydraulic profile changes during weld repairs, surface finish deterioration from cavitation, and runner seal clearance increases due to wear. Many aging turbines require more frequent repairs due to runner cavitation, and wicket gate mechanism, shaft seal, and guide bearing wear. In many instances turbine component repair can be performed in-place. On older units, runner seals, wicket gate bearings, and wicket gate end seals can be repaired only when the turbine is disassembled. Since the significant cost to disassemble and overhaul units must be offset by future maintenance savings and generation increases, turbine rehabilitation is often postponed as owners consider other alternatives. Rehabilitation is a general term used to describe a wide range of turbine reconditioning and design alternatives. Turbine rehabilitation can include a major overhaul of components, runner replacement, and component modifications. Deteriorated runners can be replaced with either a new identical runner or a new modern design having increased efficiency and capacity. The comparative turbine performance of an original, existing, and a modern runner design are shown in this paper. Component overhauls can extend turbine life and restore original efficiency and capacity to existing units. However, the overhaul of existing components cannot increase plant capacity and generation above the as-new values. As a result, owners of aging plants are considering the benefits of replacing existing turbines with modern, more efficient, higher capacity turbines, or expanding the sites. Where expansion is not feasible, hydroelectric power plant owners are finding that turbine rehabilitation is the most cost-effective method to increase plant value and life.","","","","","","United States","1991-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Power Engineering; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 36-39","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0032-5961; CODEN: POENA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5863091","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5863091","","Power Engineering; (United States)","","95:1"

The method uses a solid state Electrical Array Reconfiguration Controller (EARC), which senses the radiation as low, medium or high. accordingly, the controller chooses one favorable set of I-V characteristics for starting and another favorable set of I-V characteristics for steady state operation. This is done by switching the solar panels, depending upon the starting current requirements and the irradiance level, from a parallel to series-parallel to series connection. This produces sufficient staring current especially at low and medium radiation levels, which considerably improves the pump's performance, particularly in the early morning, late evening and cloudy days, providing valuable extra pumping hours for the user.","","","","","","United States","1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States); Journal Volume: 5:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 653-658","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8969; CODEN: ITCNE","10.1109/60.63135","","2016-04-11T00:00:00Z","5291489","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5291489","","IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (United States)","","5:4"

Retrofitting these dams was estimated to cost at least $10 billion. Since the PMF is revised upward periodically, retrofit is a continual issue. But surviving a PMF is a more stringent safety criterion than preventing other sources of dam failure; in addition, it is more stringent than safety criteria for other structures with respect to wind, earthquakes, or storm surges. This higher safety goal has large social costs. The authors propose an alternative safety goal, separating property damage from possible loss of lives. For a proposed dam whose failure could cause large loss of life or property damage, a careful evaluation should be done as to whether the dam should be built. For dams that impose smaller hazards, property damage should be handled by an analysis based on expected values of annualized benefits and costs. An adjustment for scale could be used if the property damage were extremely large. Danger to lives should be handled by establishing programs to warn and evacuate people. The authors' proposal should (1) lead to less injury and death, (2) use society's limited resources more efficiently, and (3) put the determination of safety goals on a more scientific and sensible basis.","","","","","","United States","1990-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 26:7","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1383-1391","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1397; CODEN: WRERA","10.1029/WR026i007p01383","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5489538","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5489538","","Water Resources Research; (United States)","","26:7"

This algorithm identifies unnecessarily committed units in the generation schedule of a large power network, and provides the solution for the economic allocation of the system demand among the committed units.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (USA); Journal Volume: 5:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 665-673","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0885-8950; CODEN: ITPSE","10.1109/59.54579","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","6659826","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6659826","","IEEE Transactions on Power Systems (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers); (USA)","","5:2"

If past efforts are an indicator, the job will not be easy. In 1978, a FERC regulatory process more compatible with large utility projects than small, independently owned projects, was chief among the perceived obstacles to hydropower development. Thus, is section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, Congress specifically directed FERC to streamline its licensing procedures for small hydroelectric projects (1,500 kW or less) at existing dams. The FERC interpreted Congressional intent very broadly and extended its streamlining efforts to projects as large as 5 MW. By 1980, the FERC had established regulations exempting certain projects from the burdens of licensing on a case by case basis, as well as entire categories of small projects with obviously limited environmental impact. Times have changed since 1978, and there is no question that the process of licensing and operating hydroelectric projects has become anything but streamlined. The case of the proposed Livermore Falls project in central New Hampshire, which has dragged on since 1982, is examined.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Independent Energy; (USA); Journal Volume: 20:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 42-45","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 1043-7320; CODEN: XY987","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6160404","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6160404","","Independent Energy; (USA)","","20:4"

The operating objective is to track specified power output targets, subject to a variety of physical constraints. The constraints describe the hydrologic behavior of the tributary watershed and the dynamics of the reservoir system. The decision variables are monthly average releases from each of the system reservoirs. These releases are derived in real time, as functions of available measurements of reservoir storage and tributary inflow. Inflow and measurement uncertainty are explicitly included in the state and measurement equations. The stochastic operations problem is first formulated in general terms and then simplified to allow the use of classical linear-quadratic stochastic control concepts. The solution to the simplified control problem is implemented by combining a linear deterministic control law with a linear estimation algorithm. The resulting stochastic controller is applied to a two-reservoir system in the Caroni River basin of Venezuela. Preliminary tests indicate that the controller performs well in this application, even when some of its underlying assumptions are violated.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Research; (United States); Journal Volume: 26:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 623-635","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1397; CODEN: WRERA","10.1029/WR026i004p00623","","2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","5916880","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5916880","","Water Resources Research; (United States)","","26:4"

As a basis for evaluating different approaches, one needs to predict the noise levels around a substation as accurately as possible before committing additional equipment. Since an accurate assessment of the noise levels must consider all propagation paths the sound waves take to travel from source to receivers (reflections on barriers and ground, diffraction around barriers, transmission through barriers, etc.), a PC computer program best performs all the calculation chores. This article describes such a computer program. It is available on PC to help the substation designer estimate the contours of noise levels resulting from a selected substation layout.","","","","","","United States","1990-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Computer Applications and Power; (USA); Journal Volume: 3:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 25-28","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0895-0156; CODEN: ICAPE","10.1109/67.53226","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","6839376","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6839376","","IEEE Computer Applications and Power; (USA)","","3:2"

Moreover, several developers have added a new twist to a well-established technology by formulating self-contained projects that avoid using natural water courses and thus minimize challenges over environmental impacts. Most prospective pumped storage projects are still in the early formulative stages. Four projects, however, have advanced to the point of having their applications for license under review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), while one other project has recently resumed construction after a lengthy delay. If successfully completed, these five projects would add a minimum of 5,300 MW of energy storage capacity by the mid-to-late 1990s. The paper describes the following projects: the 760 MW Rocky Mountain project near Rome, Georgia; the 1500 MW Summit Energy Storage Project neat Akron, Ohio; 200 MW Mt.

The early automations were achieved with a relay-type supervisory control system, relay logic, dc tachometer, and a pneumatic gate-position controller. While this system allowed the units to be started and stopped from a remote location, they were operated at an output that was preset by the pneumatic control at the generating site. The supervisory control system at the site provided such information as unit status, generator breaker status, and a binary coded decimal (BCD) value of the pond level. The generating units are started by energizing an on-site relay that sets the pneumatic gate controller to a preset value above the synchronous speed of the hydroelectric generator. The pneumatic controller then opens the water-wheel wicket gates to the preset startup position. As the hydroelectric generator starts to turn, the machine-mounted dc tachometer produces a voltage. At a dc voltage equivalent to synchronous speed, the generator main breaker closes, and a contact from the main breaker starts a field-delay timer. Within a few seconds, the field breaker closes. Once the cycle is complete, a relay changes the pneumatic setpoint to a preset operating point of about 8/10 wicket gate opening.","","","","","","United States","1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Tappi; (USA); Journal Volume: 73:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 153-160","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0039-8241; CODEN: TAPPA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6437846","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6437846","","Tappi; (USA)","","73:3"

The interaction between sizing and sequencing decisions is also discussed. The results offer design rules to choose the optimal size and marginal cost for individual projects, and show the interdependence of scaling and sequencing decisions.

Follow-up interviews with many of the same managers show the extent of that shake-out and that companies are developing new strategies for the coming years. As was the case in 1987, declining power purchase rates and an increasingly complicated regulatory environment continue to affect the strategy of the independent hydroelectric industry. However, today the impact of these and other factors is being felt in new and different ways. Many of the same companies that were devoting their attention to going public and acquiring operating stations three of four years ago are now shifting their strategies. Virtually all of the companies investigated indicated an unwillingness to undertake anything but larger projects. For some this has spawned a new-found interest in pumped storage hydroelectric facilities, and in one instance it meant full divestiture of all hydroelectric interests in order to focus on other alternative fuels.

The computer-designed runners are expected to add 330 MW to the peak capacity of the 28-yr-old plant and significantly increase the efficiency at high flow rates. Next year, the first new runner will be retrofit to the highly instrumented Unit 4. If the retrofit unit meets it increased-performance expectations, the other 12 units will be upgraded between 1993 and 1998. The work is part of an overall expansion of the Niagara Power Project designed to made better use of the power value of Niagara river water, within the constraints of a treaty with Canada and the scenic value of the falls. These constraints, together with varying flows and heads, introduced enormous complexities into the selection and design of the new runners. The alterations being made to Unit 4, in addition to replacing the turbine runner, include modifying the draft tube-liners, increasing the wicket-gate stroke, replacing the turbine discharge ring (to accommodate longer blades), making various electrical modifications to the generator, and replacing the transformer. But the key to the retrofit is the computer-designed runner. Charles Grose, senior project manager, New York Power Authority, White Plains, NY, emphasizes that such computer design techniques were not available a few years ago; neither were the computer-controlled machining techniques necessary to manufacture the new runners. Other aspects of the upgrading that were analyzed include runner stability, resonance, shaft torsional stress, and runaway speed.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electrical World; (United States); Journal Volume: 204:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 66-67","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0013-4457; CODEN: ELWOA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5178151","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5178151","","Electrical World; (United States)","","204:1"

CVPOP includes the dependence of energy values within each month of the capacity factor of the generating unit, avoiding the simplification of assuming constant monthly or yearly values as is common in other models. The model also includes contractual energy and capacity constraints which are nonlinear because of the powerplants' variable head performance curves (capability in MW and energy production rate in kWh per unit release versus reservoir storage). An example illustrates the difference between the values of the energy generated with operations schedules obtained using different objective functions.","","","","","","United States","1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management; (USA); Journal Volume: 116:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 52-70","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9496; CODEN: JWRMD","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1990)116:1(52)","","2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","6752220","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6752220","","Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management; (USA)","","116:1"

Suitable mitigative measures can be incorporated in dam design and reservoir operation to substantially reduce sediment entrapment in the reservoir, and to improve dissolved oxygen levels by releasing hypolimnetic waters from the reservoir. These measures may also greatly reduce streambed degradation downstream of the dam and consequent initiation of a new erosion cycle in the tributaries. Economic analyses for different storage-maintenance measures (such as undersluices and flushing pipes) have been investigated in terms of reduction in initial reservoir design storage, cost of installing measures, and cost of any dredging operations.

Water, previously aerated during release over spillways and under gates, is diverted through the hydropower facility without further aeration. The oxygen transfer that occurs as a result of air entrainment at the various release points of a dam is measured. Oxygen transfer efficiencies are calculated and incorporated into an oxygen transfer model to predict average release DO concentrations. This model is used to systematically determine the effect of hydropower operation on downstream DO. Operational alternatives are investigated and a simple operational guide is developed to mitigate the effects of hydropower operation.

A typology of MCDM is provided, dividing the techniques into three groups: outranking, distance-based, and value- or utility-based typed. The operation of the Upper Isar River project in Bavaria is analyzed by means of a value technique and an out-ranking technique called multicriterion Q-analysis. Fourteen criteria are considered in that study, including power production, habitat quality for four groups of species, aesthetics, several recreation indices, minimum flows, and phosphorus loadings. The case study of the Erlauf River Division in Austria is evaluated using a distance-based technique, called composite programming, combined with Monte Carlo simulation. An outcome of that study is that the facility's owners have increased the minimum instream flow in order to protect ecological values.","","","","","","United States","1989-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Energy Engineering; (USA); Journal Volume: 115:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 132-153","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0733-9402; CODEN: JLEED","10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9402(1989)115:3(132)","","2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","6588723","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6588723","","Journal of Energy Engineering; (USA)","","115:3"

Refrigeration plants are needed to produce a healthy working environment. These plants require large volumes of cooling water to be brought into and taken out of these mines. By converting the potential energy of the incoming water to electricity rather than to heat, the water stays colder. This results in cooler mine temperatures, and less need for off-site power. The objective of the project reported was to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of energy recovery from the incoming cooling water used in the refrigeration systems. The economic, operational, and logistic constraints imposed by a mining operation, where ore production, not power production, is the primary concern, were addressed.

These packages are frequently applied by government agencies and utilities for rate hearings, energy import/export licensing, generation capacity expansion planning, and hourly production scheduling for a weekly system operation planning, etc. The accuracy and the characteristics of the PSM however have not yet been carefully investigated. This work presents an extensive study of the PSM. A wide range of load factors and hydro ratio systems have been tested and compared with the results of the rigorous Coordination-Equation Method (CEM). It has been found that the PSM always scheduled more water in the high load period than the CEM. The PSM, therefore, is more likely to swing the hydro plants and may thus avoid frequent on/off operation of thermal units.","","","National Taiwan Univ., Taipei (Taiwan); New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, Fredericton, NB (Canada); New Brunswick Univ., Fredericton, NB (Canada)","","","United States","1989-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

In such a system, a long-term scheduling over one week to one month must be determined, because the LNG/LPG fuel is assigned to the fuel constrained unit at weekly or monthly intervals from contractual restrictions and also because the operation cycle of the pumped-storage unit is one week from economical reasons. The subgradient method using the Lagrangian relaxation for a daily unit commitment is not suitable to the long-term problem, since the convergence property to the dual maximum is not so good. In order to overcome this defect, the authors develop a new algorithm based on the variable metric method for dual maximization.","","","Hiroshima Univ. (Japan).

Ontario Hydro regularly estimates avoided costs primarily for use in evaluating some design, operating, planning and domestic marketing alternatives. Avoided costs reflect the expected cost of increased of decreased use of existing facilities or the expected cost of delaying or advancing additional resources. Avoided costs are estimated to be about 2 cents/kW.h (in $1988) to the mid 1990s. Costs increase to 3 to 4 cents/kW.h towards the late 90s (in $1988) as the nuclear construction program is completed and acid gas emission regulations become more costly to meet. Future avoided costs projections change from time to time because they are sensitive to projections of electricity demand and fuel costs and to the timing and cost of resource expansion plans. As in many other jurisdictions, regulatory and policy making bodies in Ontario and developers of cogeneration and small hydro are interested in calculations of avoided costs. This paper explains how Ontario Hydro calculates avoided costs. The paper includes a brief review of various methods proposed for calculating avoided costs.

The U.S. Flood Control Act of 1936 and the Green Book of 1950 are frequently cited as the seminal documents in the discipline, and many of the key academic studies in the field are focused explicitly on the analysis of large hydroelectric dams. The extensive literature on cost-benefit analysis has illuminated several fundamental issues, such as the discounting of costs and benefits, the evaluation of multipurpose projects, the difference between financial and economic prices, and the treatment of externalities (environmental effects). It seems fair to say that, at a conceptual level, the authors now understand these issues much better than they did half a century ago when the Flood Control Act was passed, though, of course, at a practical level the implementation of these insights can still pose major headaches.","","","","","","United States","1989-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Systems and Policy; (USA); Journal Volume: 13:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 157-167","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0090-8347; CODEN: ESYPB","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7079192","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7079192","","Energy Systems and Policy; (USA)","","13:2"

The cause is attributed to imbalances within the 6-pulse bridges caused by the converter transformer and valve stray capacitances to ground. The conventional model of the converter power circuit used as the basis for the dc filter design does not reproduce the measured 3-pulse harmonics.

The temperature difference between the warm core lamination and the relatively colder stator frame, creates both radial and tangential stresses in these components. The consequence of these stresses depends on the axial prestressing of lamination and the internal design of the core. An overriding of some critical combination of these stresses may result in buckling of lamination, fracture of core tensioning and supporting components or cracks in the stator frame. The present waved lamination technique reduces the tangential and radial spring constant of core and prevents the damages. The research performed through theoretical and experimental methods, indicates a fundamental change in the behavior of core. The waved lamination was successfully used in a large number of machines, providing the reliability and wide application range of the method.","","","","","","United States","1988-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

Many substations at Hydro-Quebec have reached a high degree of sophistication in automation these days and the next logical step for improving the distribution is to automate the feeder networks and, then, the household end. Most feeder interrupting devices are static and call for line crews to open and close switches manually in order to locate and isolate faults and restore power to customers. Traditional feeder maintenance service is no longer adequate because, as the distribution network becomes more and more complex due to expansion, customers have to face longer outages.

The hydrostation was constructed during the Second World War with a shortage of metal, cement, and construction machines. The designs of the structures were made lightweight with the minimum consumption of construction materials without considerable safety factors with respect to strength and stability. Nevertheless, these structures have already been operating for a long time under the harsh climatic conditions of the mountainous region of the Northern Urals, on a river with an unstable water regime under conditions of frequent strats of the unit for covering peak loads. This paper describes the design, construction, and operating history of the station along with maintenance and reinforcement regimes undertaken to ensure its reliability.","","","","","","United States","1988-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

The lower Nelson River generation is brought into the load centre in Southern Manitoba through an HVDC transmission system consisting of two bipoles, the first rated at 1680 MW at the rectifier and the second at 2000 MW. This paper presents the methodology used in arriving at the optimum Bipole 3 size using a reliability cost-benefit analysis. The analysis considers the forced outages of the generation and transmission systems using system outage statistics. The generator and valve group maintenance and the reduction in capability of thyristor valve groups during the summer season were also incorporated in the analysis. The load model used in the study was based on system data for the period 1980-1984. The criterion used in choosing the Bipole 3 size is to optimize the present worth value of the annual energy curtailment due to the HVDC system forced outages and the incremental installation cost of the transmission as the capacity of Bipole 3 is increased. The optimum Bipole 3 size based on the study is 2200 MW. This value is significantly lower than that based on a pole spare criterion used in the earlier development of the HVDC system. Finally, the need for validation of the outage data in evaluating future HVDC projects and the need for data collection and classification is indicated.","","","","","","United States","1988-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The difference between a ripple and a dune bed was seen to consist not only in the shape and size of the bed formations but also in the character of sediment transport.

Thermal cracking in concrete blocks of arch dams enlarged in plan should be controlled by making radial notches to concentrate tensile stresses providing the formation of radial cracks at prescribed places and through the usual methods of thermal regulation. The block size along the face of an arch dam is then no longer limited by the condition of crack resistance but is determined by the rate of concreting.

It is not uncommon to find electric power utilities in third world countries that are using and indeed developing state of the art planning techniques in long-range generation planning. This is particularly so for systems with large amounts of existing and/or potential hydroelectric power. Despite the approximations that are necessary, these techniques furnish planners and decision makers with valuable insights on the range of possible long-term consequences of near-term decisions.

The method is iterative and amenable to solution using standard LP software. The utility of the technique is demonstrated using several test applications involving a hypothetical single-purpose hydropower reservoir and a monthly increment 20-year flow record from the Gunpowder River in Maryland. The separable linearized forms solved quickly using MPSX on a variety of IBM hardware: 3090-400 VF, 3084 QX, dual processor 4381-3, and an AT/370 personal computer. For comparison purposes, the original nonlinear nonseparable version of the model was also solved using MINOS. This yielded a value of aggregate hydropower marginally higher than that using MPSX. The separable, linearized methodology proved to be a useful and an efficient means of generating good starting points for MINOS. The use of these warm starts effected substantial reductions in MINOS execution times.","","","","","","United States","1988-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resources Bulletin; (USA); Journal Volume: 24:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 435-447","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0043-1370; CODEN: WARBA","10.1111/j.1752-1688.1988.tb03003.x","","2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","7040052","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7040052","","Water Resources Bulletin; (USA)","","24:2"

Simulations are presented which compare the use of constant gains to the use of these variable gains for isolated resistive and infinite bus loads. Additional resistive load simulations show the effect of a one-second digital filter on the gain functions.

These analog signals are usually measured to second periodically and combined with desired interchange to obtain the Area Control Error (ACE). The ACE digital quantity is allocated to regulating hydro turbines and transmitted via telemetry to the remote terminal untis (RTU). The RTUs convert the raise/lower megawatts (MW) into timed relay contact closures to the governor which result in wicket gate open/close movement to change the generator output power. The output power of each generator is monitored by the digital AGC which closes a feedback loop around the governor-turbine-generator to assure the desired power level is attained. This paper describes the feedback loop design, which is essentially a sampled-data control. Additional feedback loops due to the ACE and load regulation are also analyzed.

The DO dynamics are controlled primarily by meteorological factors that are independent of the mode of hydrostation operation. DO stratification occurred during the summer in Conowingo Pond, but thermal stratification was not observed. The magnitude and duration of off-speak discharges including a run-of-the-river operation did not affect DO stratification in Conowingo Pond; little vertical mixing occurred. However, strong winds and/or high river flows temporarily destroyed DO stratification. The run-of-the-river operation of off-peak continuous discharge schemes did not provide better DO conditions downstream of the hydrostation than the peaking operation with intermittent off-speak releases. A statistical model predicted that a DO of 5 ppm occurrs 0.6 miles downstream of the powerhouse when the natural river flow is consistently greater than 15,000 cfs and water temperature is less than 80{degree}F. A mean daily DO of at least 4 ppm was predicted to occur over 80 percent of the time during the 92-day summer period.

The problem is formulated using the cartesian coordinate form of the power flow equations. Here the hydro generation is energy limited. As a result, a dynamic optimization problem involving the daily scheduling of the system is encountered. This dynamic optimal power flow problem requires the solution of a large scale set of non-linear simultaneous equations. In this paper, Newton's method is used to solve the problem. Due to the large scale nature of the problem, the authors have exploited the sparsity of the Jacobian and developed three different versions of the algorithms and implementation of these versions have been detailed in this paper. In all cases, the algorithm has been successfully tested with six standard IEEE test systems varying in size from 5 bus to 118 bus. Computational results and the CPU times required by all of the methods are given. Results are compared with the results obtained by the earlier version using polar form for load flow constraints and it is shown that the sparse implementation using rectangular coordinates offers superior computational speed.","","","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Technical Univ. of Nova Scotia, P.O.

This graph will show the expected annual flow and how the water flow is affected monthly or daily for each of the pertaining hydro sites. The flow-duration curve also reveals the consistency of the water flow and the difference between minimum and maximum flow. Knowledge of the flow characteristics is a prerequisite in determining the right turbine system to optimize utilization of the available resource.

The early states of this new chapter in hydro development will create a lot of work for legal staffs, consulting engineers and environmental specialists, but the equipment suppliers and contractors will have to wait until the relicense awards are made by the FERC before receiving new business. From the equipment supplier's point of view, and especially the turbine manufacturer's point of view, the current relicensing program is a minor perturbation in the on-going process of repairing and replacing old plants. However, it would appear that the improvement and replacement of obsolescent plants may soon be accelerated considerably by the level of competition and external pressures to make efficient use of resources.","","","","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Alternative Sources Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 95","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 22-23","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ASEND","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7150176","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7150176","","Alternative Sources Energy; (United States)","","95"

The main stabilization of the seepage behavior of the dams occurred during the first year after reservoir fill. It was measured according to pressure and temperature. An increase in seepage in the summer is explained by the effect of temperature on the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the dam material. This increase was found not to affect reliability.","","","","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

Approximately $10 million in damages occurred when a lightning strike caused a fault on the transmission intertie to the project. The fault triggered a full load rejection of all generating units, causing loss of power to the spillway gates. Efforts to restart the units or provide auxiliary power to the gates were unsuccessful. As a result, the river level rose quickly and water overtopped and breached project embankments. Portions of the power canal were also eroded and the foundation of Powerhouse No.1 was partially washed away, causing the structure to rotate and settle several degrees out of plumb. Remedial design and construction plans aimed to not only quickly restored generating capacity, but also to provide a fail-safe operation of the spillway in the future. Restoration work and its scheduling are briefly described.","","","","","","United States","1987-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Alternative Sources Energy; (United States); Journal Volume: 93","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 29","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ASEND","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5538242","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5538242","","Alternative Sources Energy; (United States)","","93"

We evaluated flushing flows on reaches proposed for hydroelectric diversions on seven streams in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, with wild populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta). The stream reaches are steep, are dominated by boulder cascades, and afford few opportunities for gravel deposition. Methods for estimating flushing flows from flow records, developed from studies in other localities, produced widely differing results when applied to the study streams, probably reflecting differences in the hydrologic and geomorphic characteristics of the streams on which the methods were developed. Tracer gravel experiments demonstrated that all sampled gravels were washed out by the flows of 1986, a wet year. Size analyses of gravel samples and hydraulic data from field surveys were used in tractive-force calculations in an attempt to specify the flow required to flush the gravels. However, these calculations produced some unrealistic results because the flows were nonuniform in the study reaches. This suggests that the tractive-force approach may not be generally applicable to small, steep streams where nonuniform flow conditions prevail.","","","Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD","","","United States","1987-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The optimal capacity is that at which the marginal cost of constructing additional storage capacity is equal to the dredging costs avoided by having that additional capacity available to store sediment. The cost implications of misestimating dredging costs, construction costs, and sediment delivery rates are investigated. In general, it is shown that oversizing is a rational response to uncertainty in the estimation of parameters. The sensitivity of the results to alternative discount rates is also discussed.

In the mid-1980s, faced with a vote on a supplemented municipal and industrial water repayment contract on the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project, the Bureau of Reclamation confirmed this hypothesis. Through modifications in cost allocation procedures, the bureau shifted costs from municipal and industrial water to hydropower and irrigation. The result of this action was retention of the irrigation purpose in the Bonneville Unit, which would have been unjustified under previous cost allocation procedures.","","","Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City","","","United States","1987-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

This is due to the use of long EHV transmission links between the production sites and the load centres, which can cause large amounts of reactive power to be generated, and low short-circuit level, leading to low-frequency resonance, further excited by the presence of transformers.

The purpose of this paper is to specify the network simplex method of the load-flow calculation in a power system. This study is not limited to the DC-flow calculation but particularly presents a model for the full AC load-flow calculation. The proposed model is an imaginary and real current one. It is based on a simplifying assumption which will allow decoupling of the problem and which is the basis of the algorithm called FLF (FLow Load-Flow algorithm). Power system elements such as lines, transformers, generators and voltage control busses are represented with adapted models. Systematic tests have been performed on some existing power systems, such as the IEEE 24-bus Reliability system. The performance of this method is compared with the results of a decoupled Newton-Raphson load-flow. The accuracy of the FLF algorithm is competitive with the Newton-Raphson method, but its speed still has to be improved. However the load-flow calculation is only a part of the power system security problem, where properties and characteristics of flow and transportation algorithms will offer greater perspective.","","","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 1007 Lausanne","","","United States","1987-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

The author illustrates this nonlinear effect with numerical illustration. Results are given of the calculations of water quality performed during optimization of the Kuzbass water-management system. Data presented give additional arguments on behalf of stream flow regulation as an effective means of improving water quality in the basins of industrial regions. The author examines in particular the direct regulating effects associated with a change in diluting capacity of rivers in lower pools of reservoirs. Effectiveness of variants of stream flow regulation of the Kuzbass according to the results of computer tests of a simulation model of the water-management system in the entire range of hydrological conditions is shown.","","","","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

To prevent increased loads on elements of the unit and water hammer in the pressure conduit, it is necessary that the total time of closing the shutoff limits the rotational speed of the rotor of the unit in the turbine direction. To find the optimal law of closing of the shutoff, calculations of the process of the loss of drive of a pump unit were calculated on a computer according to a program based on the simultaneous solution of equations of rotation of the rotor of the unit and equations of water hammer with consideration of elasticity of water and walls of the conduit. The method of determining a shutoff closing law developed here provides a minimum increase of pressure and dynamic loads on the unit.","","","","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

Between 1989 and 1991, over 50,000 megawatts of electricity will need to be ordered in order to meet the country's electrical-generating requirements in the mid-1990's. Yet, many utilities are likely to be reluctant to build new power plants because of the financial, regulatory, and construction risks, as well as possible concerns that fuel prices may spiral in the future after a period of stability in the near term. Therefore, many utilities are likely to purchase rather than produce their generating requirements. Because alternative energy (primarily cogeneration, hydro, biomass, and waste/energy) represents low-cost, short lead-time, smaller and, therefore, more manageable increments of generating capacity, a sizable proportion of the nation's generating needs will be met by alternative-energy facilities.","","","Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Strategic Plan.

Despite the lack of data in some areas, where seismicity occurred after reservoir impounding, there have been distinct seismic patterns observed in seismic areas after dam projects implantation. This has demonstrated that reservoir loading can trigger earthquakes. A mechanism of earthquake generation by reservoir impounding is proposed here with particular application to the Brazilian cases and to areas subject to low confining stress conditions in stable regions. Six artificial lakes are described and the associated earthquake sources are discussed in terms of natural or induced seismicity. Earthquake monitoring in Brazil up to 1967, when Brasilia's seismological station started operation, was mainly based in personal communications to the media. Therefore, there is a general lack of seismic records in relatively uninhabited areas, making it difficult to establish a seismic risk classification for the territory and to distinguish natural from induced seismicity. Despite this, cases reported here have shown an alteration of the original seismic stability in dam sites after reservoir loading, as observed by the inhabitants or records from Brasilia's seismological station. All cases appear to be related to an increase in pore pressure in permeable rocks or fracture zones which are confined between impermeable rock slabs or more competent rock. It is apparent that some cases show some participation of high residual stress conditions in the area.","","","","","","United States","1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environmental Geology and Water Sciences; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 149-158","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0177-5146; CODEN: EGWSE","10.1007/BF02580470","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","5964833","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5964833","","Environmental Geology and Water Sciences; (United States)","","10:3"

In this paper we are concerned with models of hydro-plant performance characteristics. Due to the diversity of plant types and installations, a number of models have been proposed in developing optimal operational strategies over the years. Here the authors choose four commonly used models. The problem of finding optimal estimates of model parameters is investigated for the Glimn-Kirchmayer model, the Hildebrand model, the Hamilton-Lamont model and the Arvanitidis-Rosing model. They develop the optimal estimator equations for each model using the weighted-least-squares approach. The result for three of the models is a set of nonlinear equations in the unknown parameters. They adopt Newton's method for actually implementing the optimal estimators. Due to the sensitivity of the algorithm's convergence characteristics to the initial guess of the unknowns, they explore and present procedures for generating initial guess values to improve the procedure's performance. Computational experience with the techniques is given in the paper to confirm its feasibility using test data from existing hydro-plants. The paper proposes and examines some extensions to the classical models to improve the accuracy of the modeling process.","","","Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Technical Univ. of Nova Scotia, P.O.

The scientist can affect policy-making as an expert witness, an advocate or a surrogate. By understanding the policy process, scientists can make their work more policy relevant. Using the Terror Lake hydro project in Alaska as a guide, three lessons are discussed: (1) not all problems are able to be solved with technology; (2) policy-relevant technology is rarely imposed on a problem; and (3) the scientist need not just to react to the policy process, but can have an impact on how that process unfolds.","","","Fish and Wildlife Service, Fort Collins, CO","","","United States","1986-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The numerical model is based on the kinematic equations with both an overland flow/stream flow component and a subsurface component of flow for 14 sub-catchments. Both flood flows and base flows from the catchment are predicted using the model on a real-time basis. In addition to being able to predict flows ahead by the lag time of the catchment (of the order of one day), projection can be made further ahead using rainfall projections. The low cost of the receiving, transmitting and processing system is made possible by coupling simple tipping bucket type rain gages through a processor to a standard microcomputer. The numerical model is simple enough to operate on the microcomputer and can readily be extended to assist in operation of the hydroelectric station to optimize the available water.","","","Univ. of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg","","","United States","1986-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The formulation and optimality conditions for systems with fixed head hydro-plants subject to an energy limited constraint are presented. The solution to obtain the optimal operational strategy is implemented using Newton's method. Due to the large scale nature of the problem, special sparsity oriented and structural property enhancements are explored and four versions for algorithmic implementation are detailed in the paper. Special attention is paid to finding realistic initial guess estimates for the algorithms reported.

The latter has been initially designed for a flood with a return frequency of one in 25 years. Lack of adequate forecasting facilities during the earlier stages of construction has resulted in significant damages and construction delays. Statistical forecasting models were developed by Projeto de Hidrologia y Climatologie da Amazonia (PHCA) for the purpose of preventing further damage at the site. The application of these models during the 1980 flood season, when the highest flood on record occurred at the Tucurui site, proved of great assistance in preventing the flooding of the cofferdam. In conjunction with the development of these models a number of data collection platforms using data transmission through the GOES system were installed to provide the data required for forecasting.","","","Univ. of Waterloo, Ontario","","","United States","1986-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The main characteristic of the method is that the analyst must first learn from the past experience of the manager and synthesize it into a simple operating rule. Then, the analyst must point out, with the help of the manager, what the acceptable modifications of such a rule are. After this has been accomplished, the optimal improvements of the operating rule can be obtained by using standard optimization techniques. Quite satisfactory results have been obtained by applying this approach to Lake Como (Northern Italy), which has been regulated since the end of World War II. In fact, the method shows that both flood protection on the lake shores and water supply to the downstream agricultural areas can be substantially improved, without lowering the mean yearly electricity production of the downstream run-of-river plants. For this reason the operating rule proposed by the method has been programmed on a microcomputer, which is now used every day by the manager as an essential support for his final decision. This and the fact that other actions suggested by this analysis have indeed been undertaken by the local authorities gave to this study the chance to have a positive and direct impact on the lake management.","","","Politecnico di Milano (Italy)","","","United States","1986-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The dynamic optimization is done for weekly averages, and the coordination to the daily optimization is done by the so called production curves, which measure the value of the regulating power. Two methods, optimal open loop control and state-feedback control, are used for determination of the operation strategy of the system.

While the issues are complex, the focus of the controversy is the fact that federal preference power is so much less expensive than traditional sources of electricity that the demand outstrips available supply. An overview of court decisions and pending suits that have shaped the allocation and ratemaking practice of the PMAs and a discussion of the non-federally funded hydroelectric programs begins with background information on PMAs, preference customers, and relevant statutes. The authors identify a number of unresolved issues, and predict a volatile year ahead as the conflicts between preference advocates and their challengers escalate. Because the stakes are so high, it is likely that Congress will ultimately resolve the major issues rather than the judiciary.","","","","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Law J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 1-70","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ELJOE","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5557185","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5557185","","Energy Law J.; (United States)","","7:1"

If the controversy should spur congressional action in favor of a preference for existing licensees, the result could be to stabilize the hydropower market and save ratepayers up to $4.5 billion. The author concludes that enabling legislation is more of a limiting factor in altering policies than court decisions. While the methods employed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may be improper, its reasoning that municipal preference should not be a part of FERC relicensing proceedings is sound.","","","","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Law J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 7:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 373-387","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ELJOE","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6984003","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6984003","","Energy Law J.; (United States)","","7:2"

The emphasis is on a method of evaluation of the risk costs based on the structure of the local economy. Costs to agricultural property as well as residential, commercial, industrial, and public property are studied in detail. Of particular interest is the case of sequential dam failure and the evaluation of the risk costs attributable to a new dam upstream from an existing one. Three real cases are presented as illustrations of the method: the Auburn Dam, the Dickey-Lincoln School Project, and the Teton Dam, which failed in 1976. This last case provides a calibration tool for the estimation of loss ratios. For these three projects, the risk-modified benefit-cost ratios are computed to assess the effect of the risk on the economic performance of the project. The role of a warning system provided by systematic monitoring of the dam is analyzed: by reducing the risk costs, the warning system attenuates their effect on the benefit-cost ratio. The precursors, however, can be missed or misinterpreted: monitoring does not guarantee that the risks to human life can be reduced to zero. This study shows, in particular, that it is critical to consider the risk costs in the decision to build a new dam when the flood area is large and densely populated.","","","Stanford Univ., CA","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Using a survey of anglers, the Travel Cost and Contingent Value Methods were applied to calculate the economic losses in recreational cold water fishing that might result, if fishing quality dropped by 50% due to hydro-power development. A 50% reduction in fish catch on the Henry's Fork of the Snake River in eastern Idaho due to a dam would result in an annual loss of US $920,000 in fishing benefits. If, instead, a 50% reduction in size of fish caught occurs as a result of a dam on the Henry's Fork, the annual loss in fishing benefits would be US $1.07 million. Recommendations are made that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) should routinely require quantification of the fisheries benefits foregone in small-head hydro applications, and FERC should use such information to determine overall project feasibility before awarding a permit. 29 references.","","","Univ. of California, Davis","","","United States","1986-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

At issue is municipal preference in hydroelectric relicensing proceedings and whether or not this preference exists under the Federal Power Act. The author traces the roots of the dispute from the Federal Power Act to the current range of bills in Congress that seek to clarify regulations. The prospects for legislative clarification are uncertain given the diametric opposition of the competing interests, although there is a distinct possibility that this congressional session will remove municipal preference.","","","","","","United States","1985-07-11T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Public Util.

An empirical analysis of the production structure of Ontario Hydro reveals the degree of substitution between factor inputs and the contribution to total factor productivity growth of economies of scale, capacity utilization, and technical change. The analysis confirms that there is a legitimate rationale to over-capitalize and add more capacity in order to encourage the substitution of electricity for non-renewable sources. The analysis also suggests a number of steps that would improve Ontario Hydro's performance, with both the federal and provincial governments playing a role. 22 references, 6 tables.","","","Economic Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario","","","United States","1985-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: South.

First, they state that the dam was constructed of concrete with high thermal properties in blocks whose sizes considerably exceed the analogous parameters for hydraulic structures constructed elsewhere in the area. They state that solidity of the enlarged blocks was provided by traditional technological and technical measures not requiring considerable added expenditure. They conclude that by far the most cracks in the dam have been caused by the use of cantilever formwork which called for early striking of the concrete, and which have a negligible width and depth of penetration into the masses. They state that this cracking does not pose a danger to the structure and that therefore the use of the industrial cantilever formwork was justified. The authors conclude that through cracking in the first column of the dam, related to the presence of inspection galleries at the middle of its width, can be eliminated by locating the latter at a distance of not more than 0.2-0.25 of the column width from the column joint. Finally, they state seepage through the cracks is negligible.","","","","","","United States","1985-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

The company devised the interferometric system, MACROMETER V-1000, to survey rights-of-way and other potential utility sites. It expects the service to become increasingly cost-effective. 2 figures.","","","","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electr.

On reservoirs of nuclear and hydroelectric power stations the role of moles (breakwaters) is performed by guide banks. At present, a number of theoretical solutions and methods of calculating wave diffraction on water areas protected by single or convergent moles are known. However, in such frequently encountered cases of the layout of water areas as protection by offset or overlapping moles, when the projection of the width of the inlet b less than or equal to O and secondary deformation occurs, the standard method cannot be used. Thus, it is necessary to develop a method to calculate wave diffraction free as far as possible of the shortcomings of the standard method. In this paper the author proposes a solution of the problem of wave diffraction on water areas which is obtained from the Helmholtz equation.","","","","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

An aerator usually consists of a device providing separation of the flow from solid boundaries (ledge, ski-jump bucket, or their combination along with a groove) and a system ventilating the separation zone. The air can enter under the nappe through flow separation regions near the side walls and behind piers or through special air ducts, as for example, on the San Roque chute spillway. The main difficulty when calculating aerators is a determination of the air-capturing ability of the flow. It is necessary to know the discharge of the air entrained by the flow as a function of the vacuum in the space under the nappe, since these parameters are the initial ones for calculating the air ducts. The authors present here the calculation of the air-capturing ability of a flow behind an aerator ledge.","","","","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

The effect of wear as a result of cavitation and the action of sediments are displayed as loss of efficiency of the machines and overconsumption of electric energy related to it, the need to conduct repair and restoration, and a decrease in the delivery of water as a consequence of an increase of the design gaps. As a result of this investigation the authors conclude that having established a generalizing relationship between the rate of cavitation-abrasive wear and the set of parameters will make it possible to select with some degree of validity the suction heads of various types and sizes of pumps which can have a significant effect on the amount if capital investment required in the construction of pump units.","","","","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

Improvement of the technology of constructing concrete hydraulic structures is possible, they say, by introducing the following suggestions: construction of massive structures mainly from a very stiff, low-cement concrete mix compacted by the vibrating roller method; use of poured self-compacting concrete mixes when constructing reinforced-concrete structural elements of hydrostations, water intakes, tunnel linings, etc.; and by development of the technology of delivering stiff concrete mixes by conveyors and their placement by rotary throwers when revetting slopes.

However, the overwhelming majority of foundations being constructed on soft soils have a certain founding depth. In hydrotechnical construction deep strip foundations are used almost exclusively. In this connection, a calculation of the stability of foundations with consideration of their depth is crucial, since the founding depth has a substantial effect on the value of the critical force.

The connection to the network is done through a back-to-back dc link, which is used as a static frequency changer. The penetration level of the wind turbine is in the range 13% - 33% of the rating of the AC network. The study includes the transient performance of the dc link and the wind turbine drive during electrical braking and for system disturbances such as AC system faults. The study shows that the use of a stabilization signal in the dc link helps to reduce large torsional vibrations in the wind turbine low speed shaft. These vibrations are observed after AC system faults. The study also shows that it is possible to obtain satisfactory operation of the overall system by adopting suitable control strategies.","","","Institut de Recherche d'Hydro-Quebec (IREQ), Varennes, Quebec","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Trans.

Exemplified in geotechnical investigations for a proposed LNG terminal near Point Conception (Little Cojo Bay), California, soil stratigraphy was employed to date last displacement of site-area faults, to estimate age of marine platforms, and to help reconstruct regional geomorphic history. Similarly, at the General Electric Test Reactor (GETR) site near Livermore (Vallecitos), California, soil stratigraphy was instrumental to date last displacement and recurrence of site-area slip surfaces engendered either by tectonic or by mass-wasting processes. Datable markers included four, strongly-developed buried paleosols, each of which marked epochs of regional landscape stability during the Quaternary.","","","","","","United States","1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Bull.

The thermal regime of a mountain river is determined by the amount of heat contained in the water mass and its change along the length of the river as a consequence of heat exchange of the water surface with the atmosphere. On the basis of the characteristics of the winter thermal regime, the authors schematically divide the investigated river into six stretches. They determine by this analysis that under conditions of a winter of normal severity, the stretch of the site of the Pamir No. 1 hydrostation is in a zone of increased probability of icing, and so in the design it is necessary to use structural and regime measures to prevent icing of the stationary parts of gates and to heat the trash racks. Further, to prevent the flow of shuga to the water intake, it is advisable to construct a shuga-retaining boom.","","","","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

The main conclusion of the work is that with fulfillment of the standard requirements imposed on the stress state, the unsealed dams with batter-arranged stepped joints have, under operating loads (in regions with a high seismicity the reliability of unsealed dams should be additionally investigated), a reliability no less than that of sealed dams, with vertical columnar masses being constructed under analogous conditions.","","","","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

The inselberg -- a residual upland located in the middle of the valley -- is used as the connecting link and is the unified barrier for joining the channel and floodplain dams which considerably reduced the volume of earthworks and construction time. Placement of soils from useful cuts in the dams sharply reduced transportation costs on hauling soils, and the location of borrow pits in the flowage lands reduced the areas of farmlands being taken away for construction. The selected variant of the location, layout, and design of an individual irrigation intake, instead of the original variant combined with the intake of the hydrostation, provides continuous delivery of water for irrigation and domestic drinking water supply in a wide range of reservoir water levels, with a considerable reduction of investments in the irrigation structures of the hydro development.","","","","","","United States","1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

It it found that for an average of seven inflow states, the largest number of storage states for which it is computationally feasible to develop the storage probability distributions is nine. It is shown that use of the dynamic program results based on a small number of storage states results in unrealistically skewed storage probability distributions.

Observational and model evidence suggests that the seasonal transport cycle of the Florida Current is locally forced, either upstream in the Caribbean or downstream over topography. Although at seasonal and shorter periods sea level or bottom pressure fluctuations on the left side of the Florida Current contribute almost all of the variance of sea level difference across the Florida Straits and hence transport, this relation does not seem to apply at interannual time scales. Using results from the Subtropical Atlantic Climate Studies, it is estimated from historical sea level data that interannual transport fluctuations of the Florida Current are only of order 1 x 10/sup 6/ cubic meters per second. Interannual fluctuations in the 2- to 3-year period range in the Florida Straits seem to be correlated with sea level differences across the Caribbean and the subtropical Atlantic but not with Sverdrup transport fluctuations in the subtropical Atlantic. 26 references, 2 figures.","","","Univ. of Miami, FL","","","United States","1985-01-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States); Journal Volume: 227:4684","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 308-311","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: SCIEA","10.1126/science.227.4684.308","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","5465448","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5465448","","Science (Washington, D.C.); (United States)","","227:4684"

Daily-averaged sea level from either gauge on the Bahamian side of the Straits was poorly correlated with transport. Bottom pressure off Jupiter had a linear coefficient of determination of r/sup 2/ = 0.93, and Miami sea level, when adjusted for weather effects, had r/sup 2/ = 0.74; the standard errors of estimating transports were +/-1.2 x 10/sup 6/ and +/-1.9 x 10/sup 6/ cubic meters per second, respectively.

Most of the studied channels are in the semiarid western US. Flood peaks generally were decreased by the dams, but in other respects the post-dam water-discharge characteristics varied from river to river. Sediment concentrations and suspended loads were decreased markedly for hundreds of kilometers downstream from dams; post-dam annual sediment loads on some rivers did not equal pre-dam loads anywhere downstream from a dam. Bed degradation varied from negligible to about 7.5 meters in the 287 cross sections studied. In general, most degradation occurred during the first decade or two after dam closure. Bed material initially coarsened as degradation proceeded, but this pattern may change during later years. Channel width can increase, decrease, or remain constant in the reach downstream from a dam. Despite major variation, changes at a cross section in stream bed elevation and in channel width with time often can be described by simple hyperbolic equations. Equation coefficients need to be determined empirically. Riparian vegetation commonly increased in the reach downstream from the dams, probably because of the decrease in peak flows. 120 references, 49 figures, 14 tables.","","","","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: U.S. Geol.

The algorithm maximize the value of energy produced at on-peak rates, plus the estimated value of water remaining in storage at the end of the 12-month planning period. The LP-DP algorithm is clearly dominated: it takes longer to find a solution and produces significantly less hydropower than the other two procedures. Successive linear programming (SLP) appears to find the global maximum and is easily implemented. For simple systems the optimal control algorithm finds the optimum in about one fifth the time required by SLP but is harder to implement. Computing costs for a two-reservoir, 12-month deterministic problem averaged about seven cents per run using optimal control and 37 cents using successive linear programming.","","","Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

But hydroelectric plants are still utilizing only a portion of the river's hydraulic energy due to hydrologic and economic restraints One possibility for increasing the efficiency of hydropower plants is the conversion of water to hydrogen through electrolysis by using the excess energy or wasted energy not yet utilized, and then conversion of hydrogen to electricity via a gas turbine or fuel cells. The electricity produced in the off-peak or no-demand time, or at the time of huge river flows in the spring can be stored in the form of hydrogen, and later, when the peak energy is needed the hydrogen converted to electricity. One of the advantages of the proposed system is that the resource for production of hydrogen (the water) is available directly at the site.","","","Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C.","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

Two scenarios are depicted. The first focuses on optimal planning of the canal capacity and optimal use of its water to generate hydroelectric power while filling the basin to its steady-state level. The second includes the impact of solar pools as a new technology whose date of adoption is a random event. It is shown that the optimal flow of water through the canal depends on the relationship between optimal canal capacity and the rate of water evaporation in the basin. The optimal design of the canal project can be considered a hybrid between depletion of a natural resource (the height differences in filling up the basin) and use of a renewable resource (solar energy to evaporate the basin water). The optimal policy is shown to consist of sequential intervals, some of which may vanish under certain conditions: first, the operation of the canal at full capacity; then the gradual decrease of water flow at a rate equal to the elasticity of the marginal product of electricity generation times the sum of interest rate and the marginal evaporation rate; and, finally, the stabilization of the water flow at the rate of steady-state evaporation. The stochastic model with the introduction of solar pools technology treated as a random event is formulated as a two-stage maximization problem. 6 references, 3 figures.","","","Ben-Gurion Univ., Beer Sheva, Israel","","","United States","1985-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This article invokes simple economic theory to show how this test can be implemented.

Attention is focused on the sediment load carried by main rivers in China; the related sediment problems encountered in developing water resources; and the methods in dealing with those problems. There are 50 rivers with annual maximum sediment load exceeding 10 million tons in China. There are more than 400,000 sq km of loess plateaus and hills in the drainage basin of the Yellow River. Inadequate conservation of soil and water leads to erosion, transportation and deposition of sediment, giving rise to much trouble in water conservation works. These problems include flood control, navigational concerns, reservoir sedimentation, and sediment problems of lowhead diversion dams or hydroelectric projects. Methods for dealing with sediment problems include water and soil conservation and use of turbid water with emphasis on terracing, strip cropping, forestation, grass and crop rotation. Several types of structures may be built along a gully such as small reservoirs, check dams, drop structures, drainage ditches, and irrigation canal systems for diverting hyperconcentrated flow into farmland or to warp land. Processes for diverting water while preventing sediment from entering water intakes at hydroelectric plants are becoming more advanced. 4 references, 3 figures, 2 tables.","","","Institute of Water conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Research, Beijing, China","","","United States","1984-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Int.; (United States); Journal Volume: 9:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 177-180","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: WAINE","10.1080/02508068408686534","","2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","6191829","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6191829","","Water Int.; (United States)","","9:4"

Total project cost data from a number of hydropower projects are compiled to provide guidelines for choosing the site factor, which is shown to vary greatly, especially for micro (less than or equal to100 kW) and mini (less than or equal to1,000 kW) hydropower projects. Envelope curves for site factors are given, and a ''weighting factor,'' which is the fraction distance between upper and lower envelope curves, is chosen for each site. The choice of weighting factor for a given site is based upon comparison with recently completed projects, a knowledge of the components which can greatly increase civil works costs, and engineering judgement.

The existence of an ice cover can lead to a substantial loss in power production. This loss in power due to the presence of ice cover, however, can be minimized with appropriate ice control measures. In this technical note, a quantitative analysis of power loss is carried out for the St. Lawrence Power Project. Major factors that affect the magnitude of power loss are examined to provide some information for future ice-related hydropower operations. The St. Lawrence River, which conveys water from the Great Lakes Basin to the Atlantic Ocean, has been utilized for hydroelectric power production since the early 1900's. The St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project, constructed in 1954-58, developed the hydropower potential of the upper St. Lawrence River. The Moses-Saunders Power Dam is located about 100 miles downstream of the outlet of Lake Ontario. Since the development of this power project, the regulation of flow through the dam in relation to the ice conditions has been an important element in its winter operation. The existence of an ice cover reduces the power production capability of the river significantly.","","","Dept. of Civ. and Environ.

The analysis considers the effects of alternative minimum flow releases, ranging from 0 to 34 cubic meters per second (cms), on the total energy flow of the affected system. The principal system components affected by differing minimum flows are hydroelectric power generation, aquatic habitat, and gross aquatic ecosystem productivity. The minimum flow alternative resulting in the highest annual energy flow in the affected system is considered optimal. From this purely analytical point of view, the optimum minimum flow is 0 cms, due to the short length and low productivity of the regulated reach, and the lack of floodplain interactions. Simulations of longer and more productive river reaches were conducted. For very short, unproductive reaches, in the absence of a floodplain, the contribution of aquatic community productivity to total system energy flow is negligible compared to hydroelectric generation. Optimum minimum flows are higher for longer and more productive reaches. For such cases the operation of hydroelectric dams could reduce total system energy flow because the energy supplied by hydroelectric generation may be offset by losses in aquatic productivity due to diminished riverine habitat.","","","Univ. of South Carolina, Columbia","","","United States","1984-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environ.

Initially, the reservoir was expected to be filled by the end of 1966. However, the actual filling was not completed until September of 1967. During filling and in the first years of operation it was constantly necessary to deal with floating timber in order to ensure normal operation of the hydrostation, navigation safety, conditions for fishery, and fulfillment of the sanitary requirements. During seasonal variations of the reservoir level about 160 sq km of the shore zone was subjected to variable flooding and waterlogging. Maximum erosion occurred on expanded stretches, and within their limits on slopes composed of loam and sand deposits. Within the narrows, where the banks are composed mainly of hard and soft rocks and wave action is weak, erosion is negligible. Wind setup and setdown cause maximum denivellation of the water surface. The maximum increase of the level during setup reaches 232 cm and the maximum decrease during setdown is 24 cm. Seiche oscillations with various amplitudes and periods are observed on the reservoir surface. The main uses of the complex are hydropower, water transport, timber floating, water supply, and fishery. For the successful development of the shores of reservoirs it is necessary to select the construction sites with consideration of possible occurrence of karstic and landslide processes; the construction of heavy structures requires special karst-control measures. 3 references, 3 figures, 1 table.","","","","","","United States","1984-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

A numerical model of these waves was developed by first identifying the primary physical processes and then performing an analysis of the solution. A linear analysis of the dynamic open channel flow equations provides relationships describing flow wave advection, diffusion, and dispersion in rivers. A one-dimensional diffusion wave model modified for application to tailwaters simulates the important physical processes and is straightforward to apply. The modified equation and von Neumann analyses provide insight into the effects of numerical parameters theta, ..delta..x, and ..delta..t upon stability and dissipative and dispersive behavior of the solution, but the Hirt analysis is found to yield incorrect phase relationships. The capability and accuracy of the model are enhanced when physical diffusion of a river wave is balanced by numerical diffusion in the model. Field studies were conducted in two greatly different tailwaters to assess our understanding of large-scale, rapidly varying flow waves. The accurate simulation of waves having wide-ranging amplitudes, shapes, periods, and base flows attests to the soundness of both the physical basis of the model and the numerical solution technique. These studies reveal that diffusion of short-period waves in natural, free-flowing rivers is significant and that inertia is negligible.","","","","","","United States","1984-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The expediency of using calculations of dimension chains coupled with the probability method has been previously described for determining the possible accuracy of assembling turbines. The possible misalignment of the necks of the turbine and generator shafts with prescribed tolerances is determined. A comparison of the calculated value with the permissible value makes it possible to establish beforehand the need to use a compensator to reduce the volume of finishing works when correcting the shaft line during assembly. The practice currently being used of assigning the wobble tolerances of a turbine shaft neck based on summation of part of the errors by the maximum-minimum method leads to overestimated values, which are artificially reduced by introducing additional conditions. Calculation of the wobbing by probabilistic summation of all manufacturing tolerances shows that even with the use of the maximum accuracy capabilities of machining equipment, the field of scatter of the amount of displacement of the axes considerably exceeds the standards established on the basis of assembly and operating experience. The main component of shaft wobble occurs from nonparallelism of the mated planes of the thrust bearing parts relative to the datum surface to which the shaft flange is connected. It is not possible to dispense with combined boring of holes in the flange connections of the turbine and generator shafts. 14 references, 3 figures, 2 tables.","","","","","","United States","1984-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrotech.

Other functions include power and navigation and could include irrigation. A 200 m high concrete gravity dam, currently being considered, would be located in the lower reach of the famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River in Hubei and Sichuan Provinces. The reservoir will store about 70 x 10 to the 9th cu m and extend upstream about 780 km. The proposed powerplant would have an installed capacity of 25,000 MW, consisting of twenty-five 1000-MW units. The Three Gorge Project, when constructed, would be the largest water resource project anywhere on earth. Beneficial effects include elimination of flooding along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a substantial increase in much needed electric power for south and central China, and creation of a large body of water which could be used for aquaculture. Consideration is also being given to diverting water to the North China Plain, one of the most important agricultural areas of China. Major adverse impacts include relocation of more than 2 million people for the reservoir area; loss of habitat for many kinds of Yangtze River aquatic life, including the unique Chinese sturgeon; and the possibility of reducing nutrient input to the downstream and estuarine fisheries.

The planned generating capacity of 12,600 MW will make the Itaipu plant the world's largest. It will employ the most powerful hydrogenerators and turbines yet built, the world's largest concentration of 500-kilovolt gas-insulated switchgear, the highest dc transmission voltages and power--600 kV and 6300 MW--ever used, about 1000 kilometers of 765-kV ac transmission, and an extensive computer-based digital supervisory system in which continuous diagnostic evaluation of equipment is emphasized. To maintain national standards, nine generators will operate at 60 hertz for Brazil and nine at 50 hertz for Paraguay. Initially, any excess electricity available from the Paraguay generators will be routed to Brazil, but Paraguay is ultimately expected to share in half the Itaipu generation. The paper discusses the plant from its original feasibility studies to the newly created technologies which its size necessitated. The environmental impact on forests, farmlands and wildlife resulting from the construction of the Itaipu dam and the loss of the 1400 square kilometers which it flooded--including the popular Seven Waterfalls--is addressed. References to other papers as well as a symposium on the Itaipu project are cited.","","","Itaipu Binacional International Engineering Co.","","","United States","1983-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Spectrum; (United States); Journal Volume: 20:8","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 46-52","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: IEESA","10.1109/MSPEC.1983.6369963","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5427054","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5427054","","IEEE Spectrum; (United States)","","20:8"

The concept of prefabricating standardized, hydroelectric powerhouses at shipyards, transporting them along the inland waterways and installing them at navigation dams without powerhouses was examined for the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation system. It was found that construction costs for the float-in design was very close to those of conventional sitebuilt design. Experience at Greenup Dam on the Ohio River where a float-in powerhouse has been installed indicated that construction time could be reduced if the float-in design was used. This time saving, use of standardized designs and construction of the float-in module at a shipyard may offer advantages that should be examined in more detailed when the power potential of the nation's low navigation dams is assessed.","","","Albert H.

It is suggested that this pattern may be characteristic of large-scale development projects in remote areas where the time lags involved in obtaining environmental data, beyond the simply descriptive information, are such that engineering plans would proceed, for economic reasons, without such environmental data as a planning input. Some environmental and social impact case studies are presented in this paper with regard to the LaGrande Complex phase of the James Bay development. The environmental impact case study involves the subsystem of estuarine fisheries and the effect on it of changes in the flow regime of the LaGrande River, the relocation of the first dam (LG-1) on the LaGrande, saltwater encroachment up the river during the filling of the second dam (LG-2), and the changes in the thermal regime of the river. The social impact case study examines the effect of the road network associated with the hydro development, on the land tenure system of the native Cree Indians of the area. The behavior of developers, as they optimize their engineering plans over the years to develop as much power as is feasible, is contrasted with the behavior of the organizations representing the native peopleof the area, first opposing the project but later giving up the aboriginal title to the land in exchange for some legally recognized rights, and subsequently making additional concessions from their established rights in exchange for various community benefits. It is argued that this process has been resulting in an incremental erosion of the land and resource base of the Cree Indian people.","","","Brock Univ., St. Catharines, Ontario","","","United States","1981-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Four categories of overt response were recorded during case tests, ranging from maintenance activity to severe flight. More than 80 percent (n=667) of the observed goats elicited some form of behavioral stress-response, with 33 percent (n=265) displaying a severe flight response to local rock or plant cover. Multiple regression analysis inferred goat responses to be statistically independent of the time of year, type, and vertical orientation of disturbance and group size. As expected, significant correlations (p less than or equal to 0.05) existed between distance of disturbance, geographic area, cover availability, and degree of awareness. Responses were stimulated primarily by auditory and secondarily by visual cues. Repeated aerial and ground follow-up surveys documented temporary range abandonment and changing observability indices (habitat use and activity patterns) associated with areas of intense exploration activity. The assessed data offer mitigation possibilities and enable formulation of management guidelines to lessen project impacts during future exploration, construction, and operation phases.","","","Mar-Terr Enviro Research Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environ.

Tube wave reflection patterns thus generated have been interpreted in terms of sediment rigidity and shear wave velocity, and these results could be compared with some independent data. It is interesting to note that, within the well section penetrating tertiary clays, the velocity of the hydraulic transients apparently was not affected by the PVC casing, which might be explained by a tight coupling between casing and clay wall. In such situations, tube waves turn out a straightforward tool for the determination of shear wave velocity and the derivation of dynamic elastic moduli of unconsolidated sediments. Further applications of the study of the distribution of seismic velocities on the dam site dealt with the consolidation history of the clays. A level of abnormally low P-wave velocities has been detected and interpreted as a gas-charged horizon which, by its coincidence with the base level of clay diapirs, might be considered to have contributed to clay flowage in past geological times. Data about maximum past burial depth, derived from shear wave velocities, turned out to be in agreement with results from consolidation testing.","","","Laboratorium voor Aardkunde, State University of Gent, Krijgslaan 281, S8, B-9000 Gent, Belgium","","","United States","1983-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophys.

Epidemiologic studies of this case showed a syndrome very similar to the two previously reported episodes. However, the exact etiology for this outbreak has not been identified. Environmental sampling was not initiated until after the cleaning was completed. Subsequent testing did not reveal any likely cause for the outbreak. The delayed onset of symptoms and the nature of the illness pointed to an infectious agent. In the absence of any suitable criteria for employee exposure evaluation, it is suggested that crews cleaning condensers under unusually dirty conditions, especially if eye or respiratory symptoms are reported, should be provided with respiratory protection.","","","","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Am.

The redds consisted of aquaria filled with a gravel mix and supplied with 4 liters of water per minute at 10 C. Cleavage eggs and embryos (the egg phases) and eleutheroembryos and pre-emergent alevins (the alevin phases) were each dewatered once for a continuous period. Egg phases were considerably more tolerant than alevin phases. Cleavage eggs tolerated one-time dewaterings up to 12 consecutive days (98% survival), the maximum exposure period. Embryos had similar tolerance when dewatered 12 consecutive days (92% survival), but survival declined to 64% and 53% when embryos were dewatered 16 and 20 consecutive days, respectively. Loss of embryos after the longer dewatering was associated with premature hatch. In contrast, eleutheroembryos tolerated only a 6-hour dewatering period (96% survival) and underwent high mortality when dewatered 48 consecutive hours. Pre-emergent alevins underwent near total mortality when dewatered 6 consecutive hours.

A stochastic dynamic programming model is employed which incorporates the physical constraints (e.g., reservoir storage limits, turbine capacity, allowable reservoir releases, etc.) of the High Aswan Dam system. Variations of monthly reservoir releases for agriculatural purposes are imposed on the system through this model, and consequent impacts on hydropower production at the high dam are studied. The results show that once operating rules are optimized for current agricultural demands an 11-20% increase in firm monthly hydropower production can be gained when summer irrigation allocations are reduced by 25%. A simple benefit/cost analysis concludes that potential benefits obtained by gains in firm monthly hydropower are nearly equal to potential losses in the agricultural sector when summer allocations are reduced by 5-10%. Operation questions raised by the introduction of a new emergency flood control spillway at Toshka are addressed. Recommendations are made for the operating guidelines of the high dam releases in light of these results.","","","","","","United States","1982-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Of the five different types of objective functions used in the models, two were clearly superior to the others. One of these requires trial and error fitting of a multiparameter objective function; the other does not.

Application is made to the California Central Valley Project (CVP).The five purposes (benefits), treated as objectives here in the multiobjective optimization, include (1) hydropower production, (2) fish protection, (3) water quality maintenance, (4) water supply, and (5) recreation. The constraint method is used to develop the trade-offs while a specially modified linear programing and dynamic programing algorithm is used for optimization. Noninferior sets can be obtained with each benefit parameterized singly and in various combinations. Two sets of monthly historical streamflows, one set corresponding to a drought year and the other set to an excess water year, are used to develop the corresponding noninferior sets. These procedures provide guidance for allocating the total benefits derived from a region's water resources and for operating the available system within all statutory, contractual, and other applicable constraints. A very high degree of decomposition of the typically large multiple purpose, multiple facility operation problem is made possible by the above technique, resulting in a rapid delineation of the noninferior policy set. The decision maker participates at various stages of the analysis and can request more or less detail with regard to the noninferior set.

Bedload and typical bed material (subpavement) size distributions are observed to be similar; it follows that the coarse half of the subpavement moves through a reach at a rate near that of the fine half. Since coarser grains are intrinsically less mobile than fine grains, it follows that some mechanism must act to nearly equalize mobility. It is hypothesized that the pavement seen in gravel bed streams at low flow is in fact in place during typical transport events capable of moving all available sizes. This pavement can provide the equalizing mechanism by exposing proportionally more coarse grains to the flow. Field data are used to quantify this concept and to develop a predictive relation for river pavement. The model indicates that pavement should be absent in most sand bed streams, in agreement with observation.","","","","","","United States","1982-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Records for 327 events were obtained; 10 of these events, each recorded on four or more stations, were analyzed to determine stress drops. Depths for the 10 events ranged from 0.5 to 1.4 km. Fault plane orientations were calculated from an inversion of the body wave displacements; individual radiation pattern corrections were applied in calculating the moments at each station. Final estimates of seismic moment were obtained from the individual estimates of the source radius, and stress drop was then calculated once from the final estimates of seismic moment and source radius for each event. Moments of the 10 digitally recorded earthquakes ranged from 2.5 x 10/sup 17/ to 2.7 x 10/sup 18/ dyne cm for the P wave data and from 4.6 x 10/sup 17/ to 4.6 x 10/sup 18/ dyne cm for the S wave data. The stress drops (S wave data only) generally ranged from about 0.2 to 4 bars. Four earthquakes were recorded by a strong motion instrument at the dam site. Magnitudes (M) for these events ranged from 2.8 to 3.0. Moments taken as averages of the values from each component ranged from 1.7 to 3.4 x 10/sup 20/ dyne cm and the stress drops from 13 to 92 bars. The variation in shear stress inferred from in situ measurements at the deeper levels indicates an inconsistency between the thrust-faulting mechanisms of the earthquakes and the state of stress which is more consistent with thrust faulting at 0.2-km depth and strike slip or normal faulting below. Thus the estimates of shear stress from in situ measurements of the same order as the stress drops of the Mapprox. =2.8-3.0 events but about 1 order of magnitude larger than the stress drops obtained for the smaller events.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California 94025","","","United States","1982-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This region contains a thick stratified sequence of Proterozoic Z and Cambrian metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. In the early to middle Paleozoic, this sequence was recrystallized and deformed under metamorphic conditions that ranged from greenschist to amphibolite facies and experienced at least two episodes of folding. The region has been intruded by late kinematic to postkinematic granitoid plutons of Silurian and Carboniferous ages and by numerous northwest trending diabase diks of Late Traissic and Early Jurassic age. The region south of Monticello Reservoir in the Carolina slate belt experienced two episodes of faulting in the late Paleozoic and/or early to middle Mesozoic. The older group of faults trends approximately east, has only small displacements, and is characterized by extensive silicifiction of the fault zones. The younger group of faults trends approximately north has experienced dip slip displacements up to 1700 m and is characterized by carbonate mineralization in the fault zones. Both sets of faults are cut by an undeformed diabase dike of Late Triassic or Early Jurassic age. The induced seismic activity around Monticello Reservoir is occurring in a heterogeneous quartz monzonite pluton of Carboniferous age. The pluton contains large enclaves of country rock and is cut by numerous, diversely oriented small faults and joint. These local inhomogeneities in the pluton together with an irregular stress field are interpreted to control the diffuse seismic activity around the reservoir. In view of the apparent absence of lengthy faults it is unlikely that a large-magnitude earthquake will occur in response to the stress and pore pressure changes related to the impoundment of Monticello Reservoir.","","","Department of Geology, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina 29208","","","United States","1982-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Analysis of these data suggests that the earthquakes were caused by an increase in subsurface pore pressure sufficiently large to trigger reverse-type fault motion on preexisting fault planes in a zone of relatively large shear stresses near the surface. The measurements indicated (1) near-critical pore pressure at depth relative to preimpoundment conditions, (3) the existence of fault planes in situ with orientations similar to those determined from composite focal plane mechanisms, and (4) in situ hydraulic diffusivities that agree well with the size of the seismically active area and time over which fluid flow would be expected to migrate into the zone of seismicity. Our physical model of the seismicity suggests that infrequent future earthquakes will occur at Monticello Reservoir as a result of eventual pore fluid diffusion into isolated zones of low permeability. Future seismic activity at Monticello Reservoir is expected to be limited in magnitude by the small dimensions of the seismogenic zones.","","","U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California 94025","","","United States","1982-08-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

A mathematical programing methodology is proposed to examine the relationship between biological instream flow needs (IFN) and more traditional water project objectives, such as water yield, flood control, reservoir recreation, or economic efficiency. This optimization approach combines the linear decision rule (LDR) modeling technique with an objective function representing the value of reservoir releases to downstream fisheries. The IFN performance objective is based on an index of physical habitat conditions called weighted usable area (WUA) which has been developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Data from a multipurpose reservoir in central Illinois have been used to demonstrate the application of the nonlinear programing model and a heuristic solution algorithm employing piecewise linearization of the habitat objective functions and linear programing.","","","","","","United States","1982-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The procedure can be applied to any multipurpose multiunit reservoir system with two general types of linkage: normal channel flow for reservoir releases and pipelines or pumping canals. Thus each reservoir could be connected to every other reservoir, and each could receive releases from any or all other reservoirs as dictated by a particular system configuration. A two-level solution algorithm is proposed. A solution can be obtained for a reservoir system with few purposes (flood control, power production, irrigation, water supply, and water quality enhancement) and random inflows and demands. The random inflows and demands are represented by conditional distribution functions. The objective function of economic efficiency, representing the tradeoff between benefits and risks embodied by a risk-loss function, is included in the present approach. The reliability programming model is nonlinear and can be split into two models: search model and special linear programming model. The procedure is illustrated using a portion of the Red River system in Oklahoma and Texas, a system of three multipurpose reservoirs. The three reservoirs individually satisfy purposes (flood protection hydroelectric power generating, water supply, and water quality enhancement, and two of the reservoirs work together to satisfy additional water requirements (flood control and water quality enhancement downstream).

An optimization of the annual Mediterranean water inflows, taking into account the high variability of the remaining natural inflows to the Dead Sea, is carried out by applying a stochastic dynamic programing algorithm to maximize the discounted expected value of the plant benefits.

Frequency distributions of water depth and velocity are presented both singly and jointly for each discharge; the methods used provide much more information on the changing character of the river than is provided by conventional hydraulic geometry relations. As discharge increases, existing channels become wider, deeper, and faster and frequency merge to become a single-larger channel. However, additional channels are generated with the same characteristics as those existing at lower discharges, and the total number of channels at a cross-section remains constant. Hence the increase of water surface area tends to be by addition of faster, deeper water to a constant area of shallow, slow water (whose location in the river bed changes). This process has the major implication for instream uses such as salmonid spawning in that the area suitable for these uses may remain constant over a wide range of flows. In some respects, then, the braided river is morphologically more stable than a single-thread river.","","","Water and Soil Science Centre, Christchurch, New Zealand","","","United States","1982-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

The costly power push, requiring the largest construction effort in Guatemala's modern history, plays a critical role for the future. When all five Pelton-wheel turbines are spinning late next year, their output will more than double electricity production in Central America's poorest, most populous country.

An intense burst of seismicity accompanied the second burst of seismicity accompanied the second stage of filling of the reservoir from 120 to 200 m during August to December 1976. Hypo-central locations and fault plane solutions determined using data from a 10-station telemetered network surrounding the reservoir show the activity to be concentrated on a series of narrow, planar fault zones near the central basin and on more diffuse zones along the upstream edges of the reservoir. The activtiy extends to depths of 8 km and appears to be confined within the upper plate of the Ionakhsh thrust, a listric fault which outcrops 1 km north of the dam. The dominant mode of deformation in the post-Paleozoic sediments of the Tadjik Depression is thrusting. Fault plane solutions for the induced seismicity show short segments of strike slip and thrust faulting for the most intense activity near the central basin and normal and thrust faulting along the upstream edges of the reservoir. None of the fault zones delineated by the induced seimicity corresponds to faults mapped at the surface, while none of the surface faults mapped in the reservoir area has shown an increase in seismicity. The spatial distribution of seismicity within the active zones is in general agreement with that expected from models of the changes in strength associated with reservoir loading. The temporal distrubition of seismicity shows a migration outward from the center of the reservoir, probably associated with diffusion of pore pressure.","","","Lamont-Dohery Geological Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964","","","United States","1982-06-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The results indicate that turbine-pumps provide significant advantages. They are simple to install, operate, and maintain. The pump tested can operate at efficiencies up to 87%, covering 30 to 60 ft of head, and flow rates up to 600 cfs. On the basis of cost per kilowatt hour, the reverse pump is competitive with a tubular turbine, and better than a Kaplan turbine. Capital investment for a pump is smaller than for a turbine. In cases where water can be impounded, a reverse pump can attain full water utilization. (The previous analysis was based on run of river operations.) A relatively small plant of 336 kW can provide power at a cost of 3.8 cents per kWh, which is lower than the units discussed above. When a small scale hydro power developer is limited by the amount of capital he can raise, the reverse pump arrangement should become attractive.","","","","","","United States","1982-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Compressed Air; (United States); Journal Volume: 87:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 20-22","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: COAIB","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6669264","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6669264","","Compressed Air; (United States)","","87:3"

Recent work indicates that these mortalities may be considerably less than 100% for some fish species in the early life stages. Point estimates of the entrainment mortality fraction have been developed based on probabilistic arguments, but the precision of these estimates has not been studied beyond the simple statistical test of the null hypothesis that no entrainment mortality exists. The ability to detect entrainment mortality is explored as a function of the sample sizes (numbers of organisms collected) at the intake and discharge sampling stations of a power plant and of the proportion of organisms found alive in the intake samples (intake survival). Minimum detectable entrainment mortality, confidence interval width, and type II error (probability of accepting the null hypothesis of no entrainment mortality when there is mortality) are considered. Increasing sample size and/or decreasing sampling mortality will decrease the minimum detectable entrainment mortality, confidence interval width, and type II error for a given level of type I error. The results of this study are considered in the context of designing useful monitoring programs for determining the entrainment mortality fraction. Preliminary estimates of intake survival and the entrainment mortality fraction can be used to obtain estimates of the sample size needed for a specified level of confidence interval width or type II error. Final estimates of the intake survival and the entrainment mortality fraction can be used to determine the minimum detectable entrainment mortality and the type II error.","","","Oak Ridge National Lab., TN","","","United States","1982-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Environ.

At fixed time intervals cover slips with their biofilm were removed from the pile, stained with crystal violet, and mounted on microscope slides. The absorbances of the slides were measured at 590 nm and plotted against time to give microbial biofilm development. From calibration experiments a staining time of 1 min and a rinse time of 10 min in a tap water flow (3 cm s/sup -1/) were considered sufficient. When an analysis of variance was performed on biofilm development data, 78% of the total variance was found to be due to random natural effects; the rest could be explained by experimental effects. The absorbance values correlated well with protein N, dry weight, and organic weight in two biofilm experiments, one with a biofilm with a high (75%) and one with a low (approx.25%, normal) inorganic content.

The method consists of rewriting the stochastic nonlinear optimization problem of two state variables which are solved by dynamic programming. The release policy obtained with this method for reservoir is a function of the water content of that reservoir and of the total amount of potential energy stored in the downstream reservoirs. The method is applied to a power system of four reservoirs, and the results obtained are compared to the true optimum. 16 refs.","","","Hydro-Que, Varennes, Can","","","United States","1981-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Tests performed to determine the efficiency and parameters of the basic equipment for electrical braking devices and to investigate the electromechanical transient processes and to compare experimental and calculated results are described. It was found that the reliability of operation and the speed of the power portion of the electric braking device on generator voltage is fairly high. The activation time and shutoff time of the resistors without accounting for the detection portion of the control scheme does not exceed 0.04 s. A significant change in resistances of the resistors from the moment of installation of the braking device, even without activation under load was found. This results in a need during operation to monitor the resistances of the resistors and, if necessary, correct the controlling effects from the braking device. Calculations and experimental studies confirmed the fairly high efficiency of the braking devices of hydroelectric generators at the Zeiskaya Hydroelectric Power Plant under conditions of the existing scheme for power transmission. Similar devices can be recommended for use at power plants where there is a severe problem with regard to dynamic stability.

The Gulf Stream core lies only about 20 miles east of Miami here its near-surface water reaches velocities of 4.3 miles per hour. Attention is called to the estimate that the energy available in the current of the Gulf Stream adjacent to Florida is approximately equivalent to that generated by 25 1,000-megawatt power plants. It is also contended that this power could be produced at competitive prices during the 1980s using large turbines moored below the ocean surface near the center of the Stream.

Polymorphism at the Mdh-B locus, encoding supernatant malate dehydrogenase, indicates that populations within 57 km of the dam are distinctive from other regional populations and possess a unique Mdh-B allele, have significantly higher levels of heterozygosity at the Mdh-B locus, represent a homogeneous set that have significantly different Mdh-B zygotic frequencies from other regional populations, and have significantly different Mdh-B zygotic proportions than would be expected under a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Increased levels of heterozygosity in fish within 57 km of the dam were correlated with discharge-associated fluctuations in water temperature at sampling stations.","","","North Texas State Univ., Denton","","","United States","1981-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans.

Since many of the technically ''easy'' large-scale hydropower sites have already been developed, recent attention has focused on small-scale (less than 15-MW potential) sites. An attempt has been made to identify and develop a statistical method of determining the hydropower potential of watersheds in California that in area are directly under 500 square mi from generally available watershed characteristics. Streamflow records, necessary for the traditional methods of estimating hydropower potential are often only short term or unavailable for many watersheds. By relating hydropower potential to watershed characteristics other than streamflow, estimates can be made regardless of whether streamflow records are available.","","","Univ. of California, Los Angeles","","","United States","1981-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It serves as an effective communication tool between analysts and policymakers, helping them understand the implication of policy recommendations to increase small-hydropower development. Only four of the factors affecting development are included in the model: economics, licensing, construction, and retirement. From a financial point of view, the most promising developers are municipalities and investor-owned utilities. In the year 2000, it may be feasible to develop sites costing approximately double the present costs. Small-scale hydropower will generally be developed now only if developers are willing to accept risks. The inflationary effects of licensing and the complexity of the process might be the major disincentives associated with licensing.","","","","","","United States","1981-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The reservoir lies along the Talas-Fergana fault, a major tectonic feature of central Asia. The nature of Cenozoic movements along the fault is in debate; however, there is considerable evidence of present-day right-lateral movement. The region is one of moderate to high seismicity. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in 1946, approximately 65 km from the dam, near the intersection of the Talas-Fergana fault and Chatkal ranges. Construction of the dam was completed in 1975 and by late 1979 the water level in the reservoir reached three fourths its final planned depth. Low-magnitude, induced earthquakes began as the water level first exceeded 100 m in late 1977. A microearthquake survey using portable instruments was carried out in July--August 1978 and a seven-station telemetered network was installed in October 1978. The largest of the induced earthquakes has been of magnitude 2.5; the activity is in the immediate vicinity of the dam at very shallow depths (2--5 km) and is related to water level. Preliminary analysis of data gathered during 1978--1979 shows a zone of activity, extending to 5 km depth, supporting geological evidence for an active reserve fault beneath the dam and parallel to the canyon of the Naryn River. Where the reservoir crosses the Talas-Fergna fault, 15 km upstream from the dam, the water level has not yet reached 100 m and seismicity along the Talas-Fergana has not shown any significant change related to filing of the reservoir.","","","Lamont-Dohety Geological Observatory of Columbia University, Palisades, New York 10964","","","United States","1981-01-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Nine genera of parasites, 19 species of bacteria, and one species of virus infected the fish. River fish had no clinical signs of disease resulting from the pathogens. In the hatchery some deaths were caused by bacterial infections, but many moribund fish were not infected. Bacterial isolations from river fish were most frequent in fish collected near the dam and near the date of lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Microscopic lesions were found in the gills, liver, spleen, and trunk kidney of many of the fish that did not have bacterial infections. Rainbow trout were most affected by the conditions in the tailwater and hatchery, and brook trout and yellow perch were least affected. Occurrence of lesions that indicated exposure to a toxicant corresponded to increases in Fe and Mn concentrations of the water, but not to Cu concentrations. Mn levels in liver were high compared to published reports. Cu concentrations in liver varied with fish species, and those of brook trout were lower than published values for this species exposed to no effect Cu levels. Liver concentrations of Zn and Cd did not indicate exposure to high levels of these metals. Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, and DO concentrations of the tailwater were levels that indicated possible harmful effects to fish. Acclimation to the tailwater conditions may have allowed survival of fish. Low pH, oxidation-reduction potential, and DO concentrations, and high metal concentrations resulted from release of hypolimnetic water from the impoundment.

The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is participating in screening studies which evaluate the unique characteristics of specific sites and recommend technical improvements for better water control and a higher output. Pumped-hydro facilities are increasing, with new attention going to underground storage as new aboveground sites become harder to find. The institutional hurdles of licensing and regulation, interference with recreational and shoreline activities, down-stream water temperature changes, fish migration, and insurance are often in conflict.

Evaluation of this problem requires both an understanding of the physics of the situation and practical knowledge of a number of alternative techniques for analysis. These range from complex, exacting procedures commonly used in the biomedical analytical laboratory to simple, portable methods well suited to use in the field or continuous monitoring. The authors have reviewed and refined several of these methods, have developed others, and have compared relevant techniques in the field and laboratory.","","","","","","United States","1980-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans.

With no free money available, developers are moving ahead on their own to develop small hydro equipment. Although it abandoned construction support, the DOE has concentrated on sponsoring feasibility studies. The studies are financed by a three-year, $30-million program of forgivable loans to develop small-scale hydro. If a study shows that a project is not feasible, the loan does not have to be paid. Traditionally, small-hydro generating plants have been built and operated by electric utilities or by municipal governments. An interesting trend in the recent surge of small-hydro growth is the emergence of the independent hydro entrepreneur. Some examples of small-head hydro projects are discussed in the article. While the typical small hydro project has a capacity of 1 megawatt, some of the new projects plan for 10 to 15 megawatts of power from low-head hydro.

Prior to the gizzard shad introduction, the growth of smallmouth bass was generally poorer than that reported for the mid-Atlantic region. Large drawdowns (9 m per day, 15.6 m per week) may have increased the vulnerability of gizzard shad by concentrating both prey and predator. In the lower reservoir, where water levels fluctuated irregularly and much less (up to 1 m per day), smallmouth bass growth was not greatly improved following the introduction of gizzard shad.","","","Muddy Run Ecological Lab., Drumore, PA","","","United States","1980-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans.

Within a fragmented, government-owned utility system, there is emerging a grand design which will create the Guri hydro project as the main source of the country's electricity supply in the closing years of the century. Utilizing the OPEC country's oil and natural gas and the newly discovered coal deposits, new fossil-fuel power plants are being added at Tacoa, Planta Centro, and Arrega to bridge the electricity demand until the Guri project starts adding electricity to the system in 1982. With electricity demand increasing at a nine percent annual rate, Guri is intended to serve as a base-load plant to supply the whole country via a multi-branch 800 kV transmission system. It is a single dam with two possibly three, power houses on a major tributary of the Orinoco river. The master plan is based on three elements. First the crest height of the water will be raised and a second power house will be installed to add 7120 MW to the present installed capacity. Second is a similar operation at Macagua on the Orinoco which will add 1400 MW to that plant's installed capacity. The third part of the plan involves the construction of at least one new power station between the existing dams. A site for that plant has not been chosen. Construction techniques and progress are highlighted in the article.

It is not known how correct such an opinion is, or what is the true balance of losses and reproduction of zooplankton in the forebays and after bays of hydroelectric stations. However, hydroelectric plants of a new type, pumped-storage plants, have been constructed in recent years and others are planned for the Dnieper reservoirs. The operational principle and purpose of these plants is that they employ special vertical turbine-electric pumps that pump water at night from the reservoirs into pumped-storage facilities at high levels, and then release this water during daytime peaks through pipes to the turbines that generate additional electric power. Such pumped-storage plants are planned, in particular, as part of the Danube-Dnieper water economy complex and for some reservoirs in the North European regions of the USSR.","","","Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev, USSR","","","United States","1980-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrobiol.

New dams constructed on the Snake River adversely affected survival and delayed migrations of juveniles. Significant loses of juveniles in 1972 and 1973 were directly responsible for record-low returns of adults to the Snake River in 1974 and 1975. Major causes of mortality were passage through turbines at dams, predation, and delays in migration through reservoirs in low-flow years, and prolonged exposure to lethal concentrations of dissolved gases caused by spilling at dams during high-flow years. Migrations of juvenile steelhead were generally later than those of chinook salmon and generally coincided with maximum river discharge. Lack of river runoff in 1973 caused a significant number of steelheads to stop migrating and to hold over in reservoirs. Mortality of chinook salmon and steelhead resulting from new dams has differed with respect to area and cause. Magnitude and composition of seaward migration has changed from 3 to 5 million wild fish in the mid-1960's to 8 to 10 million fish of both wild and hatchery origin in the 1970's.","","","National Marine Fisheries Service, Seattle, WA","","","United States","1979-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans.

Increased energy production will have an impact on the environment. Although at present there is insufficient information for precise forecasts, meteorologists and hydrologists will be able to make reasonable assumptions for the future. Human use of energy is strongly influenced by variations of weather. Such systems as electric power transmission networks, shipping of hydrocarbons by sea, and pipelines for the transportation of large quantities of oil and gas, are all particularly sensitive to weather and climate. The meteorologist provides basic data on weather and climate to facilitate energy exploration. The new energy resources addressed in this article are solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear. The World Meteorological Organization's Executive Committee established a set of priorities in dealing with energy problems. This paper also briefly examines the burden imposed on global energy resources.","","","","","","United States","1979-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: EDIS; (United States); Journal Volume: 10:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9-14","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: EDISD","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5705584","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5705584","","EDIS; (United States)","","10:4"

Feasibility studies have provided limited information so far, but a 1977 survey by the Corps of Engineers estimated that existing dams could generate 54,600 MW. The study did not differentiate between low and high-head dams, but it is assumed that most non-generating dams would be low-head (less than 20 meters high). An earlier report by the Federal Energy Regulatory commission estimated a potential of 80,000 MW if existing and new sites are developed. Economic feasibility is site-specific and is now being studied by the Corps. The rising prices of conventional fuels are expected to improve the economic feasibility of small hydro - especially the economic relief available if oil imports can be reduced, but Federal participation is needed to provide the institutional and financial support.","","","","","","United States","1979-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Public Power; (United States); Journal Volume: 37:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 38, 42, 51","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: PUPOA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6164159","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6164159","","Public Power; (United States)","","37:3"

Because it is a net consumer of energy and its function is to make better use of other energy producing plants it is clear that there must be a practical limit to the proportion of pumped-stoage plant which can be accommodated on the system. A 3-stage method has been adopted. The first stage is a feasibility assessment, which gives an indication of the quantity of pumped storage that could be accepted on the system. The other two stages involve a more detailed examination of the effect of pumped storage on long-term system security using Monte Carlo simulation and a study of total generating costs, including both capital and running costs. The methods are appropriate for assessing the characteristics of future pumped-storage developments on power systems with a significant proportion of existing hydroelectric and pumped-storage plants. They should also be applicable to systems containing very little hydraulic plant.","","","North of Scotland Hydroelectric Board, Edinburgh, Scotland","","","United States","1979-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Proc.

Globally, there are 3 main avenues along which the development of hydro power can proceed: proliferation of small hydro sites - up to 10 MW - to meet local energy demands in isolated communities; development of pumped storage and other modification of existing river sites to increase capacity for operation on mid- and peak-load duty and to provide back-up storage; and development of large hydro power sites in remote areas to supply base-load energy for the Third World countries and for export to areas of high energy consumption presently using fossil fuel.

China's total generating capacity is generally an unknown quantity in the rest of the world, but an educated guess would put it currently at about 70,000 MW--perhaps even more, depending on installations after 1972. One member of the delegation estimated China's hydro now at 10% of total installed capacity. Chia Yun-Chen, secretary of the China Coal Society says that the only major problem is acquiring the ability to tap the resources. There is much coal, but how to mine it is a problem. There is not much hydro generation but there are available water resources, the 3,400 mile long Yangtze River. There are no operating nuclear plants, but some are under construction.

There are more than 2,800 dams in the six states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. But only 200 of them produce electricity, many far below their full capacity. At the other 2,600 dams, water simply pours over the top, wasting the potential for efficient use of the energy thus created. In the summer of 1977, President Carter ordered the US Army Corps of Engineers to survey the capacity of existing dams. The Army engineers concluded that New England's hydroelectric output of 4.5 billion kWh per year could be more than tripled just by harnessing its smaller dams and increasing the capacity of its existing hydroelectric plants. With no new dams or lakes, there could be enough electricity to meet all the needs of a million people. A boost for the development of small dams has just come from Congress's passage of a three-part legislative package which will provide low-interest Federal loans to encourage the redevelopment of existing small dams of less than 15 MW of capacity. The possible development of sites in New England is described. The projects include the large-scale Dickey-Lincoln School Lakes project on the St. John River in Maine; a new hydroelectric project in Springfield, Vermont; The Goodrich Falls Project, New Hampshire; and a power station in Franklin, New Hampshire. Sustained periods of rainless weather can reduce the capability of hydro to supply power, but water stored behind dams can be released to create a near-instantaneous surge of power when needed for times of peak power demand.

The project's abundant supply of economically-priced electric power would help stabilize New England's electric rates, lessen New England's dependence on imported oil, and mean jobs for the area. Of 20 alternatives examined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, none matches its peaking-power capability or its economic feasibility. The project would consist of Dickey Dam on the upper St. John River in the village of Dickey in the town of Allagash and 11 miles downstream, in the Town of St. Francis, would be the Lincoln School Dam.

These provisions are critical in that, in the years ahead, the most-valuable and versatile electrical energy availability will be that generated by falling water. The preference right of public agencies to recapture or take over 50-year licenses originally issued to private power companies is, in the view of public power lawyers, spelled out in Sections 7(a) and 15 of the Federal Power Act of 1920. This interpretation is disputed by attorney who represent the investor-owned companies who own these franchises. Two recapture cases at issue before FERC are: a site on the Weber River, brought by the City of Bountiful, Utah, against Utah Power and Light Co. and the right to hydro sites on the Mokelumne River in California, brought by the City of Santa Clara against Pacific Gas and Electric Co.

Since screens act as a diversion device and a screening medium, backup screens for removing debris and non-diverted fish, such as required behind louver systems, are not necessary in screen systems. Louvers require an approach-to-bypass ratio of 1.0:1.5 for efficient operation, while screens are efficient at a 1:1 ratio. Bypass flows and pumping costs are lower in screen systems.

The SEBJ is responsible for the hydroelectric development of rivers of the Quebec side of James Bay, which is the southern extension of Hudson Bay. To meet the growth of Quebec's electricity needs, SEBJ has undertaken the development of the La Grande River hydroelectric resources. The complex, one of the largest hydroelectric developments in the world, began construction in 1973 and work will continue until 1985. The project will have a total installed capacity of 10,440,000 kW, with an annual energy production of 68.4 billion kWh. The project includes the construction of four generating stations and will involve the partial diversion of the Caniapiscau and Eastmain Rivers. The complex's six reservoirs and forebays, with a total capacity of 3366 billion cubic feet, will require the construction of about 150 dikes and dams, involving a total volume of fill of 200 million cubic yards.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Diesel Gas Turbine Prog.; (United States); Journal Volume: 44:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 10-13","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: DGTPA","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","5253283","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5253283","","Diesel Gas Turbine Prog.; (United States)","","44:1"

For the tests, the rotor was established along the longitudinal axis relative to phase A. The rotor position was determined from the maximum transformation coefficient between the excitation winding and the stator winding during application of an industrial frequency (50 Hz) current to phase and slow turning of the rotor. The results showed that: the calculated values of hydrogenerator parameters may differ significantly from the actual values, thus experimental determination of these parameters is necessary; the electromagnetic parameters of the SVF-1690/175-64 hydrogenerator are close to the parameters of large turbogenerators, and its attenuation (damping) system is equivalent to the body, which in the calculations should be taken into consideration by several equivalent damping circuits; the frequency characteristics determined by the harmonic effect method provide all the electromagnetic parameters both for the longitudinal and transverse axes of the machine; and the methods of performance of the experiment, analysis of the data and calculation of the parameters are simple and convenient in engineering practice.","","","","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sov.

Some of these 50,000 dams once produced power, but as the initial equipment wore out and alternative sources of electrical energy became cheaper, it was not economically feasible to refurbish them. The Corps believes that if all of the dams which could produce power were reactivated, or if new generating capacity were installed, they could supply a total of 54,600,000 kW and generate almost 160 billion kWh. It would take 265 million barrels of oil each year to generate that amount of power. The total energy shortage can never be solved with these small hydro projects. More massive projects are needed. However, many cities and public utilities could install some generating units at existing dams and produce energy at less cost than that of alternatives. These are the advantages: the natural resource is already there, and it is a renewable one. There is usually no environmental impact--no air or water pollution. And the process is clean, quiet, small scale, and unobtrusive, and frequently takes place near a population center, eliminating the need for long or high-voltage transmission lines. Technology of generating hydroelectricity exists, and in highly sophisticated form. For small hydroelectric projects at existing dams, generation can easily be achieved in five years from the conception date.","","","Tudor Engineering Co., San Francisco","","","United States","1978-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Mil.

Major water diversions from Niagara Falls are necessary for power production. Flow is allocated by the 1950 Niagara Treaty which is intended to maximize power benefits and preserve and enhance the scenic falls spectacle. This paper examines the extent to which the Treaty objectives have been achieved. Based on analyses of government documents, engineering data, and falls-viewing patterns, it is concluded that the 1950 Treaty led to enhancement of the falls spectacle and increased power generation. But significant additional power diversions probably are attainable without adverse effect upon the existing falls spectacle. Reducing daytime summer Horseshoe Falls flow and scheduling spring and autumn flow according to viewing patterns are possible means of increasing power diversions. Existing generating facilities could use considerably more water and the value of additional Niagara hydroelectricity is very high in terms of generation-cost savings over alternative power sources. Because of the cultural importance of the falls. Treaty modifications to permit increased power diversions are not recommended without prior public opinion sampling and on-site viewing experiments. These findings highlight the need for more careful study before long-term international agreements are concluded and illustrate the need for more flexible treaty arrangements to permit periodic adjustments for changing conditions.","","","Univ. of Waterloo, Canada","","","United States","1977-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Water Resour.

Concerns that the Soviet units would not operate properly were dispelled by the good performance and ended, at least temporarily, a series of disputes. Hydro selected the low-bidding Soviet company in order to get bulb-type turbines, which can be arranged compactly and have better operating efficiency at a low operating head. Five more units are scheduled for production next year. The Jenpeg project is one of the first major Soviet efforts on this continent and the first bulb-type turbine. Difficulties between Canada and the Soviet Union arose because of the project's delays, many of which resulted from the Soviet preference for on-site construction and their unfamiliar standards and philosophies. A review of the controversies reveals public disagreement within the country over how the utility and government should function during development projects.

Therefore, changes in water quality, erosion, fluctuation in water temperature and water flow, and eutrophication must be studied in planning future hydroelectric installations. The objectives of this paper are to describe briefly the reported physical, chemical, and hydrodynamic changes associated with hydroelectric dams and to relate some of these changes to the fish and benthic communities of the lower Susquehanna River. Several aspects of the impacts of hydroelectric projects are briefly considered and changes in the lower Susquehanna River, the site of four large dams, are evaluated in light of disruption of the upstream runs of the previously existing migratory fishes. Changes in the structure of the benthic community are also analyzed based on literature reviewed. 46 references.","","","Lawler, Matusky, and Skelly Engineers, Tappan, NY","","","United States","1977-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

First proposed in 1959, the project is now hoped to be operational by the mid-1980s. Lobbying activities against the dam will be discontinued by Boston Edison and 16 other electric companies. Support of the dam as economically feasible and beneficial comes from the Army Corps of Engineers (which will operate the project), the Department of Interior (which will market the power), members of Congress, and the increasing public demand for power. Opposition from the private companies was primarily in response to the preference clause giving government-operated utilities first chance to buy the power. The private companies fear that they will not get their fair share as demand grows. The project, with an anticipated cost of $668 million for construction and transmission facilities, will become part of the regional New England Power Pool.

Nigeria's largest project is Kanji, which will have an 836-MW capacity in 1978 and includes navigational locks and reservoirs. A series of low dams and locks on the Niger is needed to cover rapids, reefs, rock outcroppings, and sand banks and allow barge traffic on a regulated flow of water. The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) plans six more projects which, combined with Nigeria's oil and gas reserves, will provide substantial electric power.

The Malta River will be blocked by the 200-meter high Koelbrein dam, which will store 200 million cubic meters of water in its reservoir. The water will travel through a short tunnel to the Galgenbichl power station, where water can be discharged into a small reservoir to be pumped back to Koelnbrein or through an 18-meter tunnel through the mountains to the Rottau power plant, which has a compensating basin to hold water for the Moellbruecke power station. May 1978 is projected for completion of the project. Between Koelmbrein and Rottau is the Goesskar reservoir, which receives water by aqueducts from neighboring streams and may be the site for a fourth power plant that would use an existing lake for a pumped storage project. Outstanding features of the complex include the height of the Koelnbrein dam, the design of Rottau pumps units, and the option of bypassing the Galgenbichl power station.

Some utilities have cut back operations in the hope that summer rains will allow them to avoid rationing. Northwest suppliers like Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) are preparing for next winter when power demand peaks in an area that is highly dependent on hydroelectric power. Curtailment plans, which must be determined by state governments, will put most of the burden on comfort and convenience use rather than industry in order to preserve jobs. BPA does not plan to export power outside its system. California, which normally buys power from BPA will have to use high-cost thermal power and pass on fuel adjustment charges to customers. Some observers feel the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is under pressure to approve earthquake standards for the Diablo Canyon plant, but the plant will not contribute power for several months after its approval. Strategies for meeting the immediate crisis include shutting off customers with interruptible power, voluntary reductions, and, as a last resort, rolling blackouts. Some California utilities expect to be able to meet demand unless the drought continues through the summer.

In order to obtain the necessary information on the influence of an inversely synchronous field on each of these generators special sensors were installed: thermocouples on the cores and the damper cage jumpers between the poles and on the steel of the pole socket, and Rogovskii bands on all the damper cores. On the active steel, on the front parts of the winding and on the structural members of the unit vibration sensors were installed for measuring the vibration in the tangential, radial and vertical directions. In addition, the vibration of the active steel was measured by a vibration probe at eight points of each of the six joints of the active steel core in the tangential and radial directions. Data on heating and vibration were recorded in varying test and load conditions. The results showed that for both turbines the greatest pole heating was recorded on the surface of the pole shoe, and that, at I/sub 2//I/sub r/ = 0.08 to 0.09, the 100 Hz vibrations of the core and the front parts are within the limits of the vibration displacements on generators in prolonged operation. I/sub 2//I/sub r/, or ratio of negative sequence current to the rated current expresses the asymmetry of the generator load. The data obtained show the allowability of asymmetry of I/sub 2//I/sub r/ = 0.1 to 0.12 for generators with a single-layer winding and the allowability of I/sub 2//I/sub r/ = 0.08 to 0.09 for generators with a two-layer winding. Thus, the generators tested with direct water cooling of the stator windings allow prolonged asymmetrical load at I/sub 2//I/sub r/ greater than or equal to 8 percent. This makes it possible to transmit 350 to 400 MW through two phases of a large unit.

The operation of hydrogenerators at significant stator vibration levels leads to serious damage to individual structural parts. This necessitates monitoring of the condition of the joints. Gaps in the stator joints on an operating generator were measured with special tensometers in order to establish quantitative relationships between the gap size and the generator condition parameters which influence the gap size. It was determined that the size of the gap in hydrogenerator stator section joints is directly related to the temperature difference between the active steel and the stator housing shelves, and that there is a quantitative relationship between the size of the joint gap, the thermal state of the stator, and the voltage on the hydrogenerator leads which permits determination of the allowable gap in stator section joints.","","","","","","United States","1977-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sov.

Competing demands on the dwindling supply of water result in a confrontation of man and nature in which human demands for water are exceeding renewability. Population growth in the Sunbelt, agricultural irrigation, energy development, industry, Indian water rights, and environmental protection laws are all vying for more water than reservoirs and wells can hold. Continued dry weather has added to the problem of sinking groundwater level and increased salinity of rivers and ground water. Development of the West reflected the settlers' perception of it as oases of settlement clustered around water supplies, both natural and artificial. Although irrigation systems had been developed by the Indians, the first serious efforts to conquer the desert followed the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the development of technology capable of rechanneling and harnessing water. Public policies governing water supply developed unevenly and were of unequal benefit. Water management programs alone can do no more than delay the need to develop new sources of water. Proposals for augmentation include costly inter-basin transfers from the Columbia, Mississippi, Alaskan and Canadian Rivers. Other possibilities include weather modification, desalination, conservation, more efficient use, and an end to Federal subsidies for irrigation so that agricultural efforts will shift to more suitable areas. 19 references.

There is the possibility in New England alone of tapping 2,600 existing dams that lack generating facilities. Environmental damage from either small-scale power plants or reservoirs would be minimal. Comparisons of new hydroelectric costs with alternative fuels show hydro to be in a poor competitive position at 1976 prices, but rising fuel prices and uncertainties over supplies can reasonably be expected to give hydro the advantage. Possibilities for cost reductions are more favorable in power plant equipment than in the dam or reservoir construction.

However, there is some doubt as to whether citizens will want to see further loss of large tracts of land. An alternative to the large hydro systems now in use is a revitalization of the thousands of small hydroelectric facilities built during the last century. There are an estimated 48,000 such dams that might be put back to work generating electricity. It is estimated that these dams, if power-generating turbines were placed on them, would produce seven times more energy than the Administration anticipates from solar heating in 1985 and almost the same amount of electricity produced by all nuclear plants in operation today. The tides could yield the energy equivalent of 560 billion kWh/year, i.e., 14% of 1969's world electricity consumption. A third major source for water power is harnessing the energy contained in the action of waves. Recent estimates have placed wave power potentials from 2700 to 89.3 million gigawatts; wave power in the year 2000 could be supplying 10% of the world's energy needs.

Although the project has been under study since the 1950s, it was not thought to be economically feasible until oil prices began to rise. The new plant at Wreck Cove will add 200 megawatts for a peak power reserve with very little environmental impact on surrounding tourist and fishing areas. The power plant will be underground and will discharge directly into the sea. Instead of a high dam, a series of four lakes is being enlarged and linked by tunnels and canals to feed into the power plant. Work has progressed smoothly at the four reservoirs, which are being enlarged by rock- or earth-fill dams. From the final surge lake, there is a 344.5-meter vertical drop to the powerhouse. Tunnel construction has encountered delays because of unstable sediments that required modifications in excavating technique. The power cavern is ready for the turbines and generators to be installed. Remote control will tie the plant into the Maritime grid system.

The model takes advantage of the current capability for efficiently converting solar energy to electrical energy and allowing hydro power to be stored. Examples are drawn of how systems can benefit by using solar power to supply electricity to the power grid during periods of high demand, while the continued storage of water in reservoirs and lakes adds no cost to the system. States and provinces that already have energy self-sufficiency can benefit most from this kind of power-augmentation system.

Because of the necessity for providing safe passage over the physical obstructions of dams, fishways were provided to permit adult fish to swim over the dams to continue their upstream migration. The large scale of fishway construction required more information on fish behavior and abilities, therefore a special laboratory for fishery-engineering research was constructed in which the reactions of anadromous fish were measured. Experiments provided data on the spatial requirements of salmon on fishways, on rates of movement of ascending fish, and on the effect of fishway slope and length on fish performance. Mortality rates for juvenile fish have been estimated at 15 percent loss per dam, thus studies were undertaken to develop practical methods of protecting young migrants at dams. Dams created other environmental stresses such as delays in migration, temperature changes, and ''nitrogen supersaturation.'' To avoid the cumulative hazards of a long series of dams, a system is being developed to collect and transport young migrants to the estuary.

A population increase in the area is redirecting power to residential and commercial uses and creating a demand for more jobs. Even BPA's preference customers, 120 utilities and federal agencies, have been warned that future growth needs can not be guaranteed. The aluminum industry, which was attracted to the area by cheap power, will be hit especially hard. The industry has initiated a request that Congress allow BPA to buy thermal power from both private and public sources to supplement hydroelectric power. A joint public and private effort is developing to begin regional planning for power mixing, which would also aid some of the fast growing utilities supplying power for irrigation. Major advantages would be lower costs for older utilities and reduced capital requirements for new facilities. After political approval is won, the BPA must still resolve the environmental barriers to introducing fossil-fuel or nuclear thermal plants to the region. With nuclear initiatives in Washington and Oregon, conservation and tax incentives will also have to be explored.

Important factors are hydrodynamic damping, which can exceed the structural damping by several orders of magnitude and the energy dissipation in the blade material. Experimental investigations with wide and independent variations in the dimensionless parameters governing the oscillatory processes were conducted to determine the damping in bending oscillations of blade profiles in water flow. The flow angle of attack and geometrical parameters of the lattice remained unchanged. The experiment was performed on the GD-1 facility at the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. The experimental procedure is described. Results show that the hydrodynamic damping of profile oscillations does depend on the profile solidity. Analysis of the data shows that the variation in hydrodynamic damping due to variation in profile solidity does not depend on the Strouhal number, but is determined only by variation in the relative profile thickness: one reason for reduction in the hydrodynamic damping with increase in profile solidity is that a more solid profile is less sensitive to variation of angle of attack.","","","Inst. of Strength of Materials, Kiev, Ukrainian SSR","","","United States","1976-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Strength Mater.

However, the head might be quite adequate for a hydraulic ram installation if in fact a suitable ram mechanism can be developed. The output from the rams might be arranged to flow directly to a surge tank which in turn would supply conventional generating sets, or a storage feature might be introduced, depending on circumstances. In most cases run-of-river sites would be developed through the use of the tunnel system, in which a tunnel would by-pass a rapids or fast water section of river. As a component of a tidal power system, the ability of the hydraulic ram to operate efficiently under very low heads makes it appear very attractive as a means of providing a supply of water to prolong the periods during which the turbines would have an adequate head for their operation. Wave energy, too could be exploited with the aid of a ram. For instance, by means of an array of check gates, high and low-level pools might be established within a suitable enclosure or caisson, with hydraulic rams arranged to be operated by the available flow from the high to the low pool, the rams delivering water to a surge tank from which, in turn, conventional turbine-generators would operate.

The 630-MW Bajina Basta plant will have two 315-MW Francis-type reversible pump-turbines operating under a head range in excess of 600 m--a good 50 m higher than at any plant now operating. As is generally acknowledged, the runner of a high-head pump-turbine is relatively flat because of low specific speed, and there is much friction loss; consequently, it is difficult to produce a high-efficiency, pump-turbine. However, improving the runner blade shape, modifying the runner sealing from a conventional single seal to a multiple seal, and making other changes resulting from introduction of an automated design method for the runner have enabled Toshiba to produce a high-efficiency design. Improved cavitation characteristics have eliminated secondary flow at the runner inlet and unstable areas have been removed. Research on construction and intensity equal to the high head or the high pressure is required. In order to accomplish this, a computer-based finite element method has been developed and is now in regular use. Using this method, it is easy to illustrate the stress and deformation analysis made on the casing, stay ring, scroll case, and the head cover.

On their tributaries there are, however, heads which have not been developed and lakes which are employed only for the annual regulation of the main river. The head of 145 m between Storjuktan and the confluence of the Juktan with the Ume River has not been exploited at all, while the 85 m head above this point as far as Storuman has been completely harnessed by plants. The mean water flow in the Juktan is 30 m/sup 3//s which, by storage in Storjuktan, is concentrated in the winter months. By diversion through a tunnel to Storuman, about 85 m of the unexploited head in the Juktan could be utilized in the three existing power plants. The head of 60 m between Storjuktan and Storuman could at the same time be exploited in a power station. The study proved that such a diversion could be advantageously combined with a pumped-storage plant. The Juktan plant will not add to the total production of energy but will require no energy. The head for generation is, in fact, so much higher than the pumping head that this compensates for the energy losses normally inherent in a pure pumped storage plant. The Juktan project thus means that approximately one third of the River Juktan's previously unexploited energy resources, before its confluence with the Ume River, will provide a valuable peak power of 335 MW. The remaining two-thirds will add 160 GWh to the annual energy production.

The project is subject to requirements and interagency agreements. A practical optimization method must address not only these requirements but also the continuing needs of day-to-day operation, and the necessity for interposing the project managers in monitoring and final decision roles. The basic technical difficulty with an optimizing algorithm for a complex water resource system is the dimensionality which can easily run into the tens of thousands of decision variables and constraints. The method being developed for the project provides the necessary decomposition and involves the project managers, assisted by an integrated group of multiple policies based on interconnected monthly, daily, and hourly models, using iterated linear programming-dynamic programming techniques.","","","Bureau of Reclamation, Sacramento, CA","","","United States","1976-04-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This model will be coupled with a daily strategy mode. A four-dimensional incremental dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize the operation of the four-reservoir system. The objective of the model is to maximize energy generation within the limits of firm water and power contracts, mandatory releases, and flood control. A unique technique given the acronym RecIP for recomputed initial policy is developed to compute the initial operating policy that is optimized.

The dictum of the Chinese economy since the later 1950s has been not only developing large modern enterprises but also small projects in the rural areas. The advantages of the intermediate approach lie in an extensive use of plentiful and cheap labor instead of expensive machinery, maximum usage of local resources and materials instead of costly imports, considerable capital savings, and easier and wider penetration of essential technologies throughout the rural areas. Small-scale developments in energy industries have been predominantly concentrated in three areas: coal mining, hydroelectricity production, and biogas generation. The advantages and shortcomings of each industry are described. The first attempts at large-scale introduction of biogas generation have been undertaken in India since the early 1960s where the total number of Gobar gas plants is to reach about 25,000 by the end of the current Five-Year Plan in 1977-78, but Chinese developments are more extensive. In the southern provinces of Szechwan alone, 30,000 units were completed by the end of 1973, with 410,000 containers completed by mid-1975.

The distribution of the parasites depended on a suitable host plus a number of environmental factors. The most important of these were currrent, temperature, water level, morphometry, development of aquatic vegetation, species diversity, abundance, biomass, distribution of zooplankton and zoobenthos, species composition of fishes, amphibians, wading birds, waterfowl, and mammals and extent of pollution by organic and inorganic matter. The considerable fluctuations of water level markedly affect the abundance of parasites.

The reservoirs have provided sites for evaluating the impact of pump storage operation on primary productivity, fisheries, and water quality. Due to the location of the dam and the dendritic nature of the basin, the effect of recycling to alleviate detrimental water quality effects caused by thermal stratification were minimal. Moreover, as might be expected, the quality of water found in the upper reservoir depends upon the quality of water being recycled from the lower impoundment. Recycling appears to enhance primary productivity rates, at least in the vicinity of the dam. Pump storage operation does not appear to detract from the fishery in either reservoir. Although comprehensive studies are still needed in many areas, the results of all studies to date indicate a net beneficial effect of pump storage operation on environmental quality.

Nearly all the species of fish present in the lower pond are now found in the upper pond. Extensive sampling in the two ponds indicates no detrimental effects of the station operation on the fishes and fisheries of Conowingo Pond. The creation of the 398.9-hectare upper impoundment serves as an area where biomass of fishes pumped up from Conowingo Pond can be increased and exploited by anglers. Wide fluctuations (up to 15 m in a weekly cycle of operation) in water level limit the reproduction of nest-building fishes in the upper pond. About 6.5 times as many fish larvae were pumped up into the upper pond as left during generation. No reliable quantitative estimates could be obtained on the percentage mortality of fishes passing through the pump-turbines. The mortality of fishes associated with the operation of the pumped storage station appears to be negligible. It is concluded that screens are not needed for the protection of fish at the Muddy Run Station. Even if a satisfactory type of screen could be installed substantial mortality due to ''gilling'' of fishes would occur. Sampling problems unique to the pumped storage project are discussed.

This whole period is typified by intensive metabolism, as a result of which the content of body-building and energy-providing substances is reduced in the muscles and liver and increased in the maturing oocytes and spermatozoa. Males and females differ appreciably both in the level of the content of the substances investigated in the muscles, liver and gonads, and in the dynamics of accumulation and expenditure.","","","State Research Inst. for Lake and River Fisheries, Volgograd","","","United States","1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Plans include a 750-kV line. The U.S.S.R. has plans for exploiting the hydroelectric potential of streams originating in the Pamir Mountains and flowing through the Republic of Tadzhikistan. The Vakhsh, one of Tadzhikistan's principal rivers, begins at an elevation of 11,800 ft. above sea level. It has a potential of 23.2 MW per mile, being unequalled even by the rivers of eastern Siberia. Plans for the Vakhsh call for construction of five hydro stations with a total generating capacity of 7,800 MW. Even larger will be eight hydro stations on the Pyandzh, which forms the boundary between Tadzhikistan and Afghanistan. Their total power is expected to be 16,000 MW, for which 500 kV, later 750-kV, lines will be required.","","","","","","United States","1967-04-24T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Electr.

The total length of transmission lines, with voltages of 350 kV and higher, ran to 312,000 km. The capacity of the European power interconnections of the U.S.S.R. exceeded 68,000 MW in March 1966. The control of the power industry is centralized under the Ministry of Power and Electrification of the U.S.S.R. Ninety-four percent of its electric energy is generated at power stations that are part of interconnected systems. Thermal stations predominate; their generating capacity accounts for 77% of the total installed generation. Hydroelectric plants represent 22% of the total capacity and 18% of the total output. About one percent of the total power production is from nuclear plants. Thirty-six percent of the thermal plants are equipped to transmit heat energy as well as electric power.","","","","","","United States","1967-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: IEEE Spectrum; (United States); Journal Volume: 4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 73-79","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: IEESA","10.1109/MSPEC.1967.5216207","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","5312116","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5312116","","IEEE Spectrum; (United States)","","4"
