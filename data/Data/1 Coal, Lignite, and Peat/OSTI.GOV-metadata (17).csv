"Optimization of {sup 1}H and {sup 13}C NMR methods for structural characterization of acetone and pyridine soluble/insoluble fractions of a coal tar pitch","Morgan, Trevor J; George, Anthe; Davis, David B; Herod, Alan A; Kandiyoti, Rafael","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; HYDROGEN 1; CARBON 13; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE; STRUCTURAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; COAL TAR; PITCHES; MOLECULAR WEIGHT; AROMATICS","{sup 1}H and {sup 13}C high-resolution liquid-state NMR methods were used for the quantitative characterization of different molecular weight fractions of a coal tar pitch (CTP). Three fractions were studied: pitch acetone solubles (PAS), pitch pyridine soluble-acetone insolubles (PPS), and pitch pyridine insolubles (PPI). Standard liquid-state NMR methods were modified and calibrated for use with undeuterated quinoline or undeuterated 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as the solvent. This made it possible to calculate the average structural parameters for the higher molecular weight (MW) fractions of the coal tar pitch. Quantitative comparisons of structural differences between the solubility-separated fractions of the pitch are reported. The aromaticity and the average number of aromatic rings per polynuclear aromatic structure were both found to decrease with increasing solubility. Similarly, pericondensed and all other quaternary carbon species were found to decrease with increasing solubility. This suggests that 'continental' type structures become more dominant as the solvent solubility of these coal derived fractions diminishes. The estimated average number of aromatic rings ranged from 1 to 2 rings in the PAS fraction, 4 to 21 rings in the PPS fraction, and 11 to 210 rings in the PPI fraction. These ring-numbers were directly related to the number average molecular mass (M{sub n}) assigned to the particular fraction in the average structural parameter (ASP) calculations. The lower-limit of the M{sub n} values was derived from the ASP calculations as 200, 450, and 6200 u for the PAS, PPS, and PPI fractions, respectively. 66 refs., 7 figs., 15 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-05-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: t.j.morgan@imperial.ac.uk","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 1824-1835","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 080900065","10.1021/ef700715w","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21073535","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21073535","","Energy and Fuels","3","22"
"Determination of the effects caused by different polymers on coal fluidity during carbonization using high-temperature {sup 1}H NMR and rheometry","Diaz, Miguel Castro; Edecki, Lucky; Steel, Karen M; Patrick, John W; Snape, Colin E","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; BITUMINOUS COAL; RHEOLOGY; CARBONIZATION; HYDROGEN 1; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE; POLYMERS; COPROCESSING; SOLID WASTES; ADDITIVES; COKING; PLASTICS; VISCOSITY","The effects of blending polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), a flexible polyurethane (FPU), and a car shredded fluff waste (CSF) on fluidity development of a bituminous coal during carbonization have been studied by means of high-torque, small-amplitude controlled-strain rheometry and in situ high-temperature {sup 1}H NMR spectroscopy. The most detrimental effects were caused by PET and PS, which completely destroyed the fluidity of the coal. The CSF had a deleterious effect on coal fluidity similar to that of PET, although the deleterious effect on the viscoelastic properties of the coal were less pronounced than those of PET and PS. On the contrary, the addition of 10 wt % PE caused a slight reduction in the concentration of fluid hydrogen and an increase in the minimum complex viscosity, and the addition of 10 wt % FPU reduced the concentration of fluid hydrogen without changing the viscoelastic properties of the coal. Although these results suggest that these two plastics could potentially be used as additives in coking blends without compromising coke porosity, it was found that the semicoke strengths were reduced by adding 2 wt % FPU and 5 wt % PE. Therefore, it is unlikely that more than 2 wt % of a plastic waste could be added to a coal blend without deterioration in coke quality. 35 refs., 11 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2008-01-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 22; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: colin.snape@nottingham.ac.uk","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 471-479","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 080400058","10.1021/ef7004628","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","21004807","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/21004807","","Energy and Fuels","1","22"
"Determination of the effect of different additives in coking blends using a combination of in situ high-temperature {sup 1}H NMR and rheometry","Diaz, Miguel C; Steel, Karen M; Drage, Trevor C; Patrick, John W; Snape, Colin E","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; COKING; ADDITIVES; BITUMINOUS COAL; ANTHRACITE; COKE; PETROLEUM PRODUCTS; CHARCOAL; WOOD; COKE BREEZE; TIRES; ACTIVATED CARBON; HYDROGEN 1; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE; CONCENTRATION RATIO; MOBILITY; RHEOLOGY; MIXTURES","High-temperature {sup 1}H NMR and rheometry measurements were carried out on 4:1 wt/wt blends of a medium volatile bituminous coal with two anthracites, two petroleum cokes, charcoal, wood, a low-temperature coke breeze, tyre crumb, and active carbon to determine the effects on fluidity development to identify the parameters responsible for these effects during pyrolysis and to study possible relationships among the parameters derived from these techniques. Positive, negative, and neutral effects were identified on the concentration of fluid material. Small positive effects (ca. 5-6%) were caused by blending the coal with petroleum cokes. Charcoal, wood, and active carbon all exerted negative effects on concentration (18-27% reduction) and mobility (12-25% reduction in T2) of the fluid phase, which have been associated with the inert character and high surface areas of these additives that adsorb the fluid phase of the coal. One of the anthracites and the low-temperature coke breeze caused deleterious effects to a lesser extent on the concentration (7-12%) and mobility (13-17%) of the fluid material, possibly due to the high concentration of metals in these additives (ca. 11% ash). Despite the high fluid character of tyre crumb at the temperature of maximum fluidity of the coal (73%), the mobility of the fluid phase of the blend was lower than expected. The comparison of {sup 1}H NMR and rheometry results indicated that to account for the variations in minimum complex viscosity for all the blends, both the maximum concentration of fluid phase and the maximum mobility of the fluid material had to be considered. For individual blends, two exponential relationships have been found between the complex viscosity and the concentration of solid phase in both the softening and resolidification stages but the parameters are different for each blend. 30 refs., 8 figs., 5 tabs.","","","","","","United States","2005-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy and Fuels; Journal Volume: 19; Journal Issue: 6; Other Information: colin.snape@nottingham.ac.uk","","Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2423-2431","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0887-0624; ENFUEM; TRN: 000200053","10.1021/ef050126n","","2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","20688439","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/20688439","","Energy and Fuels","6","19"
"Chemical structure of coal tar during devolatilization","Fletcher, T H; Watt, M; Bai, S; Solum, M S","01 COAL, LIGNITE, AND PEAT; 66 PHYSICS; COAL TAR; MOLECULAR STRUCTURE; COAL EXTRACTS; NMR SPECTRA; COAL; PYROLYSIS; CHEMICAL ANALYSIS; CHARS; DEVOLATILIZATION; PYRIDINE; CARBON 13; HYDROGEN 1","Enormous progress has been made in coal pyrolysis research during the last two decades. Models of coal devolatilization have progressed from simple rate expressions based on total mass release to empirical relationships based on the elemental composition of the parent coal to models that attempt to describe the macromolecular network of the coal. In the last several years, advancements in chemical analysis techniques have allowed quantitative investigations of the chemical structure of both coal and its pyrolysis products, including the nature of the resulting char. A prominent research goal is to accurately predict the rates, yields, and products of devolatilization from measurements of the parent coal structure. The prediction of nitrogen species evolved during devolatilization is of current interest. These goals necessitate modeling the reaction processes on the molecular scale, with activation energies that relate to chemical bond breaking rather than to the mass of products released from the coal. Solid-state {sup 13}C NMR spectroscopy has proven particularly useful in obtaining average values of chemical structure features of coal and char, while liquid phase {sup 1}H NMR spectroscopy has been used to determine some of the chemical features of coal tar. Pyridine extract residues from coal and partially-pyrolyzed coal chars have also been analyzed by solid-state {sup 13}C NMR spectroscopy, and the extracts have been analyzed by {sup 1}H NMR spectroscopy.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 2; Conference: Spring national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), New Orleans, LA (United States), 24-28 Mar 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 752-755","","CONF-960376-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000004-0049","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","430321","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/430321","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","2","41"

Indeed, the fluid component increases both in terms of concentration and mobility up to maximum fluidity.

Transport of methanol in poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) and pyridine in coal is explored and compared with Fickian transport of toluene in polybutadiene rubber (PBD) and hexafluorobenzene in poly(methyl silicone) (PMS). These former two systems are characterized by sharp solvent fronts which propagate into the cores of the samples at a constant velocity. The swelling kinetics are quantified by applying a simple model which couples the kinetics of solvent diffusion to a second-order phase transition which induces network relaxation. Parameterization is accomplished with two kinetic terms and one thermodynamic parameter. These are a mass-fixed glassy diffusion coefficient, a network relaxation constant, and a critical concentration corresponding to the concentration of solvent necessary to induce a glass to rubber transition. Solvent from velocities, obtained through magnetic resonance microscopy, are used with independently derived critical concentrations to calculate the glassy diffusion coefficient and network relaxation rate constant. Kinetic swelling data are then fit with theoretical uptake curves computed using these parameters. A high-quality fit demonstrates that the proposed model successfully quantifies non-Fickian transport using a small number of physical based dynamic parameters.","","","","","","United States","1994-04-25T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Macromolecules; (United States); Journal Volume: 27:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2607-2614","","","W-31109-ENG-38","Journal ID: ISSN 0024-9297; CODEN: MAMOBX","10.1021/ma00087a033","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7112047","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7112047","","Macromolecules; (United States)","","27:9"

The calculations were carried out assuming that the predominant interaction was the dipole interaction between protons. The interaction between protons and paramagnetic centers was estimated as minor, in the range of 0.15--0.27 G/sup 2/. The result of the calculations both for the rigid structure and for the one with rotating fragments is similar to the experimental spin-spin relaxation time of the Gaussian component of free-induction decay observed for some coals. This result suggests that the Wiser molecule presents the macromolecular part in the molecular-macromolecular model of coal. Its maximal dimensions are X = 24.1, Y = 29.3, and Z = 11.29 A and the distance between the two remotest protons is 34.5 A.","","","Department of Petroleum and Coal Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, 44-100 Gliwice, ul. 1 Maja 62, Poland","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

The coverage of the carboxyl groups by metal cations varied from 30% to 60% (on an equivalent basis) for the raw coals. For all raw coals, Ca/sup +2/ was the predominate metal cation. The equilibrium ion exchange behavior of metal cations for H/sup +/ was found to be a linear function of pH regardless of the cation concentration in solution. Thus, the extent of exchange is a function of available hydrogen ions. From equilibrium ion exchange measurements, the following cation exchange selectivity pattern for a subbituminous coal was determined: H/sup +/ > Ca/sup 2 +/ > Na/sup +/ > Mg/sup 2 +/ = K/sup +/ while that for a lignite was: H/sup +/ > Ca/sup 2 +/ > Mg/sup 2 +/ > Na/sup +/ > K/sup +/. 4 figures, 6 tables.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","","","United States","1983-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Solvent Extr.

The technique of /SUP/13C dephasing by the /SUP/1H dipolar reservoir is used to resolve both the aromatic and aliphatic NMR absorption bands into tertiary plus secondary components and secondary/tertiary plus primary/quaternary aliphatic components. Integrated intensities of the various resolved absorption bands allow estimations of the percentages of tertiary and quaternary aromatic carbons, as well as those of the secondary/tertiary and primary/quaternary aliphatic carbons. First and second moments of the resolved absorption bands are believed to be correlated with both the kinds and distributions of carbons in these asphaltenes. Studies of these moments suggest that the average number of polynuclear condensed rings in these asphaltenes is much smaller than what is thought to exist in a high-rank anthracite coal. Furthermore, the aliphatic side chains attached to the polynuclear-ring backbone may have large variations in both lengths and branchings.","","","","","","United States","1982-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Anal.

The DBT uses two buffers to stoichiometrically account for contributions of hydrogen ions (H/sup +/) to soil acidity to pH 7.0, including those from the hydrolysis of Al. The first buffer lowers the soil pH to 3.17 to dissolve Al-OH polymers, amorphous coatings, and interlayer species. The second buffer raises the pH to approximately 8.2, titrating the exchangeable Al/sup 3 +/ and other hydrolyzed species to neutralized forms. Lastly, a titration of the buffers-soil mixture with standardized base to pH 8.2 provides a direct measure of the lime requirement. For comparison, a 5-month CaCO/sub 3/ incubation of 31 soils was also determined. The results by the two methods were highly correlated for 24 samples and statistically the same at a probability level of 0.001.","","","Univ. of Vermont, Burlington (USA)","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

However, the role of soluble organic acids and humic substances on the adsorption of SO{sub 4} is poorly understood. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine the effects of soluble organic ligands on the adsorption of SO{sub 4} by amorphous iron oxide (AIO) and kaolinite (KGa-2). Sulfate adsorption was studied over a range in total SO{sub 4} of 0.01 to 2.5 mM in the absence and presence of organic ligands including Seward humic and fulvic acid, tannic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, and gallic acid. Sulfate adsorption capacities in the absence of organic ligands were 3.5 and 1.3{mu}mol{sub c} m{sup {minus}2} at 324 m{sup 2}L{sup {minus}1} AIO and 583 m{sup 2}L{sup {minus}1} KGa-2, respectively. Humic and tannic acid present at 1.4 to 3.6 mM total soluble C reduced SO{sub 4} adsorption by KGa-2 at total SO{sub 4} levels below 0.12 mM. Humic, tannic, citric, gallic, and oxalic acid were all effective at inhibition SO{sub 4} adsorption by AIO. In several cases the percent of SO{sub 4} adsorbed was reduced from near 100 to zero at total SO{sub 4} levels below 0.12 mM. The amount of inhibition was related to the quantity of oxygen-containing functional groups added rather than the total soluble C. These results indicate that organic acids compete for SO{sub 4} adsorption sites and that the presence of organic acids in soil solutions will influence SO{sub 4} adsorption capacities.","","","","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Quality; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 379-385","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0047-2425; CODEN: JEVQA","10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800030024x","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6907087","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6907087","","Journal of Environmental Quality; (USA)","","18:3"

The present studies examine the relationships between the catalytically generated coal liquids and thermoplastic behavior. Five coals of rank varying from subbituminous to low-volatile bituminous and exhibiting little or no fluidity were hydrogenated by using an impregnated Mo catalyst and without vehicle for various times at temperatures up to 400 C. Except for the low-volatile bituminous coal, the fluid behavior of the hydrogenated coals, as measured by Gieseler plastometry and microdilatometry, was greatly improved compared to that of the untreated coals. The development of fluid behavior displayed by the hydrogenated coals is attributed to the generation of relatively small, solvent-soluble, molecular fragments. The structure of the low-volatile bituminous coal is considered to contain a large proportion of strong covalent bonds, which inhibit degradation of the coal structure. Air oxidation of a high-volatile A bituminous coal substantially reduced its fluid properties. Following catalytic hydrogenation, the hydrogenated coal became even more fluid than the original untreated coal. Microdilatometry measurements on mixtures of a high-volatile A bituminous coal with chloroform-soluble extracts, obtained from the same coal after hydrogenation, showed a progressive enhancement in swelling and lowering in softening temperature as the proportion of the extract in the mixture was increased. However, neither mixing a hydrogenated high-volatile A bituminous coal with its unhydrogenated parent coal nor mixing with the chloroform-soluble extract from a hydrogenated subbituminous coal improved the dilatation properties. 34 references, 3 figures, 4 tables.","","","Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Fuel; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 89-93","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENFUE","10.1021/ef00001a017","","2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","6573069","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6573069","","Energy Fuel; (United States)","","1:1"

Thirty-three Australian bituminous coals, including some maceral concentrates (80-90% carbon), were examined in situ during heating at 4 K/min by pulsed proton nuclear magnetic resonance (/sup 1/H NMR). The maximum fraction of mobile material achieved during the pyrolysis correlates strongly with hydrogen content, extrapolating to zero at 4% hydrogen. High inertinite (mainly semifusinite) coals are undifferentiated in this correlation. For vitrinite there is no significant molecular mobility below ca 600 K, but rapid mobilization occurs above this temperature. This latter transient mobilization is identified as the essence of coal thermoplasticity. As might be expected, exinite, which is probably composed predominantly of long-chain aliphatic material, acquires considerable mobility at lower temperatures than vitrinite, though its maximum mobility is achieved at the thermoplastic stage of the coal (ca 700 K). 10 references, 10 figures, 2 tables.","","","CSIRO Div. of Fossil Fuels, North Ryde, Australia","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Fuel; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 167-172","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENFUE","10.1021/ef00002a005","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","6572585","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6572585","","Energy Fuel; (United States)","","1:2"

Gated spin-echo (GASPE) spectral intensities yield a variety of chemically comprehensible average structure parameters. These include the number of carbon atoms per molecule, the number of side chains per molecule, the number of carbon atoms per side chain, the number of side chain branches per molecule, and the number of side chain rings per molecule. Additional structural characterization has been sought through more detailed spectral interpretation. The assignment of NMR resonances has been facilitated by the use of selective heteronuclear correlation (SHECOR) spectra, coupled and decoupled heteronuclear correlation 2D NMR spectra, the heteronuclear relayed coherence transfer (RELAY) 2D NMR method, and homonuclear correlation (COSY) 2D NMR spectra. Wherever possible, spectral assignments have been supported by a range of NMR information including CH/sub n/ type (n = 0-3), /sup 1/H chemical shift, /sup 13/C chemical shift, /sup 1/H-/sup 13/C resonance connectivity, /sup 1/H-/sup 1/H resonance connectivity, and /sup 1/H multiplicity. As a result, the average numbers of ..cap alpha..-, ..beta..-, and ..gamma..-CH/sub 3/ groups per molecule have been calculated. Also, a range of specific structures has been identified, including methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, tetralin ring, indan ring, and 1-methylindan ring side chains. Overall, the information collected is sufficient to identify structural similarities and differences for the samples investigated. 52 references, 10 figures, 3 tables.","","","Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Ltd., Mulgrave, Australia","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Fuel; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 111-120","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENFUE","10.1021/ef00001a021","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","6572349","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6572349","","Energy Fuel; (United States)","","1:1"

The acid-precipitated extract was dissolved in dilute base and analyzed by /sup 13/C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Of the 60% of the carbon accounted for, approximately 51% of the carbon atoms were aromatic, 20% were assigned to carboxylic acid groups, and the remainder were aliphatic carbon. Proton NMR spectra of the acid-precipitated material revealed approximately equal proportions of aromatic and aliphatic hydrogen. The bioconverted materials were highly polar and exhibited a wide range in apparent molecular weight; most material was over 10,000 Da at acidic pH, as determined by ultrafiltration experiments. Freeze-dried product material was soluble in water but was essentially insoluble in other organic solvents. Calorimetric measurements on samples of the freeze-dried extract showed that, on a per-weight basis, it retained 94-97% of the heating value of the feed coal. 12 references, 5 figures, 2 tables.","","","Battelle, Pacific Northwest Labs., Richland, WA","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Energy Fuel; (United States); Journal Volume: 1:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 80-84","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: ENFUE","10.1021/ef00001a015","","2016-05-20T00:00:00Z","6572397","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6572397","","Energy Fuel; (United States)","","1:1"

Evaluation of the ionic parameters of throughfall revealed that the concentrations of most major ions were nonnormally distributed. Differences in the distributions of concentrations were found to occur between ions as well as between storms. Significant departures from normality were mainly due to right-skewness. Only H{sup +} exhibited a left skewed sample distribution. None of the basic transformations were effective in normalizing all parameters. A high degree of spatial variability was observed for each of the chemical parameters. Nitrate and hydrogen ions (NO{sup {minus}}{sub 3} and H{sup +}), were found to be the least variable, whereas vegetatively mobile ions such as K{sup +} and Mg{sup 2+} exhibited the greatest variability. Because of high event-to-event variation in the distributions of ion concentrations, specific sample-size requirements should be estimated for each ion through preliminary sampling of throughfall precipitation from several storms.","","","","","","United States","","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Environmental Quality; (USA); Journal Volume: 18:3","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 274-280","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0047-2425; CODEN: JEVQA","10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800030005x","","2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","7166888","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7166888","","Journal of Environmental Quality; (USA)","","18:3"

The H-ion concentration varied only slightly in each of the three lakes during the 10-month study. Waterlevel fluctuation, due to spring rains, did not materially affect the pH. The acid lake was homeothermous throughout the study with only slight temperature variations. The alkaline and slightly acid lakes developed a partial thermal stratification during the summer months. In general, turbidity seemed to be regulated by the acidity: The greater the acidity the less the turbidity. There was a progressive increase in turbidity from lake No. 1 to lake No. 3. In general, the plankton population was reduced in lake No. 1 as compared to lakes No. 2 and No. 3. Rotifers and microcrustaceans composed over 90 percent of the total population in each of the three lakes. The benthos comprised a rather diverse group of organisms with insect larvae the predominant group. Of the three lakes, No. 1 contained the largest volume of organisms per square foot of bottom area with genus Tendipes the most numerous group. Fish were present in lakes No. 2 and No. 3, but evidence indicated that fish were not present in lake No. 1. Age and growth studies on bluegill from lake No. 2 indicated pronounced stunting in growth. However, growth of bass in lake No. 3 compared favorably with that of fish in other bodies of water until the third year when stunting also became pronounced.","","","","","","United States","1960-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Trans.
