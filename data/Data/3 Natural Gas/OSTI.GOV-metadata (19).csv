"Utilizing CO <sub>2</sub> as a Reactant for C <sub>3</sub> Oxygenate Production via Tandem Reactions","Biswas, Akash N.; Winter, Lea R.; Xie, Zhenhua; Chen, Jingguang G.","03 NATURAL GAS; Catalysts; Chemical reactions; Hydrocarbons; Hydroformylation; Selectivity; CO<sub>2</sub> utilization; C<sub>3</sub> oxygenates; Tandem reactors; Thermocatalysis; Electrocatalysis; Plasma chemistry","One possible solution to closing the loop on carbon emissions is using CO<sub>2</sub> as the carbon source to generate high-value, multi-carbon products. In this Perspective, we describe four tandem reaction strategies for converting CO<sub>2</sub> into C<sub>3</sub> oxygenated hydrocarbon products (i.e., propanal and 1-propanol), using either ethane or water as the hydrogen source: (1) thermocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>-assisted dehydrogenation and reforming of ethane to ethylene, CO, and H<sub>2</sub>, followed by heterogeneous hydroformylation, (2) one-pot conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and ethane using plasma-activated reactions in combination with thermocatalysis, (3) electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethylene, CO, and H<sub>2</sub>, followed by thermocatalytic hydroformylation, and (4) electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to CO, followed by electrochemical CO reduction to C<sub>3</sub> oxygenates. We first discuss the proof-of-concept results and key challenges for each tandem scheme, followed by a comparative analysis of the energy costs and prospects for net CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. The use of tandem reaction systems can provide an alternative approach to traditional catalytic processes, and these concepts can be further extended to other chemical reactions and products, thereby opening new opportunities for innovative CO<sub>2</sub> utilization technologies.","American Chemical Society","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Advances, needs highlighted for deep U.S. gas drilling","","03 NATURAL GAS; USA; NATURAL GAS WELLS; WELL DRILLING; DEPTH 3-6 KM; EXPLORATION; EXPLORATORY WELLS; TECHNOLOGY UTILIZATION","Economics of US deep gas exploration and production have improved significantly the past 3 years, one speaker told Gas Research Institute`s Second Deep Gas Forum in Denver in mid-October. Purpose of the 2 day meeting was to discuss the latest practices and technologies for improving deep gas exploration and lowering development costs. Depths considered are generally 15,000 ft and deeper, although the principles apply to many reservoirs several thousand feet shallower. Of particular interest were presentations on deep gas resources; the integrated application of exploration technologies; case studies of deep gas exploration in the Anadarko, Permian, and Rocky Mountain basins; and performance reviews of high priority deep gas plays. This paper summarizes highlights from the meeting.","","","","","","United States","1998-11-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 96; Journal Issue: 48; Other Information: PBD: 30 Nov 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 82-84","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9901%%136","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","289384","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/289384","","Oil and Gas Journal","48","96"

The USGS estimated that 114 tcf of technically recoverable conventional and nonconventional deep gas remains to be discovered in the Rocky Mountains (57 tcf), Gulf Coast (27 tcf), Alaska (18 tcf), West Texas/New Mexico (4 tcf), and Midcontinent (3 tcf), among others. This article, third in this series and the second on deep gas, takes a closer look at this large and challenging resource by addressing the following key questions: (1) Where are the locations and what are the differences among the major deep gas basins? (2) How successful and active have the deep gas plays been? (3) What obstacles and rewards are likely for developers of deep gas? This article concludes with reviews and case studies of three specific deep gas basins: the mature Anadarko basin, the emerging Green River basin, and the frontier Wind River basin. Reviews of these basins highlight the challenges in finding and producing deep gas, as well as the results and rewards.","","","","","","United States","1998-05-04T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 96; Journal Issue: 18; Other Information: PBD: 4 May 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 133-146","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9812%%186","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","597063","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/597063","","Oil and Gas Journal","18","96"

The field is expected to produce 100,000 BOPD and 110 MMcf/D of gas from a tension-leg platform (TLP) anchored in 3,000 ft of water. The TLP has a total of 24 slots available for long term development. The field consists of possibly eight reservoirs in five groups at 10,000 to 20,000 ft below sea level. Crude-oil gravities a/nd sulfur content are higher in the field`s shallower reservoirs while the gas/oil ratios are lower. The initial plans were to develop several reservoirs at the same time but to complete each well in only one pay zone. Production will be from lower intervals. The oil will flow 116 miles through an 18- and 24-in. pipeline to a salt-cavern storage site. Gas will flow 55 miles through a 14-in. subsea line to a fixed platform. From there, it will move through a 30-in. line to a gas-processing plant. The ability to develop wells in water depths greater than 2,900 ft will be a milestone in off-shore development.","","","","","","United States","1997-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology; Journal Volume: 49; Journal Issue: 9; Other Information: PBD: Sep 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 951-956","","","","Journal ID: JPTJAM; ISSN 0149-2136; TRN: IM9745%%344","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","536505","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/536505","","JPT, Journal of Petroleum Technology","9","49"

With [delta][sup 13]C[sub CH4] values from -22.4 to -48.5% and [delta]D[sub CH4] values from -133 to -372%, these methane deposits cannot be accounted for by conventional processes for bacterial or thermogenic methanogenesis. Compositionally the gases are similar to other CH[sub 4]-rich gas occurrences found in Canadian and Fennoscandian shield rocks. However, the isotopically anomalous gases of this study are characterized by unexpectedly high concentrations of H[sub 2] gas, ranging from several volume percent up to 30 vol%. The H[sub 2] gases are consistently depleted in the heavy isotope, with [delta]D[sub H[sub 2]] values of -619 to -659%. [sup 3]He/[sup 4]He ratios in the range of 0.4 X 10[sup [minus]8] to 4.4 X 10[sup [minus]8] indicate that there is no resolvable component of mantle-derived He in these deposits. Based on these results a mantle-derived source for the C-bearing gases is unlikely. Several lines of evidence support an alternative abiogenic origin for the gases from Sudbury, Canada, and Juuka and Pori, Finland. The D-depleted H[sub 2] gas and calculated [Delta]D[sub (CH[sub 4]-H[sub 2]]) equilibration temperatures of 110-170[degrees]C at all three sites are in good agreement with results obtained for abiogenically produced CH[sub 4] and H[sub 2] in ophiolite sequences in Oman and the Philippines. Serpentinization and the hydration of ultramafic rocks are the proposed mechanisms for CH[sub 4] and H[sub 2] production in these ophiolite sequences. The widespread occurrence of serpentinized and altered ultramafic rocks at Juuka and at a number of other sites in both Canada and Finland implies that similar mechanisms may be involved in gas production at at least three sites on the shields. Abiogenic processes of CH[sub 4] production may be considerably more widespread than previously anticipated.","","","","","","United States","1993-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States); Journal Volume: 57:23-24","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 5087-5097","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-7037; CODEN: GCACAK","10.1016/0016-7037(93)90610-9","","2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","5207917","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5207917","","Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta; (United States)","","57:23-24"

The ratio [sup 3]He/[sup 4]He ranges from radiogenic ([approximately]10[sup [minus]8]) to mantle ([approximately]10[sup [minus]5]) values. For the most part, the hydrocarbon fluids of the Irkutsk amphitheater contain only radiogenic helium; this distinguishes the amphitheater from ancient platforms. In contrast, fluids from the Baykal rift zone are distinguished by the presence of helium with a mantle component; this component reaches almost 100% in thermal fluids in the Tunka basin. The ratios CH[sub 4]/[sup 3]He and (CO[sub 2] + CH[sub 4])/[sup 3]He suggest that the methane and carbon dioxide in the rift zone fluids may be partially magmatogenic; in the Irkutsk amphitheater, on the other other hand, such gases originated as a result of purely crustal processes. The [sup 3]He/[sup 4]He ratio varies along the length of the Baikal rift zone, with decreasing values correlating with decreasing heat flow, increasing thickness of crust, and decreasing dimensions of rift basins. 39 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-02-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Geology Review; (United States); Journal Volume: 35:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 186-202","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0020-6814; CODEN: IGREAP","10.1080/00206819309465522","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","6371893","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6371893","","International Geology Review; (United States)","","35:2"

The measurements made over an 11 year period from 1977 to 1988 led to the prediction that the rate of decrease was of the order of 1[times]10[sup [minus]9]/yr. Several absolute isotopic ratio measurements made between 1969 and the present time also have been reported. These show a slight decrease in the helium isotopic ratio (much less than the 11 year data set shows). In the present paper, the authors report an unpublished, absolute helium isotopic ratio measurement the authors made in 1956. This value, when combined with the previously reported results, extends the time over which such measurements were made to a 32 year period and does not confirm that there is any decrease in the helium isotopic ratio in the atmosphere over this time. 12 refs., 1 fig., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1993-01-22T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States); Journal Volume: 20:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 121-123","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0094-8276; CODEN: GPRLAJ; TRN: 93-006095","10.1029/93GL00112","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","6702181","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6702181","","Geophysical Research Letters (American Geophysical Union); (United States)","","20:2"

Helium exists in natural gas wells; however, at the current rate of natural gas usage, this resource would provide {lt}5 kg/yr of {sup 3}He. The radioactive decay of {sup 3}H produced in fission production reactors could yield 110 kg of {sup 3}He by the year 2000 if it were retained. Apparently, a large amount of {sup 3}He exists within the earth's mantle, but it is inaccessible. A significant quantity of {sup 3}He, which could be imported to supply a fusion power industry on earth for hundreds of years, exists on the moon. The solar wind has deposited {gt}1 million tonnes of {sup 3}He in the fine regolith that covers the surface of the moon. The presence of this solar wind gas was confirmed by analyses of the lunar regolith samples brought to earth. A strong correlation is noted between the helium retained and the TiO{sub 2} content of the regolith; consequently, remote-sensing data showing high-titanium-bearing soils in the lunar maria areas have been used to locate potentially rich sites for helium extraction. Surface photographs of Mare Tranquillitatis have shown that nearly 50% of this mare may be minable and capable of supplying {approximately}7100 tonnes of {sup 3}He. A mobile mining vehicle is proposed for use in the excavation of the soil and the release of the helium and other solar wind gases. The evolved gases would be purified by a combination of permeators and cryogenic techniques to provide a rich resource of H{sub 2}, helium, CO{sub 2}, H{sub 2}O, and N{sub 2}, followed by helium isotopic separation systems.","","","","","","United States","1992-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fusion Technology; (United States); Journal Volume: 21:4","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 2230-2253","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0748-1896; CODEN: FUSTE","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7275748","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7275748","","Fusion Technology; (United States)","","21:4"

If the estimates are accurate (it is unknown if the figure refers to total or recoverable reserves), this makes Tengiz not only one of the largest petroleum deposits in the USSR, but in the world. Whether this potential can be developed is still unclear. The Tengiz field was discovered in late 1979 and has been characterized by Soviet experts as one of the most complex and difficult to produce in the entire USSR. The reservoir rocks are of relatively poor quality, and being fissured limestones pose unusual drilling problems. The oil is also quite deep, at 4500-5500 meters. Other development problems arise in the anomalously great reservoir pressure and the high hydrogen sulfide and gas condensate content of the associated gas, which requires the construction of a gas processing facility, to be built nearby at Karaton. The harsh physical environment and the lack of infrastructure (the field is located in salt flats on the edge of the Caspian Sea) also hinder development. The Tengizneftegaz production association was officially established in 1985, but has yet to process any gas or produce any oil.","","","","","","United States","1987-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

More than 1,000 wells have been drilled in this prolific trend during the last 10 to 12 years. Although actively developed earlier, the trend became even more attractive after its classification by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as a ''tight'' gas formation. Essentially, development of the Wilcox (Lobo) has been successful because of modern technological advances. This paper presents the results of several years of study involving the geologic history, completion methods, massive-hydraulic-fracture (HF) stimulation treatments, reservoir evaluation and numerical analysis of hydraulically fractured wells in this trend, all of which illustrate the application of this modern technology.","","","S.A.

The /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratios range from 0.11 times the atmospheric ratio (0.11 R/sub A/) in the Rio Vista field to 2.75 R/sub A/ in the Moon Bend field, indicating that 1% to 34% of the helium is mantle-derived. /sup 3/He//sup 4/He versus CH/sub 4///sup 4/He ratios provide evidence of two-component mixing between crustal and magmatic end-members. Extrapolation of the linear regression line to CH/sub 4///sup 4/He = 0 gives a hypothetical magmatic end-member /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratio of 3.84 R/sub A/, half the typical mantle ratio. This indicates that the magmatic end-member may actually represent a mixture of mantle and crustal helium. Gases which deviate from the simple two-component mixture can be explained by addition of pure methane, radiogenic /sup 4/He, or a high N/sub 2/-He component with /sup 3/He//sup 4/He = 0.6 R/sub A/ to 1.0 R/sub A/. The CH/sub 4///sup 3/He ratio of the magmatic end-member remains poorly constrained (0 to 3 x 10/sup 9/) and one cannot rule out the possibility that a significant proportion of the methane in some fields may be of deep-earth origin. However, fields with the highest /sup 3/He//sup 4/He ratios are associated with buried Plio-Pleistocene intrusives which have up-arched sediments to form hydrocarbon traps. The methane in these fields may have been produced by rapid thermal alteration of the intruded sediment. Elsewhere, the methane appears either to have migrated from deeply-buried sediments in the western basin or to have been produced by local microbial activity.","","","Univ. of California, San Diego","","","United States","1986-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Geochim.

The number of well drilled to depths greater than 15,000 ft dropped from a record high of 1,205 wells in 1982 to 566 wells last year. Early estimates show the pace to slow further in 1986. Eventually, as oil and gas prices rebound, deep drilling should make a comeback, as well. With this return in deep drilling activity, engineers will be faced once again with technical problems the industry was learning to overcome. When bottomhole temperatures exceed 400/sup 0/F and bottomhole pressures rise above 15,000 psi, corrosion problems are magnified. These high temperatures and pressures complicate decisions about the drilling fluid system and drill string program. Further, the pressure integrity of the deep liner and casing strings and the associated cementing jobs become more critical.","","","","","","United States","1986-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Pet.

The in-depth engineering approach combined stringent material and threaded-connector qualifications with new tubing-sizing methods and thorough installation planning. Standard tubing-sizing methods were unacceptable because of conservatism about erosional velocity and stress analysis inaccuracy. Proper stress analysis of the alloy required consideration of triaxial stress states, anisotropy of mechanical properties, and temperature weakening of yield stress.","","","Enertech Engineering and Research Co., Lafayette, LA","","","United States","1986-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Product.

Part 1 focused on subsea irregularities along the Norwegian Trench. Traditional pipeline landfall is on a sandy beach, into which a trench is excavated for subsequent pull-in of the pipe from the lay-barge. Excavation of a trench, although not in sand but in solid rock, was also considered for the Statpipe landfall at Kalsto. The seabed is mostly rocky for about 900 m from the coastline along the selected landfall route, with large local variations in water depths. Further out, to about 1,200 m, is a steep slope down to soft sediments at about 100-m water depth. The area is directly exposed to wind and waves from the North Sea, which significantly affects design and installation criteria. The topography as well as the exposure to the environment made this shore approach a challenge. A trench through the rocky shore approach zone would require more than 40,000 cu m of rock to be blasted and removed. This trench would at some spots be more than 12 m deep. Blasting would have to be performed to a water depth of 40-50 m. After pipeline installation, the trench would have to be completely backfilled in order to stabilize and protect the pipeline. This backfill would again require a thick protective layer of large stones in the wave-breaking zone. The trench excavation was found to be entirely feasible with some modification to existing equipment. The schedule was uncertain, however, because of the exposure of the landfall area to winds and waves.","","","Den norske stats, oljeselskap A.S.

Depths to the top of overpressured interval in the Niger Delta range from 2,000 ft at the Calabar flank to 13,000 ft in an area extending from the central part of the western Niger Delta to the nose of the Niger Delta. Comparison of depth map of top of Akata formation and TOPOVP map shows that overpressures are normally encountered at depths shallower than top of Akata formation. Based on the findings of this study, the following conclusions are warranted: Geophysical well-logging measurements in the Niger Delta area show characteristics which permit delineation of the top overpressured zone. Majority of overpressures exist at depths between 6,000 ft and 13,000 ft in the Agbada formation. The distribution of overpressures in the Delta area shows well-defined trends with depths of top overpressure increasing towards the central part of the delta at a maximum depth of 13,000 ft.

The extent of the reefal scarp is about 400 km in the terrestrial part, with an amplitude of up to 1500-2000 m, the width of the crest is about 5 km, and the depth of occurrence is 3000-4500 m. In its sublatitudinal part, the reef coincides with the Near-Balkhan zone of structures, productive in the Pliocene sequence. In its submeridional part, it corresponds to the so-called Shordzha-Gekcha fault and has been built over by a Cretaceous diapiric clay swell. The paleogeomorphic plan in the South Caspian petroliferous basin, apart from Southwestern Turkmenia, suggests the distribution of the marginal barrier-reef scarp beyond the water area of the Caspian Sea and the Kura Basin.","","","","","","United States","1982-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Int.

The onset of overpressuring occurs at about 11,600 ft (3,500 m), near the base of the Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation. Drill stem test data indicate that at about 12,800 ft (3,900 m) the pressure gradient is as high as 0.84 psi/ft (19.0 kPa/m). The development of overpressuring probably due to the active generation of large amounts of wet gas. Nearly coincident with the top of overpressuring is a reversal of the spontaneous potential (SP) curve that is thought to be caused by a reduction of formation water salinity. The very small amounts of water produced during thermochemical decomposition of organic matter and the dehydration of clays during clay transformation may provide enough low-salinity water to effictively dilute the original formation water to a degree that the formation water resistivity is greater than mud filtrate resistivity. Microscopic and geochemical evaluation of organic matter shows that they are dominantly humic-type kerogen. Total organic carbon contents of 26 samples range from 0.25 to 7.84 weight percent. Most samples exceed 0.5 percent organic carbon and the average is 1.38 percent. A vertial profile of organic maturation, shows that the top of overpressuring and beginning of important wet-gas generation occur at vitrinite reflectance values of 0.74 to 0.86.

Kharaka, a geochemist at the US Geological Survey's western headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. During the past 5 yr, and especially during the past year, these zones - deep-lying, sandstone sediments containing hot, high-pressure water thought to be frothy with methane - have moved to center stage in the search for new sources of natural gas. The geopressure zones underlie some 140,000 sq miles of coastal Texas and Louisiana at depths greater than 10,000 ft. The pressure varies sharply with depth; at 16,500 ft, it is some 6500 psi. Typical temperatures at that depth are 150 to 200 C. Nonetheless, says Kharaka, before the geopressure fields can be developed, some formidable problems must be solved. Not the least of these is how to dispose of the immense amounts of water produced (8000 cu m per well per day, according to one estimate).","","","","","","United States","1979-01-29T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

EDF 1 underwent 1963 preliminary tests in early 1963 prior to power operation; it is plandned that EDF 2 will come into service at the end of 1964 and EDF 3 during 1965. A review of the development of this reactor system In the light of experience acquired on this type of reactor is presented. The progress achieved in the laboratories on the various technical aspects, neutronic, thermal, mechanical, and metallurgical, and the development prospects resulting from them are discussed. The experience acquired from the construction of the various reactors and the technical and economical conclusions resulting from it are described. The operational experience of the Marcoule reactors and of the first trials of the EDF 1 reactor, are reviewed. An attempt was made to define the prospects of this type of reactor in the French program, by distinguishing between the technical practicability and the economic feasibility.

Some data on the behavior of the fuel elements with respect to the burn-up are given. The highest burn-up obtained was about 7000 Mwd/ton. The limitation on the burn-up was caused only by the loss of reactivity. No deformation of the fuel elements was observed. Some data on the fabrication of uranium-molybdenum fuel elements are given.
