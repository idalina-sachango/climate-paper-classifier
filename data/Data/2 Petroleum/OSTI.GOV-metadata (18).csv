"Corrosion-Resistant Plug Materials for Geothermal Well Fluid Control","Lowry, Bill; Louden, Andrew; Jerman, Robin; Pyatina, Tatiana","15 GEOTHERMAL ENERGY; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 02 PETROLEUM; 03 NATURAL GAS; thermite-based sealers; corrosion resistant well materials; cement alternatives; geothermal wells; CO2 resistant well materials; thermal shock; anorthite; mullite; aluminosilicate sealer; CO<sub>2</sub> resistant well materials","Conventional cements and plugs are challenged by corrosion in CO<sub>2</sub>-rich and extreme geothermal environments, due to the hostile chemistry and high temperatures. Thermite-based sealing and well intervention technologies are being applied in the oil and gas industry, combining the energy delivery capability of thermite materials with the sealing characteristics of low melt temperature alloys. The thermite reaction products (ceramics) and the sealing alloys used in these plugs both have very attractive corrosion properties, and their operating envelopes extend into geothermal conditions. Thermite plugs and platforms, without supplemental sealing materials, have been considered for nuclear waste isolation, carbon sequestration, and geothermal applications due to the geochemical stability of the ceramic product and its very high service temperature. This study addresses corrosion resistance of the thermite reaction products. A range of engineered thermite systems which yield thermite reaction products including pure aluminum oxide, feldspar, or aluminosilicate solid solutions (in addition to the iron produced in thermite reactions) was developed. These materials were evaluated for their strong acid resistance (pH 1), carbonate resistance (sodium carbonate) and thermal shock resistance (600 °C heating → cold water quenching repeated three times). Performance of different materials was evaluated based on the changes in mechanical properties, water-fillable porosity, phase changes under stress conditions. The aluminosilicate product exhibited very good corrosion resistance, both from material loss and strength perspectives, while the other products performed with varying degrees of stability. This paper presents the results of the thermite corrosion studies and describes the novel tools being deployed, and under development, to satisfy challenging barrier and intervention applications.","MDPI","","isol8 Inc., Port Townsend, WA (United States); Brookhaven National Lab.

"A machine learning model for predicting the minimum miscibility pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> and crude oil system based on a support vector machine algorithm approach","Chen, Hao; Zhang, Chao; Jia, Ninghong; Duncan, Ian; Yang, Shenglai; Yang, YongZhi","42 ENGINEERING; 97 MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTING; 02 PETROLEUM; Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Machine learning; Minimum miscible pressure; Prediction model; Support vector machine; The impure CO<sub>2</sub>","CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a potential way for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Though, the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> injection is greatly influenced by the reservoir conditions. Typically, Minimum miscible pressure (MMP) is selected as one of the key parameters for the screening and evaluation of prospective CO<sub>2</sub> flooding. Conventional slim tube test is both accurate and widely accepted but it is inefficient. Existing empirical formulas for MMPs are easy to be used but have been proved inaccurate and unreliable. Machine learning-based methods have great advantages in predicting MMP. However, only predication accuracy is discussed for most models without the screening of the main control factors and further validation of the model reliability. In this paper, a new prediction model based on support vector machine (SVM) was developed for pure/impure CO<sub>2</sub> and crude oil system. This study was based on 147 sets of MMP data from the literature with full information on reservoir temperature, oil composition and gas composition. The main control factors were screened by several statistical methods. Unlike the conventional prediction models that verified by only prediction accuracy, learning curve and single factor control variable analysis are further validated to obtain the optimum model.","Elsevier","","Univ. of Texas, Austin, TX (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE); China Natural Science Foundation","","United States","2020-12-30T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Fuel; Journal Volume: 290; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 120048","","","FE0024375; 51704303; 3173044; 2015-YXKJ-001; 2016ZX05016005","Journal ID: ISSN 0016-2361; PII: S0016236120330453","10.1016/j.fuel.2020.120048","","2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","1849150","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1849150","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1849150","Fuel","C","290"
"Pressure falloff testing to characterize CO<sub>2</sub> plume and dry-out zone during CO<sub>2</sub> injection in saline aquifers","Abdelaal, Mohamed; Zeidouni, Mehdi","42 ENGINEERING; 02 PETROLEUM; Energy & fuels; Engineering; Pressure falloff testing; CO<sub>2</sub> plume extent; Dry-out zone extent/mobility","The fluid mobilities and the lateral extent of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume and the dry-out zone are among important unknowns required to effectively manage CO<sub>2</sub> storage in saline aquifers projects. These unknowns can be derived from pressure falloff testing which has been widely used to characterize the subsurface. This paper provides a three-region analytical solution for falloff pressure during the infinite-acting period of CO<sub>2</sub> injection in saline aquifers. The solution is derived using Laplace transformation technique of the governing diffusivity equations and the accompanying initial and boundary conditions. The exact solution is validated against numerical results obtained from a black-oil reservoir simulator for two cases. The solution is approximated into simple forms in real-time domain considering different time periods. Then, a graphical semi-log analysis technique based on the approximate solutions is provided as an interpretation tool of falloff tests where the fluid mobilities and the extents of dry-out zone and CO<sub>2</sub> plume can be inferred. The interpretation technique is applied to synthetic falloff test data to investigate its potential and reliability.","Elsevier","","Southern States Energy Board, Peachtree Corners, GA (United States)","USDOE Office of Fossil Energy (FE)","","United States","2020-10-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: C","","Medium: ED; Size: Article No. 103160","","","FE0031557; CFDA 81.089","Journal ID: ISSN 1750-5836; PII: S1750583620305855","10.1016/j.ijggc.2020.103160","","2022-08-29T00:00:00Z","1849262","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1849262","https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1849262","International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control","C","103"

The chemical nature of the species remaining on the catalyst surface before and after SFR was analyzed by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Zeolite pore structure played an important role not only in hydrocarbon deposition during alkylation but also in hydrocarbon transformation and removal during SFR. During SFR, the formation of unsaturated cyclic or polycyclic compounds, which likely affects catalyst long-term activity after cyclic alkylation/SFR treatments, was hindered on beta zeolites and favored on catalysts containing periodic expansions or cages, such as Y and L zeolites.","","","Idaho National Lab.

Catalyst samples were deactivated in a controlled manner by running them to either to a fixed butene conversion level of 95% or a fixed time on stream of three hours, and then exposing the catalyst to supercritical isobutane to restore activity. Activity recovery was determined by comparing alkylation activity before and after the regeneration step. Both single and multiple regenerations were performed. Use of a 95% butene conversion level criterion to terminate the reaction step afforded 86% activity recovery for a single regeneration and provided nine sequential reaction steps for the multiple regeneration studies. Employing a fixed 3 h time on stream criterion resulted in nearly complete activity recovery for a single regeneration, and 24 reaction steps were demonstrated in sequence for the multiple regeneration process, producing only minor product yield declines per step.

On the clean Fe(100) surface upon adsorption at 100 K, the S-H and C-S bonds of the neopentyl thiol cleave, resulting in adsorbed S, H, and neopentyl alkyl fragments, in contrast to the formation of the alkyl thiolate observed on the adsorption of n-alkane thiols on this surface. Upon heating, some neopentyl alkyl fragments react with adsorbed surface hydrogen to evolve neopentane at 260 K. On the oxygen-modified surface, only S-H bond cleavage is observed, and a neopentyl thiolate surface species is formed. No initial neopentane evolution from the oxygen-modified surface is observed upon heating. However, on both surfaces, isobutene and trace amounts of neopentane are seen to desorb at 380 K as a result of an elimination reaction pathway for the majority of the remaining neopentyl hydrocarbon species.

The reactor temperature ranged from 620 K to 810 K and flow rates of the reactant gases neopentane, oxygen, and nitrogen were 0.285, 7.6, and 137.1 standard liter per minute (SLM), respectively, producing an equivalence ratio of 0.3. Initial simulations identified some deficiencies in the existing model and the paper presents modifications which included upgrading the thermodynamic parameters of alkyl radical and alkylperoxy radical species, adding an alternative isomerization reaction of hydroperoxy-neopentyl-peroxy, and a multistep reaction sequence for 2-methylpropan-2-yl radical with molecular oxygen. These changes improved the calculation for the overall reactivity and the concentration profiles of the following primary products: formaldehyde, acetone, isobutene; 3,3-dimethyloxetane, methacrolein, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water. Experiments indicate that neopentane shows negative temperature coefficient behavior similar to other alkanes, though it is not as pronounced as that shown by n-pentane for example. Modeling results indicate that this behavior is caused by the {beta}-scission of the neopentyl radical and the chain propagation reactions of the hydroperoxyl-neopentyl radical.","","","","USDOE, Washington, DC (United States)","","United States","1999-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Combustion and Flame; Journal Volume: 118; Journal Issue: 3; Other Information: PBD: Aug 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 415-430","","","W-7405-ENG-48","Journal ID: CBFMAO; ISSN 0010-2180; TRN: IM9931%%255","10.1016/S0010-2180(99)00014-0","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","355734","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/355734","","Combustion and Flame","3","118"

One of the most promising applications of ZSM-5 zeolites is the kinetic separation of alkane isomers for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Isobutane diffusivities in ZSM-5 zeolite have been measured by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and supported membrane techniques. This is the first diffusivity measurement of a branched alkane inside a zeolite of MFI type using a microscopic method. The self-diffusion coefficient derived from QENS is 3 {times} 10{sup {minus}12} m{sup 2}/s at 500 K. The diffusivity obtained with the supported membrane is 1 order of magnitude larger. In view of the large differences usually reported in the literature between microscopic and macroscopic techniques, the comparison between QENS and supported membrane data is quite satisfactory. The activation energy for diffusion determined from QENS is 27 kJ/mol. Because of the variation of loading due to temperature changes, an apparent activation energy is obtained with the supported membrane; it is 34 kJ/mol. In this zeolite, the diffusion of branched hydrocarbons is much slower than that of linear alkanes; the diffusion coefficient of isobutane is found to be 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of n-butane by QENS.","","","","","","United States","1999-02-18T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical; Journal Volume: 103; Journal Issue: 7; Other Information: PBD: 18 Feb 1999","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 1096-1101","","","","Journal ID: JPCBFK; ISSN 1089-5647; TRN: IM9918%%35","10.1021/jp982897g","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","335250","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/335250","","Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Materials, Surfaces, Interfaces, amp Biophysical","7","103"

The quality of the membranes is judged on the basis of the n-butane/i-butane permselectivity. Membranes with a different n-butane/i-butane permselectivity showed an identical separation capacity for ethane/methane mixtures, but the quality difference was affecting separation of hydrogen from the butane isomers. The selectivity of the membrane is significantly affected by the operating conditions, such as mixture composition, temperature, and absolute pressure. These effects are shown for ethane/methane, propene/ethene, and n-butane/i-butane mixtures. The selectivity for ethane in ethane/methane mixtures, found when the zeolite layer is facing the feed side, is completely lost when the orientation of the composite membrane is reversed, due to concentration polarization. Depending on the membrane orientation, the major resistance of the composite is in the support layer or in the zeolite layer.","","","","USDOE","","United States","1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 37; Journal Issue: 10; Other Information: PBD: Oct 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 4071-4083","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9831%%252","10.1021/ie980250c","","2016-05-17T00:00:00Z","669990","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/669990","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","10","37"

Dihydrogen evolution was observed during butane isomerization over fresh catalysts, as well as over catalysts selectively poisoned by preadsorbed ammonia. Butane isomerization over sulfated-zirconia can be viewed as a surface chain reaction comprised of initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The primary initiation step in the absence of feed olefins is considered to be the dehydrogenation of butane over sulfated-zirconia, generating butenes which adsorb onto acid sites to form protonated olefinic species associated with the conjugate base form of the acid sites. Quantum-chemical calculations, employing density-functional theory, suggest that the dissociative adsorption of dihydrogen, isobutylene hydrogenation, and dissociative adsorption of isobutane are feasible over the sulfated-zirconia cluster, and these reactions take place over Zr-O sites.","","","","","","United States","1998-09-10T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 178; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: 10 Sep 1998","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 489-498","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: IM9829%%120","10.1006/jcat.1998.2163","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","659088","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/659088","","Journal of Catalysis","2","178"

"Isobutane dehydrogenation on Pt-Sn/SiO{sub 2} catalysts: Effect of preparation variables and regeneration treatments","Stagg, S M; Alvarez, W E; Resasco, D E","02 PETROLEUM; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; FUEL ADDITIVES; SYNTHESIS; SILICA; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; 2-METHYLPROPANE; DEHYDROGENATION; PLATINUM; TIN; CALCINATION; CATALYSTS; CHEMISORPTION; COKING; DEACTIVATION; IMPREGNATION; OXIDATION; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE","The dehydrogenation of isobutane was studied under severely deactivating conditions, i.e., high temperatures and in the absence of added H{sub 2}, over silica-supported Pt-Sn catalysts. Several preparation methods were investigated. It was found that the impregnation method employed has a strong influence on the degree of Pt-Sn interaction and the fraction of Pt that remains unalloyed after the calcination and reduction process. The co-impregnation methods investigated were significantly superior to the sequential method. It was found that it is important to minimize the amount of unalloyed Pt left on the catalyst because this fraction rapidly forms coke and deactivates. At the same time, the fraction of unalloyed Pt, rather than the one alloyed with Sn, is responsible for most of the CO and hydrogen adsorbed at room temperature in typical chemisorption measurements. As a consequence, the TOF values based on this type of measurements are in error because they are not related to the density of sites that are responsible for long term activity. It was also found that the high-temperature reduction/oxidation treatments usually employed to regenerate spent catalysts can have a detrimental effect on the activity and selectivity of the Pt-Sn/SiO{sub 2} catalysts. It is postulated that such thermal treatments lead to the disruption of the Pt-Sn alloys causing an increase in the fraction of unalloyed surface Pt. As a result, the rates of coke formation and deactivation drastically increase. The monometallic (Pt only) catalysts are also affected by the high-temperature reduction/oxidation processes. The oxidation treatment results in an increased rate of coke formation and deactivation, while the regeneration process results in a much smaller effect. This difference may be due to carbon residues left on the surface. 37 refs., 17 figs., 3 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1997-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 168; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: May 1997","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 75-94","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 97:004296-0008","10.1006/jcat.1997.1617","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","543386","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/543386","","Journal of Catalysis","1","168"

The preexponential factors and activation energies show a compensation effect for both the palladium and the platinum catalysts. The trend in activation energies is compared with hydrogen TPD studies. Pressure dependence studies (in excess hydrogen) show reaction orders of approximately -2 and 0.8 for hydrogen and neopentane, respectively, except for hydrogenolysis over Pd/KL which exhibits reaction orders of {approximately}-4 and 0.64, respectively.

A series of calculations were performed to determine coordination numbers for the first three coordination shells for different ideal particle morphologies (spherical, hemispherical, cylindrical, and disc-like). The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results suggest the formation of {approximately}10 and 16 atom disc-like particles, for 2 and 3 wt% Pd/K L-zeolite, respectively. The lattice expansion for the 3 wt% Pd/K L-zeolite is consistent with chemisorption and TPD of hydrogen and indicates a bulk hydride formation.

While methanol synthesis from syngas is a well established process, the work on higher alcohol synthesis has been less successful. The demand for MTBE (Methyl-tert-butylether) is shifting the interest from higher linear alcohols towards the branched members, mainly isobutanol. The application of slurry reactors for exothermic reactions has gained considerable interest in the industrial and academic world. For synthesis gas conversions the LPMeOH process by Air Products is a well known example. This prompted us to apply this technology to isobutanol synthesis which runs under more extreme reaction conditions. Because of much easier and faster handling and the necessity to compare results from slurry reactions with the fixed bed reactions cited in literature fixed bed reactor systems are preferred for catalyst development and optimization. The main differences e.g. temperature gradients, backmixing and particle sizes will obviously have major influence on a reaction which mechanistically consists of a network from parallel and consecutive steps. Due to this objective, a fixed bed reactor study has been performed running a typical isobutanol catalyst with different particle sizes and linear velocities. The catalyst developed by us consists of a potassium promoted ZrO{sub 2}/ZnO/MnO possessing high activity for isobutanol and methanol. These tests provide data to study the behaviour of residence time and temperature on reaction products. Furthermore mass transfer limitations which affect activity and selectivity can be determined.","","","","","","United States","1996-12-31T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry; Journal Volume: 41; Journal Issue: 3; Conference: 212. national meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS), Orlando, FL (United States), 25-30 Aug 1996; Other Information: PBD: 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 875-879","","CONF-960807-","","Journal ID: ACFPAI; ISSN 0569-3772; TRN: 97:000002-0024","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","420523","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/420523","","Preprints of Papers, American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry","3","41"

It is well-known that this reaction is accompanied by a rapid deactivation of the catalyst. The objective of this study is to elucidate the route to catalyst deactivation so that the means of mitigating this problem can be identified. Using the initial reaction rate data, evidence has been found for a Broensted acid mechanism. Under liquid-phase conditions, the reaction has been found to be severely diffusion limited. Using a kinetic model that accounts for the effect of diffusion, it was found that alkylation over this catalyst suffers from slow hydride transfer relative to olefin addition. This gives rise to a rapid formation of C{sub 12}{sup +} carbocations. The formation of these cations has been tied to catalyst deactivation, using a mathematical model for the reaction. On the basis of the insight gained from the experiments and modeling work, optimal reactor and catalyst design issues are examined. It is inferred from the reaction mechanism and confirmed experimentally that alkylation under pulsed flow conditions yields higher trimethylpentane/dimethylhexane ratios and slower rates of deactivation. It is suggested that the cause of the slow rate of hydride transfer is steric hindrance. Strategies for relieving this steric hindrance are proposed.","","","","","","United States","1996-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research; Journal Volume: 35; Journal Issue: 11; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 3861-3873","","","","Journal ID: IECRED; ISSN 0888-5885; TRN: IM9653%%143","10.1021/ie960172y","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","404541","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/404541","","Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research","11","35"

Potassium-doped catalysts containing increasing amounts of alkali metal also were prepared and characterized. The reactivity of the samples in isobutane dehydrogenation was tested, and the effect of chromium and potassium loading was examined. The results were analyzed and compared with data from the scientific literature in order to draw up a model of this catalytic system. It is proposed that in samples calcined at 600{degrees}C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr{sup 6+} species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr{sup 6+} and Cr{sup 3+} oxide species. This latter Cr{sup 6+} species could be removed by a treatment with water, and thus was not grafted to the support. Crystalline {alpha}-Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3} was found only for the higher chromium oxide loading. In spent catalysts all the chromium was present in the Cr{sup 3+} form; the Cr{sup 3+} species formed by reduction in the reaction environment of the Cr{sup 6+} species were less active than the Cr{sup 3+} species in dispersed Cr{sup 3+} oxide. The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO{sub 3} loading (15.3 wt% CrO{sub 3}) which showed a lower activity. The addition of potassium led to the formation of a potassium chromate phase, the formation of which occurred at the expense of the dispersed Cr{sup 3+} oxide and of {alpha}Cr{sub 2}O{sub 3}. The catalytic activity was generally inhibited by the addition of potassium, except for the catalyst containing 15.3 wt% CrO{sub 3}. In this case an increase in activity was achieved by addition of amounts of potassium lower than 1 wt% K{sub 2}O. 56 refs., 15 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1996-01-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 158; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Jan 1996","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 236-250","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001881-0023","10.1006/jcat.1996.0023","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","223985","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/223985","","Journal of Catalysis","1","158"

When the reactions were carried out it 110{degrees}C and 1 MPa with {sup 18}O-ethanol and {sup 16}O-isobutanol over the Amberlyst-35 resin catalyst, 95% of the major product ethyl isobutyl ether (EIBE) contained {sup 16}O, while 96% of the minor product ethyl tertiarybutyl ether (ETBE) contained {sup 18}O. Similar results were obtained with methanol and isobutanol over Nafion-H and Amberlyst-35 catalysts, with methyl isobutyl ether (MIBE) and methyl tertiarybutyl ether (MTBE) as the products. These results indicate that EIBE (MIBE) was produced by a surface-catalyzed S{sub N}2 reaction, while the ETBE (MTBE) product arose via a carbenium intermediate.

"Effects of potassium on silica-supported Pt and Pt/Sn catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation","Cortright, R D; Dumesic, J A","40 CHEMISTRY; 02 PETROLEUM; POTASSIUM; CATALYTIC EFFECTS; SILICA; PLATINUM; TIN; 2-METHYLPROPANE; DEHYDROGENATION; CATALYST SUPPORTS; CATALYSTS; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE; TEMPERATURE RANGE 0400-1000 K; CALORIMETRY; ABSORPTION HEAT; CHEMICAL REACTION KINETICS","Isobutane conversion was studied over silica-supported Pt, Pt/Sn, and Pt/Sn/K catalysts at temperatures from 673 to 773 K. The addition of tin to Pt/SiO{sub 2} suppresses isobutane isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, and decreases to a smaller extent the activity for isobutane dehydrogenation. The addition of potassium to Pt/Sn/SiO{sub 2} promotes isobutane dehydrogenation, increases the dehydrogenation selectivity, and improves resistance of the catalyst to deactivation. The additions of tin and potassium lead to the formation of smaller ensembles of surface platinum atoms, and the hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coking reactions are thereby suppressed. Microcalorimetric measurements of hydrogen and carbon monoxide adsorption indicate that the addition of potassium to Pt/SiO{sub 2} and Pt/Sn/SiO{sub 2} does not significantly alter the heats of adsorption of these molecules, whereas potassium increases the saturation extent of hydrogen adsorption and decreases the extent of carbon monoxide adsorption. The rate of isobutane dehydrogenation becomes zero order with respect to hydrogen pressure over Pt/SiO{sub 2} at hydrogen pressures lower than 75 Torr, and dissociative adsorption of isobutane appears to control the dehydrogenation rate. The dehydrogenation reaction is negative order with respect to hydrogen over both Pt/Sn/SiO{sub 2} and Pt/Sn/K/SiO{sup 2} catalysts, indicating a higher coverage of hydrogen at the active sites. The increased dehydrogenation rate over Pt/Sn/K/SiO{sub 2} may be attributed to the increased number of sites available for removal of hydrogen from adsorbed isobutane and perhaps also to the stabilization of molecularly adsorbed isobutane. 36 refs., 5 figs., 6 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 157; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 576-583","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001538-0029","10.1006/jcat.1995.1322","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","224027","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/224027","","Journal of Catalysis","2","157"

Catalysts with 0, 2.6, 4.5, and 6.5% F were pretreated in flowing oxygen either at 500 or 650{degrees}C. Only the products of dehydrogenation and demethanation were obtained on pure alumina; the rate of reaction was about one order of magnitude higher when the catalyst was pretreated at 650{degrees}C than when it was pretreated at 500{degrees}C. Paraffins, including neopentane, were also produced over fluorided aluminas; on catalysts pretreated at 650{degrees}C while dehydrogenation and demethanation decreased, paraffin formation increased with time on stream (TOS). Over the catalysts with 4.5 and 6.5% F the rate of hydride transfer-producing paraffins exceeded that of initiation (H{sub 2} + CH{sub 4} formation) by a factor of from 2 to 3. All of the catalysts were more active than silica-alumina for isobutane conversion. IR spectra from pyridine adsorbed on catalysts with 0-4.5% F and pretreated either at 500 or 650{degrees}C showed no evidence of a band of 1540-50 cm{sup -1} assignable to pyridinium ion formed by interaction between pyridine and Bronsted acid sites. On the catalyst with 6.5% F this band appeared when the catalyst was pretreated at either 500 or 650{degrees}C. Isobutane can be dehydrogenated and demethanated over the dual acid-base pair sites of the alumina. The increasing paraffin formation with TOS may result from new and additional Bronsted sites introduced during dehydrogenation. 22 refs., 7 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 157; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 721-729","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 96:001538-0045","10.1006/jcat.1995.1338","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","224043","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/224043","","Journal of Catalysis","2","157"

In the international LPG market, demand growth is particularly strong in the developing markets in Asia. Demand has risen sharply in China, requiring significant imports to balance the market. Overall net LPG imports to Asia will continue to expand through 2000 as demand growth continues to outpace regional supply build-up. In North America, increased NGL demand is resulting from strong growth in petrochemical-feedstock markets. The surge in olefin demand experienced in 1994 has led to a noticeable expansion in total feedstock requirements. This trend, combined with a reasonably flat outlook on regional NGL supplies, should result in a continuation of the tightening in regional NGL supply and demand, particularly for ethane and propane. Natural gas prices have eased somewhat relative to 1993 and early 1994. Gas-processing economics have therefore improved since along with the long-term outlook for industry profitability. The paper discusses world demand, world supply, international trade, US processing, US NGL supply, and products` futures.","","","","","","United States","1995-06-12T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil and Gas Journal; Journal Volume: 93; Journal Issue: 24; Other Information: PBD: 12 Jun 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 56-65","","","","Journal ID: OIGJAV; ISSN 0030-1388; TRN: IM9526%%62","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","61281","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/61281","","Oil and Gas Journal","24","93"

Olefin desorption and isomerization reactions are at quasi-equilibrium, with the former reactions determining the surface carbenium ion coverages. Microcalorimetric measurements of ammonia adsorption show that catalyst steaming leads to a decrease in the number and strength of acid sites. Decreasing the strength of Broensted acid sites results in decreasing surface carbenium ion coverages and decreasing rates of all reactions. The hydride ion transfer cycles are affected most by catalyst steaming, leading to lower paraffin selectivities. Lower temperatures and higher conversion increase carbenium ion coverages and favor hydride ion transfer cycles, leading to higher paraffin selectivities. 26 refs., 8 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 153; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Apr 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 65-75","","","FG02-84ER13183","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005916-0008","10.1006/jcat.1995.1108","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","98947","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/98947","","Journal of Catalysis","1","153"

The authors estimated kinetic parameters using transition state theory, the Evans-Polanyi correlation, and gas phase thermodynamic data. In order to relate the gas phase calculations to the catalyst surface, the authors introduced a parameter {triangle}H{sub +}, which is the heat of stabilization of a carbenium ion relative to the heat of stabilization of a proton in the zeolite framework. The model provided a good description of the experimental data for calcined and steamed catalysts with physically realistic kinetic parameters. The main difference between the two catalysts was the higher {triangle}H{sub +} for the steamed catalyst. This indicates that steaming decreased the Broensted acid strength of the catalyst. 60 refs., 7 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1995-04-15T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 153; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: 15 Apr 1995","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 54-64","","","FG02-84ER13183","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:005916-0007","10.1006/jcat.1995.1107","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","98946","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/98946","","Journal of Catalysis","1","153"

The final theoretical expression is compared against experimental data obtained in this study from the decomposition of ETBE over Amberlyst 15, as well as that reported in the literature for ETBE synthesis. It can thus be used with reasonable confidence for the calculation of the equilibrium constant, despite a dearth of thermodynamic data yet available in the literature for ETBE.

The authors have reported that framework Fe{sup 3+} in MFI-type ferrisilicate catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane into butenes more selectively than the Fe{sup 3+} ions in iron oxide supported on silicalite or Fe-exchanged ZSM-5. The Fe{sup 3+} ions in the latter two catalysts mainly catalyze the total oxidation of n-butane into CO{sub 2}. Iron oxide on silicate dehydrogenates butane beyond butenes to 1,3-butadiene, while ferrisilicate exhibits a low activity for the further dehydrogenation of butenes produced. It is impossible to dehydrogenate small branched alkanes such as isobutane beyond isobutene to a conjugated diene, or lower alkanes such as propane beyond propylene. Therefore, the dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of these catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane and propane may differ from those for the n-butane reaction. In this work, the authors report the catalytic properties of framework iron in MFI-type ferrisilicate for the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane and propane. A comparison of the activity and selectivity of ferrisilicate for these reactions with those of Fe-exchanged ZSM-5 and iron oxide supported on silicalite has been made. 6 refs., 1 tab.","","","","","","United States","1994-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 2; Other Information: PBD: Dec 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 439-440","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000935-0022","","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","47987","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/47987","","Journal of Catalysis","2","150"

The zeolite catalysts were prepared with hydrothermal methods by using pyrrolidine as a structure-directing template. The prepared materials have been characterized by SEM-EDX, XRD, FTIR, AA-ICP, TPD, BET surface area/pore size distributions, and pyridine chemisorption. Selectivities to isobutylene ranged from 85 to 95% and yields of isobutylene from 30 to 20%, depending on the space velocity of but-1-ene. Good stability in the catalytic activity for n-butene skeletal isomerization is an important characteristic of such ZMS-23 zeolites. Isobutylene is believed to be formed from n-butene via a methyl cyclopropane carbenium intermediate and this is a reversible process. Dimerization of butene molecules is a primary side reaction for n-butene skeletal isomerization. The dimerized products (octenes) are further cracked into propylene and pentenes via {beta}-scission of carbenium intermediates. Propylene, a product of the secondary reaction, is then dimerized to form hexenes or codimerized with butene to form heptenes. Conversion of but-1-ene to cis/trans-but-2-enes is greater than one predicts from thermodynamic equilibrium data. cis-But-2-ene is observed to be the preferential product for but-1-ene double bond migration. The preferential formation of cis-but-2-ene is due to a steric interaction of the methyl group in the secondary butyl carbenium intermediate with the pore wall of the small pore zeolite, ZSM-23. Zeolite ZSM-23 also shows shape selectivity for adsorption of ammonia, but-1-ene, and isobutylene. The shape selectivities of these materials are further improved after aging of catalysts used in but-1-ene skeletal isomerization. 26 refs., 14 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; Journal Volume: 150; Journal Issue: 1; Other Information: PBD: Nov 1994","","Medium: X; Size: pp. 34-45","","","","Journal ID: JCTLA5; ISSN 0021-9517; TRN: 95:000744-0004","10.1006/jcat.1994.1320","","2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","28668","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/28668","","Journal of Catalysis","1","150"

It is shown that this procedure allows one to obtain quantitative data on propene, n-butene, and isobutene reactivities in the hydrogen transfer steps of the reaction. The results demonstrate that in the absence of steric constraints (large pore HY and HM zeolites) isobutene is approximately 5 times more reactive in hydrogen transfer than n-butene. The latter, in turn, is about 1.3 times more reactive than propene. With medium pore HZSM-5, steric inhibition of the hydrogen transfer between n-hexane and isobutene is observed. This results in a sharp decrease in the isobutene reactivity: over HZSM-5 zeolites isobutene is only 1.2 times more reactive in hydrogen transfer than n-butene. On the basis of these data it is concluded that the [beta]-test measures the [open quotes]real[close quotes] hydrogen transfer activity of zeolites, i.e., the activity that summarizes the effects of the acidic and structural properties of zeolites. An attempt is made to estimate the [open quotes]ideal[close quotes] zeolite hydrogen transfer activity, i.e., the activity determined by the zeolite acidic properties only. The estimations obtained show that this activity is approximately 1.8 and 1.6 times higher for HM zeolite in comparison with HZSM-5 and HY zeolites, respectively. 16 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1994-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 147:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 494-499","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1994.1166","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7102713","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7102713","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","147:2"

Available methods of separation include selective extraction with a liquid solvent (usually an acid); the use of addition reactions with suitable alcohols, acids, or water; selective polymerization and physical separation by absorbents. Three currently important separation processes for isobutylene production are an extraction route using mineral acid, the dehydration of tert-butanol, and the cracking of MTBE. As part of the research into solid acid catalysis for the generation of glycol tert-butyl monoethers, the authors have demonstrated an alternative C-4 separation process using solid inorganic acid catalysts and involving the intermediate preparation of glycol ethers. This new C-4 separation scheme could be particularly attractive to existing glycol producers who may also have a market, or internal need, for glycol monoalkyl ethers, as well as those who do not have MTBE capacity but still require pure isobutylene as a chemical intermediate or comonomer building block.

Here, they present their findings regarding these data using this new methodology and the mechanistic postulates of the original authors. In order to determine the reaction pathway probabilities (RPPs), these methods require that one only consider the results obtained under initial conditions.

Experimental runs were made with the following hydrocarbons: 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, 2,3-dimethylpentane, two commercial alkylates, and mixtures of isobutane and alkylates. Both alkylate quality and quantity decreased significantly due primarily to the degradation reactions of both commercial alkylates and trimethylpentanes.

Initial sticking probabilities for both molecules on Pt(111) and the surface alloys at temperatures below the monolayer desorption threshold are essentially unity (S[sub 0] [>=] 0.95). The monolayer saturation coverages of n-butane and isobutane were also independent of the amount of Sn in the surface layer. The desorption activation energies measured by TPD for the monolayer states of both n-butane and isobutane progressively decrease by 5-8 kJ/mol compared to Pt(111) as the surface concentration of Sn increases from 0.25 to 0.33 atom fraction in the respective surface alloys. The decrease in the desorption activation energy scales linearly with the Sn concentration. No thermal decomposition of either molecule on any surface occurred during TPD measurements.

By measuring product initial selectivities it has been found that protolytic cracking and bimolecular reactions take place on Broensted acid sites. In this way the contributions of bimolecular reactions involving hydride transfer have been separated from those responsible for chain transfer and those producing hydrogen transfer. Chain transfer accounts for the chain propagation in paraffin cracking, while hydrogen transfer produces the extra paraffin amounts obtained in these reactions. Hydrogen transfer reactions increase, but chain transfer reactions decrease when the unit cell size increases.

Emphasis is placed on the dependence of ignition delay on compressed gas temperature, on the evolution of reaction as portrayed in the pressure-time records and on features of light output associated with single and two-stage ignition. Two-stage ignition is a clear feature of the n-alkane combustion at low compressed gas temperatures. Single-stage ignition is apparent at somewhat higher compressed gas temperatures, but there is evidence of the first stage reaction having occurred during the final stages of compression in some circumstances. Engine-knock related pressure waves are associated with the autoignition of the n-alkanes, to a lesser extent with the branched chain structures, but not at all with toluene under the present experimental conditions. These general features and also the relationship of the measured pressures to average gas temperatures attained during the ignition delay period are discussed.

Well-homogenized Pd-Co particles exhibit a very pronounced minimum in the plot of catalytic activity versus Pd-Co alloy composition. At the same time, a maximum exists in the isomerization selectivity vs the alloy composition. These deviations from the catalytic behavior of physical mixtures of the monometallic (Pd and Co) catalysts provide a basis for the estimation of how two metals interact with each other in a supported catalyst. Incipient wetness impregnation of silica by considerable amounts (10 wt%) of metal salts leads to the formation of catalyst precursors which are fully reduced at 380[degrees]C yielding good dispersion and lateral homogeneity. Chemisorption and in situ XRD studies are compatible with the kinetic investigations, but information on metal interaction by these methods is less clear.

Variation of the charge compensating ion (Li[sup +], K[sup +], or Ca[sup 2+]) in L has only a moderate effect on the catalytic parameters, due either to variations in the heat of physisorption or to [open quotes]electronic[close quotes] effects on Pd. The reduction temperature, T[sub r], of Pd/L samples that have previously been calcined at 250[degrees]C, strongly affects the catalytic performance: after T[sub r] 250[degrees]C, sufficient NH[sub 3] ligands of the ion exchanges Pd(NH[sub 3])[sub 4][sup 2+] ions survive to neutralize the protons that are formed during reduction; catalytic activity then increased during reaction while NH[sub 4][sup +] ions decompose and Pd-proton adducts of high catalytic activity are formed. At T[sub r] = 400[degrees]C, the NH[sub 3] ligands are destroyed and this catalyst is stable and very active. Activity, selectivity, and kinetic parameters depend on the structure of the support; apparent activation energies, E[sub a], are in the range of 45-55 kcal/mol for Pd/Y, but 75-90 kcal/mol for Pd/L. A linear relation between E[sub a], are in the range of 45-55 kcal/mol for Pd/Y, but 75-90 kcal/mol for Pd/L. A linear relation between E[sub a] and log of the preexponential factor is obtained. While classical pore-diffusion operates in Y, single-file diffusion appears more likely in L; i.e., channels tend to be plugged with physisorbed molecules at low temperature. The difficulty of primary reaction products to escape from the pores correlated with a higher fraction of secondary products observed for Pd/L vis-a-vis Pd/SiO[sub 2]. It is conceivable that different diffusion types also contribute to the different E[sub a] values for zeolites with three-dimensional or unidimensional channel systems. 20 refs., 5 figs., 4 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-06-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 141:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 337-346","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5; CNN: CTS-8911184/02","10.1006/jcat.1993.1144","","2016-04-18T00:00:00Z","6153670","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6153670","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","141:2"

These reactions produced a wide range of products ranging from alkenes, dienes, anhydrides, acids, and carbon oxides. Broadly speaking, the major products were dehydrogenation products over Mg[sub 3](VO[sub 4])[sub 2], combustion products over Mg[sub 2]V[sub 2]O[sub 7], and oxygen-containing organic products over (VO)[sub 2]P[sub 2]O[sub 7], although there are exceptions to this broad generalization. From the product selectivities, the moles of oxygen consumed per mole of alkane reacted could be calculated. These were the average oxygen stoichiometries for the reactions. They had values of about unity for ethane oxidation over VPO, about two when oxidative dehydrogenation was the predominant reactions, and about four for the other reactions studied. The selectivity patterns in terms of the formation of dehydrogenation products versus oxygen-containing products including carbon oxides were explained by assuming that there existed a selectivity-determining step, which could be the reaction of the surface alkyl species or the adsorbed alkene before its desorption. The formation of oxygen-containing products would be facilitated if the surface alkyl or adsorbed alkene could interact with the vanadium ions in two adjacent VO[sub x] units such that it could easily react with the reactive oxygen in the V-O-V bridge. The results of ethane oxidation, however, could not be explained simply by this model, and other factors needed to be considered. 48 refs., 5 figs., 7 tabs.","","","","","","United States","1993-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 140:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 226-242","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA5","10.1006/jcat.1993.1080","","2016-04-08T00:00:00Z","6130768","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6130768","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","140:1"

In both catalyst series the platinum nominal loading was maintained constant at 1 wt%. The loading of the second metal component was varied. An effort has been made to better understand the reactivity trends in these catalysts, by bringing the neopentane reactivity data into context with previously obtained n-hexane reaction results and extensive catalyst characterization data. Small amounts of tin (1.0 Pt-0.1 Sn/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}) caused the neopentane isomerization selectivity to drop in comparison to monometallic 1.0 Pt/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}. However, further addition of tin up to 1.0 wt% caused the neopentane isomerization selectivity to increase above that of the monometallic 1.0 Pt/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} sample. On adding excess tin (5.0 wt%) the activity of the catalyst became prohibitively low. Hence, there seemed to be an optimum loading of tin giving desirable selectivity characteristics at reasonable activity levels. The differences in isomerization selectivity in the case of the Pt-Au/SiO{sub 2} catalysts were not as significant as those observed for the Pt-Sn/Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} catalysts. The trends in catalytic behavior were consistent with previously measured n-hexane reaction trend and could be interpreted on the basis of microstructural differences between the bimetallic catalysts. The effect of gold appeared to be mainly a geometric one, disrupting larger Pt ensembles. On the other hand, the role of tin appeared to go beyond a simple geometric effect.","","","","","","United States","1991-12-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (United States); Journal Volume: 132:2","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 451-464","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(91)90162-W","","2016-04-07T00:00:00Z","6984560","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6984560","","Journal of Catalysis; (United States)","","132:2"

Isobutylene interacts with Bronsted acid sites of the zeolites at a temperature of ca. 123 K to form a hydrogen-bonded species, as indicated by 2{sup 13}{Delta}{delta} value (relative to the 2-{sup 13}C resonance of isobutylene) of 12 ppm in HY and a {Delta}{delta} value of 16 ppm in HZSM-5. The greater {Delta}{delta} value observed for hydrogen-bonded isobutylene in HZSM-5 is consistent with the acid sites in HZSM-5 being more acidic than those in HY. The maximum number of hydrogen-bonded species detected did not exceed the number of Bronsted acid sites in the zeolites. As the temperature was raised from 123 K, hydrogen-bonded isobutylene was presumably converted to an unobserved symmetrical intermediate (a tert-butylcarbenium ion) that either underwent deprotonation to re-form isobutylene and the acid site or reacted with another isobutylene molecule to form a dimer. Evidence for this process included scrambling between the 1- and 3-{sup 13}C labels of isobutylene. In all of the spectra obtained by either cross polarization or single-pulse excitation, no peaks were observed that could be assigned to a surface-bound silyl ether species. However, in experiments performed on the 2-methyl-2-propanol-2-{sup 13}C/HZSM-5 system, the formation of a surface-bound tert-butyl silyl ether species was observed, as was reported earlier by another laboratory.","","","","","","United States","1991-11-14T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States); Journal Volume: 95:23","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 9420-9425","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0022-3654; CODEN: JPCHA","10.1021/j100176a071","","2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","7273922","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7273922","","Journal of Physical Chemistry; (United States)","","95:23"

As a result, there is a distinct possibility that the private marginal cost curve of energy producers lies to the left or right of the true cost curve. If so, social welfare will not be maximized, and underconsumption or overconsumption of fuels will exist. The occurrence of energy catastrophes and observance of the market reaction to these occurrences indicates that overconsumption of energy has been the case in the past.

The reaction rate, per accessible Pd atom, correlates with the proton content of the catalysts; for samples that contain all the protons generated during H{sub 2} reduction of Pd, it is two orders of magnitude higher than that for Pd/SiO{sub 2}. Samples prepared by reduction of Pd(NH{sub 3}){sub 2}{sup 2+} NaY display an intermediate activity. It is suggested that Pd-proton adducts are highly active sites in neopentane conversion. With methylcyclopentane as a catalytic probe, all Pd/NaHY samples deactivate rapidly and coke is deposited. Temperature-programmed oxidation reveals two types of coke, one of which correlates with the proton concentration in the catalyst. 41 refs.","","","","","","United States","1990-05-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Journal of Catalysis; (USA); Journal Volume: 123:1","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 60-73","","","","Journal ID: ISSN 0021-9517; CODEN: JCTLA","10.1016/0021-9517(90)90157-F","","2016-05-27T00:00:00Z","6352304","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6352304","","Journal of Catalysis; (USA)","","123:1"

Reactor isobutane/olefin ration, thruput and temperature are the major control variables in the reactor section. While alkylate Reid vapor pressure and product compositions are desired control variables for the fractionation towers. Feed impurities and variable operating conditions in a refinery alkylation unit produce many undesirable side reactions. Most of the side products such as acid-soluble oil (polymer) and heavy alkylate are detrimental to the alkylate product quality and the unit operation. Polymerication is very harmful because it not only produces the tar that spends the catalyst, but also reduces the yield of valuable products. Improved control of the reactor's total feed composition and operating conditions can provide economic benefits such as improved quality and yield of alkylate, and reduced acid consumption. Improved control in the distillation section of the unit can assure Reid vapor pressure (RVP) control of the alkylate product, reduce the propane and normal butane diluents in the reactor recycle streams, reduce isobutane losses in the unit product streams, and reduce unit utility costs.","","","Process Performance Co.","","","United States","1986-11-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Hydrocarbon Process.; (United States); Journal Volume: 65:11","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 113-120","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: HYPRA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7040576","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7040576","","Hydrocarbon Process.; (United States)","","65:11"

The reactor, operating isothermally, was made of glass tubing and was attached to the boiler with external heathers and the dephlegmator. It was determined that the course of alkylation of isobutane with butenes depends significantly on the reaction conditions, and primarilly on the ratio of isobutane to butenes in the reaction zone. Alkylation experiments of high dilutions of butenes revealed a series of consecutive processes, which can't be identified at low dilution because of their superposition. The influence of dilution is manifested mainly through the character and subsequent transformation of the active complexes formed on the catalyst surface. Therefore conditions in which formation and subsequent transformation of the active complexes proceed gradually should be regarded as favorable for alkylation.","","","Institute of Physical Organic Chemistry, Ukrainian SSR","","","United States","1985-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

Petroleum and synthetic white oils used for compressor lubrication in other countries were investigated for comparison. The viscosity was measured as a function of pressure (up to 200 MPa) by the falling-weight method (a cylinder with spherical ends) at 50/sup 0/, 80/sup 0/, and 100/sup 0/C. The results indicate that the pressure coefficient of viscosity decreases with increasing temperature. It is concluded that the use of the additives not only improves the viscosity-temperature properties of the oils, but in the case of the more viscous oils, it also ensures that they will have a relatively low pressure coefficient of viscosity.","","","All-Union Sci-Res Inst for Petroleum Processing","","","United States","1984-09-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Chem.

The driving forces making MTBE an attractive investment are examined with regard to the increasing demand for higher octane unleaded gasolines. The decision to proceed with MTBE production depends on the profitability of such an investment and the refiner's ability to meet market demands using available processing equipment, refinery produced streams and external feedstocks. The factors affecting this decision are analyzed in this paper and include: industry ability to meet rising octane demand; profit potential realized by diverting isobutylene to MTBE; availability of technology for producing MTBE; and investment and operating costs required to produce MTBE. Chemical Research and Licensing and NEOCHEM have developed a simple, low cost process to produce MTBE, reducing the excessive equipment and high operating costs that were associated with conventional MTBE designs. The economics and process benefits of installing a CRandL/NEOCHEM MTBE process are examined within the framework of a generalized medium-sized refinery configuration.","","","Neochem Corporation, Bellaire, TX","","","United States","1983-03-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Natl.

Although a linear program or similar analytical technique is often the best way to determine blendstock values, a less rigorous calculation can be used for simpler problems. Examples are given to show how relative values for blendstocks are determined for octane number and vapor pressure improvements. Recent market prices and typical gasoline compositions are used. However, the valuation approach is general so that current market prices and other gasoline compositions can be analyzed. Valuation of blendstocks is an integral part of modern refinery economic analysis, and applications include: evaluation of purchased blendstocks such as oxygenates, natural gasoline, mixed butanes, reformate, etc.; adjustment of contract prices for variations in blendstocks quality; analysis and process economics of isomerization, alkylation and reforming; and optimization of fractionation cut points and blendstock disposition.

One of the problem areas is cold starting and warm-up driveability. High heats of vaporation and low vapor pressures at low temperatures of the alcohols are the cause of these problems. Current solutions include electric heating, separate fuel supply, and the addition of volatile components to the alcohol such as gasoline, isopentane and dimethyl ether. The alcohols typically are as clean burning or cleaner burning than gasoline. The effect on regulated emissions from using additives needs to be included in the evaluation of cold starting additives. This assessment should include consideration of total hydrocarbons as well as detailed hydrocarbons for photochemical impact and flame ionization detector responsivity.

Reduction of the catalyst by the reaction medium increases the rate of secondary reactions and reduces diene yield in dehydrogenation of butylenes, which is due to the formation of zero-valent nickel on the surface of calcium-nickel phosphate catalyst. It was found possible in a number of studies to effect transition of Ni/sup 2 +/ ..-->.. Ni/sup 0/ during treatment of the catalyst with hydrogen. It may be assumed from these studies that to suppress cracking and coke-formation, it is necessary to introduce into the catalyst modifying additives, which prevent the reduction of bivalent nickel or block the reduced nickel. When studying dehydrogenation of cyclohexane on nickel catalysts it was found that the addition to the catalyst of zinc oxide and non-transition metal oxides results in the suppression of hydrogenolysis of cyclohexane. This paper presents results of an investigation of the transformation of cyclohexane and isoamylenes on calcium-nickel-phosphate catalysts modified by strontium and zinc cations. The effect of these modifiers on the reduction of calcium-nickel-phosphate catalysts was also studied.

This problem is especially acute in the production of hydrocarbon raw materials including pentane fractions. The initial stage in development of a technological process based on rectification is study of liquid-vapor equilibrium in the mixtures to be separated. Sulfur compounds in pentane fractions consist mainly of ethanethiol (ETH) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS). A Swietoslawski apparatus of the circulation type, made of metal, was used for studying liquid-vapor equilibrium. Isopentane (iso-C/sub 5/) and ETH purified by distillation, and n-pentane (N-C/sub 5/) and DMS of ''pure'' grade, were used in the experiments. Experimental data on equilibrium in the binary systems are presented. Results show that the experimental and calculated data on liquid-vapor equilibrium are in good agreement. The values obtained for the constants of the Wilson equation can be used for calculations of equilibria in these mixtures over wide ranges of concentration.","","","All-Union Scientific-Research Inst. of Hydrocarbon Raw Materials, USSR","","","United States","1981-10-20T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

This is due both to the instability of market prices for ethylene and the shortage of isobutane - a raw material for these large-tonnage production processes and for the synthetic rubber industry. The latter difficulty can be overcome by combining processes of isomerization of n-butane and alkylation of the resultant isobutane with ethylene in a single reaction unit. The possibility of combining these reactions using AlCl/sub 3/-based catalysts has been pointed out previously but in the literature there are no theoretical developments of technology or thermodynamic substantiation of a combined process. We have made a thermodynamic calculation of the consecutive (series-parallel) reactions of isomerization and alkylation with the goal of determining suitable technological conditions for carrying them out simultaneously and establishing the expected equilibrium yields of target products and the compositions of the reaction mixture.","","","","","","United States","1981-08-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Sov.

It is evident that there exist two consecutive relaxation processes within this frequency range, each of which has a well-defined average relaxation time with narrow distribution. A model for the dielectric relaxation of oil-external dispersions with thin shells has been proposed by unifying the theory of double-layer polarization, modified to take into account the finite thickness of the double layer, and the triphasic model of interfacial polarization. According to this model, the low-frequency relaxation time is proportional to the square of the radius of dispersed water droplets and the high-frequency relaxation time is proportional to the radius. Both relationships have been established and can be used to determine the surface charge density and the surface conductivity of oil-external microemulsion droplets. However, the magnitude of the dielectric constant cannot be described by the present model or any other model within the framework of Maxwell-Wagner theory. This inconsistency could be due to the formation of dynamic aggregates of microemulsion droplets under Brownian motion. The effect of substituting H/sub 2/O brine by D/sub 2/O brine has also been studied. It is shown that, while H/sub 2/O and D/sub 2/O havenearly identical dielectric constants, the dielectric properties of oil-external microemulsions containing H/sub 2/O or D/sub 2/O brine are distinctly different. It was found that the surface charge density, the dielectric relaxation times, and the dielectric increment of the H/sub 2/O system were ca. 2 to 4 times higher than those of the D/sub 2/O system. These observations indicate the importance of hydration effects on interfacial and double-layer polarizations in microemulsions.","","","Univ. of Florida, Gainesville","","","United States","1981-05-28T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

It was found that the yield of heavy products increases on transition from hydrocarbons of iso-structure to normal hydrocarbons, which is due to the greater ease of polycondensation of cyclopentadiene formed from n-pentenes and particularly from piperylene under conditions of dehydrogenation. A study was made by chromato-mass-spectrometry of the composition of heavy products of conversion of piperylene and isoprene. In contrast with the catalysate of isoprene, the catalysate of piperylene contains a significant proportion of hydrocarbons containing a five-membered ring in the molecule (dicyclopentadiene, indane, indene, methylindenes, azilene), this being due to the participation of cyclopentadiene in the formation of heavy products.

The primary reason for deflation afflicting the nuclear industry is the oil price increase followed by other fuel price increases. These, along with the associated effects of conservation and increased energy productivity has led to reduced growth in electricity use and thus to reduced demand forecasts. The utilities responded by slowing down construction and orders for new generating plants. Because nuclear orders were among the more recent, they were the first to go. The accident at Three Mile Island brought the uncertainties of nuclear safety problems into focus. Mr. Gilinsky feels it is still too early to gauge the full effect of the accident on America's energy policies, but if fewer nuclear power plants are to be built, it will be because we need fewer, or because we think coal is cheaper or safer. Nuclear power can be acceptable if we are willing to pay the price of living with dangerous high technologies; that price is extraordinary care, discipline, and superior craftsmanship, he adds.

Ethane-propane mixtures, available because of more efficient extraction of natural gas, are transported in pipeline quantities. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), besides being used as fuel, has a prominent position as an inexpensive aerosol propellant. Little data are available for the volume change on mixing at saturation pressures (shrinkage) of light hydrocarbons. Liquid-density data were obtained for binary systems composed of ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane at 15.6/sup 0/ and 54.4/sup 0/C and saturation pressure. To validate the mixture densities, data on the pure components also were obtained at several temperatures. The maximum shrinkage observed was about 5% for the ethane-propane system.","","","Phillips Petroleum Co","","","United States","1973-07-01T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: J.

They are now envisioning substantial exports of natural-gas liquids--propane, butane, and isobutane--in addition to natural gas before the end of the 1970's. They anticipate an important increase in foreign sales of sulfur obtained from big sour-gas field. Geographically, the Soviets are counting on rapidly expanding gas markets in the Far East as well as in Europe. They have completed detailed studies of gas demand in these areas and see nothing but bright export prospects for the indefinite future. Latest reports from Siberia's frozen outlying areas indicate that the U.S.S.R.'s proved gas reserves will reach about 12 trillion cu m (423.6 trillion cu ft) by the beginning of 1971. It is estimated that the U.S.S.R. in 1969 had about 600 natural-gas and gas condensate fields scattered over autonomous republics, provinces, and territories within the huge Russian Federated Republic and in 7 of the U.S.S.R.'s 14 other Union Republics. At 1970's planned production level--6.9 trillin cu ft--the U.S.S.R. expects to have more than a 60-yr gas supply by early 1971.","","","","","","United States","1970-03-02T00:00:00Z","English","Journal Article","","Journal Name: Oil Gas J.; (United States); Journal Volume: 68:9","","Medium: X; Size: Pages: 34-38","","","","Journal ID: CODEN: OIGJA","","","2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","7156281","https://www.osti.gov/biblio/7156281","","Oil Gas J.; (United States)","","68:9"
