"LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Fe<sub>0.1</sub>Al<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a Cobalt-Free Cathode Material with High Capacity and High Capability for Lithium-Ion Batteries","Elmaataouy, Elhoucine; Chari, Abdelwahed; El Bendali, Ayoub; Tayoury, Marwa; Amine, Rachid; Aqil, Mohamed; Xu, GuiLiang; Liu, Tongchao; Alami, Jones; Dahbi, Mouad","25 ENERGY STORAGE; lithium-ion battery; cobalt-free cathode material (NFA); nickel-rich layered oxide; solid-state reaction method; rate performance","Obtaining cathode materials with high capacity and cycle stability is one of the main challenges regarding the success of electric vehicle technologies. However, most of the widely used materials with these properties involve the use of toxic and expensive cobalt as the active material. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel cobalt-free cathode material, synthesized for the first time using a solid-state reaction, whose general formula is LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Fe<sub>0.1</sub>Al<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NFA). This class of materials offers high capacity and reduces the battery costs by removing cobalt, without jeopardizing the structural stability and safety of the NFAs. The morphology and the structural properties of the obtained NFA cathode material were characterized using different techniques, e.g., scanning electronic microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and infrared and Raman spectroscopies. The electrochemical activity and diffusivity of the Li-ion during lithium removal and its insertion into the bulk of the NFA cathode demonstrated high-yield specific capacities of ≈180 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 0.1C, along with a reasonable rate capability and cycling stability, with a capacity retention of ≈99.6% after 100 charge/discharge cycles at a rate of C/2, and whose operando X-ray diffraction experiments have been used to study the crystallographic transitions during the lithiation–delithiation reaction.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

"Cation reordering instead of phase transitions: Origins and implications of contrasting lithiation mechanisms in 1D ζ- and 2D α-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>","Luo, Yuting; Rezaei, Shahed; Santos, David A.; Zhang, Yuwei; Handy, Joseph V.; Carrillo, Luis; Schultz, Brian J.; Gobbato, Leonardo; Pupucevski, Max; Wiaderek, Kamila; Charalambous, Harry; Yakovenko, Andrey; Pharr, Matt; Xu, Bai-Xiang; Banerjee, Sarbajit","25 ENERGY STORAGE; batteries; energy storage intercalation chemistry; operando X-ray diffraction; scanning transmission X-ray microscopy","Substantial improvements in cycle life, rate performance, accessible voltage, and reversible capacity are required to realize the promise of Li-ion batteries in full measure. Here, we have examined insertion electrodes of the same composition (V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) prepared according to the same electrode specifications and comprising particles with similar dimensions and geometries that differ only in terms of their atomic connectivity and crystal structure, specifically two-dimensional (2D) layered α-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> that crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group and one-dimensional (1D) tunnel-structured ζ-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> crystallized in a monoclinic space group. By using particles of similar dimensions, we have disentangled the role of specific structural motifs and atomistic diffusion pathways in affecting electrochemical performance by mapping the dynamical evolution of lithiation-induced structural modifications using ex situ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements, and phase-field modeling. We find the operation of sharply divergent mechanisms to accommodate increasing concentrations of Li-ions: a series of distortive phase transformations that result in puckering and expansion of interlayer spacing in layered α-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, as compared with cation reordering along interstitial sites in tunnel-structured ζ-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. By alleviating distortive phase transformations, the ζ-V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> cathode shows reduced voltage hysteresis, increased Li-ion diffusivity, alleviation of stress gradients, and improved capacity retention. The findings demonstrate that alternative lithiation mechanisms can be accessed in metastable compounds by dint of their reconfigured atomic connectivity and can unlock substantially improved electrochemical performance not accessible in the thermodynamically stable phase.","National Academy of Sciences","","Argonne National Lab.

"Electrochemical characterization of evolving ionomer/electrocatalyst interactions throughout accelerated stress tests","Hu, Leiming; Van Cleve, Tim; Yu, Haoran; Park, Jae Hyung; Kariuki, Nancy; Kropf, A. Jeremy; Mukundan, Rangachary; Cullen, David A.; Myers, Deborah J.; Neyerlin, K. C.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Here, the degradation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) catalyst layers used for heavy-duty vehicles was examined using a catalyst-specific accelerated stress test (AST). High surface area carbon supported dispersed Pt (Pt/HSC), annealed Pt (a-Pt/HSC) and PtCo (PtCo/HSC) alloy catalysts were examined over the course of 90,000 cycles by measuring changes in mass activity, O<sub>2</sub> transport resistance, electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), catalyst accessibility and ionomer-electrocatalyst interactions. Compared to a-Pt/HSC and Pt/HSC catalyst, the PtCo/HSC showed better initial mass activity, a larger initial mass transport loss, and faster degradation after the first 30k AST cycles, as a large portion of Co leached out during potential cycling. Pt/HSC showed higher initial performance relative to a-Pt/HSC but had faster degradation. STEM characterizations show that the ECSA losses are largely related to Pt dissolution resulting in either catalyst particle growth via the Ostwald ripening mechanism or redeposition in the membrane. Catalyst accessibility measurements showed decreased RH sensitivity for all three samples, while CO impedance measurements revealed a decrease in both Pt-water and carbon-water interactions. This implies that, Pt is either preferentially redepositing on the exterior of the carbon support, or that the ionomer is undergoing morphological changes enabling the enhanced intrusion of mesopores.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

In the near term, adapting current commercial battery technologies to perform better under fast charging conditions through engineering optimizations will greatly expedite the process while exploratory fast-charging electrode materials are being pursued. To do so, the degradation modes in optimized Li-ion batteries need to be completely explored to understand fast charging limits while maintaining a high energy density and a long cycle life. While lithium plating on graphite still remains a challenge, cathode degradation also plays a key role in battery performance. In this work, we used nano- and micro-X-ray computed tomography to characterize the mechanical degradation of LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC532) in optimized Li-ion batteries cycled at three rates, 1C, 6C, and 9C, and at different stages of cycle life, 225 and 600 cycles. We report despite using a conservative upper voltage cutoff limit aimed to minimize extensive cathode degradation, higher charging rates and increased cycling caused the polycrystalline NMC532 particles to fracture and pulverize, which likely drives cathode capacity fade and contributes to the decrease in overall cell performance.","American Chemical Society","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States).

SEI is generally believed to be formed by the reactions between Li<sup>0</sup> and electrolyte. However, our new study shows this is not the whole story. Through synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function analysis, we reveal a much more convoluted formation mechanism of SEI, which receives considerable contributions from electrolyte, cathode, moisture and native surface species on Li<sup>0</sup>, with highly dynamic nature during cycling. Using isotope labelling, we traced the origin of LiH to electrolyte solvent, moisture and a new source: the native surface species (LiOH) on pristine Li<sup>0</sup>. When lithium accessibility is very limited as in the case of anode-free cells, LiOH develops into plate-shaped large crystals during cycling. Alternatively, when the lithium source is abundant, as in the case of Li||NMC811 cells, LiOH reacts with Li<sup>0</sup> to form LiH and Li<sub>2</sub>O. While the desired anion-derived LiF-rich SEI is typically found in the concentrated electrolytes or their derivatives, here we found it can also be formed in low-concentration electrolyte via the crosstalk effect, emphasizing the importance of formation cycle protocol and opening up opportunities for low-cost electrolyte development.","Nature Publishing Group","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (μXRF) confirmed that LiTFMP successfully minimizes the rate of transition metal deposition on the surface of graphite apparently by forming a protective agent at the cathode surface, hence allowing for improved cycling performance at high voltages.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the complete structural change accompanied by spontaneous atomic migration and volume variation during the charge/discharge cycle leads to electrode disintegration and performance degradation, therefore severely restricting the application of conventional conversion-type electrodes. Herein, latticed-confined conversion chemistry is proposed, where the “intercalation-like” redox behavior is realized on the electrode with a “conversion-like” high capacity. By delicately formulating the high-entropy compounds, the pristine crystal structure can be preserved by the inert lattice framework, thus enabling an ultra-high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.5% and a long cycling lifespan over a thousand cycles after the quasistatic charge–discharge cycle.

Currently, fast charging is limited by a variety of processes that reduce cell capacity upon extended cycling. Using a multimodal approach combining incremental capacity analysis (dQ/dV), high energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD), and mass spectrometry titration (MST), we identify specific degradation mechanisms—including Li plating, dead Li<sub>x</sub>C<sub>6</sub> formation, Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> formation, solid carbonate solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) deposition, and loss of positive electrode active material (LAM<sub>PE</sub>)—that occur during extended fast charge cycling. We find that Li plating is the major source of capacity loss in cells cycled at 6C, while non-carbonate SEI species deposition on the graphite anode is the main source of capacity loss when cycled at 4C. We also study local degradative phenomena by examining specific ~1–5 cm<sup>2</sup> regions of the cells using HEXRD and MST. Here, we find that plated Li is often collocated with dead Li<sub>x</sub>C<sub>6</sub>, Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, and solid carbonate SEI species, and these additional species cumulatively account for ~20% of the capacity lost during 6C cycling. Finally, in a cell with an anomalously high amount of LAM<sub>PE </sub>(quantified via dQ/dV), we find that regions of cathode degradation were accompanied by non-carbonate SEI products on the adjacent region of the anode. We postulate that this phenomenon arises due to crosstalk between the electrodes, wherein soluble electrolyte oxidation products formed at the delithiated cathode migrate to the graphite anode and are ultimately deposited on the graphite surface. This work demonstrates the utility of combining multiple characterization techniques to reveal a more holistic understanding of degradative phenomena that occur across multiple length scales during fast charge.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Grand challenges and opportunities in next-generation batteries and technologies","Johnson, Christopher S.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; fluoride-anion; solid-electrolyte; Beyond Li-ion; lithium; multivalent; sodium-ion","The development of advanced Li-ion batteries and technologies generally addresses one of four objectives: 1) create a higher volumetric energy density and/or specific energy/power, 2) impart intrinsically safer chemistry, 3) produce speedier charging, and 4) utilize less expensive batteries but with competitive/near-competitive performances. Certainly, other factors can play a role as well, dependent on the type of market targeted and the availability of global supplies; however, for widespread adoption, the above points/criteria remain salient. Li-ion is commercially well entrenched in industry for communication and transportation (EV) applications. Nowadays, slight iterations, mostly electrolyte-defined, are incrementally improving safety, cost, and cycle or calendar life. The last point, calendar life, is one that is often overlooked for very high-energy dense Li-ion batteries, because of their reactivity at higher charge (OCV conditions) and elevated temperatures. While cycle life is debated with respect to capacity/energy performance decline, attempts to re-purpose the battery itself or recycle the internal chemical constituents at end of life have considerably grown in the field. Hopefully, energy-neutral processes are also considered in the recycling loop. Nevertheless, the energy storage arena is quite large, and this pursuit hinges on pushing the field in one of many directions, toward loftier objectives. The pursuit of next-generation batteries and technologies must thus delve deeper into new and novel chemistry and electrochemistry to create a world with a neutral, carbon-free environment, and one that is solely sufficient on energy-producing renewables such as the Sun and wind-derived means.

"Direct Recycling of Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes: A Multi-Stage Annealing Process to Recover the Pristine Structure and Performance","Montoya, Anthony T.; Yang, Zhenzhen; Dahl, Erik U.; Pupek, Krzysztof Z.; Polzin, Bryant; Dunlop, Alison; Vaughey, J. T.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; electrochemistry; lithium-ion; batteries; recycling; NMC","Direct recycling is an alternative low-cost process that retains the structure of the lithium-ion battery cathode rather than going through materials dissolution and repurification. While the process shows promise, various steps need to be better understood and studied to identify possible roadblocks, cost intensive steps, and needed variations in protocol that may be necessary based on the feedstock of recycled cathodes available. In this study, we have evaluated the process of thermal relithiation as it applies to end-of-life cathode materials. For recovered end-of-life cathodes, approximately 20% of the useable lithium has been lost due to solid electrolyte interface formation, parasitic reactions, and particle isolation; this lost lithium contributes to higher cell impedance and a gradual shift in electrode potentials. As a first step in the direct recycling process, this lithium needs to be restored not only to recover capacity but also to eliminate surface vacancies and hinder surface reconstruction that may increase impedance and impact performance. Here, we have optimized a coating method followed by a two-stage annealing process that restores a model delithiated NMC333 material to pristine performance. Comparisons to single-stage processes are made, and new characterization tools have been used to better understand the processes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Ionic Dynamics of the Charge Carrier in Layered Solid Materials for Mg Rechargeable Batteries","Wang, Chuhong; Mueller, Tim; Assary, Rajeev S.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Multivalent-ion batteries have attracted growing attention due to their high theoretical energy density that potentially outperforms Li-ion batteries. One of the critical challenges of realizing a multivalent-ion battery is the strong polarization that results in the sluggish intercalation of ions in the host lattice, which motivates a fundamental understanding of multivalent-ion dynamics in solid-state materials. In this contribution, we investigate the diffusion mechanisms of divalent ions in a novel Mg anode coating, BiOCl, using first-principles informed learning-on-the-fly molecular dynamics. Based on nanosecond-scale dynamics observations, we gained insights into the concerted diffusion mechanism of Mg cation site-to-site hopping facilitated by synchronous anion rotational motion. Furthermore, we compute the Mg-ion diffusion in additional candidate host structures screened from available layered materials space. Here, the results suggest the co-operative divalent cation-anion motion is likely a common phenomenon in layered oxyhalide structures. Our findings provide a new perspective on how to enhance multivalent-ion diffusion in layered materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Nevertheless, lithium-ion batteries still suffer from a slow-charging limitation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that white light illumination of LiMn2O4 provokes faster charging, improving the kinetics of delithiation without the use of nanostructured active materials. In this work, we probe the mechanism of photo-accelerated fast charging and show that Mn d-d electronic transitions occurring under red light illumination are largely responsible for the increased charging rate. It is further demonstrated through X-ray absorption spectroscopy methods that LiMn2O4 Mn-Mn bond distances shorten after d-electron excitation. The shrinkage in the crystal volume beneficially contributes to delithiation kinetics by lowering the resistance to lithium-ion conduction. Advanced materials that can absorb light to modulate their structure may provide us with a new mechanistic pathway to pursue for increasing charge transfer rates.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Owing to their high energy density and low-cost advantages, high-Ni and low-Co or Co-free (zero-Co) layered cathodes have become the most promising cathodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, current high-Ni cathode materials, without exception, suffer severely from their intrinsic thermal and chemo-mechanical instabilities and insufficient cycle life. Here, by using a new compositionally complex (high-entropy) doping strategy, we successfully fabricate a high-Ni, zero-Co layered cathode that has extremely high thermal and cycling stability. Combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and nanotomography, we find that the cathode exhibits nearly zero volumetric change over a wide electrochemical window, resulting in greatly reduced lattice defects and local strain-induced cracks. In-situ heating experiments reveal that the thermal stability of the new cathode is significantly improved, reaching the level of the ultra-stable NMC-532. Owing to the considerably increased thermal stability and the zero volumetric change, it exhibits greatly improved capacity retention. This work, by resolving the long-standing safety and stability concerns for high-Ni, zero-Co cathode materials, offers a commercially viable cathode for safe, long-life lithium-ion batteries and a universal strategy for suppressing strain and phase transformation in intercalation electrodes","Nature Publishing Group","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

However, current research on proton batteries is still at its infancy, and they usually deliver low capacity and suffer from severe acidic corrosion. In this work, electrochemically activated metallic H<sub>1.75</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub> nanobelts are developed as a stable electrode for proton storage. The electrochemically pre-intercalated protons not only bond directly with the terminal O<sub>3</sub> site via strong O-H bonds but also interact with the oxygens within the adjacent layers through hydrogen bonding, forming a hydrogen-bonding network in H<sub>1.75</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub> nanobelts and enabling a diffusion-free Grotthuss mechanism as a result of its ultralow activation energy of ~0.02 eV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported inorganic electrode exhibiting Grotthuss mechanism-based proton storage. Additionally, the proton intercalation into MoO<sub>3</sub> with formation of H<sub>1.75</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub> induces strong Jahn-Teller electron-phonon coupling, rendering a metallic state. As a consequence, the H<sub>1.75</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub> shows an outstanding fast charging performance and maintains a capacity of 111 mAh/g at 2500 C, largely outperforming the state-of-art battery electrodes.

However, long-term stability issues still persist in LIB cathodes as the result of the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), structural transformations, or the loss of active cathode materials. In nanoscale cathodes, it is often impossible to isolate, let alone mitigate the causes of the observed capacity loss. Herein, a novel approach is presented to synthesizing LIB cathode model systems using thin-film molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Specifically, 100 nm thick LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LMO) thin-film cathodes are grown on SrRuO<sub>3</sub>/SrTiO<sub>3</sub> (100) single-crystal substrates and characterized in their pristine and cycled states.

The formation of surface-layer rocksalt MnO and spinel Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> along with the mass-loss associated with the corrosion of active Mn ions is also reported. It is, therefore, demonstrated that these MBE-grown model systems can be used for detailed studies of their surface structures and the electrode/electrolyte interfacial evolution in LIB cathodes, leading to the development of materials for rechargeable batteries with higher capacity and better stability.","Wiley-VCH","","Argonne National Lab.

A notable example is Ni-based layered oxides, which were discovered as early as 1950s and intensively pursued as cathode active materials (CAMs) since the early 90s but have yet to realize their full commercial potential. Significant efforts have been devoted to materials development aiming at improving performance, far less to process development for large-scale synthesis and processing of CAMs. In this paper, we present a rational design of calcination for scalable production of Ni-based CAMs. We start with an overview of the current understanding and knowledge gaps hindering rational process design and scaling-up of the calcination process.

"Capacity and Coulombic Efficiency Measurements Underestimate the Rate of SEI Growth in Silicon Anodes","Rodrigues, Marco-Tulio F.

It is generally considered that elevated values of coulombic efficiency and capacity retention are <italic>absolute</italic> indicators of the existence of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we challenge this notion by analyzing how the effect of side reactions on cell capacity depends on the choice of electrodes. More specifically, we demonstrate that the extent of <italic>measurable</italic> capacity fade due to SEI growth is modulated by the shape of the voltage profile of the cathode and anode at the end of charge and discharge half-cycles. This shape-dependency creates a mismatch between SEI growth and cell capacity loss, which is relatively small for graphite anodes but sizable for silicon-containing electrodes. We illustrate this point by showing that, at the same coulombic efficiency and capacity retention, cells containing silicon-based materials could actually exhibit rates of SEI growth that are as much as ≥ 40% higher than graphite cells. The main implication of this behavior is that, for certain systems, capacity measurements may be an unreliable source of information about the extent of reactions at the SEI, allowing other consequences of these side reactions (such as electrolyte depletion) to proceed unchecked while the cell appears to be stable. </p>","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Due to intergranular fracture stemming from volume changes of randomly oriented primary particles during charge/discharge, the synthesis of larger single-crystalline cathodes is of high interest. In this work, molten salt assisted growth of micron-sized Ni-rich crystals is achieved with excellent crystallinity, low cation mixing, and negligible impurities. However, electrochemical performance is compromised by high surface reactivity resulting in decomposition of electrolyte and subsequent formation of a thick CEI layer. While intergranular fracture is eliminated, planar gliding and severe intragranular fracture along the (003) plane occurs in the high voltage region within the first few cycles and is associated primarily with H2 to H3 structural transitions. In addition, H2 to H3 transitions are highly irreversible with cyclic voltammograms revealing polarization growth within <5 cycles. Subsequently, the single-crystalline material exhibited markedly reduced available capacity and enhanced capacity fade from sharp impedance growth compared to its polycrystalline counterpart. Here, this work furthers a fundamental understanding into the limitations of single-crystalline Ni-rich cathodes, and the obstacles limiting the advantages offered by the single-crystalline morphology.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, we link cell capacity fade to the heterogeneous physicochemical evolution of silicon anodes during battery cycling. Through a multi-length scale characterization approach, we demonstrate that silicon particles near the anode surface react differently than those near the copper current collector. In particular, near the anode surface we find an amorphized wispy silicon encased in a highly fluorinated matrix of electrolyte-reduction products. In contrast, closer to the current collector, the silicon retains more of its initial morphology and structure, suggesting the presence of isolated particles. Here, the results show that accessibility of active silicon to lithium-ions varies across the anode matrix.

To tackle these issues, researchers proposed the use of redox-inactive protective layers between the sulfur-containing cathode and lithium metal anode.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an effective method to deposit ultrathin metal fluoride coatings on LIB cathodes. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of ALD metal fluoride coatings to LIB performance, comparatively few works have examined the effect of individual ALD precursors on the cathode surface. This paper uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to elucidate the surface chemical changes on LIB cathode material surfaces upon exposure to the ALD metal fluoride precursor, hydrogen fluorine pyridine (HFPy). We found a decrease in surface carbonate and an increase in surface fluoride after HFPy exposure suggesting the conversion of lithium carbonate (Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) to lithium fluoride (LiF). This conversion is desirable given that Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> degrades LIB performance, whereas LiF provides an excellent physio-chemical barrier against chemical attack during cycling. Scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, and XPS measurements following HFPy exposure to Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> powder revealed the formation of a conformal LiF shell around the Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> particles. Finally, we confirmed the complete conversion of similar to 7 nm ALD Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> films on silicon from HFPy exposure using XPS and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The elimination of problematic Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> from LIB cathode surfaces and conversion into a protective LiF coating via a single precursor vapor treatment may provide a cost-effective method for enhancing LIB performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Tests are conducted using coin-cells with graphite negative electrodes at -20 °C, 0 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C. Three techniques are compared for determining the area-specific impedance (ASI): i) fits to the rate study average voltages, ii) fitting to the entire voltage curves using a regularization scheme, and iii) HPPC. When fit to an Arrhenius-type equation, all methods yield similar apparent activation energies (±2 kJ/mol) for the impedance, which range from -20 to -31 kJ/mol for the electrodes. Impedance growth increases with temperature but remains at less than 0.2% per cycle for most electrodes and temperatures. NCA and NMC811 are the exceptions, which yield 0.5% and 1.5% increases in ASI per cycle, respectively, at 40 °C. For cells with the same electrodes, the capacities are similar at 20 and 40 °C but reduce at lower temperatures, with up to a 52% reduction at -20 °C and 2C. The fade in energy of the cells during C/3 cycling is attributed to decreasing capacity as opposed to increasing ASI.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Benefitting from the ""Mg-pillar"" effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li<sup>+</sup> shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB-Mg-LCO and amorphous Co<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub> coating layer are found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects are also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enable a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as-designed CB-Mg-LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut-off voltage of 4.6 V. We report these findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serves to guide future cathode material design.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

A potential solution to this problem is the development of LiO<sub>2</sub>-based batteries that possess low charge overpotentials due to the lower charge transfer resistance of LiO<sub>2</sub>. In this report, IrLi nanoparticles were synthesized and implemented for the first time as a LiO<sub>2</sub> battery cathode material. The IrLi nanoparticle synthesis was achieved by a temperature- and time-optimized thermal reaction between a precise ratio of iridium nanoparticles and lithium metal. Li–O<sub>2</sub> batteries employing the IrLi-rGO cathodes were cycled up to 100 cycles at moderate current densities with sustained low cell charge potentials (<3.5 V). Further, various characterization techniques, including SEM, DEMS, TEM, Raman, and titration, were used to demonstrate the LiO<sub>2</sub> discharge product and the absence of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. On the basis of first-principles calculations, it was concluded that the formation of crystalline LiO<sub>2</sub> can be stabilized by epitaxial growth on the (111) facets of IrLi nanoparticles present on the cathode surface. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the previously studied Ir<sub>3</sub>Li intermetallic, the IrLi intermetallic also provides a means by which LiO<sub>2</sub> discharge products can be stabilized and confirms the importance of templating for the formation process.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Among them are the carbon-black and binder additives that enhance effective conductivity and provide mechanical integrity. However, these both reduce effective ionic transport in the electrolyte phase and reduce energy density. Therefore, an optimal additive loading is required to maximize performance, especially for fast charging where ionic transport is essential. Such optimization analysis is however challenging due to the nanoscale imaging limitations that prevent characterizing this additive phase and thus quantifying its impact on performance. Herein, an additive-phase generation algorithm has been developed to remedy this limitation and identify percolation threshold used to define a minimal additive loading. Improved ionic transport coefficients from reducing additive loading has been then quantified through homogenization calculation, macroscale model fitting, and experimental symmetric cell measurement, with good agreement between the methods. Rate capability test demonstrates capacity improvement at fast charge at the beginning of life, from 37% to 55%, respectively for high and low additive loading during 6C CC charging, in agreement with macroscale model, and attributed to a combination of lower cathode impedance, reduced electrode tortuosity and cathode thickness.</jats:p>","The Electrochemical Society","","Idaho National Lab.

Although recent progress in O2-type LLOs has aroused interest for their less voltage decay, the critical barrier of unsatisfactory capacity retention has not been overcome yet. In this work, to tackle these handicaps, we design a new type of LLO (O2/O3-type LLO) with a homogeneous hybrid structure, where the O2 and O3 lattice stacking sequences are arranged alternatively. Benefitting from this novel O2/O3 hybrid structure, the designed material shows greatly improved voltage and capacity stability than that of pure O2- and O3-type LLOs. Revealed by in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and operando differential electrochemical mass spectra, the O2/O3-hybrid LLO cathode shows a more reversible structural evolution, smaller volume change and suppressed oxygen loss during the electrochemical processes.

Adoption of lithium metal anodes with solid electrolytes can help to achieve that goal given that the dendrite-related issues are solved eventually. Another possibility is to use Ni-rich high-capacity NMC cathode materials with liquid and/or solid electrolytes, which presently experiences rapid capacity fade while charged to higher voltages. Several mechanical and chemical degradation mechanisms are active within these NMC-based cathode particles. Recent experimental research activities attempted to correlate the mechanical damage with the capacity fade experienced by Ni-rich LiNi<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>z</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (x+y+z = 1) (NMC) cathodes. Here, a computational framework is developed in this study capable of quantifying the evolution of inter primary particle and cathode/electrolyte interfacial fracture experienced by the poly- and single-crystalline NMC cathodes during charge/discharge operation. Influences of mechanical degradation on the overall cell capacity, while operating with liquid and/or solid electrolytes, are successfully characterized. Decreasing the size of the cathode primary particles, or the size of the single-crystalline cathodes, can mitigate the overall mechanical degradation, and subsequent capacity fade, experienced by NMC cathodes. The developed theoretical methodology can help the engineers and scientists to better understand the mechanical degradation mechanism prevalent in Ni-rich NMC cathodes and build superior lithium ion-based energy storage devices for the application in next-generation devices.","ASME","","Argonne National Lab.

"Life-cycle analysis, by global region, of automotive lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt batteries of varying nickel content","Winjobi, Olumide; Kelly, Jarod C.; Dai, Qiang","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Life cycle assessment; Environmental impact; Lithium-ion battery; High nickel content","The batteries in electric vehicles can account for one-third of their production greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; thus, it is important to understand how these batteries' environmental performance is affected by both the battery's chemistry and production location. In this study, we examined how transitioning to higher-nickel, lower-cobalt, and high-performance automotive lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from the base NMC111 would influence the environmental impacts of LIB production. Transitioning from NMC111 cathodes to cathodes with higher nickel and lower cobalt contents results in a potential increase in the energy density (i.e., increased driving range) of the batteries and is thus favored in the industry. This study utilized the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technology (GREET) life-cycle assessment model to conduct the environmental analysis by focusing on the differences among global regions with respect to production conditions (electricity grid, mineral extraction methods, etc.) and examining them on the basis of a set of scenarios for current production conditions to better understand how regional supply-chain variations impact environmental performance. The environmental impact of the transition relative to the GREET baseline conditions was such that the GHG emission levels for NMC532, NMC622, and NMC811 showed re-ductions of 0.3%, 5.3%, and 7.5%, respectively, relative to NMC111, while the SO(x)emission levels increased significantly-by 130%, 130%, and 142%, respectively-relative to NMC111. These increases in the SO<sub>x</sub> emissions levels were correlated with increasing nickel content and were due to the production pathway of the nickel precursor. Through further scenario analysis, we showed that lower SO<sub>x</sub> emission levels could be attained when the nickel precursor was produced exclusively from mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) instead of Class I nickel-although this change resulted in higher GHG emission levels with the current MHP supply chain. Regional variability of the electricity grid profiles also influenced the environmental impacts of LIB production. The use of hydro-powered electricity resulted in reduced GHG emissions levels; however, water consumption levels increased compared to the baseline conditions. Among other scenarios, we also investigated the best-and worst-case-scenario supply chains based on GHG emission levels. In this case, the best-case scenario is the scenario with the lowest GHG emissions, while the worst has the highest. For the NMC811 LIB, the GREET baseline, currently dominant, and worst-case-scenario supply chains showed GHG emission levels of 121%, 173%, and 347%, respectively, relative to the best-case-scenario supply chain.

Grain interfaces and topological defects modulate bulk proton conductivity and hydration, especially at low temperatures. Therefore, understanding the nanoscale crystal structure dynamics in situ is crucial to achieving high proton transport, material stability, and extending the operating range of proton-conducting solid oxides. Here, Bragg coherent X-ray diffractive imaging is applied to investigate in situ and in 3D nanoscale dynamics in BZY during hydration over 40 h at 200 °C, in the low-temperature range. An unexpected activity of topological defects and subsequent cracking is found on a nanoscale covered by the macroscale stability. The rearrangements in structure correlate with emergent regions of different lattice constants, suggesting heterogeneous hydration.

Tin (Sn) is a promising alloying electrode with high capacity, redox reversibility, and earth abundance. Tin electrodes, however, undergo a series of intermediate reactions exhibiting multiple voltage plateaus upon sodiation/desodiation. Phase transformations related to incomplete sodiation in tin during cycling, in the presence of a frail solid electrolyte interphase layer, can quickly weaken the structural stability. The structural dynamics and reactivity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, being further dependent on the size and morphology of the active material particle in the presence of different electrolytes, dictate the electrode degradation and survivability during cycling. Here, we paint a comprehensive picture of the underpinnings of the electrochemical and mechanics coupling and electrode/electrolyte interfacial interactions in alloying Sn electrodes. We elicit the fundamental role of electrode/electrolyte complexations in the Sn electrode structure-property-performance relationship based on multimodal analytics, including electrochemical, microscopy, and tomography analyses.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

While tuning redox potentials of redoxmers is a very effective way to enhance energy densities of NRFBs, those improvements often accompany accelerated kinetics of the charged species, undermining stability and cycling performance. In this paper, a strategy for designing redoxmers with simultaneous improvements in redox potential and stability is proposed. Specifically, the redoxmer 1,4-di-tert-butyl-2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzene (ANL-C46) is developed by incorporating fluorinated substitutions into the dialkoxybenzene-based platform. Compared to the non-fluorinated analogue, ANL-C46 demonstrates not only an increased (similar to 0.41 V) redox potential but also much enhanced stability (1.6 times) and cyclability (4 times) evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance kinetic study, H-cell and flow cell cycling. In fact, the cycling performance of ANL-C46 is among the best of high potential (>1.0 V vs Ag/Ag<sup>+</sup>) redoxmers ever reported. Density functional theory calculations suggest that while the introduced fluorine substitutions elevate the redox potentials, they also help to depress the decomposition reactions of the charged redoxmers, affording excellent stability. The findings represent an interesting strategy for simultaneously improving energy density and stability, which could further prompt the development of high-performance redoxmers.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this paper, starting from micrometer-sized silicon and black phosphorus, we have reported a high-energy silicon-phosphorus/carbon anode (denoted as mSPC) via a high-energy ball milling process, which demonstrates an average discharge working potential of 0.3 volts versus lithium, together with a high reversible capacity of > 2000 mAh/g, high initial coulombic efficiency of 84%, excellent cycle stability, and superior rate capability up to 15 A/g. Furthermore, in situ focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy reveals that the volume change of the mSPC anode during repeated (de) lithiation is effectively alleviated. In contrast, starting from nanometer-sized silicon, the resulted anode (denoted as nSPC) not only presents a lower reversible capacity (~1200 mAh/g), but also exhibits a higher charge/discharge working potential, leading to reduced energy density.

However, the large-scale recycling is hampered by economic and safety issues associated with today's recycling processes. In this study, we demonstrate a safe and energy efficient direct regeneration process based on low-temperature hydrothermal relithiation (LTHR) at low pressure for spent LiNi<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>z</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0 < <em>x,y,z</em> <1, <em>x + y + z</em> = 1, or NCM) cathode materials. A low concentration of low-cost redox mediator is employed to improve the relithiation kinetics of spent NCM materials, enabling full relithiation temperature to be reduced from 220 °C to 100 °C or below. Correspondingly, the pressure incurred in the relithiation process can be reduced from ~25 bar to 1 bar, offering significantly improved operation safety. Specifically, three NCM materials, including chemically delithiated NCM111, cycled (degraded) NCM111, and cycled NCM622, were successfully regenerated with complete recovery of composition, crystal structure, and electrochemical performance, achieving the same effectiveness as that achieved at high temperature process. Meanwhile, the total energy consumption of spent cell recycling and the greenhouse gas emission is also reduced. This work provides a facile and scalable way to more sustainable LIB recycling with high economic return, high operation safety and low cost.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Machine-learning (ML) interatomic potentials offer a uniquely compelling solution for simulating chemical processes, rare events, and phase transitions associated with these complex interfaces by mixing high scalability with quantum-level accuracy, provided that they can be trained to properly address atomic disorder. To this end, we report the construction and validation of an ML potential that is specifically designed to simulate crystalline, disordered, and amorphous LLZO systems across a wide range of conditions. The ML model is based on a neural network algorithm and is trained using ab initio data. Performance tests prove that the developed ML potential can predict accurate structural and vibrational characteristics, elastic properties, and Li diffusivity of LLZO comparable to ab initio simulations. As a demonstration of its applicability to larger systems, we show that the potential can correctly capture grain boundary effects on diffusivity, as well as the thermal transition behavior of LLZO. These examples show that the ML potential enables simulations of transitions between well-defined and disordered structures with quantum-level accuracy at speeds thousands of times faster than ab initio methods. </p>","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

However, although voltage decay issues cause continuous energy loss and impede commercialization, the prerequisite driving force for this phenomenon remains a mystery. In this paper, with in situ nanoscale sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction imaging techniques, we reveal that nanostrain and lattice displacement accumulate continuously during operation of the cell. Evidence shows that this effect is the driving force for both structure degradation and oxygen loss, which trigger the well-known rapid voltage decay in LMR cathodes. By carrying out micro- to macro-length characterizations that span atomic structure, the primary particle, multiparticle and electrode levels, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nature of LMR cathodes inevitably causes pernicious phase displacement/strain, which cannot be eliminated by conventional doping or coating methods. We therefore propose mesostructural design as a strategy to mitigate lattice displacement and inhomogeneous electrochemical/structural evolutions, thereby achieving stable voltage and capacity profiles.

However, excessive Li-ion insertion into the Li layer of layered cathodes results in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. Here, in this study, an ultrahigh reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low-content Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO<sub>2</sub> domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li-ion storage in Li layers. This work utilizes bulk cation disorder to create stable Li-ion-storage tetrahedral sites and an elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600 mA h g<sup>–1</sup>, demonstrated in th range 0.6–4.9 V versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup> at 10 mA g<sup>–1</sup>.

However, these cathodes suffer from voltage hysteresis, voltage fade, and capacity drop upon cycling; single-crystalline cathodes have recently shown some improvements but these challenges still remain. We reveal the fundamental origin of oxygen redox instability to be originated from the domain boundaries that are present in single-crystalline cathode particles. By synthesizing single-crystalline cathodes free of domain boundaries, we show that the elimination of domain boundaries enhances the reversible lattice oxygen redox while inhibiting the irreversible oxygen release. Further, this leads to significantly suppressed structural degradation and improved mechanical integrity during battery cycling and abuse heating. The robust oxygen redox enabled through domain boundary control provides practical opportunities towards high-energy, long-cycling, and safe batteries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

However, their stability and durability remain insufficient. A key to enabling future improvements and performance comparisons lies in the development of test protocols that are relevant to the operating conditions of the fuel cell cathode, can be completed within a reasonable time and are ubiquitously adopted. Here we propose and validate such protocols, designed with special attention to typical catalyst degradation mechanisms of PGM-free catalysts. The results of the cross-laboratory validation study using two different catalysts attest to the strength and feasibility of the proposed approach.

"Gradient porosity electrodes for fast charging lithium-ion batteries","Yang, Jian; Li, Yejing; Mijailovic, Aleksandar; Wang, Guanyi; Xiong, Jie; Mathew, Kevin; Lu, Wenquan; Sheldon, Brian W.; Wu, Qingliu","25 ENERGY STORAGE; fast charge; graphite electrode; gradient porosity; lithium plating","The tendency of Li plating at the surface of thick graphite electrodes greatly limits their application in electrical vehicle (EV) batteries for fast charging applications. To address this concern, we proposed an innovative gradient porosity architecture to facilitate mass transport and suppress Li plating in the thick anodes for fast charging applications. This concept was approved through a thick 3-layered graphite electrode with the highest porosity in the top layer and the lowest porosity in the bottom layer, in contact with the current collector. Here, the gradient porosity structure in the 3-layered graphite electrodes was confirmed by electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry measurements. Used as the anodes of lithium-ion batteries, 3-layered graphite electrodes demonstrated unprecedentedly rate capability and durability superior to 1-layered electrodes. The post-mortem analysis on the cycled cells shows that 3-layered electrodes can significantly suppress Li plating at a high rate up to 4C, which might be responsible for the improved performance of the derived cells. The excellent electrochemical behaviors of 3-layered graphite electrodes are associated with the favored mass transport originating from the unique gradient porosity structure. This is consistent with theoretical studies showing that gradient porosity lowers the Li-ion concentration gradient in the electrolyte in the region close to the separator and slows down the process of reaching the Li plating threshold.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Western Michigan Univ., Kalamazoo MI (United States); Argonne National Lab.

"Asphericity Can Cause Nonuniform Lithium Intercalation in Battery Active Particles","Mistry, Aashutosh; Heenan, Thomas; Smith, Kandler; Shearing, Paul; Mukherjee, Partha P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; batteries","Uniform intercalation is desired to enable next-generation Li-ion batteries. While we expect nonuniformity in materials undergoing a phase change, single-phase intercalation materials such as nickel manganese cobalt oxide are believed to lithiate uniformly at the particle/electrolyte interface. However, recent imaging reveals nonuniform lithiation. Motivated by this discrepancy, we examine if aspherical particle shape can cause such nonuniformity since the conventional belief is based on spherical particle theory. We obtain real particle geometries using rapid lab-based X-ray computed tomography and subsequently perform physics-based calculations accounting for electrochemical reactions at the particle/electrolyte interface and lithium transport inside the particle bulk. The aspherical geometry breaks the symmetry and causes nonuniform reaction distribution. Such nonuniformity is exacerbated as the particle becomes more aspherical. We report the proposed mechanism represents a fundamental limit on achievable lithiation uniformity in aspherical particles in the absence of other mechanisms causing inhomogeneity, such as grain structure, nonuniform carbon-binder coating, etc.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Depth-Dependent Understanding of Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) on the Layered Li-Ion Cathodes Operated at Extreme High Temperature","Nagarajan, Sudhan; Weiland, Conan; Hwang, Sooyeon; Balasubramanian, Mahalingam; Arava, Leela Reddy","25 ENERGY STORAGE; additives; electrodes; electrolytes; materials; redox reactions","The high-temperature operation of Li-ion batteries is highly dependent on the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed during lithiation-delithiation reactions. However, knowledge on the nature of the CEI is limited and its stability under extreme temperatures is not well understood. Therefore, herein, we investigate a proof-of-concept study on stabilizing CEI on model LiNi<sub>0.33</sub>Mn<sub>0.33</sub>Co<sub>0.33</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC333) at extreme operation condition of 100 oC using thermally stable pyrrolidinium based ionic liquid electrolyte. The electrochemical lithiation-delithiation reactions at 100 oC and the CEI evolution upon different cycling conditions are investigated. Further, the depth-dependent CEI chemistry was investigated using energy tunable synchrotron-based hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES). Overall, the results reveal that the high temperature operation accelerated the CEI formation compared to room temperature, and the surface of the interphase layer is rich in boron-based inorganic moieties than the deeper surface. Further, bulk sensitive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to investigate the transition metal redox contributors during high temperature electrochemical reactions, similar to room temperature, the Ni2+/4+redox couple is the only charge compensating redox couple during high temperature operation. Finally, the physical nature of the conformal CEI on the cathode particles was visualized with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, which confirms that the significant degradation of cathode particles without conformal CEI is due to the transformation of layer to spinel formation at extreme temperature. In this study, understanding this high temperature interfacial chemistry of NMC cathodes through advanced spectroscopy and microscopy will shed light on transforming ambient temperature Li-ion chemistry to high temperature applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> was shown to undergo reversible cycling between Li<sub>4</sub>FeO<sub>3.5</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>FeO<sub>3.5</sub> with combined cation/anion redox, a remarkable capacity of 189 mAh/g, and no O<sub>2</sub> release. However, the impact of phase transformations on the reaction thermodynamics and the correlation between the structural changes and reaction reversibility remain unclear. In this study, we use first-principles calculations to examine the delithiation and (re)lithiation reactions of Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>. We show that the experimentally observed charge and discharge processes go through non-equilibrium pathways. Upon delithiation, the compound undergoes a phase transformation from Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>, with tetrahedrally coordinated (T<sub>d</sub>) Fe ions, to a delithiated disordered rocksalt structure, with octahedral (O<sub>h</sub>) Fe ions. Fe-ion migration has an asymmetric kinetic barrier that makes T<sub>d</sub> → O<sub>h</sub> migration facile, whereas the reverse process has a much larger barrier, explaining the difficulties in reaction reversibility. We further elucidate the transition metal and O redox sequences during the charge cycle and identify the complex electrochemistry associated with the dual participation of cationic redox (Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sup>4+</sup>) and anionic redox (O<sup>2–</sup>/O<sup>–</sup>/O<sup>o</sup>). Armed with this knowledge, we conduct high-throughput screening of known alkali-rich transition metal oxides by evaluating their potential to enable reversible anionic redox, with multiple candidates proposed for further experimental trials.

Non-aqueous hybrid redox flow batteries (NAqHRFBs), based on lithium metal anode and organic redox molecules (redoxmers), have been investigated as an attractive energy storage option because of their high cell voltages and energy densities compared to other redox flow battery candidates. However, little is known about the economic potential of NAqHRFBs, as well as the operational and materials impacts. This research establishes a techno-economic model to analyze the capital costs of NAqHRFBs with selected organic redoxmers, including 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO). Sensitivity analyses for current density, area-specific resistance, cell voltage, electrolyte composition, redoxmer price, and equivalent molecular weight indicate the key factors in controlling NAqHRFB capital cost. To make the current NAqHRFB cost-effective, the first priority is to increase the operation current density over 10 times of those used in lab-scale tests, followed by adjusting redoxmer-related characteristics to afford more cost reduction space such as decreasing the unit price by ~20 fold. The results have shed light on potential material development and system engineering directions to make NAqHRFBs viable for renewable energy storage.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Exchange-Mediated Transport in Battery Electrolytes: Ultrafast or Ultraslow?","Dereka, Bogdan; Lewis, Nicholas C.; Zhang, Yong; Hahn, Nathan T.; Keim, Jonathan H.; Snyder, Scott A.; Maginn, Edward J.; Tokmakoff, Andrei","25 ENERGY STORAGE; cations; diffusion; electrolytes; ions; solvents","Understanding the mechanisms of charge transport in batteries is important for the rational design of new electrolyte formulations. Persistent questions about ion transport mechanisms in battery electrolytes are often framed in terms of vehicular diffusion by persistent ion–solvent complexes versus structural diffusion through the breaking and reformation of ion–solvent contacts, i.e., solvent exchange events. Ultrafast two-dimensional (2D) IR spectroscopy can probe exchange processes directly via the evolution of the cross-peaks on picosecond time scales. However, vibrational energy transfer in the absence of solvent exchange gives rise to the same spectral signatures, hiding the desired processes. Here we employ 2D IR on solvent resonances of a mixture of acetonitrile isotopologues to differentiate chemical exchange and energy-transfer dynamics in a comprehensive series of Li<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup> bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide electrolytes from the dilute to the superconcentrated regime. No exchange phenomena occur within at least 100 ps, regardless of the ion identity, salt concentration, and presence of water. All of the observed spectral dynamics originate from the intermolecular energy transfer. These results place the lower experimental boundary on the ion–solvent residence times to several hundred picoseconds, much slower than previously suggested. With the help of MD simulations and conductivity measurements on the Li<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> systems, we discuss these results as a continuum of vehicular and structural modalities that vary with concentration and emphasize the importance of collective electrolyte motions to ion transport. These results hold broadly applicable to many battery-relevant ions and solvents.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

Using well-defined cells and charging protocols, this study maps out the key aging mechanisms for NMC811 cycled at different XFC conditions [at 1C-9C to 4.1V (~100% state-of-charge [SOC]) and at 9C to 3.63V (~35% SOC), 3.77V (~60% SOC), and 3.94V (~80% SOC)] for up to 1000 cycles. To acquire a fundamental understanding of utilization and degradation, cells were evaluated using a range of electrochemical techniques, and a suite of multimodal and multiscale microscopy techniques to quantify chemical, structural, and crystallographic degradation as a function of cycling conditions for the NMC cathode. When comparing NMC532 to NMC811, it is observed that NMC811 has a greater subsurface crystallographic degradation from layered to rock salt structures and displays a similar magnitude of sub particle cracking. However, the NMC811 maintains superior performance despite those advanced degradations. The superior cycle life performance is attributed to the NMC811 particles having radially oriented grains and improved transport properties. NMC811 showed between 4.6× to 3.15× reduction in capacity fade than NMC532 for charging rates between 4C (e.g., 15-minute charging) and 6C (10-minute charging).","Wiley","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

The aim of this study is to understand the chemical and microstructural evolution towards optimizing sintering conditions to achieve good conductivity at low sintering temperatures. To this end, the pore surface chemistry, morphology, and elemental enrichment along grain boundaries are investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray scattering, and thermo-gravimetric analysis at temperatures below and above 1000 °C where the conductivity is significantly affected. Combined with theoretical simulations, three transition regions during the temperature ramp to 900 °C were identified: (1) 200 °C to 350 °C where the air-exposed protonated Li<sub>6.4</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>1.4</sub>Ta<sub>0.6</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (H-LLZTO) releases H<sup>+</sup> and the lattice constant decreases, (2) 550 °C to 700 °C where the LLZTO surface structure becomes unstable, which leads to the formation of a La<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (LZO) phase, and (3) 700 °C to 870 °C, where the surface Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> layer starts to decompose and react with the intermediate LZO phase to reform the LLZTO cubic phase. While gradual densification is observed between 750 °C and 900 °C, higher temperatures (1000 °C and above) significantly reduce the pore volume and increase the conductivity. Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) under cryo conditions reveals Ta enrichment and Zr depletion at grain boundaries after sintering at 1100 °C for 6 hours.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

NMR studies confirmed the superb dehydrating capability of PyDMA, which successfully prevents HF formation even at high water content. Addition of 0.5 wt% PyDMA resulted in improved capacity retention in full-cells, and also in lower levels of transition metal dissolution from the cathode.

Combinations of phases can complement each other's strengths and mitigate their weaknesses if their interfaces are carefully controlled. Intra- and interparticle phase interactions from nanoscale to macroscale must be carefully tuned to generate distinct effects on properties and performance. An informed design strategy must be paired with relevant synthesis techniques and complemented by spatially resolved characterization tools to manipulate different length scales and interfaces. This review examines the design, synthesis, and characterization strategies that have been demonstrated for the preparation of heterogeneous, multiphasic LTMOs with phase interfaces across varied length scales.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Boise State Univ., ID (United States); Argonne National Lab.

Still, no report exists for a systematic investigation on crosstalk behavior in silicon (Si)-based cells as a function of transition metal composition in cathodes. We studied the effect of crosstalk on degradation of Si-rich anodes in full cells with different cathodes having the same crystal structure but different transition metal compositions, such as LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NM111), LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC532), and LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC811).

One way to meet the growing demands for high-capacity LIBs is by developing so-called Li-rich cathode materials that greatly benefit from additional capacities from anionic moieties in the structure. Li-rich materials are intrinsically subject to higher degrees of (de)intercalation, leaving the particles more prone to fractures and thus rapid capacity fade. Alkali-rich LiNaFeS<sub>2</sub> reversibly cycles with capacities exceeding 300 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, but its capacity fades faster than an isostructural material Li<sub>2</sub>FeS<sub>2</sub>. Using synchrotron-based transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), we demonstrate that the capacity fade of LiNaFeS<sub>2</sub> stems from particle fractures in the first charge cycle. We improve the cycling performance of LiNaFeS<sub>2</sub> by means of cryomilling, which enhances capacity retention at cycle 50 by 76%. Through crystallographic and morphological characterization techniques, we confirm that cryomilling not only decreases particle and crystallite size while increasing microstrain but also prevents particles from fracturing. Cryomilling is a powerful tool to engineer nanoscale battery materials, and TXM allows the direct observation of morphological changes of the particles, which can be leveraged to develop next-generation cathode materials for LIBs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

Smaller particles provide both shorter diffusion lengths for lithium incorporation and increased surface site density for lithium insertion.

Unfortunately, traditional battery testing may take years to reach thousands of cycles. Recent studies have shown that machine learning (ML) tools can predict lithium-ion battery lifetimes from 100 or fewer preliminary cycles, representing only a few weeks of cycling. Until now, conclusions about the efficacy and broad applicability of these predictions across a variety of cathode chemistries have been limited by available experimental information. In this work, we leverage a battery cycling dataset representing six cathode chemistries (NMC111, NMC532, NMC622, NMC811, HE5050, and 5Vspinel), multiple electrolyte/anode compositions, and 300 total carefully prepared pouch batteries to explore feature selection and battery chemistry's role in ML battery lifetime predictions. Here, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 78 cycles in prediction was seen for a chemistry-spanning test set from 100 preliminary cycles. Furthermore, an MAE of 103 cycles was seen when using only the first cycle. This study represents an in-depth investigation of strategies for feature selection for battery lifetime prediction, ML models' generalization across multiple battery chemistries, and predictions beyond the training set in the chemical space.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

As adoption of electric vehicles increases, fast charging has become a key driver in enhancing consumer recharge experience. Recently, the research community has made significant improvements in developing charge protocols to support XFC. New charge protocol designs derived using a combination of advanced, physically derived models, and electrochemical and secondary characterization methods, increase charge acceptance and decrease aging. By coordinating these methods and modifying protocols to account for different material constraints, including lithium plating and cathode particle degradation, novel charge protocols have increased the energy accepted during charging by over 25% in 10 min and increased the charge acceptance prior to a constant-voltage step by approximately 3x. Here, we review several charge-protocol advances, aging factors which are enhanced by XFC and advances which will enable adoption of XFC capable vehicles. These advances include implementing machine learning and other detection algorithms to reduce and classify lithium plating, which is known to significantly degrade cell performance and reduce cell life.

Although many attempts have been taken by employing various noncarbonate solvent electrolytes, there was a lack of fundamental understanding of the limiting factors for low-temperature operations (e.g., -20 to -40 degrees C). Here, the crucial role of the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) in LIB performance at low temperature using a butyronitrile (BN)-based electrolyte was demonstrated.

Recent studies have shown that LiF at the interface between Li and SE enhances electrochemical stability.

Metal oxides as alternative supports for PGMs facilitate intrinsic activity and improve durability as compared to conventional carbon supports. However, the restricted mass and electron transfer at the metal/support interface need to be addressed. Herein, to strengthen the interaction at the metal/support interfaces and improve the utilization efficiency of PGM, an ultralow loading of Pd was embedded in a surface-oxygenated PdNiMnO porous film. The Mn-doping was designed to promote surface oxygenation using a facile anodization process that created sufficiently exposed interfaces between Pd and the support, strengthening the SMSI effects at the Pd/oxygenated support interface for enhancing ORR performance. Furthermore, the Ni-containing oxygenated catalyst served as both the active component for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the functional support for stabilizing Pd, making PdNiMnO a bifunctional catalyst for zinc–air flow batteries (ZAFB). As a proof-of-concept, the ZAFB (PdNiMnO) shows a maximal power density of 211.6 mW cm<sup>–2</sup> and outstanding cycling stability for over 2000 h with a minimal voltage gap of 0.69 V at a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>, superior to the state-of-the-art catalysts.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

"Achieving SEI preformed graphite in flow cell to mitigate initial lithium loss","Yu, Yikang; Yang, Zhenzhen; Liu, Yuzi; Xie, Jian","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Graphite powder; Initial capacity loss; Lithium ion batteries; Solid electrolyte interphase","The irreversible lithium loss due to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the initial cycle on the graphite anode greatly reduces the overall cell energy density of lithium ion batteries, that is, the lost Li ions from forming SEI lead to the decrease of Li ions for the intercalation. The method of cathode prelithiation has been widely explored to compensate this lithium loss. However, these cathode additives with high lithium contents inevitably lower the loading of the cathode active materials. In this work, we report a novel approach to solve this challenge, a facile graphite prelithiation method by preforming SEI layers on the surface of graphite powders (Pre-SEI graphite) utilizing a specially designed flow cell. The Li accommodation in the graphite anode can be controlled by the operating time and current density in the flow cell for the electrochemical SEI formation. As a result, we demonstrate a 10% initial Columbic efficiency increase of the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrode in a full cell configuration using the Pre-SEI graphite, compared with the pristine graphite anode. The electrochemical preformation of SEI on the graphite powders offers a complete solution to offset initial lithium loss without a sacrifice of active cathode material loading.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, manually labeling X-ray CT images (XCT) is time-consuming, and these XCT images are generally difficult to segment with histographical methods. We propose a deep learning approach with an asymmetrical depth encode-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-world battery material datasets. This network achieves high accuracy while requiring small amounts of labeled data and predicts a volume of billions voxel within few minutes. While applying supervised machine learning for segmenting real-world data, the ground truth is often absent. The results of segmentation are usually qualitatively justified by visual judgement. We try to unravel this fuzzy definition of segmentation quality by identifying the uncertainty due to the human bias diluted in the training data. Further CNN trainings using synthetic data show quantitative impact of such uncertainty on the determination of material’s properties. Nano-XCT datasets of various battery materials have been successfully segmented by training this neural network from scratch. We will also show that applying the transfer learning, which consists of reusing a well-trained network, can improve the accuracy of a similar dataset.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

"How do super concentrated electrolytes push the Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors beyond their thermodynamic and electrochemical limits?","Sayah, Simon; Ghosh, Arunabh; Baazizi, Mariam; Amine, Rachid; Dahbi, Mouad; Amine, Youssef; Ghamouss, Fouad; Amine, Khalil","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Super-concentrated electrolyte; High voltage; Electrode-electrolyte interface; Lithium based batteries; Supercapacitors","Increasing the energy density of energy storage devices is currently the key target of many battery and supercapacitor research activities. For both types of devices, the electrochemical stability window (ESW) determines the effective energy density of the device. ESWs are defined by the effective oxidation and reduction potentials of the electrolyte, which are controlled by many various factors, including the HOMO/LUMO (highest/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies of the electrolyte molecules, the nature of the electrode/electrolyte interphases, and other physicochemical properties. The concentration of the electrolyte would affect the HOMO/ LUMO levels thus also change the ESW. A higher concentration of salt induces specific arrangements among the anion, cation, and solvent molecules of an electrolyte, altering the bulk behavior of the electrolyte, resulting in drastic change in the electrode interfaces. These uniquely modified physicochemical properties extend the ESW in several different ways, including the enhancement in the kinetic stability of the electrodes, as well as the thermodynamic and Nernst shifts of the oxidation/reduction potentials of the electrolyte. For organic electrolytes, it is the reduced amount of free solvent molecules that plays the key role in such changes; whereas for aqueous electrolytes, it is the scarcity of free water molecules and the reduced water activity that control the key properties of the electrolyte. Here, we focus on elucidating the fundamental structural changes occurring within an electrolyte system with increasing salt concentrations. The underlying mechanisms which not only facilitates the extension of the ESW, but also enables higher rate capabilities and mitigates aluminum dissolution for batteries with organic electrolytes, are meticulously explained. Further, we thoroughly discuss the importance of high-voltage stability in aqueous battery systems by exploiting the changed properties observed with higher concentrations of salts. To finish, high-voltage supercapacitors enabled by superconcentrated electrolytes are also explored.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Shirley; Singer, Andrej","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Battery; Diffraction; Operando; Single-Particle; Sodium-ion","Structural and ion-ordering phase transitions limit the viability of sodium-ion intercalation materials in grid scale battery storage by reducing their lifetime. However, the combination of phenomena in nanoparticulate electrodes creates complex behavior that is difficult to investigate, especially on the single-nanoparticle scale under operating conditions. In this work, operando single-particle X-ray diffraction (oSP-XRD) is used to observe single-particle rotation, interlayer spacing, and layer misorientation in a functional sodium-ion battery. oSP-XRD is applied to Na<sub>2/3</sub>[Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>, an archetypal P2-type sodium-ion-positive electrode material with the notorious P2-O2 phase transition induced by sodium (de)intercalation. Here, it is found that during sodium extraction, the misorientation of crystalline layers inside individual particles increases before the layers suddenly align just prior to the P2-O2 transition. The increase in the long-range order coincides with an additional voltage plateau signifying a phase transition prior to the P2-O2 transition. To explain the layer alignment, a model for the phase evolution is proposed that includes a transition from localized to correlated Jahn-Teller distortions. The model is anticipated to guide further characterization and engineering of sodium-ion intercalation materials with P2-O2 type transitions. oSP-XRD, therefore, opens a powerful avenue for revealing complex phase behavior in heterogeneous nanoparticulate systems.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, we demonstrate a disorder-to-order phase transition approach that enables the synthesis of ultrasmall (4 to 5 nm) and stable MPEI nanoparticles (up to eight elements). We apply just 5 min of Joule heating to promote the phase transition of the nanoparticles into L1<sub>0</sub> intermetallic structure, which is then preserved by rapidly cooling. This disorder-to-order transition results in phase-stable nanoscale MPEIs with compositions (e.g., PtPdAuFeCoNiCuSn), which have not been previously attained by traditional synthetic methods.

To date, the degradation origin has been mostly attributed to cycling-initiated structural deformation while the effect of native crystallographic defects induced during the sophisticated synthesis process has been significantly overlooked. Here, using in situ synchrotron X-ray probes and advanced transmission electron microscopy to probe the solid-state synthesis and charge/discharge process of sodium layered oxide cathodes, we reveal that quenching-induced native lattice strain plays an overwhelming role in the catastrophic capacity degradation of sodium layered cathodes, which runs counter to conventional perception—phase transition and cathode interfacial reactions. We observe that the spontaneous relaxation of native lattice strain is responsible for the structural earthquake (e.g., dislocation, stacking faults and fragmentation) of sodium layered cathodes during cycling, which is unexpectedly not regulated by the voltage window but is strongly coupled with charge/discharge temperature and rate. Our findings resolve the controversial understanding on the degradation origin of cathode materials and highlight the importance of eliminating intrinsic crystallographic defects to guarantee superior cycling stability at high voltages.</p>","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Calculations predict that the interface is unstable with regard to Ti-Mn intermixing starting at 0 K, suggesting that the critical temperature found in the experiment is related to kinetics. The work overall suggests that, in designing a solid-state battery, the fundamental reactions such as intermixing need to be considered.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, this calendar life protocol is used with electrolyte formulations containing various mole fractions of ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), and LiPF<sub>6</sub> to elucidate the role each component plays in passivation for high silicon anodes. Together, EC and LiPF<sub>6</sub> lead to higher currents, and thus poorer passivation, whereas EMC acts as a spectator. The variation of the components' mole fraction also changes the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition, as measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Importantly, higher LiPF<sub>6</sub> content leads to increased LiF as well as increased current, indicating that higher LiF content does not enhance the passivation of the silicon surface. Finding that EC did not yield a passivating SEI, instead ethylene sulfite, sulfolane, and propylene carbonate (PC) were used in place of EC. Using ethylene sulfite and sulfolane resulted in poorer passivation compared to EC, whereas PC resulted in superior passivation. As a result, the superior passivation may be related to more stable lithium-solvent complexes.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

By virtue of this unique characteristic, BROMs can be utilized as both anolyte and catholyte in symmetric flow batteries, consequently, helping alleviate cross-contamination issues. Here, in this paper, we report an all-organic symmetric redox flow battery based on diimide molecule as a bipolar electroactive material.

Considerable attention has been focused on inhibiting dendrite via interface and electrolyte engineering, while admitting electrolyte-lithium metal reactivity as a thermodynamic inevitability. Here, we report the effective suppression of such reactivity through a nano-porous separator. Calculation assisted by diversified characterizations reveals that the separator partially desolvates Li<sup>+</sup> in confinement created by its uniform nanopores, and deactivates solvents for electrochemical reduction before Li<sup>0</sup>-deposition occurs. The consequence of such deactivation is realizing dendrite-free lithium-metal electrode, which even retaining its metallic lustre after long-term cycling in both Li-symmetric cell and high-voltage Li-metal battery with LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as cathode.

Here, dual surface modification on LMR particles with formic acid washing and spinel coating improves the electrochemical performance. Dilute formic acid can remove the Li2CO3 surface impurities and selectively reduce Ni while significantly increasing specific surface area by ~32 %, unlocking more electrochemically active surfaces. Spinel coating enhances cycle stability by suppressing detrimental side reactions at electrode-electrolyte interfaces at high voltage. Post-annealing temperature was found to significantly affect the cathode performance. Higher temperature favors diffusion of transition metal (TM)/Li ions of the spinel coating from surface to the bulk, removing the coating by possible reconstruction into the layered structure and thus degrading the performance. The spinel coating also appears to increase Co<sup>3+</sup> segregation on the particle surface. Compared to the original material, the optimized sample demonstrates 47 % higher capacity retention at 3C and retains 89 % of initial capacity after 150 cycles at 0.5C. Besides, the specific energy density of 523 Wh kg<sup>-1 </sup>can be attained after 150 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, the post-cycling analysis of modified sample verifies a better structural integrity with less particle cracking.

The relative anisotropic volume change in the unit cell increases with Ni content in low-loading cells, while it levels up for all three NMC cathodes in high-loading cells because of substantial Li plating. The amounts of lithium plating and heterogeneity on the anode, determined by crystallographic phase quantification, were found to be correlated with electrode loading and cathode heterogeneity. The concentrations of the transition metals deposited on the anodes depend on NMCabc composition in a complex way. More particle cracking and surface degradation was found in NMC811.

We realize this goal by tuning the solvation structure, using LiV<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LVP) as a model cathode. Phase conversion of LVP induced by H<sup>+</sup> intercalation is observed in 4 m Zn(OTf)<sub>2</sub>, whereas dominant Zn<sup>2+</sup> insertion is confirmed in a ZnCl<sub>2</sub> water-in-salt electrolyte (WiSE). This disparity is ascribed to the complete absence of free water and a strong Zn<sup>2+</sup>–H<sub>2</sub>O interaction in the latter that interrupts the H<sub>2</sub>O hydrogen bonding network, thus suppressing H<sup>+</sup> intercalation. On the basis of this strategy, a novel PEG-based hybrid electrolyte is designed to replace the corrosive ZnCl2 WiSE.

However, their practical application is hindered by many obstacles. Due to the insulating nature of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> product and the slow kinetics of reactions, attaining sustainable low charge overpotentials at high rates becomes a challenge resulting in the battery's early failure and low round trip efficiency. Herein, outstanding characteristics are discovered of a conductive metal organic framework (c-MOF) that promotes the growth of nanocrystalline Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with amorphous regions. This provides a platform for the continuous growth of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> units away from framework, enabling a fast discharge at high current rates. Moreover, the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>structure works in synergy with the redox mediator (RM). The conductivity of the amorphous regions of the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> allows the RM to act directly on the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> surface instead of catalyst edges and then transport through the electrolyte to the Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> surface. This direct charge transfer enables a small charge potential of <3.7 V under high current densities (1-2 A g<sup>-1</sup>) sustained for a long cycle life (100-300 cycles) for large capacities (1000-2000 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>). These results open a new direction for utilizing c-MOFs towards advanced energy storage systems.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the drastic volumetric changes of Si upon lithiation/delithiation hinder the practical use of Si anodes. Although adhesive polymeric binders, such as poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), mitigate this issue, the cycling performance of the fabricated Si anodes is still far from meeting the criteria of practical applications. In this study, we present a novel polymeric binder system for Si anodes consisting of PAA, a chemical switch (ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>), and a crosslinker (branched polyethylenimine, PEI). The crosslinking between PAA and PEI is switched off in the slurry, which can then be turned on during electrode drying. Interestingly, the crosslinking reaction consists of two stages: ionic cross-linking (PAA-PEI-i) and covalent crosslinking (PAA-PEI-c) at a higher temperature (e.g., 130 °C). In half-cells, Si anodes fabricated using the PAA-PEI-c binder show a 67% increase in capacity retention compared to PAA anodes over 150 cycles at C/3 rate. The PAA-PEI-c binder also outperforms PAA in full cells. In addition, the chemical switch controlled crosslinking binder system also facilitates the slurry making process by avoiding early crosslinking. This system requires no additional steps compared to the conventional electrode lamination process, showing enormous potential for direct adoption in large-scale manufacturing.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

The cobalt complexes 1 and 2 were supported on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) by π–π stacking, resulting in heterogenized cobalt materials 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, respectively, and studied for electrocatalytic water oxidation. We find that 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits an overpotential of 355 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of ~0.53 s–1 at an overpotential of 400 mV at pH 14. 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits activity that is ~1.6 times that of 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, which gives a TOF of 0.32 s–1 at 400 mV overpotential. The structural stability of the single-atom Co site was demonstrated for 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 using X-ray absorption spectroscopy for the molecular complex supported on OMC, but slow degradation in catalyst activity can be attributed to eventual formation of Co oxide clusters. DFT computations of electrocatalytic water oxidation using the molecular complexes as models provide a description of the catalytic mechanism. These studies reveal that the mechanism for O–O bond formation involves an intermediate CoIV oxo complex that undergoes an intramolecular reductive O–O coupling to form a CoII–OOH species. Further, the calculations predict that the molecular 6-FP-Co structure is more active for electrocatalytic water oxidation than 5-FP-Co, which is consistent with experimental studies of 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, highlighting the possibility that the ligand structure influences the catalytic activity of the supported molecular catalysts.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

During electrochemical cycling, lithium ions intercalate and deintercalate into these oxide particles. This behavior causes two types of lithiation gradients to emerge: (i) a bulk gradient across the depth of the cathode matrix (averaged over individual oxide particles) and (ii) a microscopic gradient across the particles themselves, which also depends on their location in the electrode. Here we show how both gradients can be studied using operando X-ray diffraction during 4C charge and 4C discharge. The oxide (de)lithiation is estimated from the unit cell parameters by indexing the X-ray diffraction spectra. By fitting the lithiation profiles with orthogonal polynomials, the bulk gradients across the electrode thickness are quantified. These gradients develop as the current flows through the cell and dissipate during open-circuit and potentiostatic-hold periods. Further details of lithiation dynamics can be obtained through shape analysis of the Bragg peaks.

In the present work, the impact of such nonionic contaminants on the practical performance of both anode and cathode materials is evaluated using a synergistic combination of electrochemical and thermal analysis. The impurities under study have been selected through evaluation of industrially shredded batteries, and include Fe-0, Al-0, Mg-0, Cu-0, and Si-0. The electrochemical behavior of materials containing each individual contaminant at either the anode or the cathode is evaluated in both half-cell and full-cell format. Further, the first-cycle thermal signatures of full cells are used to validate and complement electrochemical signatures, and the two techniques are used in conjunction to suggest distinct mechanisms of electrochemical reactivity for the various impurities. At the anode, metallic contaminants are found to disrupt performance through direct reaction with Li and may serve as weak catalysts to accelerate electrolyte degradation. At the cathode, metallic contaminants show evidence of crossover during formation cycling to disrupt SEI formation.

"Pathways towards managing cost and degradation risk of fast charging cells with electrical and thermal controls","Song, Juhyun; Liu, Zhe; Knehr, Kevin W.; Kubal, Joseph J.; Kim, Hong-Keun; Dees, Dennis W.; Nelson, Paul A.; Ahmed, Shabbir","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The charging rate of Li-ion batteries is limited by the risks of lithium plating and thermal damage, both of which negatively affect lifetime of the batteries. This work analyzes how to minimize charge time and manage the risk of degradation using both electrical and thermal controls. To accomplish this, an electrochemical-thermal model is developed to introduce a constant-risk fast charging protocol which maximizes the charging current while maintaining the cell within pre-defined design limits selected to minimize the risk of degradation. Results indicate 80%-charging of a typical NMC/graphite cell can be achieved within 10 minutes with a cell cost under $100 kW<sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> (corresponding to an 80 μm thick anode) when charged at moderate allowable risks of degradation. Here, we also demonstrate how stretching the allowable risk (i.e., higher temperatures, larger C-rates, and lower anode potential limits) allows affordable design of fast charging cells.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

"An in situ generated polymer electrolyte via anionic ring-opening polymerization for lithium–sulfur batteries","Meisner, Quinton J.; Jiang, Sisi; Cao, Pengfei; Glossmann, Tobias; Hintennach, Andreas; Zhang, Zhengcheng","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The use of solid polymer electrolytes has previously proven to be an effective approach to address the lithium polysulfide dissolution and high electrode interfacial impedance of Li–S batteries via an in situ polymerization process. However, the conventional in situ synthesis employs a cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) catalyzed by a strong Lewis acid. New polymerization chemistry that is more compatible with Li–S chemistry needs to be developed to mitigate the disadvantages associated with the CROP process. Herein we report a new approach to in situ polymerize a set of new episulfide monomers in solution with LiTFSI salt via an anionic ring-opening polymerization (AROP). This new polymer system takes advantage of the inherent cell chemistry present in the Li–S cell through the nucleophilic lithium sulfides which are generated during the initial discharge cycle and act as the initiator for the polymerization. Additionally, their presence was shown to initiate the monomer solvents through AROP with no need for additional catalysts, rather than the more commonly utilized cationic systems which require an external Lewis acid catalyst. This work offers an important pathway toward in situ polymer electrolytes for Li–S batteries and offers a new avenue of exploration for polymer electrolyte synthesis.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Tuning the Li diffusion on the anode surface has been regarded previously as a mainstream method to induce its uniform deposition, while the diffusion of Li in the anode bulk is usually ignored. In this study, conceptually different from the classic surface modification, we propose a molecular tunnelling strategy to construct atomic channels in graphite bulk, which enables the fast diffusion of superdense Li. Density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations prove that the bulk diffusion through atomic channels could become a new and dominating path. Its reversible and efficient diffusion has been further visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy. As a result, when coupled with high-loading LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathodes (20 mg cm<sup>–2</sup>), a high areal capacity and 100% capacity retention are achieved over 370 cycles.

However, the commercialization of high-Ni cathodes is hindered by their intrinsic chemomechanical instabilities and fast capacity fade. The emerging single-crystalline strategy offers a promising solution, yet the operation and degradation mechanism of single-crystalline cathodes remain elusive, especially in the extremely challenging ultrahigh-Ni (Ni > 90%) regime whereby the phase transformation, oxygen loss, and mechanical instability are exacerbated with increased Ni content. Herein, we decipher the atomic-scale stabilization mechanism controlling the enhanced cycling performance of an ultrahigh-Ni single-crystalline cathode. We find that the charge/discharge inhomogeneity, the intergranular cracking, and oxygen-loss-related phase degradations that are prominent in ultrahigh-Ni polycrystalline cathodes are considerably suppressed in their single-crystalline counterparts, leading to improved chemomechanical and cycling stabilities of the single-crystalline cathodes. Furthermore, our work offers important guidance for designing next-generation single-crystalline cathodes for high-capacity, long-life LIBs.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1 V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO<sub>2</sub> degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high-voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt-free LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, is presented. In this work, lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3–O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni-ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic-scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene-based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high-voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high-voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt-free cathodes in Li-ion battery technology.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

With a synergistic combination of X-ray tomography, structural probes, and charge reconfiguration, we encode the physical origins and structural evolution of electro-chemo-mechanical degradation in PIB anodes. By the multiple ion transport pathways created by the orderly hierarchical pores from “surface to bulk” and the homogeneous charge distribution governed in doped nanodomains, the anisotropic expansion can be significantly relieved with trace isoelectronic element doping into the host lattice, maintaining particle mechanical integrity.

It is known that the reduction of electrolyte anions such as bi s (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI<sup>-</sup>) causes Mg surface passivation, resulting in poor electrochemical performance for Mg-ion batteries. We reveal that the addition of sodium cations (Na<sup>+</sup>) in Mg-ion electrolytes can fundamentally alter the interfacial chemistry and structure at the Mg anode surface. The molecular dynamics simulation suggests that Na<sup>+</sup> cations contribute to a significant population in the interfacial double layer so that TFSI<sup>-</sup> anions are excluded from the immediate interface adjacent to the Mg anode. As a result, the TFSI<sup>-</sup> decomposition is largely suppressed so does the formation of passivation layers at the Mg surface. This mechanism is supported by our electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic analyses. The resultant Mg deposition demonstrates smooth surface morphology and lowered overpotential compared to the pure Mg(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> electrolyte.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The temperature dependence of these properties is important for predicting how the performance of the battery will change as a function of temperature, along with gaining fundamental insights into the underpinnings of ion transport in these electrolytes. In this study we provide the first investigation of the effect of temperature on ionic conductivity, salt diffusion coefficient, transference number, and the thermodynamic factor of a model polymer electrolyte: lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt dissolved in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). These properties were measured at 70, 90, and 110 °C. As expected, we see monotonic increases in conductivity and diffusion with increasing temperature. Additionally, monotonic dependencies on temperature were obtained for the transference number and the thermodynamic factor. One presumes that concentration polarization decreases with increasing temperature due to more rapid ion transport. We use concentrated solution theory to predict concentration polarization in lithium-PEO/LiTFSI-lithium symmetric cells and thereby quantify the effect of temperature on concentration polarization.","Elsevier","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

In a class of high-capacity spinel-type cathode materials, we identify cation to anion ratio in synthesis as a key parameter for tuning the structure continuously from a well-ordered spinel, through a partially ordered spinel, to rocksalt. We find that the varying degree of cation disorder modifies the voltage profile, rate capability, and charge-compensation mechanism in a rational and predictable way. Our results indicate that spinel-type order is most beneficial for achieving high-rate performance as long as the cooperative 8a to 16c phase transition is suppressed, while more rocksalt-like disorder facilitates O redox, which can increase capacity.

The capacity fade of Si-graphite (Gr) electrodes in electrolytes with and without 10 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is explored during cycling at temperatures of 25, 45, and 70 degrees C, focusing on the complex degradation modes arising from loss of active material, loss of Li inventory, and cell resistance growth. We first show the common half-cell testing cannot be used at elevated temperatures as the performance of Li metal overshadows the behavior of Si-Gr electrode. Symmetric cell configuration successfully eliminates the effect of foreign materials, and reveals that while the presence of FEC provides better passivation of Si, it also results in greater parasitic reactions at 70 degrees C and faster capacity fade. The electrolyte without FEC, on the other hand, shows higher capacity retention at 70 degrees C. Finally, we propose a multi-step test protocol which can successfully deconvolute the information on loss of Li inventory and of active material. By combining half-cell and symmetric cell test methods, we demonstrate that loss of active material is reduced at higher temperatures and the dominant mechanisms of capacity loss for Si-Gr electrodes at elevated temperatures is loss of Li inventory.","Elsevier","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

To date, only aqueous RFBs, such as the vanadium RFB, have been implemented commercially. Nevertheless, the limited energy densities and high-cost materials may preclude their wider market penetration. Organic non-aqueous redox-flow batteries (O-NRFBs), which utilize redox-active organic molecules (ROMs), have been offered as an attractive alternative. Many possible advantages include the use of earth-abundant elements (C, H, N, O, S, F), wherein the ROMs can be prepared from low-cost and sustainable materials. Additionally, a large variety of electroactive moieties are accessible as building blocks, providing a synthetic platform to tune the properties of ROMs through rational design. As a consequence, the development of novel ROMs has attracted researchers with diverse backgrounds, prompting remarkable innovations in the past decade. However, consistency in experimental protocols (e.g., electrochemical methods, cycling stability, experimental conditions) has not coincided with this uptick in research, leading to sometimes ambiguous and incomparable results. This is further convoluted by the complexity innate to battery development, such as cell design, detection, and characterization of reactions and active components. The O-NRFB application imposes stringent requirements on the physical or/and chemical processes involved in electrochemical cycling. Yet such considerations are often overlooked. Further, while quantum mechanical calculations provide a convenient tool for evaluating and selecting ROM candidates, this simulation is not always performed. Thus, in this Energy Focus, we detail a means to standardize experimental protocols for studies of O-NRFBs and suggest practices to facilitate fundamental understanding and development of ROMs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

As a result, research is intensifying on next-generation battery technologies. The use of a lithium metal anode promises the highest theoretical energy density and enables use of lithium-free or novel high-energy cathodes. However, the lithium metal anode suffers from poor morphological stability and Coulombic efficiency during cycling, especially in liquid electrolytes. In contrast to solid electrolytes, liquid electrolytes have the advantage of high ionic conductivity and good wetting of the anode, despite the lithium metal volume change during cycling. Rapid capacity fade due to inhomogeneous deposition and dissolution of lithium is the main hindrance to the successful utilization of the lithium metal anode in combination with liquid electrolytes. In this perspective, we discuss how experimental and theoretical insights can provide possible pathways for reversible cycling of two-dimensional lithium metal. Therefore, we discuss improvements in the understanding of lithium metal nucleation, deposition, and stripping on the nanoscale. As the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a key role in the lithium morphology, we discuss how the proper SEI design might allow stable cycling. We highlight recent advances in conventional and (localized) highly concentrated electrolytes in view of their respective SEIs. We also discuss artificial interphases and three-dimensional host frameworks, which show prospects of mitigating morphological instabilities and suppressing large shape change on the electrode level.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Impact of Stabilizing Cations on Lithium Intercalation in Tunneled Manganese Oxide Cathodes","Kempaiah, Ravindra; Chan, Henry; Srinivasan, Srilok; Sankaranarayanan, Subramanian KRS; Narayanan, Badri; Subramanian, Arunkumar","25 ENERGY STORAGE; alpha-manganese oxide; green electrode; lithium diffusion; lithium intercalation; lithium-ion battery; tunnel cathodes","Stabilizing cations such as K<sup>+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, and Ag<sup>+</sup> are known to provide charge neutrality and enhance structural stability in low-cost tunneled manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) cathodes for Li ion batteries. However, a fundamental understanding of the role of these cations in the electrochemical performance of tunneled MnO<sub>2</sub> cathodes remains unclear, especially at low stabilizing cation concentrations. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT + U) calculations to reveal the impact of stabilizing potassium cation (K<sup>+</sup>) concentration on the structural stability, electronic properties, and kinetics of lithium transport in 2 x 2 tunneled manganese oxide (α-K<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>8</sub>O<sub>16</sub>, at y = 0, 1, and 2) battery cathodes during lithium intercalation. Specifically, we provide insights into the effect of K<sup>+</sup> ions on several critical factors governing the electrochemical storage performance of tunneled MnO2 cathodes, including (a) energetically favorable Li+ host sites, (ii) Li<sup>+</sup> and electron transport capabilities, (iii) optimal intercalation pathways, crystal distortion, microstructural stability, and tunneled-to-layer phase transformation as a function of lithium content, and (iv) cell output voltage profile. Interestingly, we find that low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (y ≤ 1) yield partially cation-deficient tunnels in the MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode. Such unique tunnel structures in the cathode enable (a) low kinetic barriers for Li transport, (b) excellent thermodynamic stability of the tunneled structure even at a high Li<sup>+</sup> loading (up to ~ 0.625 Li/Mn), and (c) good electronic conductivity facilitated by Jahn-Teller distortions; all of which are critical for achieving high capacity batteries with enhanced rate capability. Additionally, these results provide perspectives to design low-cost transition metal oxide cathodes for high-performance Li-ion batteries with excellent cycle life.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Elucidating the Redox Behavior during Atomic Layer Deposition on Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode Materials","Darapaneni, Pragathi; Mane, Anil U.; Turczynski, Andrew; Elam, Jeffrey W.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Atomic layer deposition; Materials; Oxidation state; Oxides; Transition metals","Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as a promising technology for applying ultrathin protective coatings on lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathode surfaces to improve their cycling stability. While there have been numerous reports evaluating the electrochemical performance of these surface-modified cathode materials, the chemical changes induced on the surface of the cathode materials upon ALD coating are not fully studied. This paper describes a systematic investigation to understand the interfacial changes of 12 different cathode materials upon coating with aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) using trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and H<sub>2</sub>O, and aluminum fluoride (AlF<sub>3</sub>) using TMA and hydrogen fluoride pyridine (HFPy).

The XPS measurements reveal that the transition metals in the cathode materials undergo selective oxidation/reduction depending upon the nature of the precursor, the coating, and the cathode material. The ability to chemically modify the surface of cathode materials via vapor-phase precursor adsorption will open new avenues to systematically control the interface of the cathode materials in LIBs that are not possible by conventional coating methods.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Unlike olivine-LiMPO<sub>4</sub> (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) cathodes, maricite-NaMPO<sub>4</sub> phases are electrochemically inactive due to lack of sodium diffusion channels. Interestingly, cobalt bearing compounds exhibit rich polymorphism (α-, β-, ABW- and Red-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub>). However, the preparation of NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> single phases is challenging due to their closer enthalpies of formation. In this study, we have attempted to understand the formation mechanism of NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> polymorphs during solid state reaction using two different cobalt precursors (Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> and CoCO<sub>3</sub>). The temperature dependent <em>in-situ</em> powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies showed the formation of β-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> at a much lower temperature compared to the one reported in the literature, whilst we have discovered a new high temperature polymorph gamma-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub>. The choice of precursors was also found to be important for the preparation of ABW-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub>, i.e., the rapid decomposition of Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> has resulted in its formation whilst the high stability of CoCO<sub>3</sub> prohibited the same. The order of the formation of the NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> polymorphs during heating was found to be ABW→β→α →$\gamma$. During normal cooling, gamma-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> transformed primarily into alpha-polymorph whilst quenching in liquid N-2 resulted in the formation of β-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> The as-synthesized beta- and ABW-NaCoPO<sub>4</sub> phases exhibited high sodium (de)-intercalation voltages (similar to 4.2 and 4.5 V vs. Na<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>0</sup>, respectively), albeit with limited reversible capacities.

As we explore advanced battery chemistries (6,7) or previously inaccessible aspects of existing ones, (8-10) new theories are required to drive decisions.

We can strive to make the theoretical research verifiable such that any battery stakeholder can assess the veracity of new theories, sophisticated simulations or elaborate analyses. We distinguish verifiability, which amounts to “Can I trust the results, conclusions and insights and identify the context where they are relevant?”, from reproducibility, which ensures “Would I get the same results if I followed the same steps?” With this motivation, we propose a checklist to guide future reports of theoretical battery research in Table 1. We hereafter discuss our thoughts leading to this and how it helps to consistently document necessary details while allowing complete freedom for creativity of individual researchers.

In this Perspective, we draw upon atomistic simulations of a wide range of superionic conductors to illustrate some ways frustration can lower diffusion cation barriers in solids. Based on our studies of halides, oxides, sulfides and hydroborates and a survey of published reports, we classify three types of frustration that create competition between different local atomic preferences, thereby flattening the diffusive energy landscape. These include chemical frustration, which derives from competing factors in the anion–cation interaction; structural frustration, which arises from lattice arrangements that induce site distortion or prevent cation ordering; and dynamical frustration, which is associated with temporary fluctuations in the energy landscape due to anion reorientation or cation reconfiguration. For each class of frustration, we provide detailed simulation analyses of various materials to show how ion mobility is facilitated, resulting in stabilizing factors that are both entropic and enthalpic in origin. We propose the use of these categories as a general construct for classifying frustration in superionic conductors and discuss implications for future development of suitable descriptors and improvement strategies.","The Royal Society Publishing","External Audience (Unlimited)","Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

A combination of modeling and laboratory measurements create a timely and synergistic approach to identifying candidate electrolyte formulations. Multi-solvent systems provide a balanced set of properties, wherein lower molecular-weight solvents offer reduced viscosity, increased species diffusivity, and mitigation of concentration polarization at high charge rates. Carefully selected formulations can exhibit peak conductivity and usable conductivity range of two to three times that of the baseline EC-EMC (3:7, wt.) + LiPF<sub>6</sub>. Candidates are also chosen based on stability and longevity within the cell environment. Lab testing coincides with property predictions from the Advanced Electrolyte Model (AEM) and a macro-scale cell model. Furthermore, cell testing utilized coin and pouch cells having NMC532 or NMC811 cathodes with graphite electrodes. Results indicate combinations of low-molecular weight solvents are key for fast-charge electrolytes as they extend the useful conductivity range to both low and higher salt concentrations, and possess higher self-diffusivities compared to conventional solvents.

Repeated fast charging induces changes in the capacity-voltage profiles and increases the probability of lithium-plating on the electrode. This higher probability results from structural, morphological and chemical modifications that are revealed by multi-length scale characterization of graphite anodes extracted from discharged lithium-ion cells, previously charged at rates up to 6 C. The distinct differences between anodes with lithium-plating and as-prepared electrodes are clearly seen in analytical electron microscopy data. Scanning electrode microscopy (SEM) images show that the fast-charged anode is significantly thicker, apparently because of the electrolyte reduction/hydrolysis products that accumulate in electrode pores. High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images reveal wavy graphite fringes near the particle edges. Analysis of scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) data reveal higher d-spacings and greater lattice rotations, indicating disorder in the graphite near the particle edges that extend about 20 nm into the bulk.

The resultant RFBs resemble the aqueous vanadium RFBs, but offer greater design flexibility and potentially more favorable electrochemical and physicochemical properties. Yet the complex trade-offs in these properties have been a complication. Here we developed a fundamental rubric to uncover the likely origins in the performance metrics of these BRMs that are salient for their use in RFBs. Methylene linked phenothiazine and phthalimide moieties were employed as model BRMs and variations in their properties and molecular conformations were evaluated by systematically varying the methylene linker. Our results revealed that even minimalistic changes in the linker length resulted in dramatic oscillations in the solubility and stability. Using crystallography, quantum chemistry, and molecular dynamics, we clarify that the seemingly fluctuating behavior is due to (1) the inter- and intra-molecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor through bond or/and through space; (2) the formation of distinctive packing/clustering motifs. Both interactions are strongly dependent on the molecular conformation. As these structural factors modify the electronic structure of both electroactive functional groups and do not change monotonically, the structure–property response in BRMs is often complex. Finally, accordingly, these behaviors need to be taken into account in developing BRMs and knowledge of these structural factors will allow the more rational design of BRMs for grid-scale energy storage.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, XFC of LIBs is associated with the degradation of battery performance and safety concerns. Quantitative and simultaneous characterization of various components during cell degradation represents a major experimental challenge. In this work, we outline a methodology for the use of spatially resolved, high-energy X-ray diffraction as a quantitative, in situ method of mapping the degradation of LIBs. We use this approach to study the battery cell capacity loss, both locally (mm scale) and globally over the entire cell (cm scale). Specifically, our workflow allows us to quantify the total amount of plated Li on the anode, as well as its spatial correlation to the structural properties of the anode and cathode. The method complements existing optical methods to resolve the spatial heterogeneity of local degradation mechanisms such as Li plating and provides simultaneous insights into concomitant anode state-of-charge variability. We apply it to commercially relevant single-layer pouch cells with the graphite anode and the LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode. Our results show that Li plating occurs heterogeneously on the graphite anode and that it is spatially correlated to the extent of anode lithiation. In this work, we anticipate that the described workflow will allow for understanding multiscale degradation in energy-storage devices beyond LIBs, where quantitative analysis at a local and global length scale can be performed without the necessity to tear down the device, due to the applicability of high-energy X-rays to probe in situ degradation.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

Inspired by the superior cycle performance of organic materials in half cells, tetrafluoro-1,4-benzoquinone (TFBQ), the main structure of which has been widely applied as an organic cathode material, is utilized for the first time as an additive for Li metal protection. By chemical and electrochemical reactions between TFBQ and the Li metal surface, an F-rich interface layer is in situ formed on the Li metal surface during the charge and discharge process. From electrochemical tests and characterization, the powerful self-healing ability of the interface layer enabled by TFBQ is revealed, making an extremely stable Li metal anode. By using a lean electrolyte with 0.1 M TFBQ, the cycle life of Li|Li symmetric cells is increased at least 6 times compared to the control group. Moreover, impressive full cell performance was achieved. Ultra-stable Li–LFP cells showed a 0.026% average degradation for 600 cycles at 1C and Li–NMC622 cells showed a 36.8% higher capacity compared to the control group over 200 cycles at 0.5C, which are among the best results reported.

Herein, in situ formation of single-atom Fe-N-C catalysts on plate wood-based porous carbon is achieved via a facile Lewis acid pretreatment and carbonization process. Lewis acid FeCl3 pretreatment on the cell wall of wood not only produces abundant microchannels but also successfully introduces atomically dispersed Fe-N active species into the hierarchical structure.

One potential solution to this challenge is the stabilization of the lithium superoxide (LiO<sub>2</sub>) discharge intermediate, which has much higher electronic conductivity compared to Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Cathodes based on small iridium (Ir) nanoparticles have been recently used in a LiO<sub>2</sub> battery to successfully stabilize the LiO<sub>2</sub> product, however, the LiO<sub>2</sub> had a short lifetime. In the previous study, researchers found that the LiO<sub>2</sub> was stabilized on Ir<sub>3</sub>Li surfaces which were formed from Ir nanoparticles during battery operation. Little is known about the electronic properties of Ir<sub>3</sub>Li and its role in stabilizing LiO<sub>2</sub> product formation. This work provides the first study of the electronic properties of Ir<sub>3</sub>Li, which was thermally synthesized in bulk prior to implementation on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode of a Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell. Here, the bulk Ir<sub>3</sub>Li was found to have comparable electrical conductivity to Ir metal, possess metal-like magnetic properties, and has an affinity towards O<sub>2</sub> adsorption. The LiO<sub>2</sub> discharge product formed from the Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery discharge was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, titration, along with a comprehensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study. This analysis revealed the formation of ultra-nanocrystalline LiO<sub>2</sub> particles greater than 200 nm. This result was attributed to the use of large micron sized Ir<sub>3</sub>Li particles, which could stabilize larger LiO<sub>2</sub> particles compared to previous cathodes that utilized Ir nanoparticles that partially converted to Ir<sub>3</sub>Li during cycling. These results demonstrate that cathode properties can be modified to stabilize the bulk LiO<sub>2</sub> discharge product, which can be useful for the further development of LiO<sub>2</sub>-based Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Nickel-rich layered cathodes have been at the forefront of the revolution for batteries due to their relatively high capacity and low cost. However, with the increase of nickel content, the batteries suffer from severe safety concerns, which caused by thermal runaway. Herein, we show that the ultraconformal cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) protective skin with high inorganic content dramatically enhances the safety of high-energy practical Li-ion pouch cells. We find that the robust CEI skin significantly improves the intrinsic thermal stability, mitigates the evolution of oxygen resulting from phase transition, and effectively suppresses the associated parasitic reactions between the delithiated cathodes and electrolyte. The in-situ CEI engineering strategy is simple and suitable for practical industrial manufacture, and it provides design ideas for aggressive nickel-rich cathodes towards safe and high-energy batteries.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Currently, fast charging is limited by increased cell aging, which is primarily driven by Li plating and degradation of cathode materials. Here, using combined sets of experimental and computational analysis and a suite of different charge protocols, we begin to examine the interplay between failure mode, cell designs, and ultimately aging mechanisms. Slight variation in cell design and the subsequent impacts that charge protocols have on aging can create distinct cell-to-cell variation. As little as 2% difference in porosity change at the cell negative electrode during cycling due to early Li metal plating has been found to alter the aging pathway and either accelerate or inhibit the loss due to Li plating.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

Extending the operating potential window from 3.0 to 4.8 V to 2.0–4.8 V can double the capacity, but result in fast capacity decay due to the drastic cubic-tetragonal phase transition below 3.0 V, induced by serious Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of structure units (Mn<sup>3+</sup>)O<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to suppress J-T distortion by tuning the linkage of structure units MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra. The original full-vertex-sharing LiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra around MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra in spinel phase are partially replaced by edge-sharing LiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, which relate Mn-O bonds along the dz<sup>2</sup> direction with those along the d<sub>xy</sub> plane, thus significantly mitigating J-T distortion and suppressing the phase transition when discharged to 2.0 V. Following this strategy, the prepared spinel-based cathode achieves a high reversible capacity of about 290 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> and an energy density up to 957 W h kg<sup>–1</sup> with improved cycling stability. Furthermore, this work finds a new opportunity for the traditional spinel cathode towards applications in high energy density LIBs in a low cost and sustainable manner.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Li plating and stripping greatly depend on the solid electrolyte interphase formed at the Li metal-liquid electrolyte interface. This Review discusses the reactions occurring at this interface from a corrosion science perspective, highlighting the requirements for an ideal passivation layer. Rechargeable Li metal batteries are currently limited by safety concerns, continuous electrolyte decomposition and rapid consumption of Li. These issues are mainly related to reactions occurring at the Li metal-liquid electrolyte interface. Additionally, the formation of a passivation film (that is, a solid electrolyte interphase) determines ionic diffusion and the structural and morphological evolution of the Li metal electrode upon cycling. In this Review, we discuss spontaneous and operation-induced reactions at the Li metal-electrolyte interface from a corrosion science perspective. We highlight that the instantaneous formation of a thin protective film of corrosion products at the Li surface, which acts as a barrier to further chemical reactions with the electrolyte, precedes film reformation, which occurs during subsequent electrochemical stripping and plating of Li during battery operation. Finally, we discuss solutions to overcoming remaining challenges of Li metal batteries related to Li surface science, electrolyte chemistry, cell engineering and the intrinsic instability of the Li metal-electrolyte interface.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

However, in addition to the fast capacity decay, silicon anodes also suffer from inferior calendar life in practical applications due to the unstable solid-electrode interface (SEI). Until now, strategies to effectively improve the calendar life by tailored SEIs remain largely unclear, especially in high-Si content, zero-graphite anodes. Here, silicon anodes with superior calendar life are developed by adding small concentrations of multivalent salts into the baseline electrolyte. The Ca additive reacts with the F ions in the electrolyte, forming a layer of nanocrystalline CaF<sub>2</sub> that is closely coated around the silicon particles. The CaF<sub>2</sub>-enabled new SEI is strong and dense, which effectively protects the silicon core from side reactions, leading to lower capacity decay after calendar aging at high voltage. More importantly, the Ca additive is effective universally for all available commercial silicon or SiO sources. This study provides a feasible and low-cost solution for developing silicon anodes with long calendar life, paving the way towards commercially viable silicon anodes.","Wiley","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the state-of-the-art technology, but future energy requirements demand higher energy densities and a more diverse battery landscape to meet a wide variety of applications. Unfortunately, many next-generation LIB chemistries and beyond-LIB technologies suffer from large first-cycle irreversible capacity caused by active ion loss. The field of pre-lithiation/sodiation has recently emerged as researchers attempt to mitigate active ion loss and boost the energy density of next-generation LIBs and sodium-ion batteries.

However, a thick surficial oxide layer could significantly reduce the capacity of a Si anode. Here, Si nanoparticles with a thick surficial oxide layer of ~20 nm (Si@SiO<sub>x</sub>) were fabricated through thermal oxidation and investigated electrochemically. The results revealed that very low current density is needed to activate Si@SiO<sub>x</sub> anodes during the first formation cycle. Once activated, the Si@SiO<sub>x</sub> anode can deliver reversible capacity as high as ~1000 mAh/g with low current density. Then, the Si@SiO<sub>x</sub> can be cycled at higher current densities of >700 mAh/g. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the lower current density results in lower charge-transfer resistance of the Si@SiO<sub>x</sub> anode, suggesting a higher degree of lithiation of the surficial oxide layer during low-current activation. EIS analysis also reveals that the lithiation of the surficial oxide is irreversible. We believe that the surface silicon oxide layer is lithiated and forms lithium silicate during the initial activation process. Lithium silicate has high conductivity and allows the lithiation/delithiation of Si core under the oxide layer during following charge and discharge.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Unlocking the Electrochemical–Mechanical Coupling Behaviors of Dendrite Growth and Crack Propagation in All-Solid-State Batteries","Yuan, Chunhao; Lu, Wenquan; Xu, Jun","25 ENERGY STORAGE; All-solid-state battery; Dendrite growth; Crack propagation; Short circuit; Electrochemical-mechanical model","Dendrite growth and crack propagation are two major hurdles on the road towards the large-scale commercialization of lithium metal all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Due to the high multiphysics coupled nature of the underlying dendrite growth mechanism, understanding it has been difficult. Herein, for the first time, an electrochemical-mechanical model is established that directly couples dendrite growth and crack propagation from a physics-based perspective at the cell level. Results reveal that overpotential-driven stress propels a crack to penetrate through the solid electrolyte, creating vacancies for dendrite growth, leading to the short circuit of the battery. Thus, high lithiation/charging rate and low conductivity of electrolytes can accelerate the electrochemical failure of the battery. It is further discovered that Young's modulus E<sub>LLZO</sub> of the electrolyte has competing contributions to the fracture and dendrite growth; specifically, when E<sub>LLZO</sub> = 40-100 GPa, the short circuit is triggered early. A larger toughness value hinders the crack propagation and mitigates the Li dendrite growth. The developed multiphysics model provides an in-depth understanding of the coupling of crack propagation and dendrite growth within ASSBs and an insightful mechanistic design guidance map for robust and safe ASSB cells.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

The well-known class of lithium- and manganese-rich cathodes still represents very viable options. However, despite the important work on understanding the mechanisms of voltage fade, hysteresis, and oxygen activity, relatively little attention has been given to understanding the impedance characteristics of these electrodes. In particular, an anomalous rise in area specific impedance at lower states of charge, as well as overall impedance rise and surface damage due to electrolyte interactions, represent critical barriers to implementation. This work presents a comprehensive study of impedance behavior in cobalt-free, lithium- and manganese-rich electrodes. The use of a robust surface treatment allows for long-term behavior to be probed in the absence of surface damage, capacity loss, and impedance rise due to electrolyte interactions. The anomalous rise in impedance could not be correlated to surface changes, or surface phase formation, but could be directly correlated with the bulk processes of voltage fade and voltage hysteresis. The activated material can be explained as a percolating network of higher-voltage, layered-type sites having facile Li diffusion. Interspersed throughout this network are lower-voltage, disordered sites that represent a significant barrier.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, we report an investigation of the reactivity of 0.5 M Mg(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent at a Mg(0001) surface using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and detailed Bader charge analysis. Based on the simulations, the initial degradation reactions of the electrolyte strongly depend on the structure of the Mg(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> species near the anode surface. At the surface, the dissociation of Mg(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> species occurs via cleavage of the N-S bond for the solvent separated ion pair (SSIP) and via cleavage of the C-S bond for the contact ion pair (CIP) configuration. In the case of the CIP, both TFSI anions undergo spontaneous bond dissociation reactions to form atomic O, C, S, F, and N species adsorbed on the surface of the Mg anode. These products indicate that the initial SEI layer formed on the surface of the pristine Mg anode consists of a complex mixture of multiple components such as oxides, carbides, sulfides, fluorides, and nitrides. Overall, we believe that the atomic-level insights gained from these simulations will lay the groundwork for the rational design of tailored and functional interphases that are critical for the success of multivalent battery technology.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Establishing a clear understanding of the property (catalyst ink)–structure (catalyst layer)–performance (MEA) relationship lays the foundation for this rational design. Here, a synergistic approach was taken to correlate the ink formulation, the microstructure of catalyst layers, and the resulting MEA performance to establish such a property–structure–performance relationship. The solvent composition (n-PA/H<sub>2</sub>O mixtures) demonstrated a strong influence on the performance of the MEA fabricated with an 830-EW (Aquivion) ionomer, especially polarization losses of cell activation and mass transport. The performance differences were studied in terms of how the solvent composition affects the catalyst/ionomer interface, ionomer network, and pore structure of the resulting catalyst layers. The ionomer aggregates mainly covered the surface of catalyst aggregates acting as oxygen reduction reaction active sites, and the aggregate sizes of the ionomer and catalyst (revealed by ultrasmall angle X-ray scattering and cryo-transmission electron microscopy) were dictated by tuning the solvent composition, which in turn determined the catalyst/ionomer interface (available active sites). In n-PA/H<sub>2</sub>O mixtures with 50~90 wt % H<sub>2</sub>O, the catalyst agglomerates could be effectively broken up into small aggregates, leading to enhanced kinetic activities. The boiling point of the mixed solvents determined the pore structure of ultimate catalyst layers, as evidenced by mercury porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. For mixed solvents with a higher boiling point, the catalyst–ionomer aggregates in the ink tend to agglomerate during the solvent evaporation process and finally form larger catalyst–ionomer aggregates in the ultimate catalyst layer, resulting in more secondary pores and thus lower mass transport resistance. Both the enlarged catalyst/ionomer interface and appropriate pore structure were achieved with the catalyst layer fabricated from an n-PA/H<sub>2</sub>O mixture with 90 wt % H<sub>2</sub>O, leading to the best MEA performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Next generation energy storage systems will need to leverage high energy density anodes and high voltage cathodes to achieve the required performance metrics (longer vehicle range, long life, production costs, safety). Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are promising materials technology for achieving these metrics by enabling these electrode systems due to the underlying material properties of the solid electrolyte (viz. mechanical strength, electrochemical stability, ionic conductivity). Electro-chemo-mechanical degradation in SSBs detrimentally impact the Coulombic efficiencies, capacity retention, durability and safety in SSBs restricting their practical implementation. Solid|solid interfaces in SSBs are hot-spots of dynamics that contribute to the degradation of SSBs. Characterizing and understanding the processes at the solid|solid interfaces in SSBs is crucial towards designing of resilient, durable, high energy density SSBs.

However, the application of strain engineering in electrocatalysis has been limited by the strain relaxation caused by structural instability such as dissolution and destruction, leading to insufficient durability towards the ORR/OER. Herein, we propose a doping strategy to modulate the phase transition and formation of self-supported cobalt fluoride-sulfide (CoFS) nanoporous films using a low amount of copper (Cu) as a dopant. This well-defined Cu-CoFS heterostructure overcomes the obstacle of structural instability. Our study of the proposed Cu-CoFS also helps establish the structure-property relationship of strained electrocatalysts by unraveling the role of local strain in regulating the electronic structure of the catalyst. As a proof-of-concept, the Cu-CoFS electrocatalyst with doping-modulated strain exhibited superior onset potentials of 0.91 V and 1.49 V for the ORR and OER, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C@RuO2 and benchmarking non-platinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts.

Cationic potential was leveraged in elemental substitution to further promote the material structural stability and electrochemical performance. Several cost-effective O<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub> hybrid cathode materials have been obtained, all of which demonstrate excellent performance. In particular, the Na<sub>0.85</sub>Mn<sub>0.5</sub>Ni<sub>0.4</sub>Ti<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> delivers a high specific capacity of ~130 mAh/g between 2 and 4 V and 91% retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the work discovers multiple materials as high-performance and cost-effective Na-ion battery cathodes and offers critical guidance to the rational design of future layered cathode materials.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, understanding the factors affecting the reversibility of oxygen redox is nontrivial due to complicated structural and chemical transformations. Here in this paper, we show that local Mn–O symmetry induced structural/chemical evolutions majorly dictate the reversibility of oxygen redox of Na<sub>x</sub>Li<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>1–y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Na cells. Na<sub>x</sub>Li<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>1–y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with Jahn–Teller distorted MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra undergoes severe Mn dissolution during cycling, which destabilizes the transition metal layer resulting in poor Li retention and irreversible oxygen redox. Jahn–Teller distortion of MnO<sub>6</sub> octahedra can be suppressed by modulating the local charge of Mn and Mn–O distance through Mg/Ti dual doping. This leads to reduced Mn dissolution and more reversible oxygen redox. Such stabilization significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Mg/Ti dual doped Na<sub>x</sub>Li<sub>y</sub>Mn<sub>1–y</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Through this work, we show that local structural stabilization through local chemical environment modification can promote reversible oxygen redox in layered cathodes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

This article presents cycle-life implications of XFC on cathodes at multiple length scales, combining electrochemical analyses, degradation modeling, and post-test characterizations. The comprehensive test matrix includes 41 well-defined gr/NMC pouch cells under varied fast-charge rates (1–9C) and state-of-charges cycled up to 1000 times.

Despite extensive studies conducted previously, challenges exist to decouple these behaviors, capture the evolution of electro-chemo-mechanical behavior in realistic conditions, and correlate atomic-scale stress evolution to micro-scale bulk mechanical degradation. Here, we report multiscale operando techniques to investigate polydisperse battery electrodes by integrating volume-averaged quantitative synchrotron X-ray scattering with high-resolution transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM). The former provides us information spanning a wide spatial range, from Angstrom-level atomic structures to micrometer-level particle scales, while the latter provides time-resolved 2D images of the particles during cycling. The complementarity of the two operando techniques is demonstrated by an over-lithiation test of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrodes, where particles crack and eventually pulverize. Additionally, the techniques are applied to study LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cycling stability from 3.0 V to 4.5 V. Operando X-ray scattering result shows nanometer-scale features keep forming in LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrodes during cycling, resulting in an increased projected area observed by the TXM experiment. The formation of such features is inhibited by a polymer coating on the electrode, leading to vastly improved cycling stability. The polymer coating alleviates LiCoO<sub>2</sub> surface deterioration, reduces side product generation, and inhibits LiCoO<sub>2</sub> particles volume expansion during the cycling test. These operando multimodal X-ray techniques presented herein thus offer a novel, multiscale diagnostic modality for studying existing and emerging battery materials, aiding the development of next-generation LIBs.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Our models are trained on a new database of solvation energies for 130,258 molecules taken from the QM9 dataset computed in five solvents (acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and water) via an implicit solvent model. Our best model achieves a mean absolute error of 0.5 kcal/mol for molecules with nine or fewer non-hydrogen atoms and 1 kcal/mol for molecules with between 10 and 14 non-hydrogen atoms. We make the entire dataset of 651,290 computed entries openly available and provide simple web and programmatic interfaces to enable others to run our solvation energy model on new molecules. This model calculates the solvation energies for molecules using only the SMILES string and also provides an estimate of whether each molecule is within the domain of applicability of our model.

Compared to other fluorinated solvents such as alpha-fluorinated sulfone (FMES) and fluorinated carbonate (FEMC), which are prone to reduction on the graphite anode, the LiFSI-TFPMS system displayed outstanding compatibility with graphite. While regular carbonate and sulfone from the LiFSI electrolyte system are compatible with the graphite anode, their high solvating power not only induces severe corrosion on the aluminum cathode current collector at high voltage, but also renders a low aggregation level at a normal salt concentration (about 1.0 M), resulting in the formation of an unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the graphite anode. Owing to the low solvating power of TFPMS, the aggregation level of the LiFSI-TFPMS system is relatively high even at normal salt concentration, which not only facilitates the formation of a robust SEI by the sacrificial decomposition of LiFSI, but also suppresses the aluminum corrosion of the LiFSI electrolyte system at high voltage.

By studying the local structure around the iron during electrochemical cycling using in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), it is possible to gain insight into the factors which determine the electrochemical properties of this material. In order to practically perform in situ XAS studies, the charge/discharge of LFS was maximized using two approaches: (a) reducing the particle size of LFS samples from micro-scale to nano-scale in order to reduce the diffusion path for intercalating ions; and (b) applying a conductive coating to each nanoparticle to facilitate electron transfer. A family of LFS materials was synthesized and characterized using x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive analysis for structural and morphological analysis, as well as cyclic voltammetry and cycling tests for electrochemical performance diagnosis. This material was then characterized by in situ XAS.

In this study we report an effective strategy to boost PGM catalysts through integrating PGM-free atomically-dispersed single metal active sites in the carbon support toward the cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We achieved uniform and fine Pt nanoparticle (NP) (~2 nm) dispersion on an already highly ORR-active FeN<sub>4</sub> site-rich carbon (FeN<sub>4</sub>–C). Furthermore, we developed an effective approach to preparing a well-dispersed and highly ordered L1<sub>2</sub> Pt<sub>3</sub>Co intermetallic nanoparticle catalyst on the FeN<sub>4</sub>–C support. DFT calculations predicted a synergistic interaction between Pt clusters and surrounding FeN<sub>4</sub> sites through weakening O<sub>2</sub> adsorption by 0.15 eV on Pt sites and reducing activation energy to break O–O bonds, thereby enhancing the intrinsic activity of Pt. Experimentally, we verified the synergistic effect between Pt or Pt<sub>3</sub>Co NPs and FeN<sub>4</sub> sites, leading to significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability. Especially in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a low cathode Pt loading (0.1 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>–2</sup>), the Pt/FeN<sub>4</sub>–C catalyst achieved a mass activity of 0.451 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>–1</sup> and retained 80% of the initial values after 30 000 voltage cycles (0.60 to 0.95 V), exceeding DOE 2020 targets. Furthermore, the Pt<sub>3</sub>Co/FeN<sub>4</sub> catalyst achieved significantly enhanced performance and durability concerning initial mass activity (0.72 A mg<sub>Pt</sub><sup>–1</sup>), power density (824 mW cm<sup>–2</sup> at 0.67 V), and stability (23 mV loss at 1.0 A cm<sup>–2</sup>). The approach to exploring the synergy between PGM and PGM-free Fe–N–C catalysts provides a new direction to design advanced catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells and various electrocatalysis processes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Liquid redoxmers represent an extreme scenario where maximum concentration may be achieved by minimizing supporting solvents, thus maximizing the energy density of RFBs. Herein, a series of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO)-based high potential (catholyte) liquid redoxmers, TEMPO-EG1, TEMPO-EG2, and TEMPO-EG3, were developed by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains. Such modifications not only afford dramatic physical changes from solid to liquid and full miscibility in acetonitrile, but also impact the redox behavior. DFT calculations indicate that the incorporated PEG chains impact the charge distribution, which may account for the electrochemical changes. Importantly, compared to our previous liquid catholytes, the new redoxmers exhibit lower viscosity, which is desired for enhancing high concentration cycling performance. Furthermore, by using a hybrid flow cell, TEMPO-EG1 demonstrated more than 70% capacity retention over 100 cycles at 0.1 M and 66% capacity retention at 0.5 M, affording excellent cyclability at various concentrations. The study exemplifies how molecular engineering tuned the rheological properties of redoxmers, such as viscosity, to improve the high concentration cycling performance of RFBs, which may represent a promising avenue for a high energy density and low-cost flow battery system.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, in this study it is demonstrated that the intrinsic instability of an electrochemical interface can be converted from an obstacle into an advantage. In aqueous zinc-ion batteries, manganese oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) exhibits considerable dissolution even in electrolyte containing Mn<sup>2+</sup> salt. Balancing with redeposition alleviates the harmful impact of dissolution on performance and alters the trajectory of the active phase. Inclusion of Mn<sup>2+</sup> salt in the electrolyte induces MnO<sub>2</sub> deposition on all conductive surfaces, requiring that distracting side reactions be eliminated to isolate the dynamics of the active phase. Under conditions favoring dissolution, capacity decreases dramatically and a highly crystalline tetragonal ZnMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phase forms, while redeposition helps maintain capacity and promotes a disordered cubic Zn-rich phase. Ultimately, this work aims to illuminate a path forward to unlock the potential of batteries made with materials that are fundamentally unstable in their operating environment.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

This is achieved via the formation in an in situ manner of relatively more stable Li-M-Si ternary phases with less chemical reactivity. These phases stabilize Si anions and thus reduce side reactions with electrolytes at the surface and eventually benefit the overall electrochemistry. To understand the mechanism of ternary Zintl phase formation and its dynamics upon lithiation/delithiation, high-resolution solid-state <sup>7</sup>Li and <sup>29</sup>Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are utilized to directly probe the local Li and Si environments on Si electrodes harvested from coin and pouch cells at various states of (de)lithiation. The NMR spectra along with the electrochemical characterization reveal that lithiation of Si starts from the surface Si-O layer further confirmed by <sup>7</sup>Li–<sup>29</sup>Si cross-polarization NMR. Lithiation progresses with heterogeneous silicon clustering with Si<sup>-4</sup> anions at high states of lithiation. At a fully lithiated state, the formation of overlithiated Si species is detected. At a low-voltage region (below 100 mV), direct evidence for Mg-ion insertion is found, postulated by two possible mechanisms: ion exchange with fully or overlithiated binary domains (Li<sub>3.75+x</sub>Si) and/or a coinsertion with slightly underlithiated domains (similar to Li<sub>3.55</sub>Si). Upon delithiation, Li extraction starts from overlithiated Si domains. No evidence is found for electrochemical Mg removal. Evidence for a lithium-deficient Li<sub>y</sub>Mg<sub>0.1</sub>Si phase is found as a result of Li removal during charging. This investigation sheds light on the possible mechanisms of a new Si anode chemistry, which could enable the development of stable Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

To accelerate the development and adoption of new technologies, VTO has developed specific targets for a wide range of powertrain components, including the energy storage system. In this study, we use Autonomie, Argonne National Laboratory’s (Argonne’s) vehicle system simulation tool to evaluate future energy storage requirements (power, energy, etc.) for different vehicle classes, powertrains, component technologies and timeframes. BatPac, Argonne’s tool dedicated to energy storage pack design and costs, is then used to quantify the materials required for each pack. Market penetrations are then used to estimate the overall material demand worldwide and in the United States, with or without recycling. The results demonstrate that the positive impact of VTO research and development will lead to significant reduction in material compared to business-as-usual due to new anode and cathode designs, along with acceleration in battery cell chemistry penetrations. In terms of material demands, it is observed that lithium demand reaches about 80,000 tons (by a factor of 42–45), nickel demand reaches about 500,000 tons (by a factor of 47–56), manganese demand reaches about 30,000–50,000 tons (by a factor of 20–34), and cobalt demand reaches about 30,000 tons (by a factor of 13–28) in the future by 2050. The individual material demand per unit energy, however, decreases significantly in the future due to advances in VTO research and development activities. The increase in battery material demands is mostly driven by increased electrified vehicle fleet penetration in the markets.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the large volume change of silicon particles and high reactivity of lithiated silicon when in contact with the electrolyte lead to rapid capacity fading during charging/discharging processes. In this report, we use specific lithium silicides (LS) as model compounds to systematically study the reaction between lithiated Si and different electrolyte solvents, which provides a powerful platform to deconvolute and evaluate the degradation of various organic solvents in contact with the active lithiated Si-electrode surface after lithiation. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characterization results show that a cyclic carbonate such as ethylene carbonate is chemically less stable than a linear carbonate such as ethylmethyl carbonate, fluoroethylene carbonate, and triglyme as they are found to be more stable when mixed with LS model compounds. Furthermore, guided by the experimental results, two ethylene carbonate (EC)-free electrolytes are studied, and the electrochemical results show improvements with graphite-free Si electrodes relative to the traditional ethylene-carbonate-based electrolytes. More importantly, the study contributes to our understanding of the significant fundamental chemical and electrochemical stability differences between silicon and traditional graphite lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes and suggests a focused development of electrolytes with specific chemical stability vs lithiated silicon which can passivate the surface more effectively.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical corrosion of the current collector is one of the main reasons for battery failure, leading to poor internal electrical contact and the dissolution of harmful ions into electrolytes. This phenomenon is especially evident in lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI)-based electrolytes, although they have many advantages over conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF<sub>6</sub>)-based electrolytes, such as low viscosity, good thermal stability, and stable to water. Recently, highly concentrated electrolytes are found hopeful of inhibiting aluminum's corrosion and boosting new electrolyte development. Here we discuss the solvation structures of liquid electrolytes and decouple the degradation mechanisms of using LiTFSI-based electrolytes in Li(Ni<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>)O<sub>2</sub>/Li metal batteries. The results suggest although concentrated electrolytes inhibit the Al corrosion, the growth of lithium dendrites and the protection of the cathode-electrolyte interphase are not significantly improved. Furthermore, this paper provides a paradigm to evaluate the performance of electrolytes comprehensively.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The effect of moisture contamination on the electrochemical properties of NMC cathodes was studied by galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The moisture contamination resulted in either structural disorder or unwanted surficial deposition products, which increased a charge-transfer impedance and consequent performance degradation of battery cells.

While nanosizing electrode particles (with larger surface area) and maintaining electrode integrity are both good for performance enhancement, they seem to contradict each other and can be hardly well-balanced. Herein, we designed electrode particles consisting of numerous nanograins with uniform crystalline orientation to guarantee both high surface area and high structural integrity, allowing the significant improvement of Li<sup>+</sup> storage kinetics and performance. Applying this “mesocrystallizing” strategy to a NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-based anode, resulting in various degrees of pseudocapacitance response, the long-term cyclability and rate performance of this material have been largely enhanced.

"Understanding the Value of Energy Storage for Power System Reliability and Resilience Applications","Balducci, Patrick; Mongird, Kendall; Weimar, Mark","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Energy economics; Storage valuation; Energy storage","The need for energy storage in the electrical grid has grown in recent years in response to a reduced reliance on fossil fuel baseload power, added intermittent renewable investment, and expanded adoption of distributed energy resources. While the methods and models for valuing storage use cases have advanced significantly in recent years, the value of enhanced resilience remains an open research question. The findings of the recent research indicate that energy storage provides significant value to the grid, with median benefit values for specific use cases ranging from under 10 dollars per kW-year for voltage support to roughly 100 dollars per kW-year for capacity and frequency regulation services. While the value of lost load is used widely to estimate the benefits of mitigating short-duration outages, reaching as high as 719 dollars per kilowatt-year, there is no consensus when it comes to monetizing the value of improving grid resilience. This paper presents a use case taxonomy for energy storage and uses the taxonomy to conduct a meta-analysis of an extensive set of energy storage valuation studies. It reviews several approaches for monetizing reliability and resiliency services and presents a proposed approach for valuing resiliency for energy storage investments.","Springer Science + Business Media","","Argonne National Lab.

Although the use of LiFSI salt can increase the electrolyte conductivity and lengthen the cycle life of LMBs, the aged lithium anode morphology formed by the sacrificial decomposition of LiFSI is highly porous, leading to an abrupt cell capacity drop toward the end of cycling. Moreover, the inability to stop aluminum corrosion by the LiFSI-based electrolyte also causes cracking of the cathode tab during prolonged cycling. It is observed that a highly porous aged lithium consumed electrolyte at a higher rate, leading to the dry-out of electrolyte solvents. On the contrary, dense aged lithium anode morphology increased the localized current applied on the lithium, causing the formation of lithium dendrite. Thus, porosity control is the key to enhance battery performance. In this complementary system, LiClO<sub>4</sub> was introduced as an advanced additive to not only improve the capacity retention rate but also mitigate the abrupt capacity drop toward the end of cycle life because LiClO<sub>4</sub> acted as a pore astringent reducing the porosity of the aged lithium metal anode to the desired level. Moreover, the addition of LiClO<sub>4</sub> can also suppress the AI corrosion, allowing stable high-voltage cycling of LMBs. The synergistic effect of combining LiFSI salt and a LiClO<sub>4</sub> additive leads to an electrolyte system that can facilitate the application of high-energy LMBs with practical electrode loading.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The single-atom model, which differed from the previous heterojunction model, was employed for the adsorption/desorption of urea and CO<sub>2</sub> in the alkaline media. As demonstrated from the calculated results, NiO@Graphene prefers to adsorb the hydroxyl group than urea in the initial stage due to the stronger adsorption energy of the hydroxyl group.

Electronic density difference and the d band center diagram further confirmed that the Ni(III) species is the most favorable site for urea oxidation while facilitating charge transfer between urea and NiO@Graphene.

To maximize energy density, the redoxmer concentration needs to be maximized while maintaining low viscosity and high ionic conductivity. During charge, a redoxmer molecule pairs with an ion in the electrolyte while another ion migrates across the membrane to maintain electric neutrality. In a crowded electrolyte, this reconstitution changes physical and chemical properties of the solution. To explore these behaviors, a phenothiazine redoxmer fully miscible with acetonitrile was used, and electrochemical charge was mimicked by chemical oxidation. The solutions were examined using small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and conductometry and modeled using classical molecular dynamics. Overall, our study indicates that physical and structural properties of redoxmer solutions in both states of charge make it exceedingly difficult to increase the redoxmer concentrations over 2 M at any temperature without compromising dynamic properties of such solutions. The cause for this limitation is proximity to a gel-like regime in which fluidity, diffusivity, and ionic conductivity exponentially decrease with increasing concentration. This tendency is compounded by non-Arrhenius behavior of the electrolyte: a small increase in the concentration outruns gains in fluidity and conductivity at a higher temperature. Thus the properties of crowded electrolytes generally make it impossible to operate when gel-like behavior sets in. Pushing the redoxmer concentration to 2.5-3 M might be possible for small redoxmer molecules, but it would require the use of ionic liquid electrolytes at 340-360 K. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, silicon anodes suffer from low initial coulombic efficiency and fast capacity decay, limiting their widespread application. Pre-lithiation strategies are highly appealing to compensate for irreversible active lithium loss and to boost the cell energy density. In this work, we maximize the cell energy density by direct pre-lithiation of the NMC (LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) cathode to Li<sub>1+x</sub>NMCO<sub>2</sub> without introducing inactive deadweight to either electrode. First, we demonstrate that Li<sub>1+x</sub>NMCO<sub>2</sub> can be synthesized chemically, via reaction between NMC and lithium napthalide, and electrochemically. The NMC cathode is tolerant of a one-time over-lithiation up to 60 mA h g<sub>NMC</sub><sup>-1</sup>, giving capacity retention on par with untreated NMC in half cell electrochemical cycling. Using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ex situ) and diffraction (in situ), we demonstrate that higher amounts of over-lithiation lead to local structure distortion – driven by transition metal reduction to Jahn–Teller active Mn<sup>3+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> – as well as bulk structural hysteresis during over-lithiation and layer “buckling” that increases the amount of lithium extracted from the structure in the charged state. The Li<sub>1+x</sub>NMCO<sub>2</sub> with low-to-moderate over-lithiation capacity (23, 46, and 70 mA h g<sub>NMC</sub><sup>-1</sup>) is proven to be a highly effective dual-purpose lithium source and cathode material in full cell tests with a commercially relevant Si–graphite anode. These cells show higher capacity, superior cycle life, and improved coulombic efficiencies when compared to those with stoichiometric NMC cathodes. Finally, this study introduces a new and simple method to pre-lithiate layered transition metal oxide cathodes, opening up new possibilities for the development of high energy density lithium-ion batteries with next-generation anodes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the practical energy densities of the reported SSLMBs have been significantly overstated due to the use of thick solid-state electrolytes, thick lithium (Li) anodes, and thin cathodes. Here, a high-performance NASICON-based SSLMB using a thin (60&nbsp;µm) Li<sub>1.5</sub>Al<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>1.5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (LAGP) electrolyte, ultrathin (36&nbsp;µm) Li metal, and high-loading (8&nbsp;mg cm<sup>-2</sup>) LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (LFP) cathode is reported. The thin and dense LAGP electrolyte prepared by hot-pressing exhibits a high Li ionic conductivity of 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>&nbsp;S cm<sup>-1</sup> at 80&nbsp;°C. The assembled SSLMB can thus deliver an increased areal capacity of ≈1 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> at C/5 with a high capacity retention of ≈96% after 50 cycles under 80&nbsp;°C. Furthermore, it is revealed by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction that the side reactions between LAGP electrolyte and LFP cathode are significantly suppressed, while rational surface protection is required for Ni-rich layered cathodes.

Here the authors show that controlled and reversible changes in host structures upon cycling can actually be used to improve the battery kinetics. High-rate cathode materials for Li-ion batteries require fast Li transport kinetics, which typically rely on topotactic Li intercalation/de-intercalation because it minimally disrupts Li transport pathways. In contrast to this conventional view, here we demonstrate that the rate capability in a Li-rich cation-disordered rocksalt cathode can be significantly improved when the topotactic reaction is replaced by a non-topotactic reaction. The fast non-topotactic lithiation reaction is enabled by facile and reversible transition metal octahedral-to-tetrahedral migration, which improves rather than impedes Li transport. Using this concept, we show that high-rate performance can be achieved in Mn- and Ni-based cation-disordered rocksalt materials when some of the transition metal content can reversibly switch between octahedral and tetrahedral sites. This study provides a new perspective on the design of high-performance cathode materials by demonstrating how the interplay between Li and transition metal migration in materials can be conducive to fast non-topotactic Li intercalation/de-intercalations.","Nature Publishing Group","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

"Importance of multimodal characterization and influence of residual Li<sub>2</sub>S impurity in amorphous Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> inorganic electrolytes","Mirmira, Priyadarshini; Zheng, Jin; Ma, Peiyuan; Amanchukwu, Chibueze V.","37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","Amorphous Li<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> (LPS) solid-state electrolytes are promising for energy-dense lithium metal batteries. LPS glass, synthesized from a 3:1 mol ratio of Li<sub>2</sub>S and P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, has high ionic conductivity and can be synthesized by ball milling or solution processing. Ball milling has been attractive because it provides the easiest route to access amorphous LPS with a conductivity of 3.5 × 10<sup>–4</sup> S cm<sup>–1</sup> (20 °C). However, achieving the complete reaction of precursors via ball milling can be difficult, and most literature reports use X-ray diffraction (XRD) or Raman spectroscopy to confirm sample purity, both of which have limitations. Furthermore, the effect of residual precursors on ionic conductivity and lithium metal cycling is unknown. In this work, we illustrate the importance of multimodal characterization to determine LPS phase and chemical purity. To determine the residual Li<sub>2</sub>S content in LPS, we show that (1) XRD and <sup>31</sup>P solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) are insufficient and (2) Raman loses sensitivity at concentrations below 12 mol% Li<sub>2</sub>S. Most importantly, we show that <sup>7</sup>Li ssNMR is highly sensitive. Using <sup>7</sup>Li ssNMR, we investigate the effect of ball milling parameters and develop a robust and highly reproducible procedure for pure LPS synthesis. We find that as the residual Li<sub>2</sub>S precursor content increases, LPS conductivity decreases and lithium metal batteries exhibit higher overpotentials and poor cycle life. Furthermore, our work reveals the importance of multimodal characterization techniques for amorphous solid-state electrolyte characterization and will enable better synthetic strategies for highly conductive electrolytes for efficient energy-dense solid-state lithium metal batteries.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

"Theoretical evidence of water serving as a promoter for lithium superoxide disproportionation in Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries","Shan, Nannan; Redfern, Paul C.; Ngo, Anh T.; Zapol, Peter; Markovic, Nenad; Curtiss, Larry A.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Experimental evidence has demonstrated that the presence of water in non-aqueous electrolytes significantly affects Li-O<sub>2</sub> electrochemistry. Understanding the reaction mechanism for Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation in the presence of water impurities is important to understand Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery performance. A recent experiment has found that very small amounts of water (as low as 40 ppm) can significantly affect the product formation in Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries as opposed to essentially no water (1 ppm). Although experimental as well as theoretical work has proposed mechanisms of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation in the presence of much larger amounts of water, none of the mechanisms provide an explanation for the observations for very small amounts of water. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the Li-O<sub>2</sub> discharge chemistry in a dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte containing an isolated water and no water. The reaction pathways for Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation from LiO<sub>2</sub> on a model system were carefully evaluated with different level of theories, i.e. PBE (PW), B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p), B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,p) and G4MP2. The results indicate that the LiO<sub>2</sub> disproportionation reaction to Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be promoted by the water in DME electrolyte, which explains why there is a significant difference compared to when no water is present in the experimentally observed discharge product distributions. Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were also used to investigate the disproportionation of LiO<sub>2</sub> dimer in explicit DME. This work adds to the fundamental understanding of the discharge chemistry of a Li-O<sub>2</sub> battery.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the low thermal stability typically caused by detrimental oxygen release leads to significant safety concerns. Determining the pathways of oxygen evolution reaction is essential, as the ideal safety countermeasure is to break the reaction chain of thermal runaway. In this study, we demonstrate that two endogenous pathways of oxygen involved in strong exothermic reactions lead the NMC811|graphite pouch cell to an uncontrollable state, and we quantify the individual contribution of the pathways to thermal runaway. Approximately 41% of thermal-induced oxygen reacts aggressively with ethylene carbonate (EC) at the cathode/electrolyte interface with 16% heat generation, accelerating the self-heating rate and thereby further triggering thermal runaway. The residual oxygen that survives the reaction with carbonate spreads to the lithiated anode with major heat generation (65%), bringing the battery to the maximum destructive temperature during thermal runaway. By confirming the significant roles of EC and anode, a deeper understanding on battery fire was achieved. Finally, the revealed mechanism can help guide studies on stopping the two reaction pathways, allowing for the safer use of high-energy lithium-ion batteries in the future.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the fundamental mechanism of Li diffusion behavior in various Si/C composite materials remains unclear, with our understanding limited by experimental techniques and continuum modeling methodologies. Herein, the atomic behavior of Li diffusion in the Si/C composite material is studied within the framework of density functional theory. Two representative structural mixing formats, that is, simple mixture mode and core-shell mode, are modeled and compared. We discover that the carbon material increases Li diffusion in silicon from 7.75 x 10<sup>-5</sup> to 2.097 x 10<sup>-4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s. The boost is about 50% more obvious in the mixture mode, while the core-shell structure shows more dependence on the atomic structures of the carbon layer. These results offer new insights into Li diffusion behavior in Si/C composites and unlock the enhancing mechanism for Li diffusion in Si/C. Furthermore, this understanding facilitates the modeling of batteries with composite anodes and will guide the corresponding structure designs for robust and high-energy-density batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"The Quest for Functional Oxide Cathodes for Magnesium Batteries: A Critical Perspective","Johnson, Ian D.; Ingram, Brian J.; Cabana, Jordi","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The Mg battery is an energy storage technology which has garnered significant interest in recent years. Mg batteries incorporating a metal oxide cathode (MOC) are potential candidates to supersede the state-of-the-art Li-ion battery in energy density, cost, and sustainability. However, there are significant discrepancies in reported performances and reactivities of Mg battery MOCs, with detailed analyses revealing that parasitic electrolyte reactions can contribute almost entirely to the measured capacity. This Perspective describes a holistic approach. encompassing elemental, redox, and structural probes-which is vital to robustly confirm and quantify Mg intercalation in MOCs. It critically surveys recent literature for applications of this approach to reveal true state-of-the-art MOCs for Mg batteries.

Here, the hydrometallurgical recycling method has been widely adopted to recover cathode materials as a result of its wide applicability and high productivity. However, it is hard to completely eliminate impurities such as copper, aluminum, and carbon, which could bring significant impacts on recovered materials. Here, the influence of the carbon impurity on recovered LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NCM622) cathode material is systematically investigated. It shows that the carbon impurity promotes nucleation during coprecipitation and forms holes in the cathode secondary particles after sintering which could enhance cyclability of the NCM622 cathode. The cathode with 0.2 atom % of carbon impurity displays the highest capacity of 159.9 mAh/g with a striking capacity retention rate of 97.9% after 100 cycles at 0.33C, but performs worse at high rates. Nonetheless, excess carbon (5 atom %) results in severe cation disorder and lattice distortion which significantly deteriorates the electrochemical properties of the NCM622 cathode. Therefore, it is important to strictly control carbon impurity during the recycling process for spent LIBs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

But during the early stages of research (e.g., when screening compositional spaces of interest), using a CSTR in steady-state mode can be time consuming and wasteful. An alternative is to operate the reactor in semi-batch mode, which shortens reaction times and reduces the amount of waste. However, the effect of this mode on the product is not well documented. The present work investigates how several process variables affect the physical properties of Mn-rich NMC carbonate precursors prepared under semi-batch operation of a CSTR. The process variables examined are pH, ammonia concentration of feed solution, process temperature, stirring speed, and reaction time. Overall, the results can help guide research-scale production to support efficient development of Mn-rich carbonates for cathode oxides.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical test results showed the major degradation mode of LTO/LMO cells arises from continuous electrolyte decomposition at the LTO anode and loss of Li inventory. EC and PC electrolytes created distinct surface layers, where the EC reduction products were more effective in passivating the LTO electrode surface. Dissolution and migration of Mn from the cathode was probed as Mn<sup>2+</sup> species distributed throughout the surface layer at the anode. By utilizing a prelithiated LTO electrode, the LTO/LMO cell performance was significantly enhanced with EC electrolyte.

Herein, we report a self-assembly method in an aqueous solution to develop an atomically-dispersed iron catalyst with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in acidic electrolytes. As determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), this benign aqueous synthesis strategy facilitates the formation of homogeneous atomic nitrogen-coordinated iron sites embedded in a popcorn-like porous graphitic carbon matrix. These catalyst properties contribute to the improved ORR kinetic current density and mass transport. By controlling synthesis chemistry, the correlation between structure and property is systematically investigated. The iron content is the most critical material property and can regulate site density and graphitic carbon structures in the catalyst, impacting catalytic activity and stability. The enhanced performance and durability were examined in both acidic aqueous electrolytes and membrane electrode assemblies.","IOP Publishing - The Electrochemical Society","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

As one of the approaches to mitigate this problem, cathode materials comprising Ni-rich high-capacity core wrapped in Mn-rich multiple shells are produced successfully. In contrast to the conventional batch-type process for concentration-gradient materials, a digital-gradient cascade coprecipitation process described here achieves the improvements in productivity and quality consistency needed to move toward large-scale manufacturing. The core-multishell cathode materials produced in this manner not only have longer cycle life and improved rate performance compared to homogeneous Ni-rich cathode materials having the same overall composition, but also show remarkably enhanced thermal stability and low impedance growth characteristics. In a novel attempt to determine the correlation between the mechanical properties of the core-multishell cathode particles and their electrochemical cyclabilities, their breaking force and elasticity were successfully measured using a statistical approach, which indicates that a cathode particle with stable surface composition as well as high breaking force has improved capacity retention and durability. These results guide the realization of long life and high thermal stability in Ni-rich cathode materials through heterogeneous particle engineering.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

This is due to the ALD coating preventing the direct contact between the cathode and the electrolyte, and therefore inhibits transition metal dissolution.

"Principle in developing novel fluorinated sulfone electrolyte for high voltage lithium-ion batteries","Su, Chi-Cheung; He, Meinan; Shi, Jiayan; Amine, Rachid; Yu, Zhou; Cheng, Lei; Guo, Juchen; Amine, Khalil","25 ENERGY STORAGE","A new class of fluorinated sulfones, β-fluorinated sulfones, were designed and synthesized as electrolyte solvents for high voltage lithium-ion batteries. While the oxidation potential of β-fluorinated sulfones is slightly lower than that of α-fluorinated sulfones, it is still significantly higher than the oxidation potential of regular sulfones, which already possess fairly high anodic stability. However, β-fluorinated sulfones exhibit a significant decrease in reduction potential compared to α-fluorinated sulfones, rendering them more stable towards graphite anodes. Moreover, the reduced lithium solvating power of β-fluorinated sulfones compared to regular sulfones mitigates the transition metal dissolution of cathodes. Taken together, these middle ground properties of β-fluorinated sulfone-based electrolytes enable the very stable long-term cycling of graphite||LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> full cells.

In this review, various approaches used to detect and characterize the formation of Li in batteries are discussed. Each technique has its unique set of advantages and limitations, and works towards solving only part of the full puzzle of battery degradation. Going forward, multimodal characterization holds the most promise towards addressing two pressing concerns in the implementation of the next generation of batteries in the transportation sector (viz. reducing recharging times and increasing the available capacity per recharge without sacrificing cycle life). Such characterizations involve combining several techniques (experimental- and/or modeling-based) in order to exploit their respective advantages and allow a more comprehensive view of cell degradation and the role of Li metal formation in it. It is also discussed which individual techniques, or combinations thereof, can be implemented in real-world battery management systems on-board electric vehicles for early detection of potential battery degradation that would lead to failure.","Wiley","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States).

Specifically, the effects of regenerative processing parameters on the composition, structure, and electrochemical performance of the regenerated cathode materials are investigated via systematic characterization and testing. From this analysis, it was found that the raw material costs can be substantially reduced by either replacing the typically employed 4 M LiOH solution by a cost-effective mixture of 0.1 M LiOH and 3.9 M KOH or recycling of the concentrated 4 M LiOH for continuous relithiation processes.

A fundamental solution of recovering dead lithium is urgently needed to stabilize lithium metal batteries.

We present a lithium restoration method based on a series of iodine redox reactions mainly involving I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/I<sup>-</sup>. Using a biochar capsule host for iodine, we show that the I<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/I<sup>-</sup> redox takes place spontaneously, effectively rejuvenating dead lithium to compensate the lithium loss. Through this design, a full-cell using a very limited lithium metal anode exhibits an excellent lifespan of 1,000 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. We also demonstrate the design with a commercial cathode in pouch cells. Cycling lithium batteries often results in inactive lithium that no longer participates in redox reactions, leading to performance deterioration.

Theoretical calculations indicate that no O–O bonding is formed in LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, in sharp contrast to the lithium-rich system in which O–O bonding does form. Finally, these results provide the rationale for achieving a reversible deep delithiation and high energy density for LiCoO<sub>2</sub>-based electrodes.","Elsevier","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However, reversible oxygen-redox can only be obtained in the high-voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal-oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen-redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V in a P2-layered Na<sub>0.7</sub>Mg<sub>0.2</sub>[Fe<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>$\square$0.2]O<sub>2</sub> cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition-metal (TM) sites and Mg-ions are located in Na sites. Mg-ions in the Na layer serve as ""pillars"" to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high-voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of ""$\square$-O-$\square$"", ""Na-O-$\square$"" and ""Mg-O-$\square$"" to trigger oxygen-redox in the whole voltage range of charge-discharge. Additionally, time-resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5-4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn- and O-ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V, while the redox of Fe-ions only contributes to the high-voltage region of 3.0-4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM-vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen-redox, and Mg-ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The subsequent push for multi-electron reactivity has led to the recognition of the extremely versatile role of oxide ligands in charge compensation when there is a large redox swing. Li<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> is a unique model of such activity because it can reversibly cycle between Li<sub>1</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>4.7</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>. In this study, X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and computational simulations uncover the evolution of O states in the different steps, compared to the involvement of Ir. While the process between Li<sub>1</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> is dominated by the unconventional lattice oxygen redox, the process between Li<sub>3</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>4.7</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> involves a conventional change of the formal oxidation state of Ir, which affects O due to the high covalency.

Patterned electrodes, in addition to artificially increasing the current density of cells by increasing the surface area available for reaction, also generate a nonuniform electric field in the vicinity of the electrode surface. This nonuniform electric field, though rapidly screened by the electrolyte, can promote inhomogeneous deposition and Solid Electrolyte Interphase formation. As the consequence of these effects is not theoretically apparent since Solid Electrolyte Interphase volume and conductivity changes can, in principle, offset variations in local current density, we have performed experiments to examine the deposition of Li on nonuniform electrode surfaces using Atomic Force Microscopy. In this work, we measure the local variations in topography, SEI thickness, and composition, and discuss their implications for the formation of dendrites in Li metal.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

Recent studies suggest that minimizing the existing interface problems is even more important than maximizing the conductivity of SE. Interfaces are essential in ASSB, and their properties significantly influence the battery performance. Interface problems, arising from both physical and (electro)chemical material properties, can significantly inhibit the transport of electrons and Li-ions in ASSB. Consequently, interface problems may result in interlayer formation, high impedances, immobilization of moveable Li-ions, loss of active host sites available to accommodate Li-ions, and Li-dendrite formation, all causing significant storage capacity losses and ultimately battery failures. The characteristic differences of interfaces between liquid- and solid-type Li-based batteries are presented here. Interface types, interlayer origin, physical and chemical structures, properties, time evolution, complex interrelations between various factors, and promising interfacial tailoring approaches are reviewed. Furthermore, recent advances in the interface-sensitive or depth-resolved analytical tools that can provide mechanistic insights into the interlayer formation and strategies to tailor the interlayer formation, composition, and properties are discussed.","Wiley Blackwell (John Wiley & Sons)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here the authors analyse the roles of cobalt and its interplay with other ions in high-nickel layered oxides, and deduce a material formula for promising cobalt-free cathodes. Current bottlenecks in cobalt (Co) supply have negatively impacted commercial battery production and inspired the development of cathode materials that are less reliant on Co. However, complete Co elimination is prevented by the lack of fundamental understanding of the impact of Co on cathode capacity and structural stability, as well as the lack of effective substitute components in practice. Here we investigate the roles of Co in purposely designed systems that include both Co-rich and Mn-substituted Co-free cathodes. Our results affirmed that Co plays an undeniable role in fast capacity and/or structural degradation, and found that Co is more destructive than Ni at high potentials, which offers unexpected but encouraging perspectives for Co reduction. Moreover, Mn substitution effectively alleviates the destructive effects of Co and enables a high potential functionality. Finally, with these fundamental discoveries, we demonstrated a series of LiNi<sub>α</sub>Mn<sub>β</sub>X<sub>γ</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (X = single or multiple dopants) as a promising candidate for Co-free cathodes.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

And the reaction between cathode and flammable electrolyte is proved as the trigger of the thermal runaway accident. In detail, with differential scanning calorimeter tests for battery components, the material combination contributing to thermal runaway was decoupled. Characterization with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy with in-situ heating proved that the vigorous exothermic reaction is initiated by the liberated oxygen species. The pulse of highly active oxygen species reacted quickly with the electrolyte, accompanied with tremendous heat release, which accelerated the phase transformation of charged cathode. Also, the mechanism is verified by a confirmatory experiment when the highly active oxygen species were trapped by anion receptor, the phase transformation of the charged cathode was inhibited.

However, lack of high-performance cathodes has become the main bottleneck of AZBs development. Here, oxygen-deficient NH<sub>4</sub>V<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10–x</sub>·nH<sub>2</sub>O (NVOH) microspheres are synthesized and used as cathodes for AZBs. The experimental test and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the oxygen vacancies in the lattice lower the Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion energy barrier, which enables fast Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and good electrochemical performance in a wide temperature range. The suppressed side reactions also can help to improve the low temperature performance. NVOH shows a high energy density of 372.4 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> and 296 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> at room temperature and –30 °C, respectively. Moreover, NVOH maintains a 100% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g<sup>–1</sup> and ~94% capacity retention after 2600 cycles at 2 A g<sup>–1</sup> and –30 °C. Investigation into the mechanism of the process reveals that the capacity contribution of surface capacitive behaviors is dominant and capacity attenuation is mainly caused by the decay of diffusion-controlled capacity. As a result, flexible AZBs can steadily power portable electronics under different bending states, demonstrating its great potential in wide-temperature wearable device.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, under fuel cell operating conditions, state-of-the-art oxygen reduction reaction alloy catalysts either feature high atomic percentages of noble metals (>70%) with limited durability or show poor durability when lower percentages of noble metals (<50%) are used. Here, we demonstrate a highly-durable alloy catalyst derived by alloying PtPd (<50%) with 3d-transition metals (Cu, Ni or Co) in ternary compositions. The origin of the high durability is probed by in-situ/operando high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with pair distribution function analysis of atomic phase structures and strains, revealing an important role of realloying in the compressively-strained single-phase alloy state despite the occurrence of dealloying. The implication of the finding, a striking departure from previous perceptions of phase-segregated noble metal skin or complete dealloying of non-noble metals, is the fulfilling of the promise of alloy catalysts for mass commercialization of fuel cells. Durability of catalysts under fuel cell reaction conditions is challenging for active nanoalloy electrocatalysts derived from platinum group metals and other transition metals.

The methods for quantifying lithium concentration in these phases from the acquired diffraction patterns are described. Compact expressions for time-dependent concentration gradients in the solid electrodes using orthogonal polynomial expansions are presented. Experimentally, these gradients persisted in lithiated graphite electrodes even after the cells rested at open-circuit for over 9 h. A multiphase electrochemical model of graphite intercalation captured many of the observed behaviors, including the progression of phase transitions and the persistent gradients at zero current. However, the magnitude of concentration gradients in both the oxide cathode and graphite anode is underestimated by the model, even at moderate currents.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Unveiling decaying mechanism through quantitative structure-activity relationship in electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries","Su, Chi-Cheung; He, Meinan; Amine, Rachid; Chen, Zonghai; Yu, Zhou; Rojas, Tomas; Cheng, Lei; Ngo, Anh T.; Amine, Khalil","25 ENERGY STORAGE; lithium-ion batteries; decaying mechanism; electrolyte solvation; quantitative structure-activity relationship; relative solvating power","Understanding the decaying mechanism in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is critical to establishing a stable electrolyte system. Despite the advent of various novel electrolyte solvents designated for high-voltage LIBs, their working principles are not fully understood. Currently, oxidative decomposition of electrolytes is believed to be the major cause of capacity fade, and tremendous effort has been devoted to discovering a new electrolyte with enhanced anodic stability. However, the oxidative decomposition process cannot solely explain the rapid decay of some electrolyte systems with intrinsic high anodic stability when used with a high-nickel layered oxide cathode such as LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC622). In this report, a study of the quantitative structure-activity relationship was conducted to deepen the mechanistic understanding of the decay in high-voltage LIBs. Here, the results obtained from the newly introduced molecular pair analysis and linear free-energy relationship (LFER) studies were highly consistent with the solvation-involved decaying mechanism in a high-nickel layered oxide cathode cycling at high voltage (> 4.5 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). There was no evidence correlating the solvation ability of electrolyte solvents with the decay of a high-nickel layered oxide cathode cycling at a relatively low voltage (< 4.3 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>), nor with the high-voltage spinel cathode LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (LNMO). Undoubtedly, the unveiled mechanistic insight provides a critical guideline for the development of an appropriate electrolyte system targeting different high-voltage cathode materials.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Optimization of battery swapping infrastructure for e-commerce drone delivery","Cokyasar, Taner","25 ENERGY STORAGE; battery swapping for drones; drone delivery; optimization","Drone delivery is widely-researched to alter the current e-commerce delivery convention for providing short delivery lead times. Yet, flight range of drones, constrained by the available battery technology, sets a milestone toward realizing the sole-drone delivery. To tackle with the flight range limitation, locating automated battery swapping machines (ABSM) have been proposed and a few studies modeled the problem. Using the ABSMs, drones can be loaded with fully-charged batteries along the route to a demand location. Here, we introduce a mixed-integer nonlinear program to model the problem. The objective of the program is to optimally select ABSM locations, determine the delivery-mode choices (drone-only, truck-only, and mixed delivery) of demand locations, find drone delivery routes, and approximate the baseline requirements for the number of drones and batteries needed. The program minimizes the overall delivery system costs including: ABSM, delivery, drone ownership, battery inventory, and service congestion. A cutting-plane method is developed to find exact solutions in finite iterations. Computational experiments showed that the method quickly yields the optimal solution to instances with less than 60 ABSM candidates and 20 demand locations. A case study shows that the optimal drone delivery infrastructure can save almost 20% cost compared to the conventional truck-only delivery. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to reveal the impact of key parameters in the decision-making and found that a decrease in the ABSM and drone costs highly affect the system cost.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Microcracks have been previously recognized as one of the primary reasons for the observed capacity fade. Although there exists a generally developed mechanical understanding of microcracks, the role of the electrolyte has not been clearly understood, especially after extended cycling and at the atomic scale. Here, we unveil the microstructural evolution of spherical NCA secondary particles after long-term cycling using scanning transmission electron microscopy accompanied with electron energy loss spectroscopy. In this work, we found that the microcracks initiated and grew through grain boundaries, which then serve as the pathway for electrolyte penetration into secondary NCA particles. Additionally, the rock-salt phase reconstruction is prone to occur at the (003) surfaces of the primary particles or the crack surfaces, largely due to electrolyte (LiPF<sub>6</sub> EC/EMC) corrosion. Crack propagation within the NCA grains is primarily a joint consequence from electrolyte corrosion and mechanical strain during lithiation/delithiation. During extended cycling, due to the distinctive surface facets, the primary grains located in the center of the secondary particles experience more intensive electrolyte corrosion, leading to a reduced contact with nearby particles, impairing the overall capacity. These results establish the initiation and growth mechanism of microcracks and voids in NCA-based cathodes during cycling and point out the role of the electrolyte in affecting the degradation of NCA-based cathodes.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, severe capacity fading is observed in Si electrodes, and it is a result of mechanical changes of Si, such as volume changes, stress or fracture. Furthermore, these mechanical behaviors are strongly coupled with the electrochemistry of the Li-Si alloying reaction in Si-based electrodes, including both thermodynamics and kinetics. Therefore, the electrochemical properties of Si-based electrodes are strongly dependent on the control of the mechanics of Si during lithiation/delithiation. As such, it is very important to understand the correlation between electrochemistry and mechanics.

The carbon nanomaterial can be prepared from both biomass derivatives and crude biomass by a low cost, facile and nanoscale controllable method. The open slit-shaped hierarchical pore structure endows the electrode sufficient active surface sites and mass transport channels that are not easily asphyxiated by the discharge products. The concentration of oxygenic groups and structure defects on the surface of obtained carbon materials is very low, which minimizes the side reactions associated with carbon decomposition.

"Self-discharge of magnesium–sulfur batteries leads to active material loss and poor shelf life","Ford, Hunter O.; Doyle, Emily S.; He, Peng; Boggess, William C.; Oliver, Allen G.; Wu, Tianpin; Sterbinsky, George E.; Schaefer, Jennifer L.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Due to its high theoretical energy density and relative abundancy of active materials, the magnesium–sulfur battery has attracted research attention in recent years. A closely related system, the lithium-sulfur battery, can suffer from serious self-discharge behavior. Until now, the self-discharge of Mg–S has been rarely addressed. Herein, we demonstrate for a wide variety of Mg–S electrolytes and conditions that Mg–S batteries also suffer from serious self-discharge. For a common Mg–S electrolyte, we identify a multi-step self-discharge pathway. Covalent S8 diffuses to the metal Mg anode and is converted to ionic Mg polysulfide in a non-faradaic reaction. Mg polysulfides in solution are found to be meta-stable, continuing to react and precipitate as solid magnesium polysulfide species during both storage and active use. Mg–S electrolytes from the early, middle, and state-of-the-art stages of the Mg–S literature are all found to enable the self-discharge. The self-discharge behavior is found to decrease first cycle discharge capacity by at least 32%, and in some cases up to 96%, indicating this is a phenomenon of the Mg–S chemistry that deserves focused attention.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

To make this possible, a variable-rate anode potential charging protocol has been implemented by using a microprobe reference electrode to continuously monitor and adjust the current, in this way avoiding low anode potentials that favor Li deposition. Various implementations of the anode potential control are considered using electrochemical modeling and compared with the experimental data.

The possibility of changing both x and y in the chemical formula provides numerous materials with diverse electrochemical and structural properties. It is highly desirable to have guidance on correlating NMC structural and electrochemical properties with their chemical composition for material designing and screening. In this work, using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical characterization, and literature survey, the content difference between Mn and Co (denoted as x–y in NMC) is identified as an effective indicator to estimate Li/transition metal (Li/TM) cation mixing ratio and first-cycle Coulombic efficiency (CE). In addition, a linear relationship between oxygen position “z” and the size difference between Li<sup>+</sup> and TM cation (normalized by the c-axis length) is found, and such linearity can be used to accurately predict the oxygen position in NMC materials by considering the average TM cation size and c-axis length. It is also concluded that the shortest O–O distance in the bulk of NMC materials could not be shorter than 2.5 Å even at a highly charged state. Therefore, oxygen release is not likely to take place from the bulk if the structure maintains the $R\overline 3m$ symmetry.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

"Significance of a Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Separation of Anode and Cathode Materials from Spent Li-Ion Batteries by Froth Flotation","Zhan, Ruiting; Yang, Zhenzhen; Bloom, Ira; Pan, Lei","25 ENERGY STORAGE; froth flotation; lithium-ion; battery recycling; thermal pyrolysis; electrode material; solid electrolyte interphase","The separation of electrode active materials from spent Li-ion batteries (LIBs) by froth flotation is challenging due to the changes in surface properties of electrode active materials from cycling as well as the presence of organic binders. In this work, the froth flotation separation of aged anode and cathode composite materials from spent LIBs was systematically investigated after the materials were heat treated. The results show that aged anode and cathode materials from spent LIBs can be well separated from each other after a heating process in air at 400 degrees C and at which some of the PVDF binder remains intact. The underlying mechanism was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle measurements, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results from the XPS and contact angle measurements show that there is a hydrophilic and oxygen-rich layer on the surface of aged anode materials. This hydrophilic surface, associated with the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, impacts the froth flotation process significantly. The results also show that both the SEI layers and PVDF binder residues on the surface are removed at 400 degrees C for an hour, restoring the hydrophobicity of the anode materials, which, in turn, benefits the separation of anode and cathode materials. The STEM/EDX elemental analysis data confirms that there are 20 nm-thick oxygen-rich SEI layers on the surfaces, which can be removed after a heating process. The present result illustrates the significance of the SEI layers in flotation separation of electrode materials and sheds new lights into the future development of the recycling processes for the separation of anode and cathode composite materials from spent Li-ion batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, volume changes and interfacial instabilities cause a large irreversible capacity and a continual loss of lithium during cycling, which lead to rapid capacity loss. In this work, we add Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> (LFO) to a LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC) cathode as a pre-lithiation additive, which increases the lithium inventory and extends the cycle life of Si-graphite/NMC full cells, and decreases the NMC particle degradation.

By tuning the LFO content in Si-graphite/LFO-NMC full cells, we show higher capacity, improved retention, lower impedance, and superior rate performance compared to full cells without LFO. Post-test characterizations demonstrate that LFO inclusion in the cathode matrix leads to less NMC secondary particle segregation/cracking and a thinner surface reduced layer on the NMC particles. The beneficial effects of LFO endure after the lithium reserve has been exhausted, highlighting a lasting synergy between the lithium source and electrode active materials. This study introduces a new approach to simultaneously increase lithium inventory and reduce cathode degradation, and makes critical advances toward enabling Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

"Atomic-scale constituting stable interface for improved LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathodes of lithium-ion batteries","Wang, Xin; Cai, Jiyu; Liu, Yongqiang; Han, Xiaoxiao; Ren, Yang; Li, Jianlin; Liu, Yuzi; Meng, Xiangbo","25 ENERGY STORAGE; lithium-ion batteries; atomic layer deposition; mechanical integrity; metal dissolution; nickel-rich cathodes; solid electrolyte interphase; surface modification","Ascribed to their higher capacity and lower cost compared to conventional LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, the Ni-rich layered LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC622) is now considered as one promising cathode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, it still suffers from some evident performance degradation, especially under high cutoff voltages (i.e., >4.3 V versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). The performance degradation typically is exhibited as capacity fading and voltage drop, mainly originating from an instable interface between the NMC622 and electrolyte as well as the evolution of the NMC structure. To improve the interfacial and structural stability of NMC cathodes, herein we deposited an ultrathin layer of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings (<5 nm) conformally over NMC622 composite electrodes directly using atomic layer deposition (ALD). It was found that, under different upper cutoff voltages (4.3, 4.5, and 4.7 V), the ALD Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings enable enhanced performance of NMC622 cathodes with better cyclability and higher capacity. Particularly, the beneficial effects of the ALD Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings are more remarkable at higher upper cutoff voltages (4.5 and 4.7 V). Furthermore, the ALD coatings can significantly improve the rate capability of NMC622. To this end, we utilized a suite of characterization tools and performed a series of electrochemical tests to clarify the effects of the ALD Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings. This study revealed that the beneficial effects of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ALD coatings are multiple: (i) serving as an artificial layer of solid electrolyte interphase to mitigate undesirable interfacial reactions; (ii) acting as a physical barrier to inhibit metal dissolution of NMC; and (iii) forming a reinforced networked overcoating to boost the mechanical integrity of NMC cathodes. This study is favorable for designing high-performance NMC cathodes.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab. (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States); Oak Ridge National Lab.

The electrification revolution could eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels and enable a clean energy future; advanced batteries would facilitate this transition. However, owing to the demanding performance, cost, and safety requirements, it is challenging to translate new materials from laboratory prototypes to industrial-scale products. This Perspective describes that journey for a new lithium-ion battery anode material, TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (TNO). TNO is intended as an alternative to graphite or Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> with better rate and safety characteristics than the former and higher energy density than the latter. The high capacity of TNO stems from the multielectron redox of Nb<sup>5+</sup> to Nb<sup>3+</sup>, its operating voltage window well above the Li<sup>+</sup>/Li reduction potential prevents lithium dendrite formation, and its open crystal structure leads to high-power performance. Nevertheless, the creation of a practical TNO anode was nonlinear and nontrivial. Its history is built on 30 years of fundamental science that preceded its application as a battery anode, and its battery development included a nearly 30-year gap. The insights and lessons contained in this Perspective, many of them acquired firsthand, serve two purposes: (i) to unite the disparate studies of TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> into a coherent modern understanding relevant to its application as a battery material and (ii) to highlight briefly some of the challenges faced when scaling up a new material that affect TiNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as well as new electrode candidates more generally.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, we propose a drone delivery network design using automated battery swapping machines (ABSMs) to extend ranges. The design minimizes the long-term delivery costs, including ABSM investment, drone ownership, and cost of the delivery time, and locates ABSMs to serve a set of customers. We build a mixed-integer nonlinear program that captures the nonlinear waiting time of drones at ABSMs. To solve the problem, we create an exact solution algorithm that finds the globally optimal solution using a derivative-supported cutting-plane method. To validate the applicability of our program, we conduct a case study on the Chicago Metropolitan area using cost data from leading ABSM manufacturer and geographical data from the planning and operations language for agent-based regional integrated simulation (more commonly known as POLARIS). A sensitivity analysis identifies that ABSM service times and costs are the key parameters impacting the long-term adoption of drone delivery.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Herein, the observation of enhanced cycling stability of a typical polyanionic cathode, Na<sub>3</sub>VCr(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (NVCP) at lower temperature (-15 degrees C vs 30 degrees C), triggers the exploration of its structural origins with a surprising finding that the migratable nature of vanadium in NVCP leads to detrimental structural degradation of the polyanionic host upon cycling. The correlation between long range and short range structural change associated with this atomic migration is established via a strong combination of various in situ/ex situ characterization tools, revealing the essential V-to-Na1 site migration. Such transition metal migration is effectively suppressed when V atoms are pinned to their original position in the lattice by lowering the temperature. More importantly and practically, a room temperature-based deep sodiation strategy is further developed to recover the structure. Overall, this work challenges the long-standing assumption of the stability of the polyanionic framework structure and calls for urgent attention to the structural understanding of the NVCP system as well as strategy development for property enhancement.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Herein, an in situ “anchoring + pouring” synergistic cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) construction is realized by using 1,3,6-hexanetricarbonitrile (HTCN) and tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphate (TMSP) electrolyte additives to alleviate the challenges of an LLO (Li<sub>1.13</sub>Mn<sub>0.517</sub>Ni<sub>0.256</sub>Co<sub>0.097</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). HTCN with three nitrile groups can tightly anchor transition metals by coordinative interaction to form the CEI framework, and TMSP will electrochemically decompose to reshape the CEI layer. The uniform and robust in situ constructed CEI layer can suppress the transition metal dissolution, shield the cathode against diverse side reactions, and significantly improve the overall electrochemical performance of the cathode with a discharge voltage decay of only 0.5 mV/cycle<sup>-1</sup>. Further investigations based on a series of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations have revealed the composition of in situ constructed CEI layers and their distribution, including the enhanced HTCN anchoring effect after lattice densification of LLOs. Finally, this study provides insights into the in situ CEI construction for enhancing the performance of high-energy and high-voltage cathode materials through effective, convenient and economical electrolyte approaches.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the significantly increased basicity causes degradation of Si particles while the irreversible conversion of carboxylic acid groups to lithium carboxylates undermines the binding strength, collectively leading to adverse cycling performance of the fabricated Si anodes. Herein, a novel neutralization process for PAA binders is developed. A weak base, ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), was discovered as a neutralizing agent that still promotes rheological response of binder solutions but results in a reduced pH increase. Interestingly, the resulting ammonium carboxylate groups may cleave during the drying process to restore the neutralized PAA (PAA-NH<sub>3</sub>) binders to their pristine states. The best-performing composition of 50% neutralization (PAA-50%NH<sub>3</sub>) provides comparable rheological response as a PAA-Li binder as well as much improved cycling performance. Additionally, the half-cells using the PAA-50%NH<sub>3</sub> binder can deliver 60% capacity retention over 100 cycles at C/3 rate, affording a 23.8% increase compared to PAA-Li half-cells. This restorable neutralization process of PAA binders represents an innovative strategy of mitigating issues from slurry processing of Si particles to achieve concurrent improvements in high-quality lamination and cycling performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Our combined experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that TM-PBAs exhibit volcano-like OER activity with Ni-PBA located near the top of the volcano. Such a volcano-like activity profile can be attributed to the distinctive binding energy difference between *O and *OH on different TM-PBAs surfaces.

The current cathode chemistry relies heavily on cobalt, which, due to its scarcity and the environmental abuse and violation of human rights during its mining, must be replaced by abundant and environmentally friendly elements such as redox-active manganese. LiMnO<sub>2</sub> is a strong contender for sustainable cathodes but cycles poorly because the Jahn-Teller distorted Mn<sup>3+</sup> ions destabilize the lattice framework. In this work, we report a LiMnO<sub>2</sub> cathode design with interwoven spinel and layered domains. At the interface between these two domains, the Mn dz<sup>2</sup> orbitals are oriented perpendicular to each other, giving rise to interfacial orbital ordering, which suppresses the otherwise cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion and Mn dissolution. As a result, the heterostructured cathode delivers enhanced structural and electrochemical cycling stability. This work provides a new strategy for interface engineering, possibly stimulating more research on Mn-rich cathode materials for sustainable lithium-ion batteries.

"Future material demand for automotive lithium-based batteries","Xu, Chengjian; Dai, Qiang; Gaines, Linda; Hu, Mingming; Tukker, Arnold; Steubing, Bernhard","25 ENERGY STORAGE; energy science and technology; environmental sciences","The world is shifting to electric vehicles to mitigate climate change. Here, we quantify the future demand for key battery materials, considering potential electric vehicle fleet and battery chemistry developments as well as second-use and recycling of electric vehicle batteries. We find that in a lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide dominated battery scenario, demand is estimated to increase by factors of 18–20 for lithium, 17–19 for cobalt, 28–31 for nickel, and 15–20 for most other materials from 2020 to 2050, requiring a drastic expansion of lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply chains and likely additional resource discovery. However, uncertainties are large. Key factors are the development of the electric vehicles fleet and battery capacity requirements per vehicle. If other battery chemistries were used at large scale, e.g. lithium iron phosphate or novel lithium-sulphur or lithium-air batteries, the demand for cobalt and nickel would be substantially smaller. Closed-loop recycling plays a minor, but increasingly important role for reducing primary material demand until 2050, however, advances in recycling are necessary to economically recover battery-grade materials from end-of-life batteries. Second-use of electric vehicles batteries further delays recycling potentials.","Springer Nature","","Argonne National Lab.

However, SIBs have been significantly hindered by lack of a suitable anode. Herein, an exceptional Cu<sub>2</sub>S-based composite anode is developed via a facile ball-milling method, in which Cu<sub>2</sub>S particles are wrapped by nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (Cu<sub>2</sub>S@NG). This Cu<sub>2</sub>S@NG composite anode enables extremely long cycling life, ultra-stable cyclability with high capacity, and excellent rate capability. The superior performance of the Cu<sub>2</sub>S@NG composite is owing to its intriguing core-shell structure and the exceptional properties of both the Cu<sub>2</sub>S and NG. In this study, it is found that the NG shell yields multiple merits in improving the performance of Cu<sub>2</sub>S: (i) mitigating the loss of active materials, (ii) constituting a stable interface, (iii) providing improved electrical conductivity and good ionic transfer, and (iv) enhancing mechanical integrity. Additionally, the vital effects of different voltage windows and a surface coating via atomic layer deposition on further enhancing performance are clarified. Significantly, the electrochemical mechanism of Cu<sub>2</sub>S during sodiation/desodiation is unveiled using advanced synchrotron-based in-situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy.

"Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Stability of LLZO in Contact with Lithium Metal","Connell, Justin G.; Fuchs, Till; Hartmann, Hannah; Krauskopf, Thorben; Zhu, Yisi; Sann, Joachim; Garcia-Mendez, Regina; Sakamoto, Jeff; Tepavcevic, Sanja; Janek, Jürgen","25 ENERGY STORAGE; SEI formation; lithium metal anode; solid electrolyte; solid-state battery","Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (LLZO) garnet-based oxides are a promising class of solid electrolytes used as the separator in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). While LLZO is considered to have a wide electrochemical stability window, its intrinsic stability in contact with lithium metal is not sufficiently well understood, and there is still a debate on the key question of whether LLZO does or does not form passivation layers before and during cycling. Utilizing both in situ and operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, in this work we reveal the presence of a kinetic barrier to the reduction of LLZO by Li metal, with the extent of oxygen-deficient interphase (ODI) formation depending sensitively on the energetics of Li metal arriving at the Li vertical bar LLZO interface. Despite the clear presence of a kinetic barrier to reduction, the electrochemical response of the Li vertical bar LLZO interface is unchanged by the presence of the ODI, indicating that ODI formation during electrochemical cycling does not hinder charge transfer across the Li vertical bar LLZO interface. Overall, these results reveal that the reactivity of LLZO with Li metal depends not only on the material properties of the adjoining phases (i.e., surface purity and active contact) and their resulting thermodynamic stability but also on the energy input at the interface and the resulting reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of a kinetic barrier to reduction highlights the additional complexities governing the reactivity of solid-state interfaces in ASSBs and underscores the importance of operando characterization of interfacial stability to design more robust, high-performance protection strategies for solid electrolytes in contact with reactive electrodes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this paper, we report an atomically dispersed Co and N co-doped carbon (Co–N–C) catalyst with a high catalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity comparable to that of a similarly synthesized Fe–N–C catalyst but with a four-time enhanced durability. The Co–N–C catalyst achieved a current density of 0.022 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.9 V<sub>iR-free</sub> (internal resistance-compensated voltage) and peak power density of 0.64 W cm<sup>-2</sup> in 1.0 bar H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> fuel cells, higher than that of non-iron platinum-group-metal-free catalysts reported in the literature. Importantly, we identified two main degradation mechanisms for metal (M)–N–C catalysts: catalyst oxidation by radicals and active-site demetallation. The enhanced durability of Co–N–C relative to Fe–N–C is attributed to the lower activity of Co ions for Fenton reactions that produce radicals from the main oxygen reduction reaction by-product, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the significantly enhanced resistance to demetallation of Co–N–C.","Springer Nature","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxides (NCM), such as LiNi(0.5)Co(0.2)Mr(0.3)O(2) (NCM523), are commonly used in commercial lithium ion batteries for electric vehicle applications. These cathodes are typically fabricated using environmentally hazardous, energy intensive, and time-consuming solvent-based slurry casting processes. Polymeric binders, also required for cathode preparation, add weight and can undergo parasitic reactions during battery cycling. Here we report a facile, solvent-free, binder-free, and rapid cold-press electrode fabrication process to prepare high mass loading NCM cathodes within minutes. This process is enabled by the use of holey graphene, a unique lightweight, compressible carbon nanomaterial that serves as both a binder and an electrically conductive matrix. NCM cathodes fabricated by this method are stable and exhibit good active material utilization. A significant advantage for the dry-press process is that the electrode mass loadings can be readily increased simply by adding more composite powder to the compression molding die, resulting in improved areal capacities that are attractive for applications requiring high energy per unit footprint.

However, the puzzling existence and role of SEI behind the huge volume changes of the graphite electrodes need to be answered. Herein, the reason of how ether-derived SEI maintains excellent reversibility despite the huge volume changes during cycling is unraveled. Theoretical simulations and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrate the formation mechanism of an SEI between the graphite anode and electrolyte. Furthermore, the high mechanical tolerance of the ether-derived SEI is confirmed in atomic force microscopy. A depth profile of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy points to a multilayer structure of the ether-derived SEI. The outer layer comprises organics (sodium alkoxide), while the inorganics (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaF) in interior region are mixed with some organics. Notably, the presence of organics ensures the adaptability of the SEI to the volume expansion of graphite during cycling, and the concentrated distribution of inorganics improves the Young's modulus (resistance to deformation).

However, their S cathodes are harassed by the poor conductivity, shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LPSs), and large volume change. In improving conductivity of S cathodes, carbon materials are widely used as conductive additives. However, there still lacks a comparative study on their geometric and structural effects in Li-S batteries. To this end, a systematic investigation is conducted on two different typical conductive additives, carbon black (CB)<sup>1</sup> and nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (N-GNS)<sup>2</sup>. This work reveals that, compared to the zero-dimensional (0D) CB nanoparticles, the two-dimensional (2D) N-GNS is structurally less defective and has a larger surface area. Furthermore, as a result, the 2D structure of the N-GNS helps achieve higher capacity retention but inhibits Li-ion transportation. In comparison, the 0D structure of the CB facilitates the transportation of Li-ions with a higher initial capacity but exposed to a severer shuttling behavior of LPSs. It is also found that a combination of the CB and N-GNS enables better performance of Li-S batteries, in terms of sustainable capacity, Coulombic efficiency, and rate capability.

However, the practical specific energy and cycle life of Li-S pouch cells are significantly limited by the use of thin sulfur electrodes/flooded electrolytes and polysulfides shuttle/Li metal degradation, respectively. In this work we propose a cathode design concept to achieve good Li-S pouch cell performances. The cathode is composed of uniformly embedded ZnS nanoparticles and Co-N-C single-atom catalyst to form double-end biding sites inside a highly oriented macroporous host, which can effectively immobilize and catalytically convert polysulfides intermediates during cycling, thus eliminating the shuttle effect and lithium metal corrosion. The ordered macropores enhance ionic transport under high sulfur loading by forming sufficient catalyst/conductive support/electrolyte triple-phase boundaries. This prevents the formation of inactive sulfur (dead sulfur). Our cathode structure shows improved performances in a pouch cell configuration under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation. An Ah-level pouch cell with only 100% lithium excess can deliver a cell specific energy of > 300 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> with a Coulombic efficiency >95% for 80 cycles.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

For example, little is known about the properties of one of the key intermediates, lithium superoxide (LiO<sub>2</sub>), which until recently had not been stabilized in bulk form. In this work, lithium superoxide was deposited onto iridium–reduced graphene oxide (Ir–rGO) cathodes in a Li–O<sub>2</sub> system under a flow of O<sub>2</sub>. Lithium peroxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was subsequently produced on the cathode surface in an inert Ar atmosphere. Based on a detailed analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, it was demonstrated experimentally for the first time that the charge transport resistance through LiO<sub>2</sub> was much lower than for Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and correlated with lower LiO<sub>2</sub> charge overpotentials. We report this result indicates that LiO<sub>2</sub> has good electronic conductivity and confirms previous theoretical predictions that bulk LiO<sub>2</sub> has better charge transport properties than Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

For overcoming the intergranular-cracking issue in polycrystals, single-crystals are considered an appealing alternative, but aggravating concerns on compromising the electrochemical kinetics of electrodes. We report here a quantitative assessment of electrochemical reaction in single-crystal LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>2</sub> using operando hard X-ray microscopy/spectroscopy, revealing a strong dependence of redox kinetics on the state of charge (SOC) - being sluggish at low SOC while increasing rapidly as SOC increases both in the bulk electrode and individual particles. The observation is corroborated by transport measurements and finite-element simulation, indicating that the sluggish kinetics in single-crystals is governed by ionic transport at low SOC and may be alleviated through synergistic interaction with polycrystals integrated into a same electrode. Finally, with the elucidated mechanistic origin and alleviation solution of kinetic limitations in single-crystal high-Ni cathodes, this work constitutes a step forward in enabling their practical deployment.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. In this work, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K-ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K-Se battery is prepared by employing the small-molecule Se embedded in freestanding N -doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short-chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K<sub>2</sub>Se by a two-step conversion reaction via an ""all-solid-state"" electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>n</sub>, 3 ≤ n ≤ 8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se-2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K-Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K-Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Twelve cells contain a graphite electrode that is 26% porous, and 47% for the other twelve. The cells are cycled using a 6-C charge and a C/2 discharge protocol at temperatures in the range of 20-50 degrees C. A macro-homogeneous electrochemical model and microstructure analysis tool set are used to help interpret experimental observations for the effect of anode porosity and ambient temperature on fast-charging performance. Additionally, comparison between the two also highlights gaps in current theoretical understanding that need to be addressed. In post-test examination, lithium plating is seen in all cells, regardless of porosity. Elevated temperature is shown to reduce the amount of lithium plating and improve initial fast-charge capacity, but also changes the rate of other, less well-understood degradation mechanisms.

This higher solubility is desired as it potentially allows achieving greater energy density in the battery. However, the present synthetic strategies often yield bulky molecules with low molarity even when they are neat and still lower molarity in liquid solutions. Fortunately, there are exceptions to this rule. Here, we examine one well-studied redoxmer, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, which has solubility similar to 5.7 M in acetonitrile at 25 degrees C.

In this work, we investigate the reversibility of TM ions in layered NFMs with varying Fe contents and potential windows. Utilizing ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of pre-cycled samples the valence and bonding evolution of the TMs are elucidated. It is found that Mn is electrochemically inactive as indicated by the insignificant change of Mn valence and Mn-O bonding distance. Fe is electrochemically inactive after the first five cycles. The Ni redox couple contributes most of the charge compensation for NFMs. Ni redox is quite reversible in the cathodes with less Fe contents. Furthermore, the Ni redox couple shows significant irreversibility with high Fe content of 0.8.

In this work, we present a method for the detection of protons-one of the commonly proposed products of battery electrolyte decomposition at high potentials-using the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method. Using the H<sub>2</sub> oxidation reaction (HOR) as a model reaction, we first determine that protons generated at the disk electrode can be detected in organic carbonate-based electrolyte at the ring electrode with a ring collection efficiency close to the theoretical value. We then show that protons are indeed generated during the electrochemical decomposition of the battery electrolyte on Pt(111) at high potentials. Furthermore, quantitative detection of protons provided a valuable insight into the mechanism of oxidation for the electrolyte used.

Stanley","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Li-ion battery; cathode materials; vanadium compounds","Vanadyl phosphates comprise a class of multielectron cathode materials capable of cycling two Li<sup>+</sup>, about 1.66 Na<sup>+</sup>, and some K<sup>+</sup> ions per redox center. In this review, structures, thermodynamic stabilities, and ion diffusion kinetics of various A<sub>x</sub>VOPO<sub>4</sub> (A = Li, Na, K, NH<sub>4</sub>) polymorphs are discussed. Both the experimental data and first-principle calculations indicate kinetic limitations for alkali metal ions cycling, especially between for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and metastability of phases with x > 1. This creates challenges for multiple-ion cycling, as the slow kinetics call for nanosized particles, which being metastable and reactive with organic electrolytes are prone to side reactions. Thus, various synthesis approaches, surface coating, and transition metal ion substitution strategies are discussed here as possible ways to stabilize A<sub>x</sub>VOPO<sub>4</sub> structures and improve alkali metal ion diffusion. Finally, the role of advanced characterization techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, diffraction, pair distribution function analysis and <sup>7</sup>Li and <sup>31</sup>P NMR, in understanding the reaction mechanism from both structural and electronic points of view is emphasized.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

As the key component in ASSLBs, solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) with non-flammability and good adaptability to lithium metal anodes have attracted extensive attention in recent years. Among the current SSEs, composite solid-state electrolytes (CSSEs) with multiple phases have greater flexibility to customize and combine the advantages of single-phase electrolytes, which have been widely investigated recently and regarded as promising candidates for commercial ASSLBs. Based on existing investigations, herein, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in CSSEs. Initially, we introduce the historical development from solid-state ionic conductors to CSSEs, and then summarize the fundamentals including mechanisms of lithium ion transport, key evaluation parameters, design principles, and key materials. Finally, four main types of advanced structures for CSSEs are classified and highlighted according to the recent progress. Moreover, advanced characterization and computational simulation techniques including machine learning are reviewed for the first time, and the main challenges and perspectives of CSSEs are also provided for their future development.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, widespread application has been hindered due to low round-trip efficiencies (RTEs) and disappointing durability, in particular at high rates. In this study, we break through that barrier by demonstrating highly efficient, flexible, and stable URFCs <em>via</em> hierarchical design of the multiscale catalyst-layer structures. A more porous and less tortuous Pt and Ir catalyst layer is realized using a doctor blade fabrication method that significantly improves URFC performance. We demonstrate RTEs of 56% and 53% under constant-electrode and constant-gas mode, respectively, while operating at 1000 mA cm<small><sup>–2</sup></small>, and significantly, a RTE of 45% at 2000 mA cm<small><sup>–2</sup></small>, achievements that were previously viewed as unfeasible under the onerous demands of URFC operation. At the same time we demonstrate URFCs under both constant-electrode and constant-gas mode operated continuously for over 500 h with negligible degradation. These results demonstrate the viability of applying URFCs for long-term energy storage at previously unattainable efficiencies and cast new light on electrode design and optimization of URFCs.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen cathode reactions lead to huge energy loss, while the unfavorable side reactions associated with the widely used carbon and binder account for fast battery decay during cycles. In this work, hierarchically holey IrNi alloy nanosheets are facilely designed on Ni foam substrate as a freestanding, binder- and carbon-free cathode to address these challenges. The IrNi nanosheets consist of numerous interconnected nanoparticles, forming abundant nanoholes, benefiting active-site exposure. Moreover, the meso-/macropores pave channels for the transfer of oxygen and lithium ions and provide enough accommodation for the insoluble Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> product. The corresponding Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries demonstrate low polarization and excellent cycle stability with full discharge/charge capability (up to 292 cycles at a current density of 0.2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> within a voltage range from 2.3 to 4.3 V). The long-term cycling performance is principally attributed to the exclusive catalytic stability of the holey IrNi nanosheets and its good compatibility with dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte.

However, few studies focus on understanding synthesis, especially during the coprecipitation of metal oxide precursors, a process that largely determines the final morphology of the material. In this paper, we go beyond the typical equilibrium particle shape analysis conducted in the literature and incorporate kinetic aspects of morphology evolution. We perform these studies using controlled synthesis on a well-defined metal salt system (MnCO<sub>3</sub>) combined with multiscale simulations and high-resolution microscopy. Results show that with increasing metal concentration, the particles transition from rhombohedral to cubic to spherical shapes. Computational analysis using density functional theory (DFT) reveals that rhombohedral shaped particles evolve under equilibrium conditions. Phase field techniques indicate that at higher metal concentrations, fast growth kinetics of the precipitates result in the transition to cubic and, subsequently, spherical shapes, accompanied by a decrease in particle size. This study, while limited to the one metal salt system, provides an approach to shed light on the synthesis process of mixed transition metal salts, gradient materials, and other cathode materials of interest to the battery community.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, a high-power and durable Co–N–C nanofiber catalyst synthesized through electrospinning cobalt-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks into selected polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers is reported. The distinct porous fibrous morphology and hierarchical structures play a vital role in boosting electrode performance by exposing more accessible active sites, providing facile electron conductivity, and facilitating the mass transport of reactant. The enhanced intrinsic activity is attributed to the extra graphitic N dopants surrounding the CoN4 moieties. The highly graphitized carbon matrix in the catalyst is beneficial for enhancing the carbon corrosion resistance, thereby promoting catalyst stability. The unique nanoscale X-ray computed tomography verifies the well-distributed ionomer coverage throughout the fibrous carbon network in the catalyst. The membrane electrode assembly achieves a power density of 0.40 W cm-2 in a practical H2/air cell (1.0 bar) and demonstrates significantly enhanced durability under accelerated stability tests.

We systematically investigate how solid electrolyte microstructure and interfacial decomposition (e.g., interphase) affect failure mechanisms in lithium thiophosphates (Li3PS4, LPS) electrolytes. Kinetically metastable interphases are engineered with iodine doping, and microstructural control is achieved using milling and annealing processing techniques. In situ transmission electron microscopy reveals iodine diffusion to the interphase, and upon electrochemical cycling, pores are formed in the interphase region. In situ synchrotron tomography reveals that interphase pore formation drives edge fracture events, which are the origin of through-plane fracture failure. Fractures in thiophosphate electrolytes actively grow toward regions of higher porosity and are affected by heterogeneity in microstructure (e.g., porosity factor).

These materials offer the benefit of large compositional flexibility and can be used in a wide variety of applications, including thermoelectrics, catalysts, superionic conductors and battery electrodes. We show here that the HE concept can lead to very substantial improvements in performance in battery cathodes. Among lithium-ion cathodes, cation-disordered rocksalt (DRX)-type materials are an ideal platform within which to design HE materials because of their demonstrated chemical flexibility. By comparing a group of DRX cathodes containing two, four or six transition metal (TM) species, we show that short-range order systematically decreases, whereas energy density and rate capability systematically increase, as more TM cation species are mixed together, despite the total metal content remaining fixed. A DRX cathode with six TM species achieves 307 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> (955 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>) at a low rate (20 mA g<sup>-1</sup>), and retains more than 170 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> when cycling at a high rate of 2,000 mA g<sup>-1</sup>.

Partial utilization of the anode lessens the volume changes experienced by silicon particles during cycling, which can mitigate mechanisms of performance degradation. In full-cells, anode utilization can be modulated by adjusting the relative capacities of the negative and positive electrodes - the N/P ratio. Here, we examine how the N/P ratio affects the long-term stability of Si-based full-cells, and investigate how this parameter would impact the cost and energy of realistic Li-ion cells. Here, we show that, for some configurations, cell failure due to rapid anode degradation can only by avoided at higher N/P ratios. The price of this enhanced stability is accelerated impedance rise at the cathode. Surprisingly, when electrode expansion is taken into account, increasing N/P ratio can actually increase the specific energy and energy density of silicon-rich Li-ion cells.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the reaction mechanism of these materials, especially the reason for the disappearance of multiple voltage plateaus, is still not clear. Herein, two representative TLOs (Na<sub>2/3</sub>Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Ti<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>Ti<sub>2/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) with the same P2 crystal structure have been studied to scrutinize those unexplained issues. In situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction revealed a solid solution reaction mechanism for both, suggesting the absence of rigid phase transitions upon electrochemical cycling. An interesting “spring effect” of the TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedron, i.e., the reversible vibration of the central Ti atom inside the local octahedron upon electrochemical redox, was demonstrated by advanced X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Such an effect could suppress the rigid phase transitions, and result in smooth charge/discharge profiles and enhanced cycle stability. Finally, this work not only accounts for the disappearance of multiple voltage plateaus of TLOs for NIBs, but also provides an effective local-structure viewpoint to increase the cycle stability of electrode materials for other advanced battery systems.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

The performance degradation was reflected as capacity fading and voltage drop, having their roots in instable interface of NMC622. Aimed at improving interfacial stability, in this study, we deposited nanoscale ZrO2 coatings conformally over NMC622 cathodes using atomic layer deposition (ALD). We found that, under a high cutoff voltage (4.5 V), the ALD ZrO2 coatings evidently improved the performance of NMC622 cathode, showing better cyclability and higher sustainable capacity. In addition, the ALD coatings dramatically boosted the rate capability of NMC622. All these compelling performance results are ascribed to the atomic-scale tunable ZrO2 coatings via ALD, which create stable interface and thereby inhibit unfavorable evolutions. In the study, we utilize a suite of characterization tools and various analyses to clarify the effects of ALD ZrO2 coatings. This study will be helpful for improving the performance of nickel-rich cathodes via interfacial engineering using ALD.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the development of a suitable cathode operating with high areal capacity and uncovering the relevant reaction mechanisms remain challenging. Herein, the application of Mg<sub>0.26</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>∙0.73H<sub>2</sub>O (MVO) nanobelts as a ZIB cathode is demonstrated. In situ FT-IR reveals the shift of OH stretching from 3350 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 3200 cm<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the hydration shell of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, while in situ Raman suggests the interlayer charges creening effect, which would boost the intercalation of hydrated Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Density function theory reveals that the hydrated Zn<sup>2+</sup> can lower the Coulombic repulsion at the electrode-electrolyte interface and circumvents the desolvation penalty of hydrated Zn<sup>2+</sup> during the (de)intercalation process. Additionally, excellent structure stability and large interlayer spacing guarantee the highly reversible (de)intercalation of hydrated Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, the MVO nanobelts exhibit a high areal capacity of 2.12 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.05 A g<sup>-1</sup>, outstanding cycling stability of 2500 cycles at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup> with a mass loading of 5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>.

In this work, we examine the status of Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based solid state batteries for electric vehicle applications using a continuum scale mathematical model. We examine LiFePO4(LFP) cathode/lithium metal anode batteries containing three different electrolytes, namely (1) a liquid electrolyte, (2) the polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) block copolymer electrolyte, and (3) a single-ion conducting (SIC) block copolymer electrolyte, with the liquid electrolyte serving as the baseline for the comparison. By using an optimization procedure, we assemble ""virtual"" batteries to identify the optimal design that maximizes energy density while allowing the power requirements of electric vehicles (EVs) to be satisfied. Results show the present status of different SPEs are still below what is considered acceptable and further improvements are needed to achieve electric vehicle targets. The optimization studies conducted here show that for low transference number electrolytes (similar to 0.2) the conductivity target is 5 x 10(-3)S cm(-1), while for a unity transference number electrolyte this target decreases to 4 x 10(-4)S cm(-1).

Structural modelling of the NPD data shows a stable level of Li/Ni anti-site defects and does not indicate any significant changes in lattice parameters or hydrogen-lithium (D<sup>+</sup>/Li<sup>+</sup>) exchange in the structure. Consequently, the secondary phase formation must take place via transformation rather than modification of the parent material.

However, the growth of lithium protrusions during charging presents significant challenges. Since these protrusions are often branched and filamentous in conventional liquid electrolytes, this problem is referred to in the literature as the “dendrite problem”. While solid electrolytes have the potential to solve this problem, protrusions grow in all electrolytes when the current density exceeds a critical value. Fundamentally understanding the formation is necessary to develop a rational approach for increasing the critical current density, but it is challenging due to the complex interplay between electrochemical and material properties. The diameters and heights of protrusions on lithium-metal anodes stabilized by a rigid block copolymer electrolyte were measured in situ by synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. The diameter of the shorting protrusions increased linearly with increasing electrolyte thickness. Further, a universal linear relationship between protrusion height and diameter of both shorting and non-shorting protrusions was observed. A model based on the concentrated solution theory was used to establish the electrochemical and mechanical sources for our observations. Here, the computational analysis indicates that elastic and plastic deformation of both the lithium metal and the polymer are important to describe protrusion growth. Both stress-induced current density effects due to the deformation of the electrolyte near the protrusion and plastic deformation of lithium metal combine to give the counterintuitive result: the fastest-growing protrusions have the largest diameter.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The X-ray data indicate uneven areal compression of the electrode assembly in such cells, which we trace to a specific design feature that leads to elastic deformation of a metal spacer. Steep lithiation gradients observed in the electrodes imply radially-dependent resistivity, for which uneven compression of the separator is a likely cause.

Small amounts of d(0) dopants (e.g., Mo(6+)and Ti4+, 0.5-1 at. %) increase the cathode's specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability. For example, a Mo-doped cathode with the nominal composition LiNi0.495Mn0.495Mo0.01O2 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 180 mA h/g at 20 mA/g compared to only 156 mA h/g for undoped NM-50/50. Effects of 1 at.% Mo dopant on the cathode structure were studied using a suite of characterization tools including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Xray absorption spectroscopy. These measurements demonstrate that Mo6+ dopant is enriched near the particle surface and improves the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 by: (i) reducing Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing which facilitates Li+ transport, (ii) mitigating undesirable phase transformations near the cathode surface, and (iii) altering the cathode/electrolyte interfacial chemistry. This work also reports the use of an inorganic Mn2P2O7 coating which enhances the cycling stability of Mo-doped NM-50/50, presumably through formation of a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer. Overall, the synthesis approaches reported herein are quite general and can potentially be expanded to other high voltage Li-ion battery cathodes.","Elsevier","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

Raising cell temperature is one approach to enable fast charge; the higher temperature facilitates charge migration and lowers electrode polarization limited by the rates of diffusion and interfacial transport. In this study we examine the behavior of cells subjected to constant current and pulse current charging, at rates from 1C to 8C in the 30 degrees C to 55 degrees C range. To demonstratesafecharge conditions that averts Li metal plating on the anode, we use a microprobe reference electrode to continuously monitor the electrode potentials during tests. We then adopt a state-of-the-art multiphase electrochemical model to extrapolate the anodereferencepotential to the anodesurfacepotential, which determines the overpotential for Li plating. For constant current charging, the results suggest that safe charging at 6C to 80% full capacity would be untenable for all but the thinnest electrodes. For pulse charging, thesafeconditions depend on cell voltage, temperature, and the rate/duration of the pulse. The ""safe lines"" established in this study can help define charging protocols that enable higher charge rates, while minimizing losses in cell performance over time.","IOP Publishing","","National Renewable Energy Lab.

However, the sub-optimal intercalation potentials of current anodes result in a trade-off between energy density, power and safety. In this paper we report that disordered rock salt Li<sub>3+<i>x</i></sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> can be used as a fast-charging anode that can reversibly cycle two lithium ions at an average voltage of about 0.6 volts versus a Li/Li<sup>+</sup> reference electrode. The increased potential compared to graphite reduces the likelihood of lithium metal plating if proper charging controls are used, alleviating a major safety concern (short-circuiting related to Li dendrite growth). In addition, a lithium-ion battery with a disordered rock salt Li<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> anode yields a cell voltage much higher than does a battery using a commercial fast-charging lithium titanate anode or other intercalation anode candidates (Li<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> and LiV<sub>0.5</sub>Ti<sub>0.5</sub>S<sub>2</sub>). Further, disordered rock salt Li<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> can perform over 1,000 charge–discharge cycles with negligible capacity decay and exhibits exceptional rate capability, delivering over 40 per cent of its capacity in 20 seconds. We attribute the low voltage and high rate capability of disordered rock salt Li<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to a redistributive lithium intercalation mechanism with low energy barriers revealed via ab initio calculations.

Current separators, either in commercial usage or under investigation, have yet to meet the high stability and lifespan performance standards necessary to prevent deterioration in the efficiency and reliability of the battery technologies. Recently, considerable effort has been devoted to developing functionalized separators, ranging from designing a variety of new materials and modification methods, and increasingly, to optimizing advanced preparation processes. In order to understand how the mechanisms of separator performance are affected by different properties, we will first summarize recent research progress and then have in-depth discussions regarding the separator's significant contribution to enhancing the safety and performance of the cell. Additionally, we then provide our design strategy for future separators, which not only meets the requirements of different type of batteries, but also aims for multifunctionality.

"Methanol tolerance of atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts: mechanistic understanding and high-performance direct methanol fuel cells","Shi, Qiurong; He, Yanghua; Bai, Xiaowan; Wang, Maoyu; Cullen, David A.; Lucero, Macros; Zhao, Xunhua; More, Karren L.; Zhou, Hua; Feng, Zhenxing; Liu, Yuanyue; Wu, Gang","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are promising power sources from portable electronic devices to vehicles. The high-cost issue of these low-temperature fuel cells can be primarily addressed by using platinum-group metal (PGM)-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, in particular atomically dispersed metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C, M = Fe, Co, Mn). Furthermore, a significant advantage of M–N–C catalysts is their superior methanol tolerance over Pt, which can mitigate the methanol cross-over effect and offer great potential of using a higher concentration of methanol in DMFCs. In this work, we investigated the ORR catalytic properties of M–N–C catalysts in methanol-containing acidic electrolytes via experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. FeN<sub>4</sub> sites demonstrated the highest methanol tolerance ability when compared to metal-free pyridinic N, CoN<sub>4</sub>, and MnN<sub>4</sub> active sites. The methanol adsorption on MN<sub>4</sub> sites is even strengthened when electrode potentials are applied during the ORR. The negative influence of methanol adsorption becomes significant for methanol concentrations higher than 2.0 M. However, the methanol adsorption does not affect the 4e<sup>-</sup> ORR pathway or chemically destroy the FeN<sub>4</sub> sites. The understanding of the methanol-induced ORR activity loss guides the design of promising M–N–C cathode catalyst in DMFCs. Accordingly, we developed a dual-metal site Fe/Co–N–C catalyst through a combined chemical-doping and adsorption strategy. Instead of generating a possible synergistic effect, the introduced Co atoms in the first doping step act as “scissors” for Zn removal in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which is crucial for modifying the porosity of the catalyst and providing more defects for stabilizing the active FeN<sub>4</sub> sites generated in the second adsorption step. The Fe/Co–N–C catalyst significantly improved the ORR catalytic activity and delivered remarkably enhanced peak power densities (i.e., 502 and 135 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) under H<sub>2</sub>–air and methanol–air conditions, respectively, representing the best performance for both types of fuel cells. Notably, the fundamental understanding of methanol tolerance, along with the encouraging DMFC performance, will open an avenue for the potential application of atomically dispersed M–N–C catalysts in other direct alcohol or ammonia fuel cells.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

However, further progress in ORR activity requires evaluation of precursors and synthesis approaches. In response to this challenge, we generated a first of its kind experimental data set of 36 samples using high-throughput synthesis and activity measurements. Several control parameters (e.g., Fe precursor identity, the precursor content, and pyrolysis temperature) were varied. We then developed several state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based regression models to predict ORR activity, dependent on selected synthesis variables. Through an iterative algorithm, higher prediction accuracy (smaller root-mean-square error) was achieved. We identified that gradient boosting regression (GBR) and support vector regression (SVR), among several methods, work best for this data set. Aided by our ML-based surrogate models, we decided to alter catalyst synthesis conditions, which resulted in a 36% increase in measured ORR activity in comparison to the maximum ORR mass activity value of 21.9 A/g<sub>catalyst</sub> in the original data set. Overall, this combined experiment and machine learning approach represents a promising path forward toward developing highly efficient next-generation ORR electrocatalysts and, more generally, functional materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Rate-Dependent Aging Resulting from Fast Charging of Li-Ion Cells","Raj, Abhi; Rodrigues, Marco-Tulio F.; Abraham, Daniel P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; capacity fade; fast charging; impedance rise; lithium plating; particle cracking","The mass electrification of personal and service vehicles is reliant on the ability of battery packs to undergo extreme fast recharging. A central challenge is that the repeated exposure to high currents can trigger and/or accelerate mechanisms of performance degradation, such as lithium deposition, mechanical damage of active material particles, and impedance rise. Here, we investigate whether constraining high-rate charging to limited state-of-charge (SOC) ranges can mitigate these aging processes. Our experiments map the boundaries of lithium plating conditions, and also indicate that permanent losses of electrode capacity appear to be a function of cycle number, but not charging rate. Interestingly, we show that impedance rise appears to depend on charging rate alone, and not on the amount of charge passed at each cycle. This observation suggests that limiting fast charging to a narrow SOC range would only delay cell aging, but not fully prevent it from happening. We identify oxide-particle cracking as the likely mechanism for this impedance rise, suggesting that particle and electrode design are essential to enable fast charging. The findings of this work can inform the development of fast-charging protocols that are less damaging to cell health.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

The high abundancy and easy accessibility of aluminum raw materials further make AAIBs appealing for grid-scale energy storage. However, the passivating oxide film formation and hydrogen side reactions at the aluminum anode as well as limited availability of the cathode lead to low discharge voltage and poor cycling stability. Here, we proposed a new AAIB system consisting of an Al<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode, a zinc substrate-supported Zn-Al alloy anode, and an Al(OTF)<sub>3</sub> aqueous electrolyte.

The anode was realized by a simple deposition process of Al<sup>3+</sup> onto Zn foil substrate. The featured alloy interface layer can effectively alleviate the passivation and suppress the dendrite growth, ensuring ultralong-term stable aluminum stripping/plating.

Self-reporting enables the rapid health assessment of redox flow batteries (RFBs) and provides insight into degradation mechanisms of electrochemically active molecules (redoxmers). In this study, we introduce fluorescence as an orthogonal property to probe this chemistry in situ. An established anolyte redoxmer, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, is rendered an efficient blue-green fluorophore through minimalistic derivatization. One of the derivatives is electrochemically reversible with a long lifetime and cycling stability in the charged state. Spectroscopic measurements on this new redoxmer reveal strong effects of the electrolyte cation on the fluorescence that are useful for probing the solvent microenvironment. Using this probe, we demonstrate proof-of-concept in situ crossover sensing and characterize the effects of electrolyte composition on this crossover. In this way, real-time tracing of redoxmers in a flow cell is demonstrated, paving the way to include still more self-reporting functions into the redoxmers.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, there is lack of quantitative understanding of the interrelationship between crystallographic defects and redox reactions. Herein, crystallographic defects, such as geometrically necessary dislocations, are reported to influence the redox reactions in battery particles through single-particle, multimodal, in situ synchrotron measurements. Through Laue X-ray microdiffraction, many crystallographic defects are spatially identified and statistically quantified from a large quantity of diffraction patterns in many layered oxide particles, including geometrically necessary dislocations, tilt boundaries, and mixed defects. The in situ and ex situ measurements, combining microdiffraction and X-ray spectroscopic imaging, reveal that LiCoO2 particles with a higher concentration of geometrically necessary dislocations provide deeper charging reactions, indicating that dislocations may facilitate redox reactions in layered oxides. Furthermore, the defect-charge correlation analysis implies that the geometrically necessary dislocations can potentially impact the charge distribution of the nanodomains distant from the dislocation. The present study illustrates that a precise control of crystallographic defects and their distribution can potentially promote and homogenize redox reactions in battery materials.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Herewith, we communicate a facile method to produce anhydrous redox-active Bio-inspired electrolytes for flexible supercapacitors with application over a broad temperature range. The glycerol (Gly) gel electrolyte consists of various fractions of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and redox active unit, i.e., ammonium molybdate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> (abbreviated as Mo), in the anhydrous state. The doped glycerol matrix acts as a framework that provides a stable gel electrolyte, forming hierarchical pathway for ion diffusion. The developed gel network with Gly-KOH-MoX (X = 3, 5, 10, and 15%, w/w) provides an effective route to carry the ions onto the pores of the electrodes. The supercapacitor with Gly-KOH5-Mo10 gel provides a specific capacitance of 328 F g<sup>–1</sup>, and the same device achieved an energy density of 45.6 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> at a power density of 497 W kg<sup>–1</sup>. In addition, the supercapacitor maintained extraordinary cyclic robustness and wide temperature tolerance.

Currently, it is a challenge to create a profitable recycling process, which is made more difficult by the reduction in cathode cobalt content. Maintenance of the cathode structure throughout the recycling process can yield increased revenues that may make recycling profitable. This method will require careful removal of the PVDF binder and carbon black, which can be achieved through thermal processing. Furthermore, it is necessary to mitigate the effects of the fluorine from the PVDF on the cathode material.

Understanding these details in calcium electrolytes is of immediate importance due to recent, unprecedented demonstrations of reversible calcium metal electrodeposition in a limited number of ethereal solvent-based systems. In this work, we provide insight connecting Ca2+ coordination tendencies to important calcium battery electrolyte properties. Our results demonstrate a clear solvent:Ca2+ coordination strength trend across a series of cyclic ether and linear glyme solvents that controls the extent of ion association in solutions of ""weakly"" coordinating salts. We apply understanding gained from these results to rationalize relative anion:Ca2+ coordination tendencies and attendant Ca2+ coordination structures using two oxidatively stable anions of particular interest for current battery electrolytes. Armed with this understanding of solvent and anion interactions with Ca2+, we demonstrate and interpret differences in electrochemical calcium deposition behavior across several electrolyte exemplars with varying solvent and anion coordination strengths. Our findings demonstrate that solvents exhibiting especially strong coordination to Ca2+, such as triglyme, can inhibit reversible calcium deposition despite effective elimination of anion:Ca2+ coordination while solvents exhibiting more modest coordination strength, such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, may enable deposition provided anion:Ca2+ coordination is substantially limited. These results reveal that the strength of coordination of both anion and solvent should be considered in the design of electrolytes for calcium batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

The experiment results reveal the size evolution of Si nanodomains in SiO during the electrochemical cycling and find it highly dependent on the initial Si domain size in SiO. If the initial Si domain size is too large, the average size of Si nanodomains would increase at first and then decrease after a certain number of cycles, which indicates the pulverization of Si domains after the electrochemical-driven growth of Si nanodomains reaches a critical point. Furthermore, these results suggest that an optimal initial Si nanodomain size of 4-6 nm for SiO anode materials is essential to retard the growth and subsequent pulverization process of Si nanodomains and thus to improve the cyclability of SiO during long-term cycling.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, we provide the first evidence for common descriptors for improved reversibility of metal plating/stripping in nonaqueous electrolytes for multivalent ion batteries. Focusing first on the specific role of chloride (Cl<sup>–</sup>) in promoting electrochemical reversibility in multivalent systems, rotating disk (RDE) and ring-disk electrode (RRDE) investigations were performed utilizing a variety of divalent cations (Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>2+</sup>) and the bis-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (TFSI<sup>–</sup>) anion. By introducing varying concentrations of Cl<sup>–</sup>, a cooperative effect is observed between TFSI<sup>–</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> that yields the more reversible behavior of mixed electrolytes relative to electrolytes containing only TFSI<sup>–</sup>. This effect is shown to be general for Mg, Zn, and Cu electrodeposition, and mechanistic understanding of the role of Cl<sup>–</sup> in improving reversibility of TFSI-based electrolytes is obtained through the combination of R(R)DE experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) evaluation of the redox activity and thermodynamic stability of various TFSI- and Cl-based solution complexes of metal ions. The cooperative anion effect is further generalized to other mixed-anion systems, where systematic variations in anion association strength predicted from DFT (i.e., Cl<sup>–</sup> &gt; OTf<sup>–</sup> ≈ TFSI<sup>–</sup> &gt; BF<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup> &gt; PF<sub>6</sub><sup>–</sup>) yield corresponding trends in redox potentials and improvements of ≥200 mV in the reversibility of metal deposition/dissolution.

Through a recent combination of interface-based science, nanotechnology-based solutions and characterization methods, the LMA is now primed for a technological boom. In this review, the recent emerging strategies and perspectives on LMAs are summarized, following which the current huge evolution in interfacial chemistry regulation, optimizing electrolyte components, designing a rational ‘host’ for lithium metal, optimizing “solid-state electrolytes” and other emerging strategies for developing high-safety LMAs is highlighted. Furthermore, several state-of-the-art in situ/operando synchrotron-based X-ray techniques for high safety LMB research are introduced.

"What do Coulombic Efficiency and Capacity Retention Truly Measure? A Deep Dive into Cyclable Lithium Inventory, Limitation Type, and Redox Side Reactions","Tornheim, Adam; O’Hanlon, Daniel C.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Here, the battery performance metrics of Coulombic efficiency (CE) and capacity retention (CR) are derived in terms of cycling current and side-reaction currents at each electrode. A cyclable lithium inventory (CLI) framework is developed to explain the fundamental differences between inventory-limited and site-limited cells. The otherwise unmeasurable oxidation and reduction side-reaction currents are expressed in terms of cycling current, CE, and CR for both limitation types. Important conclusions regarding cyclable lithium inventory, limitation type, and the interpretation of CE and CR are discussed. From the framework, CE depends on either the oxidation side-reaction current or the reduction side-reaction current, but not both. CE and CR depend on cell limitation type and are increased by faster cycling. Experiments are presented to support the framework and demonstrate that cells can transition between limitation types. These conclusions are presented in terms of lithium-ion batteries, but this framework may be extended to describe other battery systems.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

"Bismuth Enables the Formation of Disordered Birnessite in Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries","Bruck, Andrea M.; Kim, Matthew A.; Ma, Lu; Ehrlich, Steven N.; Okasinski, John S.; Gallaway, Joshua W.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Recent advances in rechargeable Zn/MnO$_2$ alkaline batteries have shown promise for scalable energy storage systems which provide a safe, low-cost alternative with a demonstrated lifetime over thousands of cycles. This cathode technology is based on a 2-electron Mn redox process where a layered birnessite-type phase has been shown to form after the first cycle with excellent reversibility between the discharge product, Mn(OH)$_2$. Herein, we investigate the reversible reaction between birnessite and Mn(OH)$_2$ with and without a Bi$_2$O$_3$ additive using multimodal structural characterization techniques during active battery cycling. Diffraction results provide evidence of Bi$^{3+}$ residing in the interlayer of birnessite which prevents irreversible Mn$_3$O$_4$ formation by limiting Mn$^{3+}$ diffusion within the crystal lattice. Also, upon charge no MnOOH intermediate phases are observed. Instead, X-ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy indicate a disordered, non-crystalline birnessite-type phase consisting of mostly neutral H$_2$O within the interlayer. Birnessite phases will reform without Bi$_2$O$_3$ present, but Mn$_3$O$_4$ formation severely polarizes the potential they are formed at, leading to capacity fade. Also, we discuss the reversible Bi$_2$O$_3$ conversion to Bi$^0$ and its contribution to the observed capacity. We expect the results will provide crucial insight into the development of aqueous, rechargeable battery systems utilizing MnO<sub>2</sub>.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

To formulate a functional electrolyte system that can stabilize the lithium-metal anode, the solvation behavior of the solvent molecules must be understood because the electrochemical properties of a solvent can be heavily influenced by its solvation status. Here, we unambiguously demonstrated the solvation rule for the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) enabler in an electrolyte system. In this study, fluoroethylene carbonate was used as the SEI enabler due to its ability to form a robust SEI on the lithium metal surface, allowing relatively stable LMB cycling. The results revealed that the solvation number of fluoroethylene carbonate must be ≥ 1 to ensure the formation of a stable SEI in which the sacrificial reduction of the SEI enabler subsequently leads to the stable cycling of LMBs.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

"Oxygen-Based Anion Redox for Lithium Batteries","Li, Matthew; Bi, Xuanxuan; Amine, Khalil; Lu, Jun","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The importance of current Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in modern society cannot be overstated. While the energy demands of devices increase, the corresponding enhancements in energy density of battery technologies are highly sought after. Currently, many different battery concepts, such as Li-S and metal-air among many others, have been investigated. However, their practical implementation has mostly been restricted to the prototyping stage. In fact, most of these technologies require rework of existing Li-ion battery manufacturing facilities and will naturally incur resistance to change from industry. For this reason, one specifically attractive technology, anionic redox in transition metal oxides, has gained much attention in the recent years. Its ability to be directly used in already established processes and higher energy density with similar electrolyte formulation make it a key materials research direction for next generation Li-ion batteries. In regular LIBs, the redox active centers are the transition metal cation. In anion redox, both the anion (typically O) and the transition metal cation are utilized as redox centers with enormous implications for increasing energy density. This new material can be highly competitive for replacing the current LIB technologies. However, much is still unknown about its cyding mechanism. Upon activating the O redox couples, most cationic and anionic redox active materials will either evolve O<sub>2</sub> or undergo irreversible structural degradation with associated severe decreases in electrochemical performance. By understanding the transition from full anion redox to partial cationic and anionic redo; we hope readers can gain a deeper understanding of the topic. This Account will focus mainly on the work that was conducted by our group at Argonne National Laboratory. Herein, the phenomenon of cationic and anionic redox in a lithium-ion battery cathode will first be discussed. Our work in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to investigate the spectroscopic features of O after delithiation has found potential ""fingerprint"" signals that could likely be used to identify and confirm reversible O redox if corroborated with other techniques. To follow, we will examine our work on Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries. While our group and the research community have had many significant contributions and improvements to the field of Li-O<sub>2</sub> (such as decreasing overpotential and achieving cyclability in air environment), its practical application is still far from realization. Perhaps our most important contribution to this area is the discovery that Ir deposited on reduced graphene oxide can be used to halt the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> at the LiO<sub>2</sub> oxidation state. This not only significantly decreases the charge overpotential but also presents the important concept of oxidation-state controlled discharge. Subsequently, we will focus on our oxidation state-controlled redox-based charging of oxygen in a pure oxygen redox Li-ion battery. Future implications of this technology will be emphasized.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Li<sub>3</sub>MCl<sub>6</sub> showed the lower migration energy barrier in monoclinic structures, while orthorhombic and trigonal structures exhibited higher energy barriers due to the sluggish diffusion along the two-dimensional path based on the BVSE model. AIMD results confirmed the slower ion migration along the 2D path, exhibiting lower ionic diffusivity and higher activation energy in orthorhombic and trigonal structures.

To maintain high capacities over cycles, new designs rely on engineering-specific hierarchical geometries and/or optimized composite compositions such that at least one of the multiple elements serves as buffer and/or electron conductive pathways in the electrodes. In this paper, we report an innovative design in which alternating layers of periodic atomic structures involving multiple elements form a new anode material for lithium-ion batteries. In this work, a superlattice-structured amorphous film made using Si, Mo, and Cu is fabricated by a simple and scalable magnetron sputtering process for the first time. This continuous and repetitive superlattice formation along the film thickness provides a homogeneous stress-strain distribution. The Mo-Cu layer in the superlattice acts as an inactive-conductive layer and as a backbone to handle the volume expansion of active Si upon cycling. This nano-functional superlattice approach enables harnessing the high energy density of Si while maintaining its structural stability. As a result, the electrode exhibits high specific capacity and capacity retention even at high cycling rates. The possible use of the film in a full cell is also evaluated by cycling it vs. the LiMn<sub>1.5</sub>Ni<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cathode. The full cell maintains a stable capacity of about 900 mAh g<sub>anode</sub><sup>-1</sup> over 150 cycles, at ~600 mA g<sup>-1</sup> rate.

Here we unveil the impact of SEI inhomogeneities on early-stage defect formation in Si electrodes. Buried under the SEI, these early-stage defects are inaccessible by most surface-probing techniques. With operando full field diffraction X-ray microscopy, we observe the formation of these defects in real time and connect their origin to a heterogeneous degree of lithiation. This heterogeneous lithiation is further correlated to inhomogeneities in topography and lithium-ion mobility in both the inner- and outer-SEI, thanks to a combination of operando atomic force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy and sputter-etched X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our multi-modal study bridges observations across the multi-level interfaces (Si/LixSi/inner-SEI/outer-SEI), thus offering novel insights into the impact of SEI homogeneities on the structural stability of Si-based lithium-ion batteries. Severe structural deformation during (de)lithiation is the main factor limiting the stability of Si anodes in Li-ion batteries. Here, a multi-modal approach is used to visualize these deformations in their early-stage and link them to inhomogeneities in the dual-layer solid-electrolyte interphase.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

While the intrinsic structural stability of the cathode materials under thermal conditions is important, it is also critical to consider their reaction with electrolytes. In this paper, operando gas analysis, ex situ neutron diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry were combined to give a broader picture of the thermal stability of Ni-rich NMC cathodes. Li1-xNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) composite materials with four different states of charge were investigated with and without the presence of an electrolyte. It has been found that electrolyte can greatly accelerate both the structural and thermal decomposition of the cathode materials. A higher state of charge will also make cathode materials more susceptible to thermal shock. Without an electrolyte, O-2 release inducing a structural change from layered to rock salt was the major observation during thermal runaway. However, all samples retained some levels of layered structure after annealing up to 300 degrees C without the electrolyte. In comparison, almost all the O3-type layered phase transformed to the rock-salt phase for the cathode materials heated with the electrolyte at the same experimental conditions. Moreover, the amount of CO2 increased by nearly two orders of magnitude when annealing cathode materials with electrolyte in operando gas analysis experiments. More delithiated NMC811 samples released larger amounts of CO2 at earlier onset temperatures, resonating well with the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showing that more delithiated samples release more heat during thermal shock.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

The Bi<sub>0.75</sub>Sb<sub>0.25</sub> arrays exhibit an appreciable electrochemical robustness for sodium storage, sustaining a reversible capability 335 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at a high rate of 2.5 A g<sup>–1</sup> and 87% of the initial capacity over 2000 cycles.

This full cell achieves a high specific energy of 203 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> (based on both active electrodes).

It is generally reported that the energy inefficiency, observed during electrochemical cycling of Li-rich electrodes, is a direct result of anion redox processes. Similarly, the coupled phenomenon of cation migration has been cited as being a mere consequence of that process with no essential ramification to hysteresis. Such works, however, have only shown correlations and not causation. Specifically, studies that clearly preclude the complete absence of either anion redox or cation migration (down to defect-level concentrations) are not reported yet. Herein, we present first principles calculations and experimental data on a bespoke Li-rich system that is indubitably immune to oxygen activity but yet exhibits significant energy inefficiency. Additionally, the results directly implicate transition metal migration as the fundamental, sole process responsible for hysteresis in this material. This study is of particular importance to the design and development of new Li-rich materials aimed at eliminating the role of oxygen and enhancing the effective cationic redox contribution to the capacity and points out the essential need to develop materials devoid of transition metal migration to interstitial sites in both layered and disordered oxides alike.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Herein, nanocrystals of a few-layer phyllomanganate, reminiscent of the mineral vernadite, were shown to have considerable electrochemical activity toward Mg intercalation at room temperature, where it delivered ~190 mAh g-1 at ~1.9 V (vs Mg/Mg2+) in batteries paired with a Mg metal anode. Multimodal characterization confirmed the notable degree of reversible intercalation by probing the structural, compositional, and redox changes undertaken by the oxide. Distinct levels of Mg activity were also observed while varying the content of small amounts of lattice water and the temperature of the reaction. The results reaffirm the prospects for operational Mg batteries using oxide cathodes in moderate conditions, overcoming current limits of performance of this prospective technology.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the shuttle of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish kinetics of transformation of LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S still hinder the achievement of long-life cycling and high-rate of Li-S batteries.

Single atoms (SAs) with high surface free energy are found to serve as both anchoring and electrocatalytic centers for LiPSs. Furthermore, atomically dispersed metal catalyst on carbon provide conductive and flexible host for dielectric sulfur. Moreover, SAs as the uniform lithiophilic sites can reduce the nucleation overpotential and ensure uniformly plating of Li. In this review, the latest strategies for preparation of SAs supported on carbons are provided on the application of Li-S batteries, including cathode, modified separator and Li metal anode. In addition, it also discusses how SAs with high catalytic activity can help build better Li-S batteries and the design principles for SAs.

However, after being cycled at high voltages, these single crystal materials exhibited severe structural instability and capacity fade. Understanding on how the surface structural changes determine the performance degradation over cycling is crucial but remains elusive. Here, we investigated the correlation of the surface structure, internal strain and capacity deterioration by using operando X-ray spectroscopy imaging and nano-tomography. We directly observed a close correlation between surface chemistry and phase distribution from homogeneity to heterogeneity, which induces heterogeneous internal strain within the particle and the resulting structural/performance degradation during cycling. We also discover that surface chemistry can significantly enhance the cyclic performances. Our modified process effectively regulates the performance fade issue of single-crystal cathode and provides new insights for improved design of high-capacity battery materials.","Nature Publishing Group","","Brookhaven National Lab.

A contemporary example is the lithium (Li)-ion battery, which enabled the launch of the personal electronics revolution in 1991 and the first commercial electric vehicles in 2010. Most recently, Li-ion batteries have expanded into the electricity grid to firm variable renewable generation, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of transmission and distribution. Important applications continue to emerge including decarbonization of heavy-duty vehicles, rail, maritime shipping, and aviation and the growth of renewable electricity and storage on the grid. This perspective compares energy storage needs and priorities in 2010 with those now and those emerging over the next few decades. The diversity of demands for energy storage requires a diversity of purpose-built batteries designed to meet disparate applications. Advances in the frontier of battery research to achieve transformative performance spanning energy and power density, capacity, charge/discharge times, cost,lifetime, andsafety arehighlighted, along with strategic research refinements made by the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) and the broader community to accommodate the changing storage needs and priorities. Innovative experimental tools with higher spatial and temporal resolution, in situ and operando characterization, first-principles simulation, high throughput computation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence work collectively to reveal the origins of the electrochemical phenomena that enable new means of energy storage.

Recently, theoretical calculations predict that Pb2+ cations can be substituted by a combination of Cu2+ and Sb2+ cations to form a vacancy-ordered layered double perovskite structure with superior optoelectronic properties. However, accessibilities to this class of perovskite-type materials remain inadequate, hindering their practical implementations in various applications. Here, we report the first colloidal synthesis of Cs(4)CuSb(2)Cl(12 )perovskite-type nanocrystals (NCs). The resulting NCs exhibit a layered double perovskite structure with ordered vacancies and a direct band gap of 1.79 eV. A composition-structure-property relationship has been established by investigating a series of Cs(4)Cu(x)Ag(2-2x)Sb(2)Cl(12 )perovskite-type NCs (0 <= x <= 1). The composition induced crystal structure transformation, and thus, the electronic band gap evolution has been explored by experimental observations and further confirmed by theoretical calculations. Taking advantage of both the unique electronic structure and solution processability, we demonstrate that the Cs4CuSb2Cl12 NCs can be solution-processed as high-speed photodetectors with ultrafast photoresponse and narrow bandwidth. We anticipate that our study will prompt future research to design and fabricate novel and high-performance lead-free perovskite-type NCs for a range of applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

Tortuosity factor and porosity are the two microstructure parameters that control this effective diffusion coefficient. While different methods exist to experimentally measure or calculate the tortuosity factor, no generic relationship between tortuosity and microstructure presently exists that is applicable across a large variety of electrode microstructures and porosities. Indeed, most relationships are microstructure specific. In this work, generic relationships are established using only geometrically defined metrics that can thus be used to design thick electrodes suitable for fast charging. To achieve this objective, an original, discrete particle-size algorithm is introduced and used to identify and segment particles across a set of 19 various electrode microstructures (nickel-manganese-cobalt [NMC] and graphite) obtained from X-ray computed tomography (CT) to quantify parameters such as porosity, particle elongation, sinuosity, and constriction, which influence the effective diffusion coefficient. Compared to the widely used watershed method, the new algorithm shows less over-segmentation. Particle size obtained with different numerical methods is also compared. Lastly, microstructure-tortuosity relationship and particle size and morphology analysis methods are reviewed. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

These challenges hinder the practical applications of Li–S batteries. Here, we proposed a rational strategy of tuning the d-band of catalysts to accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. Nitrogen vacancies were engineered in hexagonal Ni<sub>3</sub>N (space group <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub>22) to tune its d-band center, leading to the strong interaction between polysulfides and Ni<sub>3</sub>N. Because of the greater electron population in the lowest occupied molecular orbital of Li<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, the terminal S–S bonds were weakened for breaking. Temperature-dependent experiments confirm that Ni<sub>3</sub>N<sub>0.85</sub> demonstrates a much low activation energy, thereby accelerating the conversion of polysulfides.

Herein, this work reports a Li<sub>5</sub>B<sub>4</sub>/Li composite featuring a 3D Li<sub>5</sub>B<sub>4</sub> fibrillar framework filled with metallic Li, which maintains its initial structure at 325 °C in Ar atmosphere without leakage of the liquid Li. The capillary force caused by the porous structure of the Li<sub>4</sub>B<sub>5</sub> fibrillar framework, together with its lithiophilic surface, restricts the leakage of liquid metallic Li and enables good thermal tolerance of the Li<sub>5</sub>B<sub>4</sub>/Li composite. Thus, it can be facilely operated for rechargeable high-temperature Li metal batteries. Li<sub>5</sub>B<sub>4</sub>/Li electrodes are coupled with a garnet-type ceramic electrolyte (Li<sub>6.5</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>0.5</sub>Ta<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) to fabricate symmetric cells, which exhibit stable Li stripping/plating behaviors with low overpotential of approximate to 6 mV at 200 °C using a regular sandwich-type cell configuration.

"Engineering lithium-ion battery cathodes for high-voltage applications using electromagnetic excitation","Su, Laisuo; Jha, Shikhar Krishn; Phuah, Xin Li; Xu, Jiang; Nakamura, Nathan; Wang, Haiyan; Okasinski, John S.; Reeja-Jayan, B.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Microwave radiation (MWR), a type of electromagnetic excitation source, reduces the synthesis temperature and processing time for chemical reactions compared to traditional synthesis methods. Recently, we demonstrated that MWR can engineer ceramics with different crystal phases compared to traditional methods [<i>Journal of Materials Chemistry A</i><b>5</b>, 35 (2017)]. Here, we further apply the MWR-assisted technique to improve the electrochemical performance of LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cathodes by engineering TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub> ceramic coatings. Electrochemical tests suggest that the TiO<sub>2</sub> coating improves the rate capability of the LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrode. Both TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub> coatings improve the high-voltage (4.5 V) cycling stability of LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. The capacity remaining is improved from 52.8 to 84.4% and 81.9% by the TiO<sub>2</sub> coating and the ZrO<sub>2</sub> coating, respectively, after 40 cycles. We compare these results with existing studies that apply traditional methods to engineer TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZrO<sub>2</sub> on LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, and find that the MWR-assisted method shows better performance improvement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements suggest that the improved cycling stability arises from the formation of metal fluorides that protect the electrode from side reactions with electrolytes. This mechanism is further supported by the reduced Co dissolution from TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZrO<sub>2</sub>-coated LiCoO<sub>2</sub> electrode after cycling. This study provides a new toolbox facilitating the integration of many delicate, low melting point materials like polymers into battery electrodes.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the irreversible release of Li-ions during the first charging process, instability of LRMO/electrolyte interface and relatively low ion conductivity of LRMO result in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), poor cycle stability and rate performance, which prohibit its further application. Furthermore, interface engineering via additive coating is expected to effectively address these issues. Herein, we rely on potassium Prussian blue (KPB), a Li<sup>+</sup> acceptor with good ion conductivity, as a new coating material on LRMO particles. The KPB coating not only forms a protective layer on the surface of LRMO against electrolyte corrosion, but also functions as a host for Li<sup>+</sup> transport and accommodation, leading to enhanced ion conductivity and ICE of LRMO cathode. Consequently, 2 wt% KPB coated LRMO cathode achieved an initial discharge capacity of up to 281.7 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> with an ICE of 85.69% compared to an ICE of 79.52% for the LRMO cathode without coating. The cycling and rate performance are also greatly improved as evidenced by the well maintained capacity of up to 176.8 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C, compared to the limited capacity of only 135.3 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> for the LRMO cathode without coating. Overall, this work pioneers the use of potassium Prussian blue as additive coating material to enhance performance of LRMO cathode, and we expect it to inspire the battery community with new strategies of material engineering/design toward practical application in high-energy lithium-ion batteries.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) were used to determine changes in the microstructures and phase compositions of the anode materials at high temperatures and under a reducing atmosphere. The stability of the double perovskite structure was found to be highly dependent on the identity of the cation M, such that when M = Fe, the material remained stable over the course of the experiments. However, when M = Co or Ni, significant changes in the microstructure and phase composition were observed. An in situ study of the M = Co sample, in which electrical conductivity and USAXS/SAXS/WAXS measurements were conducted simultaneously, revealed the structural degradation mechanisms and electrical conductivity changes over a range of temperatures. To conduct these measurements, a cell was developed that allowed for a sample mounted on Pt wires to be placed in the X-ray beam and heated under gas flow comprising 4% mass H<sub>2</sub> and 96% mass N<sub>2</sub>. The resulting measurements allowed for the direct comparison of the electrical and morphological changes occurring in the material under operating conditions, such that increases in conductivity could be attributed to the growth of new phases.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Exploiting the Spinel Structure for Li-ion Battery Applications: A Tribute to John B.

The narrative begins at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa in the mid-1970s when, in response to the Middle East oil crisis, worldwide efforts were turned to develop high-temperature sodium and lithium batteries to power electric vehicles. In 1981, results in CSIR's program on a high-temperature lithium battery led to a collaborative project on room-temperature lithium cells with Prof. John B. Goodenough at Oxford University, where studies of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cathodes led to the recognition of the broad utility of the [B2]O4 spinel framework as an anode, cathode, or solid electrolyte for rechargeable lithium cells. This finding has had a profound and lasting impact, influencing further ideas and discoveries at the CSIR, Argonne National Laboratory, and elsewhere. The narrative emphasizes the compositional versatility of the spinel structure and the opportunities to tailor the electrochemical potential and stability of a Li-ion cell.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

We reveal a transition region with chemical gradient, in which the layered structure gradually densifies and eventually transforms into the SRL on the top surface. Contrary to these observations, no SRL is observed on pristine, Li-impermeable (001) surfaces, revealing the facet-dependent nature of surface reconstructions during particle synthesis. Upon electrochemical cycling, significant composition-and facet-dependent SRL growth is observed. The driving force and mechanism for surface reconstruction are further discussed.

However, developing suitable electrode materials that can reversibly accommodate large potassium ions is a great challenge. In this paper, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the strategy of interfacial engineering via surface amorphization of VO<sub>2</sub> (B) nanorods (SA-VO<sub>2</sub>), which results in the formation of a crystalline core/amorphous shell heterostructure, enables superior K<sup>+</sup> storage performance in terms of large capacity, outstanding rate capability, and long cycle stability working as an anode for PIBs. DFT calculations reveal that the created crystalline/amorphous heterointerface in SA-VO<sub>2</sub> can substantially lower the surface energy, narrow the band gap, and reduce the K<sup>+</sup> diffusion barrier of VO<sub>2</sub> (B). These conditions enable enhanced K<sup>+</sup> storage capacity and rapid K<sup>+</sup>/electron transfer, which result in large capacity and outstanding rate capability. Using in situ X-ray diffraction and in situ transmission electron microscopy complemented by ex situ microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, it is unveiled that the superior cycling stability originates from the excellent phase reversibility with negligible strain response and robust mechanical behavior of SA-VO<sub>2</sub> upon (de)potassiation.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

"A Facile Approach to High Precision Detection of Cell-to-Cell Variation for Li-ion Batteries","Xie, Leqiong; Ren, Dongsheng; Wang, Li; Chen, Zonghai; Tian, Guangyu; Amine, Khalil (ORCID:0000000192063719); He, Xiangming (ORCID:0000000171464097)","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Li-ion battery; cell-to cell variation; connecting in series; homogeneity screening; module integration","Over the past decade, major progress in homogeneity screening of cells has shown a substantial contribution to the development of electric vehicles employing lithium-ion batteries. However, most studies based on several parameters of individual cell such as capacity, mass, impedance, direct current resistance, and so forth, which are often mutual independent and lead to different results by different parameters. Furthermore, individual measurement always suffers from data of poor accuracy due to insufficient precision of measurement equipment. Difficulty to determinate coulombic current precisely is one of the main reasons which currently persecutes the cell screening with high uniformity and high quality pack configuration. Here we report a facile and precision measurement to precisely screen out cell-to-cell variations, by which only one parameter of voltage is needed without consideration of coulombic current precision. By connecting the cells in series (CiS), the capacity error caused by current error between the charge/discharge equipment can be well avoided because the currents are the same in series. The outcomes of homogeneity screening prove that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply, sensitively and accurately detected and analyzed in this way. Rate dependence of cell homogeneity differs by the battery makers. This study enriches the understanding of cell screening method. The simple and precise CiS measuring is promising for cell screening for high quality module integration, as well as for supplier evaluation. Also, this method may lead to a new type of test protocol for module and pack of high homogeneity.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Conductivity and polarity are two critical parameters for the search of optimal sulfur host materials. However, their role in immobilizing polysulfides and enhancing redox kinetics for long-life LSBs are not fully understood. In this work we have conducted an evaluation on the role of polarity over conductivity by using a polar but nonconductive platelet ordered mesoporous silica (pOMS) and its replica platelet ordered mesoporous carbon (pOMC), which is conductive but nonpolar. It is found that the polar pOMS/S cathode with a sulfur mass fraction of 80 wt% demonstrates outstanding long-term cycle stability for 2000 cycles even at a high current density of 2C. Furthermore, the pOMS/S cathode with a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> illustrates high areal and volumetric capacities with high capacity retention. Complementary physical and electrochemical probes clearly show that surface polarity and structure are more dominant factors for sulfur utilization efficiency and long-life, while the conductivity can be compensated by the conductive agent involved as a required electrode material during electrode preparation. The present findings shed new light on the design principles of sulfur hosts towards long-life and highly efficient LSBs.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Ex situ component-level and in situ cell-level open circuit voltage (OCV) tests combined with the physics-based model analyses were conducted to investigate the electrochemical reaction behaviors of the Al–air cell. Especially, the effect of aluminum oxide formation on the anode- and cathode-side reactions were analyzed in detail. The oxide film formed at the Al surface strongly was found to significantly impede the electrochemical reaction at the surface, and the film growth was controlled by decreasing the surface tension by aggressive anions. In the cathode side, the aluminum oxide precipitated in the porous cathode electrode was found to decrease the porous reaction area and block reactant access into the reaction sites. The effects of O<sub>2</sub> solubility in the electrolyte, initial porosity and thickness of the porous electrode are compared in detailed, and optimal thickness is suggested.","MDPI AG","","Argonne National Lab.

Such systems allow for the manipulation of spin waves on the nanoscale and their potential use as information carriers. However, there are presently two general obstacles to the realization of artificial spin-ice-based magnonic crystals: the magnetic state of artificial spin ices is difficult to reconfigure and the magnetostatic interactions between the nanoislands are often weak, preventing mode coupling. We demonstrate, using micromagnetic modeling, that coupling a reconfigurable artificial spin-ice geometry made of weakly interacting nanomagnets to a soft magnetic underlayer creates a complex system exhibiting dynamically coupled modes. These give rise to spin-wave channels in the underlayer at well-defined frequencies, based on the artificial spin-ice magnetic state, which can be reconfigured. Finally, these findings open the door to the realization of reconfigurable magnonic crystals with potential applications for data transport and processing in magnonic-based logic architectures.","American Physical Society (APS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In the Rouse regime, the monomeric friction coefficient increases with increasing salt concentration, as seen previously in homopolymer electrolytes. In the reptation regime, the tube diameters, which represent entanglement constraints, decrease with increasing salt concentration. The normalized longest molecular relaxation time, calculated from the NSE results, increases with increasing salt concentration.

Focusing on Li<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.0.5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a model compound, we use operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that the apparent first-cycle capacity loss is a kinetic effect linked to limited Li mobility at x > 0.88, with near full capacity recovered during a potentiostatic hold following the galvanostatic charge- discharge cycle. This kinetic capacity loss, unlike many capacity losses in LTMOs, is independent of the cutoff voltage during delithiation and it is a reversible process. The kinetic limitation manifests not only as the kinetic capacity loss during discharge but as a subtle bimodal compositional distribution early in charge and, also, a dramatic increase of the charge-discharge voltage hysteresis at x > 0.88. <sup>7</sup>Li NMR measurements indicate that the kinetic limitation reflects limited Li transport at x > 0.86. Electrochemical measurements on a wider range of LTMOs including Li<sub>x</sub>(Ni,Fe)<sub>y</sub>Co<sub>1-y</sub>O<sub>2</sub> suggest that 5% substitution is sufficient to induce the kinetic limitation and that the effect is not limited to Ni substitution. In this paper, we outline how, in addition to a reduction in the number of Li vacancies and shrinkage of the Li-layer size, the intrinsic charge storage mechanism (two-phase vs solid-solution) and localization of charge give rise to additional kinetic barriers in NCA and nonmetallic LTMOs in general.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

With continuous improvements in design strategies and assembly technologies, the fabrication of various advanced flexible metal–gas batteries has been attempted. In spite of these efforts, the synchronous integration of high flexibility, safety, comfort, and high performance into flexible metal–gas batteries with specifically functionalized configurations still remains a formidable challenge. To resolve these dilemmas, the redesign of cathode catalysts, gel polymer electrolyte, and battery configurations/components has been investigated. In this paper, we review the recent technical advances together with the major dilemmas facing currently available flexible metal–gas batteries, highlighting how flexible cathodes and gel polymer electrolytes with various structures and components can affect the electrochemical performance and functionality of flexible metal–gas batteries. Flexible Zn–air, Li–O<sub>2</sub>/air, and Li–CO<sub>2</sub> batteries are mainly exemplified to elucidate their promising potential. Finally, based on our considerations, unresolved technical hurdles and future research perspectives involving flexible metal–gas batteries for wearable electronics are proposed.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

The rapid market growth of rechargeable batteries requires electrode materials that combine high power and energy and are made from earth-abundant elements. In this paper we show that combining a partial spinel-like cation order and substantial lithium excess enables both dense and fast energy storage. Cation overstoichiometry and the resulting partial order is used to eliminate the phase transitions typical of ordered spinels and enable a larger practical capacity, while lithium excess is synergistically used with fluorine substitution to create a high lithium mobility. With this strategy, we achieved specific energies greater than 1,100 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> and discharge rates up to 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Remarkably, the cathode materials thus obtained from inexpensive manganese present a rare case wherein an excellent rate capability coexists with a reversible oxygen redox activity.

However, the weak bonding between the electrode particles and the current collector cannot withstand the severe volume change of active materials upon battery cycling, which largely limit the large-scale application of such electrodes. Using tin nanoarrays electrochemically deposited on copper substrate as an example, here we demonstrate a strategy of strengthening the connection between electrode and current collector by thermally alloying tin and copper at their interface. The locally formed tin-copper alloys are electron-conductive and meanwhile electrochemically inactive, working as an ideal ""glue"" robustly bridging tin and copper to survive harsh cycling conditions in sodium ion batteries. The working mechanism of the alloy ""glue"" is further characterized through a combination of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, atomic structural analysis and in situ X-ray diffraction, presenting itself as a promising strategy for engineering binder-free electrode with endurable performance.

By utilizing the doping chemistry, we evaluate the battery performance and structural/chemical reversibility of a new no-cobalt cathode material (Mg/Mn-LiNiO<sub>2</sub>). The unique dual dopants drive Mg and Mn to occupy the Li site and Ni site, respectively. We report the Mg/Mn-LiNiO<sub>2</sub> cathode delivers smooth voltage profiles, enhanced structural stability, elevated self-discharge resistance, and inhibited nickel dissolution. As a result, the Mg/Mn-LiNiO<sub>2</sub> cathode enables improved cycling stability in lithium metal batteries with the conventional carbonate electrolyte: 80% capacity retention after 350 cycles at <i>C</i>/3, and 67% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 2<i>C</i> (22 °C). We then take the Mg/Mn-LiNiO<sub>2</sub> as the platform to investigate the local structural and chemical reversibility, where we identify that the irreversibility takes place starting from the very first cycle.

"A low temperature unitized regenerative fuel cell realizing 60% round trip efficiency and 10 000 cycles of durability for energy storage applications","Regmi, Yagya N.; Peng, Xiong; Fornaciari, Julie C.; Wei, Max; Myers, Deborah J.; Weber, Adam Z.; Danilovic, Nemanja","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFC) convert electrical energy to and from chemical bonds in hydrogen. URFCs have the potential to provide economical means for efficient long-term, seasonal, energy storage and on-demand conversion back to electrical energy. We first optimize the catalyst layer for discrete electrolyzer and fuel cell and then configure the URFC. The goal is to identify a cost competitive configuration for URFCs, and demonstrate it in terms of upper limit of round trip efficiencies (RTEs). Two possible configurations of URFCs are compared via experiments and techno-economic analysis (TEA), which emphasize the advantages of the unconventional constant-electrode (CE) URFC over the traditional constant-gas (CG) configuration. We also study the stability via accelerated stress tests (ASTs) and demonstrate steady state operation in a daily cycle for day to night energy shifting. From the investigations, the optimum composition of the URFC anode catalyst layer is 90 at% Ir-black balanced by Pt-black for both CE and CG configurations. At 80 °C and 1 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, the optimized CE URFC achieves 57% and 60% RTE with air and O<sub>2</sub> as the reductant gases, respectively. We then evaluated the differences in durability using an AST over 10k charge–discharge cycles; the results reveal that the wider potential window at the anode in CE (0.05–1.55 V) has minimal effect on catalyst layer stability compared to CG (0.55–1.55 V). Furthermore, there was no degradation up to the range of 2k–5k cycles; beyond that the fuel cell (discharge) performance degraded while the electrolyzer (charge) performance was still stable. Finally, the observations here indicate substantial potential to employ URFCs as efficient and cost-effective bidirectional energy-conversion devices within energy storage and utilization systems after appropriate technological and operational optimizations.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

Commercial FCEVs are now on the road; however, their PEMFC systems do not meet the cost targets established by the U.S. Department of Energy, primarily due to the high platinum loading needed on the cathode to achieve the requisite performance and lifetime. While the activities of a number of commercial Pt-based alloy cathode catalysts exceed the beginning-of-life (BOL) targets, these activities, and the overall cathode performance, degrade via a variety of mechanisms described herein. Degradation is mitigated in current FCEVs by utilizing a cathode catalyst with a lower BOL activity (e.g., much lower transition metal alloy content and larger BOL nanoparticle size), necessitating higher catalyst loadings, and through the utilization of system controls that avoid conditions known to exacerbate degradation processes, such as limiting the fuel cell stack voltage range. The design and development of active and robust materials and eliminating the need for vehicle mitigation strategies would greatly simplify the operating system, allowing for greater transient operation, avoiding large hybridization, and curtailing of fuel cell power. Although system mitigation strategies have provided the near-term pathway for FCEV commercialization, material-specific solutions are required to further reduce costs and improve operability and efficiency. Future material developments should focus on stabilization of the electrode structure and minimization of the catalyst particle susceptibility to dissolution caused by oxide formation and reduction over PEMFC cathode-relevant operating potentials plus minimization of support corrosion. Ex situ accelerated stress tests have provided insight into the processes responsible for material and performance degradation and will continue to provide useful information on the relative stability of materials and benchmarks for robust and stable materials-based solutions not requiring system mitigation strategies to achieve adequate lifetime.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Na, K, and Ca are promising as the basis for battery chemistries in that these elements are highly abundant. Here, a series of single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SIPEs) for Na, K, and Ca batteries are synthesized and investigated. The two classes of metal cation neutralized SIPEs compared are crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate-x-styrene sulfonate (PEGDMA-SS) and poly(tetrahydrofuran) diacrylate-x-4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PTHFDA-STFSI); three cation types, three charge densities, and four swelling states are examined. The impact on conductivity of all of these parameters is studied, and in conjunction with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), it is found that promoting ion dissociation and preventing the formation of dense ionic aggregates facilitates ion transport. These results indicate many of the lessons learned from the Li SIPE literature can be translated to beyond Li chemistries. At 25 °C, the best performing Na/K and Ca exchanged polymers yield active cation conductivity on the order of 10<sup>–4</sup> S/cm and 10<sup>–6</sup> S/cm, respectively, for ethylene carbonate:propylene carbonate gelled SIPEs, and 10<sup>–5</sup> S/cm and 10<sup>–7</sup> S/cm, respectively, for glyme gelled SIPEs.","MDPI","","Argonne National Lab.

Both short- and long-term effects of moisture have previously been associated with use of ambient air. To better understand these effects, we study oxygen exchange kinetics at the cathode surface and the cathode/electrolyte interface using La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2-Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) epitaxial thin films as a model-surface system. In situ synchrotron X-ray techniques evaluate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in response to environmental variables. The results suggest a clear enhancement of the ORR rate upon short term exposure of the perovskite-structured films to water. On the basis of these measurements, along with in situ X-ray characterization of Sr segregation and computational first-principles studies, we suggest a model for this increased ORR activity that may lead to further improvements by stabilizing active cathode surface configurations.","Elsevier","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

Cells with a low loading of 1.5 mAk.cm(-2) withstand XFC performance remarkably well even up to 9C constant current (CC) charging with high charge capacity, high coulombic efficiency and very little apparent lithium plating. For a moderate loading of 2.5 mAk.cm(-2), the 6C CC charge capacity is poor with significant amounts of visually observed lithium plating. Simulated electrolyte transport properties are revealed to be insufficient and majorly set limitations for XFC performance in case of the moderate and the only simulated higher loadings (>2.5 mAk.cm(-2)). Charging at elevated temperature is shown to be an effective strategy for moderate loading cells enabling good 10-min charge capacity, high coulombic efficiency, and mitigating lithium plating. Lastly, an electrochemical model is used to investigate strategies for enabling 4-6C CC charging for cells incorporating loading beyond 3 mAk.cm(-2).

"Descriptor-Based Analysis of Atomic Layer Deposition Mechanisms on Spinel LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes","Warburton, Robert E.; Young, Matthias J.; Letourneau, Steven; Elam, Jeffrey W.; Greeley, Jeffrey","25 ENERGY STORAGE; adsorption; organic reactions; ions; atomic layer deposition; transition metals","Protective coatings have been shown to effectively suppress Mn ion dissolution from the spinel LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> lithium-ion battery cathode by stabilizing the surface against undesired side reactions with the electrolyte. In spite of extensive study, however, there remains a lack of atomic-scale understanding of how such coatings are deposited, and no molecular-level descriptor to predict trends in deposition mechanisms has been identified. We have recently shown that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) with alternating trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water exposures exhibit submonolayer growth because of precursor decomposition on the lithium manganate spinel (LMO) surface during early ALD pulses. In the present work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ALD process using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments, and we introduce a generalized descriptor-based framework to understand the resulting trends across a spectrum of surface structures and functionalities. We demonstrate that all decomposition products, including CH<sub>3</sub> -aluminum adducts and dissociated CH<sub>3</sub> groups, are Lewis bases and are coordinated to oxygen atoms on the LMO surface, leading to charge transfer to Lewis acidic Mn 3d states. Inert-transfer XPS supports these theoretical predictions, showing an increase in near-surface Mn<sup>3+</sup> content following TMA exposure and shifts in C is spectra consistent with C-O bond formation. We extend the DFT studies to various low- and high-index LMO surface facets, as a proxy for tuning the Lewis acid-base interactions between surface-bound CH<sub>3</sub>* and near-surface Mn ions. The thermochemistry for TMA reactions on these chemically distinct LMO surfaces demonstrates that ALD is structure-sensitive and that there is higher reactivity for TMA decomposition and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nucleation near LMO steps and defects. Motivated by the Lewis basic character of the decomposition products, we introduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy as a descriptor for decomposition energetics, and we demonstrate that all energetics are correlated to this quantity through the number of electrons that are transferred along the reaction coordinate. Finally, based on these findings, we hypothesize that improved electrochemical cycling with only 1-2 ALD cycles may be due to selective passivation of defect sites on the LMO surface that are more susceptible to Mn dissolution, and we suggest that similar descriptor-based analyses could be useful for the study of other ALD coatings on oxide substrates.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

The previous pursuing of novel cathode materials with high redox potentials impedes the vast applications due to the simultaneous electrolyte decomposition at high potentials, though they are expected to deliver high specific capacities. Eventually, people start thinking in an opposite way, desirable anode materials with low redox potentials can also own high specific capacities. Among all the promising candidates, phosphorus-based anodes in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have received considerable attention owing to the low cost and relatively high natural abundance of phosphorus. More importantly, phosphorus can store three sodium atoms and enable a high theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, which overwhelms any other SIB anode currently available. However, the poor electronic conductivity and large volume change of phosphorus during cycling severely deteriorate battery performance. The most widely used strategy is to confine phosphorus within well-designed carbon hosts. Here, we thereby introduce a new type of porous hollow carbon with conductive-network interior as phosphorus host, which not only improves the electrical conductivity, but also creates enough interior surface for maximizing phosphorus utilization and shortening the ion's diffusion distance, compared to those conventional hollow carbon hosts. Therefore, the as-prepared red phosphorus-carbon spheres composites (RP/CS) exhibit superior rate performance (similar to 1083 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 4 A g<sup>-1</sup>, similar to 837 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> even at 8 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and excellent cycle life (1027 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 4 A g<sup>-1</sup> more than 2000 cycles).","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrodes with highly stable cycling were prepared by simple planetary mixing procedures, enabled by the use of just a fraction of a weight percent of commercial SWCNTs as the only conductive additive, and by the appropriate choice of binder/stabilizing agent. In fact, the use of SWCNTs allowed for graphite-free SiO electrodes with approximately 74% higher volumetric energy density relative to traditional graphite electrodes, and superior capacity retention in coin-type full-cell testing versus NMC532 cathodes.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"A Low-Cost Iron-Based Current Collector for Alkaline Battery Electrodes","Irshad, Ahamed; Mitra, D.; Sundar Rajan, A.; Trinh, P.; Balasubramanian, M.; Narayanan, S. R.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The use of three-dimensional porous nickel foam as the current collector of the nickel hydroxide electrode adds significantly to the cost of the nickel-based alkaline rechargeable batteries. Although iron is considerably less expensive than nickel, iron corrodes at the operating potential of the nickel hydroxide electrode. We have found that a 70–100 nm thick thermal coating of cobalt ferrite spinel protects the iron from corrosion. Such a coated iron substrate was found to be stable against corrosion even when polarized anodically at 10 mA cm<sup>-2 </sup>in 30% potassium hydroxide electrolyte for 1000 h. While the thermal coating of cobalt ferrite protected iron against corrosion, incorporation of lithium ions into the coating was found to enhance the electrical conductivity of the coating. XPS and EXAFS studies confirmed that the enhanced conductivity resulted from an increase in the population of Co<sup>3+</sup> in the ferrite spinel lattice. An inexpensive iron (steel) substrate protected by such a coating when used as a nickel hydroxide battery electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 0.25 Ah g<sup>-1</sup> at C/5 discharge rate, comparable to a nickel hydroxide electrode based on a relatively expensive nickel foam substrate. The steel-based electrode also exhibited no noticeable degradation over 150 cycles at C/2 rate.

A new novel titration method was used to quantify the amounts of hydroxide, carbonate and bicarbonate in the membrane. However, hydroxide and bicarbonate react internally which disturbs the equilibrium and hence it's impossible to detect real species concentration using titration. The uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a rise in membrane mass within the first 15 min. The anionic conductivity of the AEM experiences a quick drop within 20 minutes to carbonate and bicarbonate levels. However, switching the inlet gas to 0 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> reverses the equilibrium due to the desorption phenomenon. Investigating the morphology of the film by small angle X-ray scattering shows that the ionomer domains lose intensity as the reaction progresses, and the drop is of the double-exponential type but the time of equilibration is slower when compared to that of the conductivity. The wide-angle X-ray scattering data were fit to 3 Gaussian peaks showing that the CF<sub>2</sub> inter-chain spacing becomes less crystalline during the process. 30% of peak power was lost for this membrane in an AEM fuel cell on addition of CO<sub>2</sub>, yet we observed the highest H<sub>2</sub>/ambient air (400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>) performance, 446 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>, reported to date.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

While the most current studies focus on the macroscopic and bulk crystal structure of these materials, our previous work suggests that, as a confined region where charge transfer takes place, the interfacial structures of cathode materials largely dictate their electrochemical performances due to the structural symmetry breaking from 3D (bulk) to 2D (surface), which leads to reconstructions under the different chemical/electrochemical conditions. By summarizing works in this subject and offering our perspectives, this tutorial review will reveal for the first time the correlation between surface structure and interface reconstruction at atomic/molecular scales and their direct impact on corresponding electrochemical performances.

"An epoxy-reinforced ceramic sheet as a durable solid electrolyte for solid state Na-ion batteries","Lim, Young Jun; Han, Jinhyup; Kim, Hyun Woo; Choi, Yunseok; Lee, Eungje; Kim, Youngsik","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Na-ion batteries; Oxide solid electrolyte; all-solid-state batteries; ceramic electrolyte; epoxy polymer","In a conventional Na-ion battery system using liquid electrolyte, there are critical safety issues due to the instability of the liquid electrolyte. Na<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>12</sub> (NASICON) solid electrolyte is a material that is sufficient to replace a liquid electrolyte as it has high ionic conductivity and thermal and electrochemical stability. However, as there is a large interfacial resistance in the NASICON solid electrolyte powder, even when used in combination with a polymer electrolyte, the advantageous effects of ceramics are not easily exhibited. In this study, we propose a top-down method of combining a polymer with a ceramic in which an ion transport channel is previously formed. In this method, a NASICON solid electrolyte is partially sintered to form ion transport channels. Then the NASICON solid electrolyte pores are filled with an epoxy polymer to increase the strength of the epoxy-NASICON composite electrolyte. This method demonstrates the possibility of our composite electrolyte being used as a thin and strong film. As a result of our methods, the ionic conductivity and thermal and electrochemical stability of NASICON were maintained, while the physical strength was enhanced by approximately 2 times. In addition, a capacity of 120 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> and stability of 20 cycles were confirmed in a half cell with a Na<sub>3</sub>V<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> cathode and Na metal. This method proposes a new direction for research regarding composite electrolytes created using an oxide-based solid electrolyte.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, we synthesized and electrochemically tested four representative compositions in the Li-Mn-O-F DRX chemical space with various Li and F content. Although all compositions achieve higher than 200 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> initial capacity and good cyclability, we show that the Li-site distribution plays a more important role than the metal-redox capacity in determining the initial capacity, whereas the metal-redox capacity is more closely related to the cyclability of the materials. We apply these insights and generate a capacity map of the Li-Mn-O-F chemical space, LixMn<sub>2-x</sub>O<sub>2-y</sub>F<sub>y</sub> (1.167 ≤ x ≤ 1.333, 0 ≤ y ≤ 0.667), which predicts both accessible Li capacity and Mn-redox capacity.

"Re-Engineering Poly(Acrylic Acid) Binder toward Optimized Electrochemical Performance for Silicon Lithium-Ion Batteries: Branching Architecture Leads to Balanced Properties of Polymeric Binders","Jiang, Sisi; Hu, Bin; Shi, Zhangxing; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Zhengcheng; Zhang, Lu","25 ENERGY STORAGE; branched PAA; lithium-ion batteries; polymer binder; silicon anode","Silicon is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries with its superior capacity. However, the drastic volume changes during lithiation/delithiation cycles hinder the cycling performance, resulting in particle pulverization, conductivity loss, and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface. In this work, a series of synthetic polymeric binders, poly(acrylic acid-co-tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate)-featuring a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) backbone branched via tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA)-are developed that edge toward evidencing well-balanced properties to confront capacity fading in Si-based electrodes. The incorporation of ether chain not only leads to the branching architecture of the PAA backbone, thus affecting its mechanical properties, but also promotes the conductivity of Li ions. As a result, a synergistic performance improvement is observed in both half and full cells. The best-performing cell using a branched PAA binder (bPAA) with a feeding molar ratio ([TEGDA]:[acrylic acid(AA)]) of 0.2 results in a 10% increase in initial capacity and a 31% increase in capacity retention over 100 cycles compared to the linear PAA cell. The cross-sectional microscopic images of the cycled electrodes reveal that bPAA binders can drastically reduce the electrode expansion. This improvement results from the well-balanced properties of the polymer design, which could guide further development for more advanced binder materials.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the energy storage of most organic cathodes relies on the electron transfer of a single type of functional group, leading to either a low redox potential or a low capacity. Here we propose a new strategy for the structure design and performance optimization of organic materials. Furthermore, a new organic cathode, dithianon (DTN), containing three functional groups (-S-, C=O, C equivalent to N) in one framework, is reported. The -S- group increases the redox potential to 3.0 V, while C=O and C equivalent to N groups enable a three Li-ions-involved redox reaction. As a cathode, DTN delivers 270.2 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5C for 300 cycles. Even at 5C, it still retains 161.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 1000 cycles. The high-capacity, high-power, and stable DTN cathode offers great promise for high-performance and sustainable LIBs.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"Fast Charging of Li-Ion Cells: Part III. Relaxation Dynamics and Trap-Controlled Lithium Ion Transport","Shkrob, Ilya A.; Rodrigues, Marco-Tulio F.; Abraham, Daniel P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; NCM523; dispersive kinetics; graphite; impedance; layered oxides; lithium plating","Fast charging of Li-ion batteries would ease consumer concerns regarding refueling time of electric vehicles. In this series of articles, we are systematically examining the effects of high currents flowing through the cell. Here we consider open-circuit relaxation dynamics for cell voltage and individual electrode potentials after abrupt termination of steady-state charging currents (1-6C) or short current pulses (< 30 s) of either polarity (to 16C). We demonstrate that dispersive kinetics observed after these current perturbations become faster for higher currents applied before the rest period. Our observations indicate that the voltage relaxation behaviors (i) depend on the current during charge, and less so on the state of charge, (ii) display universal stretched-exponential kinetics, (iii) can be induced by a short current pulse, (iv) require a minimum amount of charge transfer during the pulse, and (v) originate mainly from the oxide cathode. Trap controlled Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport through a partially disordered oxygen-depleted subsurface layer in the cathode is suggested as a possible origin for the relaxation behavior. The slow multidecadal responses to high currents can cause the nonlinearities observed during rapid charging of the electrochemical cells, reported in Part 2 of this series.","IOP Publishing - The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Compared to the over-emphasized efforts on the electrode structure design to mitigate the volume changes, understanding and engineering of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) are significantly lacking. This work demonstrates that modifying the surface of alloy-based anode materials by building an ultraconformal layer of Sb can significantly enhance their structural and interfacial stability during cycling. Combined experimental and theoretical studies consistently reveal that the ultraconformal Sb layer is dynamically converted to Li<sub>3</sub>Sb during cycling, which can selectively adsorb and catalytically decompose electrolyte additives to form a robust, thin, and dense LiF-dominated SEI, and simultaneously restrain the decomposition of electrolyte solvents. Hence, the Sb-coated porous Ge electrode delivers much higher initial Coulombic efficiency of 85% and higher reversible capacity of 1046 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 200 cycles at 500 mA g<sup>-1</sup>, compared to only 72% and 170 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> for bare porous Ge. The present finding has indicated that tailoring surface structures of electrode materials is an appealing approach to construct a robust SEI and achieve long-term cycling stability for alloy-based anode materials.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

In addition, BSSs can precharge batteries for customers and the batteries that are not in charging can provide a stable regulation capacity to the market. However, uncertainties, such as ACE signals and the EV per-hour visit counts, introduce stochastic nonlinear dynamics into the operation of a BSS-based FFRS. Currently, there is no quantification method to ensure its optimal economical operation. To close this gap, in this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning-based FFRS capacity dynamic scheduling strategy. This method can autonomously schedule the hourly regulation capacity in real time to maximize the BSSx0027;s revenue for providing FFRS.

In this work, a novel lithium chlorothiophosphate compound, Li15P4S16Cl3, is discovered. The crystal structure and electrochemical properties are investigated. Li15P4S16Cl3 can be synthesized as a pure phase via a facile solid-state reaction by heating a ballmilled mixture of Li2S, P2S5, and LiCl at 360 degrees C. The crystal structure of Li15P4S16Cl3 was refined against neutron and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data, revealing that it crystallizes in the space group 1 (4) over bar 3d. The Li+ transport in Li15P4S16Cl3 was also investigated by multiple solid-state NMR methods, including variable-temperature NMR line-shape analysis, NMR relaxometry, and pulsed-field-gradient NMR. Li15P4S16Cl3 shows good thermodynamic stability and can be synthesized at relatively low temperature. Although it exhibits a low ionic conductivity at room temperature, it can serve as a new motif crystal structure for the design and development of new solid-state electrolytes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Brookhaven National Lab.

The spontaneous integration of well-crystallized metal alloy, carbon shell with a tunable active FeOy layer, not only guarantees smooth charge transfer across the thin oxide layer, but also generates the synergistic effect at the interface, thus dramatically boosting the intrinsic activity of oxygen catalysis.

Interestingly, cathodes surface-treated at a low temperature (~100°C) exhibited the best results. The optimized LLS cathode was tested vs. graphite using small amounts of lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate electrolyte additive. The combined approach improved various aspects of the electrochemical performance (e.g., impedance, cycle life, and coulombic efficiency) more than each strategy used alone by mitigating Mn dissolution from the cathode and the ensuing deposition on the anode.

Specifically, thermal processing at different temperatures is utilized to tune the sub-nanoparticle polymorph composition, while mechanical processing (high energy ball-milling) is used to change the particle size and create a better contact between active material and conductive graphite additive. The combination of thermal and mechanical processing is also investigated for possible synergistic effects. The structural changes due to processing suggest that thermal treatment of the MnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles at 400 °C forms a high concentration of pyrolusite domains (1 $\times$ 1 channels) leading to improved reversibility of lithium intercalation/de-intercalation and capacity retention.

This is exemplified by the ambiguity for the equilibrium phases driving the first open–circuit voltage (OCV) plateau for the lithiation of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals. Adding complexity, the relaxed state for Li<sub><em>x</em></sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is observed to be a function of electrochemical discharge rate. The phases occurring on the first OCV plateau for the lithiation of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals have been investigated with density functional theory (DFT) through the evaluation of stable, or hypothesized metastable, reaction pathways. Hypotheses are evaluated through the systematic combined refinement with X–ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X–ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, neutron–diffraction measurements, and the measured OCV on samples lithiated to <em>x</em> = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 in Li<sub><em>x</em></sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. In contrast to the Li–Fe–O bulk phase thermodynamic pathway, Fe0 is not observed as a product on the first OCV plateau for 10–45 nm nanocrystals. The phase most consistent with the systematic refinement is LiFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, showing Li+Fe cation disorder. Here, the observed equilibrium concentration for conversion to Fe<sup>0</sup> occurs at <em>x</em> = 4.0. These definitive phase identifications rely heavily on the systematic combined refinement approach, which is broadly applicable to other nano– and mesoscaled systems that have suffered from difficult or crystallite–size–dependent phase identification.","Wiley","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Here, it is reported that surface modification of NCA cathode (R-3m) with 5 nm-thick nanopillar layers and Fm-3m structures significantly improves electrode structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance. The formation of nanopillar layers increases cycling and working voltage stability of NCA by shielding the host material from hydrofluoric acid and improves structural stability with the electrolyte. The modified NCA cathode exhibits an enhanced 89% capacity retention at a rate of 1 C over that of pristine NCA (75.2%) after 150 cycles and effectively suppresses working voltage fade (a drop of 0.025 V after 300 cycles) during repeated charge-discharge cycles. In addition, the diffusion barrier of Li ions in NCA crystals at 0.80 V is noticeably smaller than that of Li ions in pristine NCA (0.87 eV). These findings demonstrate that this unique surface structure design considerably enhances cycle and rate performance of NCA, which has potential applications in other Ni-rich layered cathode materials.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the actual structures and functions of surface alumina coatings formed by different synthesis methods are still not clear. In this work, we systematically compared two different synthesis approaches, wet chemical (WC) coating and atomic layer deposition (ALD), for alumina coatings on LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532). Using nuclear magnetic resonance and electron microscope characterizations, we found that high-temperature annealing can significantly affect the atomic and chemical structures of alumina coating layers formed byWC method, leading to the formation of more alpha-LiAlO2 buffer layer attached closely to the cathode particles and the improvement of electrochemical performance. Such strong interaction between cathode materials and alumina coatings during annealing is related to the Li extraction during the solution-based coating procedures. On the other hand, ALD-coated samples are less influenced by the high-temperature annealing, showing good electrochemical performance both before and after the heat-treatment. This work proves that different coating protocols have critical influences on the atomic and chemical structures of surface alumina coatings as well as the electrochemical performance of the coated cathodes.

Thus far, there have been no ways to increase the charging rate without losses in energy density and electrochemical performance. Here we show that the charging rate of a cathode can be dramatically increased via interaction with white light. We find that a direct exposure of light to an operating LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cathode during charging leads to a remarkable lowering of the battery charging time by a factor of two or more. This enhancement is enabled by the induction of a microsecond long-lived charge separated state, consisting of Mn<sup>4+</sup> (hole) plus electron.

Many types of electrocatalysts have been explored to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, even with the application of catalysts, it is still difficult to achieve stable operation as the carbon electrode (especially the defects) easily undergoes side reactions. To achieve high stability and round-trip efficiency, the rational design of OER catalysts and stable carbon electrodes are required. Herein, we employ a wet impregnation chemistry method to form a thin layer of palladium nanoparticles on the surface of carbon, which largely suppresses the side reaction through a selective coating on the carbon defect sites. Simultaneously, the Pd films serve as an electrocatalyst enabling the OER reaction with a very low overpotential. Overall, this rational design improves overall cell efficiency and extends the cycle life of the lithium-oxygen battery.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work size-selected subnanometer Ir clusters are used to investigate cathode materials that can help control lithium superoxide formation during discharge, which has good electronic conductivity needed for low charge potentials. It is found that Ir particles can lead to lithium superoxide formation as the discharge product with Ir particle sizes of , similar to 1.5 nm giving the lowest charge potentials. During discharge these 1.5 nm Ir nanoparticles surprisingly evolve to larger ones while incorporating Li to form core-shell structures with Ir<sub>3</sub>Li shells, which probably act as templates for growth of lithium superoxide during discharge. Various characterization techniques including DEMS, Raman, titration, and HRTEM are used to characterize the LiO<sub>2</sub> discharge product and the evolution of the Ir nanoparticles. Density functional calculations are used to provide insight into the mechanism for formation of the core-shell Ir Li<sub>3</sub> particles.

Fracture and continued formation of the SEI contribute to consumption of lithium, drying of electrolyte, increase in impedance, and growth of dendrites resulting in capacity fade and premature failure. Electrolyte additives such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) have been known to improve performance, but the underlying reasons have been elusive. Despite its importance, reliable methods for mechanical characterization of SEI have been lacking. In this paper, we present a new experimental technique that combines atomic force microscopy and membrane-bulge configuration to accurately measure the stress-strain behavior of SEI, including the onset of inelastic response and evolution of fracture. We characterize the SEI formed with two ethylene carbonate-based electrolytes, without and with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive. The measurements show a striking contrast; SEI with FEC additive has 80% higher elastic modulus and a vastly higher resistance to fracture. These findings offer a mechanical-behavior based rationale to understand how SEI controls battery performance. Moreover, the experimental technique offers a robust diagnostic tool to design electrolytes that can form SEI with the desired mechanical properties for optimal battery performance.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The high Ni loading, on the other hand, raises the critical issues of surface instability and poor rate performance. The rational design of synthesis leading to layered LiNi0.7Mn0.15Co0.15O2 with greatly enhanced rate capability is demonstrated, by implementing a quenching process alternative to the general slow cooling. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, coupled with surface analysis, is applied to studies of the synthesis process, revealing cooling-induced surface reconstruction involving Li2CO3 accumulation, formation of a Li-deficient layer and Ni reduction at the particle surface. The reconstruction process occurs predominantly at high temperatures (above 350 °C) and is highly cooling-rate dependent, implying that surface reconstruction can be suppressed through synthetic control, i.e., quenching to improve the surface stability and rate performance of the synthesized materials. These findings may provide guidance to rational synthesis of high-Ni cathode materials.","Wiley","","Brookhaven National Lab. (BNL), Upton, NY (United States); Argonne National Lab.

We show that the anode impedance as measured both using this new treatment and the more established pulsed-current techniques is not significantly changed after high-rate aging of the cell, including the conditions under which Li plating has occurred. Our measurements suggest that the changes in cell and electrode polarization to a large extent occur through nonlinear effects that involve time-delayed processes.

The physical origin of the observed anion redox remains debatable, and more direct experimental evidence is needed. In this work, we have shown electronic signatures of oxygen-oxygen coupling, direct evidence central to lattice oxygen redox (O2-/(O-2)(n-)), in charged Li2-xRuO3 after Ru oxidation (Ru-4(+)/Ru5+) upon first electron removal with lithium deintercalation. Experimental Ru L-3-edge high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectra (HERFD-XAS), supported by ab initio simulations, revealed that the increased intensity in the high-energy shoulder upon lithium deintercalation resulted from increased O-O coupling, inducing (O-O) sigma*-like states with pi overlap with Ru d-manifolds, in agreement with O K-edge XAS spectra. Experimental and simulated O K-edge X-ray emission spectra further supported this observation with the broadening of the oxygen nonbonding feature upon charging, also originated from (O-O) sigma* states. This lattice oxygen redox of Li2-xRuO3 was accompanied by a small amount of O-2 evolution in the first charge from differential electrochemistry mass spectrometry but diminished in the subsequent cycles, in agreement with the more reduced states of Ru in later cycles from Ru L-3-edge HERFD-XAS. These observations indicated that Ru redox contributed more to discharge capacities after the first cycle. This study has pinpointed the key spectral fingerprints related to lattice oxygen redox from a molecular level and constructed a transferrable framework to rationally interpret the spectroscopic features by combining advanced experiments and theoretical calculations to design materials for Li-ion batteries and electrocatalysis applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The future direction of academic research based on current studies of the existing challenges is proposed.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Globally regional life cycle analysis of automotive lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt batteries","Kelly, Jarod C. (ORCID:0000000278046506); Dai, Qiang; Wang, Michael","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Automotive; Life cycle assessment; Lithium ion battery; Supply chain","Electric vehicles based on lithium-ion batteries (LIB) have seen rapid growth over the past decade as they are viewed as a cleaner alternative to conventional fossil-fuel burning vehicles, especially for local pollutant (nitrogen oxides [NO<sub>x</sub>], sulfur oxides [SO<sub>x</sub>], and particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 and 10 μm [PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>]) and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, LIBs are known to have their own energy and environmental challenges. This study focuses on LIBs made of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), since they currently dominate the United States (US) and global automotive markets and will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. The effects of globalized production of NMC, especially LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>O2 (NMC<sub>111</sub>), are examined, considering the potential regional variability at several important stages of production. This study explores regional effects of alumina reduction and nickel refining, along with the production of NMC cathode, battery cells, and battery management systems. Of primary concern is how production of these battery materials and components in different parts of the world may impact the battery’s life cycle pollutant emissions and total energy and water consumption. Since energy sources for heat and electricity generation are subject to great regional variation, we anticipated significant variability in the energy and emissions associated with LIB production. We configured Argonne National Laboratory’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET®) model as the basis for this study with key input data from several world regions. In particular, the study examined LIB production in the US, China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe, with details of supply chains and the electrical grid in these regions. Results indicate that 27-kWh automotive NMC111 LIBs produced via a European-dominant supply chain generate 65 kg CO2e/kWh, while those produced via a Chinese-dominant supply chain generate 100 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh. Further, there are significant regional differences for local pollutants associated with LIB, especially SO<sub>x</sub> emissions related to nickel production. We find that no single regional supply chain outperforms all others in every evaluation metric, but the data indicate that supply chains powered by renewable electricity provide the greatest emission reduction potential.","Springer","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the electrochemical reversibility of these compounds is affected not only by their molecular structure but also by the properties of a carbon-based electrode surface. This study combines experimental and theoretical approaches to understand this dependence. Specifically, we study the electron transfer kinetics of two synthesized quinone derivatives and two commercially available ones with a glassy carbon, a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, and a high-edge-density graphite electrode (HEDGE). The electrochemical reversibility is notably improved on the HEDGE, which shows a higher density of defects and presents oxygenated functional groups at its surface. The electron transfer kinetics are controlled by adsorbed species onto the HEDGE. Molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanics calculations suggest defects with oxygen-containing functional groups, such as C-O and C$=$O, on HEDGE surfaces drive the interaction with the functional groups of the molecules, during physisorption from van der Waals forces. The presence of sulfonic acid side groups and a greater number of aromatic rings in the molecular structure may contribute to a higher stabilization of quinone derivatives on HEDGEs. We propose that high-performance carbon-based electrodes can be obtained without catalysts for organic batteries, by the engineering of carbon-based surfaces with edge-like defects and oxygenated functional groups.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Herein, an asymmetric design of a Mo net/Li metal film (MLF) composite electrode is developed by an inverted thermal infusion method. The asymmetric MLF electrode has a dense oxide passivated layer on the top side, a porous Mo net matrix on the back side, and active Li layer in between. The back side has a larger specific area and higher electric field than the top side, which contacts with the separator upon cycling, triggering the preferred Li deposition and stripping of the porous back side of the electrode far from the separator. The surface passivation layer on the top side of the electrode as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase ensures the stable contact with the electrolyte and separator. Meanwhile, the porous structure of the supporting Mo net provides enough space for accommodating the volume change during Li deposition and stripping. This asymmetry design enables a unique “top down” growth pathway for Li deposition in the MLF electrode, suppressing the dendrite growth effectively. In conclusion, the design strategy provides a new direction for high-energy dendrite-free Li metal anodes.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical cycling suggests a loose correlation between the Coulombic efficiency observed over 200 cycles and the fluorination degree of the PFE, which correlates with the computed pKa of the C–H bond of the ethers. PFE with lower pKa (<36) tends to chemically react with lithium anode forming a solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) layer thus preventing the shuttling effect of the lithium polysulfides. The cycled lithium anodes with DOL/PFE electrolyte was discovered to produce a protective SEI analyzed by FT-IR and SEM/EDS. Computations of the interactions between the PFEs of interest and a lithium surface suggest the generation of LiF and unsaturated PFE derivatives which are easily reduced and polymerized on the Li surface. The PFE decomposition is more thermodynamically likely with increasing fluorination degree.

However, the extreme reactivity of Li-metal with the electrolyte leads to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer which often impedes the Li<sup>+</sup> transport across the interface. The challenge is to predict the chemical, structural and topographical heterogeneity of SEI layer arising from multitude of interfacial constituents. Traditionally the pathways and products of electrolyte decomposition processes were analyzed with the basic presumption of pristine Li-metal surface for simplicity. However, ubiquitous inorganic passivation layers on Li-metal can dampen the electronic charge transfer to the electrolyte and significantly alter the SEI layer evolution. In this study, we analyzed the effect of nanometric Li<sub>2</sub>O, LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> as surface passivation layer on the interfacial reactivity of Li-metal using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. These nanometric layers impede the electronic charge transfer to the electrolyte and thereby provide some degree of passivation (compared to pristine lithium metal) to the redox based decomposition process. The Li<sub>2</sub>O, LiOH and Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> layers admits varying level of electron transfer from Li-metal slab and subsequent storage of the electronic charges within their structure. Nevertheless, their ability for electron transfer to the electrolyte molecules and the extent of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anion decomposition is significantly smaller than that on the pristine Li-metal. The XPS experiments showed that Li<sub>2</sub>O as major surface component had greater LiF phase formation, whereas a dominant LiOH layer shows enhanced sulfur decomposition process. Furthermore, these observations were explained based on different electronic charge transfer ability of the passivating films derived from AIMD results.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Origin of High Activity and Durability of Twisty Nanowire Alloy Catalysts under Oxygen Reduction and Fuel Cell Operating Conditions","Kong, Zhijie; Maswadeh, Yazan; Vargas, Jorge A.; Shan, Shiyao; Wu, Zhi-Peng; Kareem, Haval; Leff, Asher C.; Tran, Dat T.; Yan, Shan; Nam, Sanghyun; Zhao, Xingfang; Lee, Jason M.; Luo, Jin; Shastri, Sarvjit; Yu, Gang; Petkov, Valeri; Zhong, Chuan-Jian","25 ENERGY STORAGE; twisty nanowires; platinum-iron alloy electrocatalysts; realloying; oxygen reduction reaction; synchrotron X-ray diffraction; pair distribution function analysis; fuel cell","The ability to control the surface composition and morphology of alloy catalysts is critical for achieving high activity and durability of catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and fuel cells. Here, this report describes an efficient surfactant-free synthesis route for producing a twisty nanowire (TNW) shaped platinum–iron (PtFe) alloy catalyst (denoted as PtFe TNWs) with controllable bimetallic compositions. PtFe TNWs with an optimal initial composition of ~24% Pt are shown to exhibit the highest mass activity (3.4 A/mg<sub>Pt</sub>, ~20 times higher than that of commercial Pt catalyst) and the highest durability (<2% loss of activity after 40000 cycles and <30% loss after 120000 cycles) among all PtFe-based nanocatalysts under ORR or fuel cell operating conditions reported so far. Using ex situ and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and 3D modeling, the PtFe TNWs are shown to exhibit mixed face-centered cubic (fcc)-body-centered cubic (bcc) alloy structure and a significant lattice strain. A striking finding is that the activity strongly depends on the composition of the as-synthesized catalysts and this dependence remains unchanged despite the evolution of the composition of the different catalysts and their lattice constants under ORR or fuel cell operating conditions. Notably, dealloying under fuel cell operating condition starts at phase-segregated domain sites leading to a final fcc alloy structure with subtle differences in surface morphology. Due to a subsequent realloying and the morphology of TNWs, the surface lattice strain observed with the as-synthesized catalysts is largely preserved. This strain and the particular facets exhibited by the TNWs are believed to be responsible for the observed activity and durability enhancements. These findings provide new insights into the correlation between the structure, activity, and durability of nanoalloy catalysts and are expected to energize the ongoing effort to develop highly active and durable low-Pt-content nanowire catalysts by controlling their alloy structure and morphology.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Reversible intercalation of methyl viologen as a dicationic charge carrier in aqueous batteries","Wei, Zhixuan; Shin, Woochul; Jiang, Heng; Wu, Xianyong; Stickle, William F.; Chen, Gang; Lu, Jun; Alex Greaney, P.; Du, Fei; Ji, Xiulei","25 ENERGY STORAGE","The interactions among charge carriers and electrode structures represent one of the most important considerations in the search for new energy storage devices. Currently, ionic bonding dominates the battery chemistry. In this work we report the reversible insertion of a large molecular dication, methyl viologen, into the crystal structure of an aromatic solid electrode, 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride. This is the largest insertion charge carrier when non-solvated ever reported for batteries; surprisingly, the kinetic properties of the (de) insertion of methyl viologen are excellent with 60% of capacity retained when the current rate is increased from 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup> to 2000 mA g<sup>-1</sup>. Characterization reveals that the insertion of methyl viologen causes phase transformation of the organic host, and embodies guest-host chemical bonding. First-principles density functional theory calculations suggest strong guest-host interaction beyond the pure ionic bonding, where a large extent of covalency may exist. This study extends the boundary of battery chemistry to large molecular ions as charge carriers and also highlights the electrochemical assembly of a supramolecular system.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

In many cases, standard electrochemical methods only provide an overall voltage or specific capacity, giving an inadequate description of parallel redox processes or chemical gradients at the particle and pack level. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) is frequently used to augment bulk electrochemical data, as it provides element-specific changes in oxidation state and local atomic structure. Such microscopic descriptors are crucial for elucidating charge transfer and structural changes associated with bonding or site mixing, two key factors in evaluating state of charge and modes of cell failure. However, the impact of XAFS on LIB research has been significantly constrained by a logistical barrier: contemporary XAFS work is performed almost exclusively at synchrotron X-ray light sources, where beamtime is infrequent and experiment time-frames are limited. In this report we show that modern laboratory-based XAFS cannot only be applied to, e.g., characterization of ex situ LIB electrode materials, but can also be used for operando studies at industrially-relevant charging rates in a standard pouch cell preparation. Such capability enables accelerated discovery of new materials and improved operation modes for LIBs.","IOP Publishing","","Argonne National Lab.

Yet, the large volume expansion and the formation of highly reactive lithium silicides during charging cause the continuous lithium and electrolyte consumption as well as the fast decay of Si anodes. In this work, by adding 0.1 M M(TFSI)<sub><em>x</em></sub> (M = Mg, Zn, Al and Ca) as a second salt into the electrolyte, we stabilize the anode chemistry through the in situ formation of Li–M–Si ternary phases during the charging process. First, lithium silicides and magnesium lithium silicides were synthesized as model compounds to investigate the influence of metal doping on the reactivity of lithiated Si. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that Mg doping can dramatically suppress the chemical reactions between the lithium silicide compounds and common electrolyte solvents. New mixed salt electrolytes were prepared containing M(TFSI)x as a second salt to LiPF6 and tested in commercially relevant electrodes, which show higher capacity, superior cyclability, and higher Coulombic efficiencies in both half-cell and full-cell configurations (except for Zn) when compared with standard electrolytes. Post-electrochemistry characterizations demonstrate that adding M salts leads to the co-insertion of M cations along with Li into Si during the lithiation process, stabilizing silicon anions by forming more stable Li–M–Si ternaries, which fundamentally changes the traditional Li–Si binary chemistry while minimally affecting silicon electrochemical profiles and theoretical capacities. This report opens a new and simple way to stabilize silicon anodes to enable widespread application of Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

To address this issue, we have developed highly stable porous graphitic carbon (PGC) produced through pyrolysis of a 3D polymer hydrogel in combination with Mn. The resulting PGC features multilayer carbon sheets assembled in porous and flower-like morphologies. <em>In situ</em> high-temperature electron microscopy was employed to dynamically monitor the carbonization process up to 1100 °C, suggesting that the 3D polymer hydrogel provides high porosity at multiple scales, and that Mn catalyzes the graphitization process more effectively than other metals. Compared to conventional carbon supports such as Vulcan, Ketjenblack, and graphitized carbon, PGC provides an improved balance between high graphitization and hierarchical porosity, which is favorable for uniform Pt nanoparticle dispersion and enhanced corrosion resistance. As a result, Pt supported on PGC exhibits remarkably enhanced stability. In addition to thorough testing in aqueous electrolytes, we also conducted fuel cell testing using durability protocols recommended by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). After 5000 voltage cycles from 1.0 to 1.5 V, the Pt/PGC catalyst only lost 9 mV at a current density of 1.5 A cm<sup>-2</sup>, dramatically exceeding the DOE support durability target (<30 mV), and surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts. Along with the enhanced carbon corrosion resistance of the PGC support, the enhanced catalyst–support interactions are beneficial for stability improvement, likely due to nitrogen doping into carbon, which was further elucidated through X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the high stability and activity of PGC-based Pt catalysts are attributed to the combination of high graphitization degree, favorable surface area and porosity, and nitrogen doping, which effectively stabilize highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Los Alamos National Lab.

It is widely recognized that ion irradiation promotes the formation of defects within a crystalline solid. Among all ion species used for irradiation, protons are expected to create primarily simple Frenkel pair point defects without significantly changing the stoichiometry of the damaged region of the target material. This work investigates the effect of proton irradiation at varying temperatures on the electrochemical properties of anatase TiO2 nanotube (TiO2-NT) electrode for lithium-ion battery applications. Anatase TiO2-NTs are irradiated at both room temperature (25 degrees C) and 250 degrees C and compared with non-irradiated control specimens. Characterization by Raman spectroscopy and XRD suggests that the irradiation at both temperatures does not alter the long-range order of the nanotubes. However, high-resolution TEM reveals that defect clusters are formed upon irradiation and increase in size with increasing temperature. Both irradiated samples exhibit increased capacity and enhanced rate capability compared with the non-irradiated control, which can be explained by increased storage sites as well as improved Li+ diffusivity due to the presence of irradiation-induced defects. This study presents a unique perspective on pathways to engineer functional nanostructured electrode materials by tailoring irradiation conditions.","Springer","","Los Alamos National Lab.

One promising strategy to modify LMR-NMC properties has been the incorporation of spinel-type, local domains to create ""layered- layered-spinel"" cathodes. HoweVer, precise control of local structure and composition, as well as subsequent characterization of such materials, is challenging and elucidating structure-property relationships is not trivial. Therefore, detailed studies of atomic structures within these materials are still critical to their development. Herein, aberration corrected-scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) is utilized to study atomic structures, prior to and subsequent to electrochemical cycling, of LMR-NMC materials having integrated spinel-type components. The results demonstrate that strained grain boundaries with various atomic configurations, including spinel-type structures, can exist. These high energy boundaries appear to induce cracking and promote dissolution of Mn by increasing the contact surface area to electrolyte as well as migration of Ni during cycling, thereby accelerating performance degradation. These results present insights into the important role that local structures can play in the macroscopic degradation of the cathode structures and reiterate the complexity of how synthesis and composition affect structure-electrochemical property relationships of advanced cathode designs.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

"Nature of the “Z”-phase in layered Na-ion battery cathodes","Somerville, James W.; Sobkowiak, Adam; Tapia-Ruiz, Nuria; Billaud, Juliette; Lozano, Juan G.; House, Robert A.; Gallington, Leighanne C.; Ericsson, Tore; Häggström, Lennart; Roberts, Matthew R.; Maitra, Urmimala; Bruce, Peter G.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 37 INORGANIC, ORGANIC, PHYSICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","Layered sodium transition metal oxides with the P2 structure, e.g. Na<sub>2/3</sub>[Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>, are regarded as candidates for Na-ion battery cathodes. On charging, extraction of Na destabilizes the P2 phase (ABBA oxide ion stacking) in which Na<sup>+</sup> is in trigonal prismatic coordination, resulting in layer gliding and formation of an O2 phase (ABAC stacking) with octahedral coordination. However, many related compounds do not exhibit such a simple P2 to O2 transition but rather form a so called “Z”-phase. Substituting Ni by Fe in Na<sub>2/3</sub>[Ni<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>2/3</sub>]O<sub>2</sub> is attractive as it reduces cost. The Fe containing compounds, such as Na<sub>2/3</sub>[Ni<sub>1/6</sub>Mn<sub>1/2</sub>Fe<sub>1/3</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>, form a “Z”-phase when charged above 4.1 V vs. Na<sup>+</sup>/Na. By combining ex situ and operando X-ray diffraction with scanning transmission electron microscopy and simulated diffraction patterns, we demonstrate that the “Z”-phase is most accurately described as a continuously changing intergrowth structure which evolves from P2 to O2 through the OP4 structure as an intermediate. On charging, Na<sup>+</sup> removal results in O-type stacking faults within the P2 structure which increase in proportion. At 50% O-type stacking faults, the ordered OP4 phase forms and on further charging more O-type stacking faults are formed progressing towards a pure O2 structure. This gives the superficial appearance of a solid solution. Furthermore, in contrast to some previous studies, we did not detect Fe migration at any state-of-charge using <sup>57</sup>Fe-Mössbauer spectroscopy. It was, however, found that the Fe-substitution serves to disrupt cation ordering in the material.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, crystalline lithium silicide (LS) with Li<sub>7</sub>Si<sub>3</sub> composition is synthesized to study the direct chemical reactions between the lithiated Si anodes and two typical binders, polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and lithiated polyacrylic acid (LiPAA).

No LiF is detected, however HF release is confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The characterization results are consistent with electrochemical tests, which show the Si electrode using LiPAA as the binder has a much higher cyclability than when compared with PVDF. This work demonstrates the using of LS as an effective approach to evaluate and investigate the reactions between lithiated Si and different cell components, in order to stabilize Si anodes.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Furthermore, we demonstrate a highly soluble (0.6 M) 1,4-dialkoxybenzene redox shuttle molecule that provides overcharge protection over 500 cycles at a C/2 rate and 100% overcharge ratio, which places this additive far ahead of the current state of the art.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Hybrid solid electrolytes containing 15 vol% Al-LLZO demonstrate optimal ionic conductivity properties. Ionic conductivity is shown to decrease at high inorganic loadings. This optimum is most obvious above the melting temperature of polyethylene oxide where the polymer is amorphous. Structural analysis using synchrotron nanotomography reveals that the inorganic particles are highly aggregated. The aggregation size grows with inorganic content and the largest percolating clusters measured for 5 vol%, 15 vol% and 50 vol% were ~12 μm<sup>3</sup>, 206 μm<sup>3</sup>, and 324 μm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Enhanced transport in hybrid electrolytes is shown to be due to polymer|particle (Al-LLZO) interactions and ionic conductivity is directly related to the accessible surface area of the inorganic particles within the electrolyte.

Despite numerous studies on iron and nitrogen codoped carbon (Fe-N-C) catalysts, grand challenges exist due to limited performance and understanding of catalytic mechanisms. This study reports a general strategy to boost electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity of Fe-N-C with the incorporation of S atoms to engineer carbon support structure and electronic properties of active Fe-N sites simultaneously via a copolymer-assisted synthetic approach. The employment of N,S comonomers significantly increases the numbers of micropores and surface area, enabling dense atomic Fe-N and enhanced utilization efficiency. We report the first-principles calculations reveal that S modulation upraises the Fermi energy of Fe 3d and increases charge density on Fe atoms of Fe-N<sub>4</sub>, thereby enhancing intrinsic catalytic reactivity and selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by strengthening the binding interaction between the Fe site and key COOH* intermediate. These integrated structural and electronic merits endow Fe-NS-C with outstanding activity (e.g., CO Faradaic efficiency of 98% at an overpotential of 490 mV) and stability (without deactivation in 30 h), ranking it one of the most active Fe-N-C reported to date. The finding offers an innovative design strategy to enable the design of advanced catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab. (ANL), Argonne, IL (United States).

As a tapping-mode AFM-based technique, EFM probes height, phase, and electrostatic force gradient through two-pass interleave scans, which reveals the direct relationship between membrane surface morphology and connectivity of the ionic domain. The AEMs are diblock copolymers of a polyisoprene (PIp) block and a polystyrenic block containing the phosphonium ion (P(R3P+)MS). Different alignments of cylinders were observed in the bulk and on the surface for AEMs with different ionexchange capacities (IECs) and preparation methods. The impacts of the cylinder alignment on the connectivity of the ionic domain were then investigated by EFM. For AEM 13 with IEC = 0.44 mmol/g and a hexagonal morphology, cylinders aligned parallel to the surface, which led to many disconnected regions observed throughout the membrane.

While lithium plating during fast charging is a known challenge, the full suite of limitations which occur in full cells during a 10 min fast charge are unknown. In the present work the central constraints of extreme fast charging are explored through extensive experiments and analysis in single layer graphite/NMC532 pouch cells. Methods of developing fast-charging protocols considering the impedance and transport limitations are presented and the relative benefits of altering the charging rate, profile, relaxation, etc., are investigated. Analysis during and at the end of cycling identified both known and unexpected aging pathways. The most distinct outcomes from the work are a significant increase in cell-to-cell variability as the number of fast charge cycles increase [up to 11% (1s)] and the identification of distinct aging of the NMC532 positive electrode including cracking of the secondary particles and a trend towards under-lithiation of the positive electrode. While significant aging of the positive electrode was observed, only a few conditions had discernible Li plating and no distinct reversible Li signature was seen during periodic reference performance tests.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

With the hierarchical distribution of Mg/Ti dual dopants in LiNiO2, we report a Co-free layered oxide that exhibits enhanced bulk and surface stability. Ti shows a gradient distribution and is enriched at the surface, whereas Mg distributes homogeneously throughout the primary particles. The resulting Mg/Ti codoped LiNiO2 delivers a material-level specific energy of similar to 780 W h/kg at C/10 with 96% retention after 50 cycles. The specific energy reaches similar to 680 W h/kg at 1C with 77% retention after 300 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg/Ti dual dopants improve the rate capability, thermal stability, and self-discharge resistance of LiNiO2. Our synchrotron X-ray, electron, and electrochemical diagnostics reveal that the Mg/Ti dual dopants mitigate phase transformations, reduce nickel dissolution, and stabilize the cathode-electrolyte interface, thus leading to the favorable battery performance in lithium metal and graphite cells. The present study suggests that engineering the dopant distribution in cathodes may provide an effective path toward lower cost, safer, and higher energy density Co-free lithium batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

The Lithium-ion battery is currently the most widely used solution for energy storage system. However, its high cost is considered as one of the major barriers hampering the integration of renewable energy and the adoption of electric vehicles. Reusing electric vehicle batteries seems a promising solution to the aforementioned problem. Based on a dynamic degradation model of Lithium-ion batteries, this paper first compares the profits that second-life and fresh batteries can bring to the wind farm. Model predictive control is adopted to solve an hourly optimal wind scheduling problem and maximize the profit of wind farm owner. Here, the optimal size of battery is determined and then the comparison of second-life and fresh batteries is conducted taking the battery degradation, the profit of the wind farm owner, and various remaining capacities of battery into account. Two case studies in USA and Denmark are conducted and the analysis shows that given the current prices of wind energy and Lithium-ion batteries, reusing batteries is not worthwhile for the studied wind farms, but it may outperform fresh batteries in the future if the wind energy price decreases much faster than the battery price.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

This phase is formed between 180 and 220 °C, as diamond-like crystals around 10–15 μm in size. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that hydrothermal ε-LiVOPO<sub>4</sub> lattice parameters <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> linearly decrease, while <em>c</em> linearly increases when the synthesis temperature increases. Thermogravimetric analysis with mass spectroscopy reveals 1.5 to 0.5% water loss at about 350 °C for ε-LiVOPO<sub>4</sub> synthesized at 180 and 220 °C, suggesting water or protons incorporation into the structure. Magnetic studies reveal ferrimagnetism in hydrothermal ε-LiVOPO<sub>4</sub> below 10 K, as opposed to antiferromagnetic ordering below 14 K found in samples synthesized at high temperature. In-situ XRD upon heating of the hydrothermal ε-LiVOPO<sub>4</sub> synthesized at 180, 200, and 220 °C reveals that the temperature dependences of their lattice parameters merge at about 500 °C; furthermore, at the same temperature the structure reversibly changes from triclinic to monoclinic. The lattice parameters and the magnetic properties of the hydrothermal samples heated to 750 °C are similar to those of solid-state synthesized ε-LiVOPO<sub>4</sub>.

This study analyzes the cradle-to-gate total energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, SOx, NOx, PM10 emissions, and water consumption associated with current industrial production of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, with the battery life cycle analysis (LCA) module in the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model, which was recently updated with primary data collected from large-scale commercial battery material producers and automotive LIB manufacturers. The results show that active cathode material, aluminum, and energy use for cell production are the major contributors to the energy and environmental impacts of NMC batteries. However, this study also notes that the impacts could change significantly, depending on where in the world the battery is produced, and where the materials are sourced.

These LLZO-based ceramic SSEs are polycrystalline and possess distinct grain-interior/grain-boundary (GI/GB) microstructure. Lithium dendrite growth through these GI and GB domains is considered to be the largest bottleneck preventing their successful implementation. Dendrite growth has been observed to occur predominantly within the GB regions. While this would be expected if the GB regions were more ionically conductive than the GI regions, there is significant disagreement over the relative conductivities of these two regions. The present work demonstrates that dendrite growth can occur preferentially in the GB regions even when the GI regions have higher ionic conductivity. Electrochemical potential changes induced by mechanical stress within the GI and GB domains reveals that the magnitude of effective stress induced current density within the elastically softer GB is larger than in the mechanically stiffer GI, which leads to enhanced lithium deposition in GB and subsequent dendrite growth. Finally, the present work additionally examines the impact of applied current density and grain size on current focusing in the GB regions, and also finds that SSE fractures initiate from the GB regions.","IOP Publishing - The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

In this context, batteries based on multivalent-ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Al<sup>3+</sup>) have developed their own niche with their capability to achieve at least twice the energy density of monovalent-ion systems such as Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Among the multivalent-ion battery candidates, magnesium (Mg) batteries appear to be the most viable choice to eventually replace the Li-ion technology because of the high electrode potential, superior safety, and high abundance of Mg-metal. However, the limited development in electrolytes and cathodes has prevented their commercialization to date. There is a lack of suitable electrolytes that can be used at high voltages required for Mg<sup>2+</sup> insertion into cathode hosts. The limited compatibility of organic electrolytes with Mg-metal anode is also a challenge, which requires extensive studies of the metal/electrolyte interactions. Such studies over the last two decades were critical in developing state-of-the-art Mg electrolytes that possess voltage windows of >4.0 V and simultaneously be compatible with Mg-metal anodes. Here, we present a review on the development of Mg battery electrolytes, challenges that impede their performance, and promising strategies that have been adopted to address them. As a result, we believe that this comprehensive review covering all three categories of Mg electrolytes (liquids, polymers, and solids) would enable researchers to get a quick grasp of the prevailing challenges, and consequently motivate them to develop novel electrolyte candidates.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

The accumulative internal passivation phase and the surface layer over cycling enforce a rate-limiting diffusion barrier for the electron transport, which is responsible for the capacity degradation and poor rate capability.

However, due to their extreme chemical reactivity, no study to date has been capable of definitively proving the basic physical nature of Li dissolution in molten LiCl. In this study, the evolution of the structure of molten LiCl-Li is probed as metallic Li is electrochemically introduced into the melt in situ, using synchrotron radiation experiments based on high energy wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The time-resolved scattering results indicate the formation of transient Cl- ion cages surrounding low-density voids with a periodicity of similar to 8.3 angstrom, which suggests the formation of metastable Li nanocluster. The structure of the LiCl-Li nanoclusters in the solution is modeled using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We report the simulation results are in agreement with the X-ray diffraction measurement and suggest the nanoclusters are predominantly Li-8, along with smaller clusters.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Here we use the interfacial sensitivity of <em>operando</em> X-ray reflectivity to visualize the structural evolution of ultrathin NiO electrodes and their interfaces during conversion. We observe two additional reactions prior to the well-known bulk, three-dimensional conversion occurring at 0.6 V: an accumulation of lithium at the buried metal/oxide interface (at 2.2 V) followed by interfacial lithiation of the buried NiO/Ni interface at the theoretical potential for conversion (at 1.9 V). To understand the mechanisms for bulk and interfacial lithiation, we calculate interfacial energies using density functional theory to build a potential-dependent nucleation model for conversion. These calculations show that the additional space charge layer of lithium is a crucial component for reducing energy barriers for conversion in NiO.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

In this paper, we report a transformative approach using an oxidative chemical vapour deposition technique to build a protective conductive polymer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) skin on layered oxide cathode materials. The ultraconformal poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) skin facilitates the transport of lithium ions and electrons, significantly suppresses the undesired layered to spinel/rock-salt phase transformation and the associated oxygen loss, mitigates intergranular and intragranular mechanical cracking, and effectively stabilizes the cathode-electrolyte interface. This approach remarkably enhances the capacity and thermal stability under high-voltage operation. Building a protective skin at both secondary and primary particle levels of layered oxides offers a promising design strategy for Ni-rich cathodes towards high-energy, long-life and safe lithium-ion batteries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

However, the limited lithium intercalation capacities (less than 200 milliampere-hours per gram) of typical transition-metal-oxide cathodes preclude higher energy densities. Partial or exclusive anionic redox reactions may achieve higher capacity, but at the expense of reversibility. Here we report a halogen conversion-intercalation chemistry in graphite that produces composite electrodes with a capacity of 243 milliampere-hours per gram (for the total weight of the electrode) at an average potential of 4.2 volts versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. Experimental characterization and modelling attribute this high specific capacity to a densely packed stage-I graphite intercalation compound, C<sub>3.5</sub>[Br<sub>0.5</sub>Cl<sub>0.5</sub>], which can form reversibly in water-in-bisalt electrolyte. By coupling this cathode with a passivated graphite anode, we create a 4-volt-class aqueous Li-ion full cell with an energy density of 460 watt-hours per kilogram of total composite electrode and about 100 per cent Coulombic efficiency. Here, this anion conversion-intercalation mechanism combines the high energy densities of the conversion reactions, the excellent reversibility of the intercalation mechanism and the improved safety of aqueous batteries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Unfortunately, they generally show a laggard oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which results in a lethargic charging performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Here porous S-doped Fe-N-C nanosheets are innovatively synthesized utilizing a scalable FeCl<sub>3</sub>-encapsulated-porphyra precursor pyrolysis strategy. The obtained electrocatalyst exhibits ultrahigh ORR activity (<em>E</em><sub>1/2</sub> = 0.84 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and impressive OER performance (<em>E<sub>j=10</sub></em> = 1.64 V). The potential gap (Δ<em>E</em> = <em>E<sub>j=10</sub></em> - <em>E</em><sub>1/2</sub>) is 0.80 V, outperforming that of most highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. Furthermore, the key role of S involved in the atomically dispersed Fe-N<em>x</em> species on the enhanced ORR and OER activities is expounded for the first time by ultrasound-assisted extraction of the exclusive S source (taurine) from porphyra. Moreover, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery comprising this bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits higher power density (225.1 mW cm<sup>-2</sup>) and lower charging-discharging overpotential (1.00 V, 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> compared to Pt/C + RuO<sub>2</sub> catalyst).

While protective oxide coating layers such as LiNbO3 (LNO) have been proposed, its precise working mechanisms are still not fully understood. Existing literature attributes reductions in interfacial impedance growth to the coating's ability to prevent interfacial reactions. However, its true nature is more complex, with cathode interfacial reactions and electrolyte electrochemical decomposition occurring simultaneously, making it difficult to decouple each effect. Herein, we utilized various advanced characterization tools and first-principles calculations to probe the interfacial phenomenon between solid electrolyte Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and high-voltage cathode LiNi0.85Co0.1Al0.05O2 (NCA). We segregated the effects of spontaneous reaction between LPSCl and NCA at the interface and quantified the intrinsic electrochemical decomposition of LPSCl during cell cycling. Both experimental and computational results demonstrated improved thermodynamic stability between NCA and LPSCl after incorporation of the LNO coating. Additionally, we revealed the in situ passivation effect of LPSCl electrochemical decomposition. When combined, both these phenomena occurring at the first charge cycle result in a stabilized interface, enabling long cyclability of all-solid-state batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, to ensure that silicon can be used in EVs, it is necessary to determine whether it can withstand the temperature changes that an EV can experience. For this purpose, we evaluate the electrochemical performance of silicon-graphite (Si-Gr) half-cells at 4 different temperatures and explore the effect of adding fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) to the electrolyte. We observe that cells cycled without FEC are temperature-sensitive; that is, the specific capacity, cyclability, and coulombic efficiency of Si-Gr vary as a function of the temperature applied. Conversely, the presence of FEC in the cell stabilizes the electrochemical behavior of Si-Gr, diminishing its sensitivity to temperature and providing similar reversible capacity, coulombic efficiency, and cycle-life. In this manuscript, we provide an explanation of the reasons causing this phenomenon along with other side effects of temperature, as proved by several characterization techniques.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Quantifying Reaction and Rate Heterogeneity in Battery Electrodes in 3D through Operando X-ray Diffraction Computed Tomography","Liu, Hao; Kazemiabnavi, Saeed; Grenier, Antonin; Vaughan, Gavin; Di Michiel, Marco; Polzin, Bryant J.; Thornton, Katsuyo; Chapman, Karena W.; Chupas, Peter J.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Li-ion batteries; LiFePO4; X-ray diffraction computed tomography; operando; reaction heterogeneity; thick electrode","In composite battery electrode architectures, local limitations in ionic and electronic transport can result in nonuniform energy storage reactions. Understanding such reaction heterogeneity is important to optimizing battery performance, including rate capability and mitigating degradation and failure. Here, we use spatially resolved X-ray diffraction computed tomography to map the reaction in a composite electrode based on the LiFePO4 active material as it undergoes charge and discharge. Accelerated reactions at the electrode faces in contact with either the separator or the current collector demonstrate that both ionic and electronic transport limit the reaction progress. The data quantify how nonuniformity of the electrode reaction leads to variability in the charge/discharge rate, both as a function of time and position within the electrode architecture. Importantly, this local variation in the reaction rate means that the maximum rate that individual cathode particles experience can be substantially higher than the average, control charge/discharge rate, by a factor of at least 2–5 times. This rate heterogeneity may accelerate rate-dependent degradation pathways in regions of the composite electrode experiencing faster-than-average reaction and has important implications for understanding and optimizing rate-dependent battery performance. Benchmarking multiscale continuum model parameters against the observed reaction heterogeneity permits extension of these models to other electrode geometries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

However, lithium dendrites at the interface between anode and separator pose risks of short circuits and fire, impeding the safe application. In contrast to conventional approaches of suppressing dendrites, here we show a deposition-regulating strategy by electrically passivating the top of a porous nickel scaffold and chemically activating the bottom of the scaffold to form conductivity/lithiophilicity gradients, whereby lithium is guided to deposit preferentially at the bottom of the anode, safely away from the separator. The resulting lithium anodes significantly reduce the probability of dendrite-induced short circuits. Crucially, excellent properties are also demonstrated at extremely high capacity (up to 40 mAh cm<sup>–2</sup>), high current density, and/or low temperatures (down to –15 °C), which readily induce dendrite shorts in particular.

In this work, we investigate an inverse case by which the defects generated at the particle surface are continuously pumped into the bulk lattice. We show that, during operation of a rechargeable battery, oxygen vacancies produced at the surfaces of lithium-rich layered cathode particles migrate towards the inside lattice. This process is associated with a high cutoff voltage at which an anionic redox process is activated. First-principle calculations reveal that triggering of this redox process leads to a sharp decrease of both the formation energy of oxygen vacancies and the migration barrier of oxidized oxide ions, therefore enabling the migration of oxygen vacancies into the bulk lattice of the cathode.

The polarization of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries can be rapidly increased by operation under a high rate condition, resulting in the early capacity fade of the cells. Therefore, a well-designed catalyst with a unique structure and excellent catalytic ability is an important way to boost the round-trip performance of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries, especially under high current density. In this work, a unique nanoflower structure assembled with Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanosheets is synthesized by using 2-methylimidazole (2-MIM) as a structural directing agent. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectra reveal abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoflower, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and long round-trip lifetime. Density functional theory results demonstrate that Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> catalyst with oxygen vacancies could promote the wetting of Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on substrate and formation of a Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> nanofilm, thereby boosting the discharge capacity of Li-O<sub>2</sub> batteries.

"Fluoroethylene Carbonate Breakdown Mechanisms and Energetics on Two Lithium Silicide Surfaces","Sprowl, Lynza H.; Árnadóttir, Líney; Chan, Maria K. Y.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Lithium-ion batteries are a leading energy storage technology. One challenge with lithium-ion batteries is the reductive decomposition of electrolyte on the surface, forming a passivating, solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI). The SEI prevents further electrolyte breakdown and consumption, but if not formed properly, may also consume lithium ions and prevent lithium-ion diffusion to the anode. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) is currently one of the best electrolyte additives used to form a more robust SEI on silicon anodes. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the spontaneous breakdown mechanisms, energies, and charge transfers of FEC on the surface of a silicon anode in a lesser lithiated LiSi and a more lithiated Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> state. The reductive decomposition of FEC on LiSi and Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> to F, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>2</sub>CHO is energetically most favorable on both surfaces, but F, CO, and OCH<sub>2</sub>CHO can also be formed. The breakdown of FEC via either of the breakdown mechanisms is about 2 times more favorable on the Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> surface than on the LiSi surface. Lastly, the Bader charge transferred from the anode to the FEC breakdown products is larger when forming F, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>2</sub>CHO than when forming F, CO, and OCH<sub>2</sub>CHO and is also larger on the Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> surface than on the LiSi surface.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, it is shown that an atomically thin layer of reduced graphene oxide can suppress oxygen release from LixCoO<sub>2</sub> particles and improve their structural stability. Electrochemical cycling, differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and in situ heating transmission electron microscopy are performed to characterize the effectiveness of the graphene-coating on the abusive tolerance of LixCoO<sub>2</sub>. Electrochemical cycling mass spectroscopy results suggest that oxygen release is hindered at high cutoff voltage cycling when the cathode is coated with reduced graphene oxide.

However, uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrite results in severe safety and cycling stability concerns, which hinders the application in next generation secondary batteries. In this paper, a new and facile method imposing a magnetic field to lithium metal anodes is proposed. That is, the lithium ions suffering Lorentz force due to the electromagnetic fields are put into spiral motion causing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effect. This MHD effect can effectively promote mass transfer and uniform distribution of lithium ions to suppress the dendrite growth as well as obtain uniform and compact lithium deposition. The results show that the lithium metal electrodes within the magnetic field exhibit excellent cycling and rate performance in a symmetrical battery. Additionally, full batteries using limited lithium metal as anodes and commercial LiFePO<sub>4</sub> as cathodes show improved performance within the magnetic field. In summary, a new and facile strategy of suppressing lithium dendrites using the MHD effect by imposing a magnetic field is proposed, which may be generalized to other advanced alkali metal batteries.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

It is necessary to explore the failure mechanism of such battery materials from the microscopic level in order to understand the evolution of porous structures. In this work, prototyped Sb<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> nanowires are targeted to understand the structural failures during repetitive (de)sodiation, which exhibits mainly alloying and conversion mechanisms. The fast growing nanosized pores embedded in the nanowire during desodiation are identified to be the key factor that weakens the mechanical strength of the material and thus cause a rapid capacity decrease. To suppress the pore development, we further limit the cutoff charge voltage in a half-cell against Na below a critical value where the conversion reaction of such a material system is yet happening, the result of which demonstrates significantly improved battery performance with well-maintained structural integrity. These results may shed some light on electrode failure investigation and rational design of advanced electrode materials with long cycling life.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The significant problem of oxidizing the solid insulating lithium peroxide can greatly be facilitated by incorporating redox mediators that shuttle electron-holes between the porous substrate and lithium peroxide. Redox mediator stability is thus key for energy efficiency, reversibility, and cycle life. However, the gradual deactivation of redox mediators during repeated cycling has not conclusively been explained. Here, we show that organic redox mediators are predominantly decomposed by singlet oxygen that forms during cycling. Their reaction with superoxide, previously assumed to mainly trigger their degradation, peroxide, and dioxygen, is orders of magnitude slower in comparison. The reduced form of the mediator is markedly more reactive towards singlet oxygen than the oxidized form, from which we derive reaction mechanisms supported by density functional theory calculations. Redox mediators must thus be designed for stability against singlet oxygen.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Various aspects, including transition metal dissolution, structural disordering, particle cracking, surface film thickening, etc., have already been investigated in terms of their performance degradation in the battery research community.

In this article, we aim to understand how such high-current regimes affect electrochemical properties of the cells. Formation of Li metal deposits is a recognized hazard of high-rate charging, as Li plating can overtake lithium intercalation in the negative electrode. Here we demonstrate how microprobe Li/Cu reference electrodes can be used to characterize the graphite anode and layered oxide (NCM523) cathode during constant-current (≤ 6C) voltage-limited (4.39 V) charging of Li-ion cells. These reference electrodes are used to monitor the onset of Li plating conditions in situ during cell charging. As the current increases over 3C, the anode potentials decrease below -40 mV causing lithium nucleation. Surprisingly, this nucleation (at least, initially) does not result in capacity fade or a higher anode impedance even in strongly polarized cells, so it appears that the nascent Li nuclei are isolated from electrolyte by the pre-existing solid electrolyte interphase. Our study shows that microprobe reference electrodes are an important diagnostic tool to characterize full-cell behavior in the high-current regimes.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

In an attempt to further that understanding, we constructed a two-compartment lithium-ion cell using a solid-state lithium-ion conductor as the separator to block the movement of species generated at one electrode to the other. After a long-term hold at a high voltage, the electrolytes extracted from each side were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We compared these results with those from a coin cell made with a regular porous separator. Extra species were present in the coin cell, which were absent in both compartments of the two-compartment cell, and we identified them as cross-talk species. We propose chemical structures for such species and show that these species likely have carbon carbon double bonds and fluorinated carbons.

Yet, the practical application of Li-S batteries has been hindered by technical obstacles arising from the polysulfide shuttle effect and poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and discharge products. Therefore, it is of critical significance for understanding the underlying reaction mechanism of Li-S batteries to circumvent these problems and improve the overall battery performance. Advanced characterization techniques, especially synchrotron-based X-ray techniques, have been widely applied to the mechanistic understanding of Li-S batteries. Specifically, in situ/operando synchrotron-based techniques allows chemical and structural evolution to be directly observed under real operation conditions. Here, current progress in the understanding of the operating principles of Li-S batteries based on in situ/operando synchrotron-based techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray microscopy, is reviewed. The aim of this progress report is to provide a comprehensive treatise on in situ/operando synchrotron-based techniques for mechanism understanding of Li-S batteries, and thereby provide guidance for optimizing their overall electrochemical performances.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Because of the lower amount of redox-active transition metal, a substantial part of the charge transfer must occur via less reversible oxygen redox. Fluorination can be used to minimize this dependence on oxygen redox by increasing the amount of low-valent transition metal in the compound, but it adds complexity to materials design. Here, we investigate the feasibility of using computationally constructed phase diagrams to facilitate the search for optimal oxyfluorides. We use the phase diagram of LiF-Li<sub>3</sub>NbO<sub>4</sub>-NiO to identify Li<sub>1.13</sub>Ni<sub>0.57</sub>Nb<sub>0.3</sub>O<sub>1.75</sub>F<sub>0.25</sub> and Li<sub>1.19</sub>Ni<sub>0.59</sub>Nb<sub>0.22</sub>O<sub>1.46</sub>F<sub>0.54</sub> as two promising compositions and demonstrate that they can be successfully synthesized. These compounds exhibit significantly reduced hysteresis and higher energy density than the previously reported Li<sub>1.3</sub>Ni<sub>0.27</sub>Nb<sub>0.43</sub>O<sub>2</sub> compound in this space. Although we generally attribute the improved performance to the increased Ni content enabled by fluorination, a more nuanced relation between fluorination and the cycling behavior is revealed through electrochemical tests, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory. We find that fluorination increases the voltage, improves cycle life, but reduces the accessibility of Ni redox. Consideration of these effects will facilitate the future design of optimized disordered-rocksalt oxyfluoride cathodes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

All these morphological features are determined during the cathode synthesis process, which consists of two steps, (i) coprecipitation and (ii) calcination. Transition metal hydroxide precursors are synthesized during the coprecipitation process, whereas their oxidation and lithiation occur during calcination. The size and size distribution of crystalline primary and aggregated secondary particles and their internal porosity are determined during coprecipitation. Operating conditions of the chemical reactor, such as solution pH, ammonia concentration, and stirring speed control the final morphological features. Here, a multiscale computational model has been developed to capture the nucleation and growth of crystalline primary particles and their aggregation into secondary transition metal hydroxide precursor particles. The simulations indicate that increasing solution pH and decreasing ammonia concentration lead to smaller sizes of the secondary particles. Finally, a phase map has been developed that can help identify the synthesis conditions needed for a specified particle size and size distribution.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

To efficiently design functional electrolytes for lithium batteries, it is particularly important to understand the relative solvating ability of each individual organic solvent, because most of the electrolyte systems are comprised of two or more electrolyte solvents. Using a newly developed internally referenced diffusion-ordered spectroscopy technique and diffusion coefficient–coordination ratio ($D–α$) analysis, we successfully constructed a solvating power series for common electrolyte solvents. We demonstrated the usefulness of this solvating power series in designing more reliable electrolyte system by selecting an appropriate fluorinated electrolyte solvent for a high-voltage lithium metal battery (LMB) as an example. For a methyl(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)carbonate-based electrolyte, we identified fluoroethylene carbonate as a more desirable cyclic carbonate co-solvent than difluoroethylene carbonate for LMB due to its significantly higher ability to solvate lithium ions.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, several molecular precursors have been synthesized, and the topology and energetics of secondary anions were correlated with their cycling performance. Regardless of their structural motif, all such additives demonstrated improved electrochemical performance by reducing initial cathode impedance and lowering the rate of capacity fade compared to the baseline electrolyte.

When continually exposed to such high potentials, these materials gradually deteriorate unless protected by sacrificial agents called electrolyte additives. During the formation cycles, these electrolyte additives decompose on the electrodes forming thin protective layers of insoluble products impeding further deleterious reactions. Some of these electrolyte additives spontaneously react when introduced into the electrolyte to yield specific surface-modifying products that alone protect the cathode; in other words, the nominal additive is the precursor and the secondary product is the protective agent. Guided by this insight, we used molecular engineering to obtain such surface-active secondary products in situ with 100% yield. Two of these electrolyte additives proved exceptional in that they delay both the impedance rise and capacity fade in the Li-ion cells. We demonstrate this protective action and scrutinize the activation of these additives in the electrolyte. As a result, by “taming” spontaneous reactions and regaining full control over the chemical structure, new avenues open to targeted synthesis of electrolyte additives extending the operation of high voltage Li-ion batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, polypyrrole-encapsulated amorphous Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> hollow spheres are prepared by the sulfuration of Bi–glycol spheres with a polypyrrole (PPy) coating. Benefiting from the unique hollow structure (Kirkendall effect) and the excellent conductivity and flexibility of the PPy coating, this material can be applied in both SIBs and Li–S batteries. For SIBs, the unconductive amorphous Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is electrochemically reduced to conductive metallic Bi, leading to a Bi–PPy core–shell structure. The resulting Bi acts as the main active material while the PPy coating accommodates the volume variation of Bi during sodiation/desodiation. For Li–S batteries, the outer double layer structure effectively prevents the dissolution and “shuttle effect” of polysulfides by physically containing and chemically adsorbing polysulfides, and tolerates the volume expansion of sulfur. Meanwhile, the residual polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the preparation process is chemically bonded with sulfur and exhibits the electrochemical properties, and results in additional discharging/charging capacity. Hence, this multifunctional electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling life in SIBs and Li–S batteries.

In this study, graphene oxide is used as a template to in situ synthesize burr globule–like FeSe<sub>2</sub>/graphene hybrid (B–FeSe<sub>2</sub>/G) using a facile one–step hydrothermal method. Structural characterization demonstrates that graphene layers not only wrap the surfaces of FeSe<sub>2</sub> particles, but also stretch into the interior of these particles, as a result of which the unique nano–microsphere structure is successfully established. When serving as anode material for Na–ion batteries, B–FeSe<sub>2</sub>/G hybrid displays high electrochemical performance in the voltage range of 0.5–2.9 V. The B–FeSe<sub>2</sub>/G hybrid has high reversible capacity of 521.6 mAh·g<sup>–1</sup> at 1.0 A g<sup>–1</sup>. Meanwhile, after 400 cycles, high discharge capacity of 496.3 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> is obtained at a rate of 2.5 A g<sup>–1</sup>, with a high columbic efficiency of 96.6% and less than 1.0% loss of discharge capacity. Even at the ultrahigh rate of 10 A g<sup>–1</sup>, a specific capacity of 316.8 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> can be achieved. Furthermore, kinetic analyses reveal that the excellent performance of the B–FeSe<sub>2</sub>/G hybrid is largely attributed to the high pseudocapacitive contribution induced by the special nano–micro structure.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Nanosized tungsten carbide particles dispersed on the carbonaceous support are prepared from the pyrolysis of phosphotungstic acid-functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that they not only have strong affinity toward polysulfide intermediates, but also significantly accelerate the reduction of low-order polysulfides that is otherwise kinetically challenged.

"Insights from incorporating reference electrodes in symmetric lithium-ion cells with layered oxide or graphite electrodes","Kalaga, Kaushik; Rodrigues, Marco-Tulio F.; Bareño, Javier; Shkrob, Ilya A.; Abraham, Daniel P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; calendar-aging; capacity gain; electrolyte oxidation; impedance rise; potential slide","Symmetric cells provide complementary means to probe electrochemical processes in lithium-ion batteries. Here, positive and negative electrodes harvested from conventional oxide/graphite cells are cross-paired, and the assembled reference-electrode-bearing symmetric cells are cycled/aged. For graphite symmetric cells, the electrode potentials and impedances remain nearly constant during calendar aging and the parasitic currents are typically small. However, at higher cell voltages when the “positive” graphite potential exceeds 1.0 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, the capacity loss is higher, indicating that even a mild (but prolonged) overdischarge can damage the SEI. For the layered-oxide symmetric cells there are strong parasitic currents and a persistent slide of the electrode potential over time during calendar aging. Significant cell impedance rise, especially at higher hold voltages, is also observed. Curiously, the impedance rise in the “negative” oxide electrode, which experiences potentials below 4.0 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>, is greater than in the “positive” oxide electrode that experiences much higher potentials. We postulate that electrolyte oxidation is responsible for the behavior of these oxide symmetric cells, as it supplies electrons (that bind more Li<sup>+</sup> into the cathode, causing the potential slide) and protons (that contribute to impedance rise). Furthermore, these insights can guide the development of future lithium-ion cell chemistries.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

"Deviations from Vegard's law and evolution of the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt-based nanoalloys inside fuel cells by <i>in operando</i> X-ray spectroscopy and total scattering","Petkov, Valeri; Maswadeh, Yazan; Vargas, Jorge A.; Shan, Shiyao; Kareem, Haval; Wu, Zhi-Peng; Luo, Jin; Zhong, Chuan-Jian; Shastri, Sarvjit; Kenesei, Peter","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Catalysts for energy related applications, in particular metallic nanoalloys, readily undergo atomic-level changes during electrochemical reactions. The origin, dynamics and implications of the changes for the catalysts’ activity inside fuel cells though are not well understood. This is largely because they are studied on model nanoalloy structures under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we use combined synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy and total scattering to study the dynamic behaviour of nanoalloys of Pt with 3d-transition metals as they function at the cathode of an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Results show that the composition and atomic structure of the nanoalloys change profoundly, from the initial state to the active form and further along the cell operation. The electrocatalytic activity of the nanoalloys also changes. The rate and magnitude of the changes may be rationalized when the limits of traditional relationships used to connect the composition and structure of nanoalloys with their electrocatalytic activity and stability, such as Vegard's law, are recognized. In particular, deviations from the law inherent for Pt-3d metal nanoalloys can well explain their behaviour under operating conditions. Moreover, it appears that factors behind the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of Pt-3d metal nanoalloys, such as the large surface to unit volume ratio and “size misfit” of the constituent Pt and 3d-transition metal atoms, also contribute to their instability inside fuel cells. The new insight into the atomic-level evolution of nanoalloy electrocatalysts during their lifetime is likely to inspire new efforts to stabilize transient structure states beneficial to their activity and stability under operating conditions, if not synthesize them directly.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

While remarkable progress has been seen in the development of binders, improved cycling performance is still needed to fully enable Si anodes. Achieving that end requires in turn a better understanding of the relationship between binder properties and cell cycling performance. Here, we describe a novel polymer binder, poly(4-vinylbenzoic acid) (P4VBA), developed by re-engineering the widely used poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) binder to explore that relationship. The modified structure produces a binder that is more compatible with 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) slurries and affords much improved cycling performance of the fabricated cells. Compared with PAA binders, P4VBA provides higher initial and average capacities and better capacity retention. While P4VBA offers an interesting alternative to wet processing of the Si-based electrodes, this re-engineered binder is an initial effort to develop a better binder material by exploring the relationship between binder and cell cycling performance.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

C-TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance than A-TiO<sub>2</sub> in terms of rate capability and cycle life. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis suggests reversible Na ion insertion/extraction in C-TiO<sub>2</sub>. However, such process is irreversible in the case of A-TiO<sub>2</sub>. The charge storage mechanisms in both samples were studied to show that diffusion-controlled intercalation process becomes significant in C-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample. The C-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample has a better Na<sup>+</sup> diffusivity measured through the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) compared to A-TiO<sub>2</sub>, which corroborates well with the rate capability study. Furthermore, the evolution of local structure of the TiO<sub>2</sub> samples was analyzed by ex situ pair distribution function (PDF) to understand the variation in electrochemical properties. In conclusion, it reveals that the corner-shared Ti-Ti distance along Na ion diffusion pathway increases with the increase of crystallinity, leading to the expanded diffusion channels and therefore more active sites and faster diffusion.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Strategically improving catalyst durability requires better understanding of the relationship between degradation mechanisms and catalyst structure. To investigate the effects of the carbon support morphology, we compare the electrochemical performance and durability of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using Pt and PtCox catalysts with a range of porous, solid, and intermediate carbon supports (HSC, Vulcan, and acetylene black). We find that electrochemical surface area (ECSA) retention after a catalyst-targeted durability test tends to improve with increasing support porosity. Using electron microscopy, we investigate microstructural changes in the catalysts and reveal the underlying degradation mechanisms in MEA specimens. Pt migration to the membrane and catalyst coarsening, measured microscopically, together were quantitatively consistent with the ECSA loss, indicating that these were the only two significant degradation pathways. Changes in catalyst particle size, morphology, and PtCo core-shell structure indicate that Ostwald ripening is a significant coarsening mechanism for catalysts on all carbons, while particle coalescence is only significant on the more solid carbon supports. Porous carbon supports thus appear to protect against particle coalescence, providing an effective strategy for mitigating catalyst coarsening.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

This success is the result of intense collaboration between academia and industry over the past several decades, culminating with the advent of and improvements in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. As applications become more demanding, there is the risk that stunted growth in the performance of commercial batteries will slow the adoption of important technologies such as electric vehicles. Yet the scientific literature includes many reports describing material designs with allegedly superior performance. A considerable gap needs to be filled if we wish these laboratory-based achievements to reach commercialization. In this Perspective, we discuss some of the most relevant testing parameters that are often overlooked in academic literature but are critical for practical applicability outside the laboratory. We explain metrics such as anode energy density, voltage hysteresis, mass of non-active cell components and anode/cathode mass ratio, and we make recommendations for future reporting. We hope that this Perspective, together with other similar guiding principles that have recently started to emerge, will aid the transition from lab-scale research to next-generation practical batteries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

However, modeling studies predict steep Li<sup>+</sup> ion gradients in the electrodes during cycling at the higher currents. Such gradients introduce heterogeneities in the electrodes, which make it difficult to predict cell lifetimes as different portions of the cell age at different rates. There is a dearth of experimental methods to probe these concentration gradients across the depth of the electrode. Here we use spatially resolved energy dispersive X-ray diffraction to obtain a “movie” of lithiation and delithiation in different sections of the cell and quantify lithium gradients that develop in a porous graphite electrode during cycling at a 1C rate. Inhomogeneity in the total Li content, and in the individual ordered Li<sub><em>x</em></sub>C<sub>6</sub> phases formed during lithium insertion into (and extraction from) the graphite, has been observed in an <em>operando</em> fashion. The complex dynamics of lithium-staging in graphite with the distinct front propagation of phase changes have been characterized and new features of these dynamics are highlighted here. As large Li<sup>+</sup> ion gradients contribute to cell polarization, our results suggest that Li plating conditions can be met near the graphite electrode surface, even when the cell is charged at a moderate (1C) rate.","Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)","","Argonne National Lab.

In this report, we propose that improving the reversibility of H2-H3 phase transition for Ni-rich materials is effective to tackle this challenge. It has been confirmed that the generation of microcracks and structural transformations have been suppressed since the H2-H3 phase transition becomes reversible, while which shows little effect on capacity delivery. Consequently, using Ni-rich LiNi<sub>0.9</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the cathode material, the 100<sup>th</sup> capacity retention cycling at 38mAg<sup>-1</sup> has been improved remarkably from 69.7% to 97.9% by adopting this strategy. Hence, it should be a novel solution to realize both high capacity and stable cyclability for the Ni-rich cathodes.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

When used, the carboxyl (-CO2H) groups of PAA can be partially lithiated (known as pre-lithiation treatment), which is believed to facilitates lamination process, especially for production on a large scale. However, such treatment impacts numerous physico-chemical properties of the PAA binder that affect the cycling performance of the electrode. Here we seek to quantify the pre-lithiation treatment effect on Li-ion cells containing Si-graphite composite electrodes. The electrochemical cycling results indicated that such pre-lithiation treatment of PAA can undermine the cycling performance, as more capacity loss was observed when pre-lithitated PAA binders were used. On the other hand, the same pre-lithiation practice is indeed beneficial for the lamination process, as it increases the viscosity of aqueous slurries at low shear rates (slows down sedimentation) and prompts the shear thinning (so that the slurries can be more easily mixed). Thus, there is an uneasy balance between the electrochemical performance that suffers from the pre-lithiation of PAA and the quality of slurry processing which benefits from the same practice. An alternative approach to slurry treatment would be desired to achieve better cycling performance without undermining the stability of slurry suspensions.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Regardless of substitution group, all phosphates showed slightly higher CE than the additive-free electrolyte (baseline), although no additive significantly decreases oxidation reactions over the course of the potentiostatic hold. Post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the cathodes indicates that the additive with trimethylsilyl group leads to significantly higher incidence of oxygen and phosphorus on the cathode surface for both phosphites and phosphates. Atomistic simulations indicate the susceptibility of these additives to electrochemical and chemical oxidation, showing chemical oxidation to be much more likely with the phosphite additives. Lastly, the identity of the ligands on the phosphorus-containing additive can dramatically affect both the decomposition current as well as cathode surface after the potentiostatic hold.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4 V versus Li/Li<sup>+</sup> in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li<sub>2-x</sub>Ir<sub>1-y</sub>Sn<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3</sub> model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure-redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8 Å metal-oxygen π bonds and approximately 1.4 Å O-O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li<sub>2-x</sub>Ir<sub>1-y</sub>Sn<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3</sub> through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry.","Springer Nature - Nature Publishing Group","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

"A comparison of methodologies for the non-invasive characterisation of commercial Li-ion cells","Barai, Anup; Uddin, Kotub; Dubarry, Matthieu; Somerville, Limhi; McGordon, Andrew; Jennings, Paul; Bloom, Ira","25 ENERGY STORAGE; EIS; GITT; battery testing; differential voltage; incremental capacity; internal resistance","Lithium-ion cells currently power almost all electronic devices and power tools; they are a key enabling technology for electric vehicles and are increasingly considered to be the technology of choice for grid storage. In line with this increased applicability, there is furthemore an increase in the development of new commercial lithium-ion cell technologies that incorporate innovative functional components (electrode material compositions and electrolyte formulations) and designs, leading to a diverse range of performance characteristics. The uniqueness of each technology in-turn gives rise to unique evolutions of cell performance as the cell degrades because of usage. Non-destructively measuring and subsequently tracking the evolution of lithium-ion cell characteristics is valuable for both industrial engineers and academic researchers. To proceed in this regard, stakeholders have often devised their own procedures for characterising lithium-ion cells, typically without considering unification, comparability or compatibility. This makes the comparison of technologies difficult. This comprehensive review for the first time has analysed and discusses the various international standards and regulations for the characterisation and electrical testing of lithium-ion cells, specifically for high-power automotive and grid applications.

Improving the chemical/electrochemical stability of the cathode electrolyte interface has been the major technical focus to enable this class of cathode materials. Here, LiCoO<sub>2</sub> is adopted as the model cathode material to investigate the active sites for parasitic reactions between the delithiated cathode and the non-aqueous electrolyte. Both ab initio calculations and experimental results clearly show that the partially coordinated transition metal atoms at the surface is responsible for the parasitic reactions at the cathode electrolyte interface.

Although protective coatings positively affect LMO cycle life, much remains to be understood regarding the interface formed between these coatings and LMO. Using operando powder X–ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement, it is shown that, in comparison to bare LMO, the lattice parameter of a model Au–coated LMO cathode is significantly reduced upon relithiation. Less charge passes through Au–coated LMO in comparison to bare LMO, suggesting that the reduced lattice parameter is associated with decreased Li<sup>+</sup> solubility in the Au–coated LMO. Density functional theory calculations show that a more Li<sup>+</sup>–deficient near–surface is thermodynamically favorable in the presence of the Au coating, which may further stabilize these cathodes through suppressing formation of the Jahn–Teller distorted Li<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phase at the surface. Electronic structure and chemical bonding analyses show enhanced hybridization between Au and LMO for delithiated surfaces leading to partial oxidation of Au upon delithiation. Furthermore, this study suggests that, in addition to transition metal dissolution from electrode surfaces, protective coating design must also balance potential energy effects induced by charge transfer at the electrode–coating interface.","Wiley-VCH","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Despite numerous experimental and theoretical attempts to unravel the mechanism of oxygen redox behavior, the electronic origin of oxygen activities in energy storage of Li-rich LIB materials remains under intense debate. In this work, the onset of oxygen activity was examined using a Li-rich material that has been reported to exhibit oxygen redox, namely, Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>. By comparing experimental measurements and first-principles Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations of oxygen K-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), it was found that experimentally-observed changes in XAS originate from the non-bonding oxygen states in cation-disordered delithiated Li<sub>5</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>, and the spectral features of oxygen dimers were also determined. This combined experimental and theoretical study offers an effective approach to disentangle the intertwined signals in XAS and can be further utilized in broader contexts for characterizing other energy storage and conversion materials.","American Chemical Society","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Recently, colloidal chemistry methods have enabled the design of core–shell nanocrystals of Li<sub>1+x</sub>Mn<sub>2–x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, an important battery cathode, with passivating shells rich in Al<sup>3+</sup> through a colloidal synthetic route. These heterostructures combine the presence of redox-inactive ions on the surface to minimize undesired reactions, with the coverage of each individual particle in an epitaxial manner. Although they improve electrode performance, the exact chemistry and structure of the shell as well as the precise effect of the ratio between the shell and the active core remain to be elucidated. Correlation of these parameters to electrode properties would serve to tailor the heterostructure design toward complete shutdown of undesired reactions. These knowledge gaps are the target here. Li<sub>1+x</sub>Mn<sub>2–x</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocrystals with Al<sup>3+</sup>-rich shells of different thicknesses were synthesized. Multimodal characterization comprehensively revealed the elemental distribution, electronic state, and crystallinity in the heterostructures, which confirmed the potential of this approach to finely tune passivating layers. All of the modified nanocrystals improved the capacity retention while retaining charge storage compared to the bare counterpart, even under harsh conditions.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

These advantages allow them to be smaller and lighter than other conventional rechargeable batteries such as lead–acid batteries, nickel–cadmium batteries (Ni–Cd) and nickel–metal hydride batteries (Ni–MH). Modern EVs, however, still suffer from performance barriers (range, charging rate, lifetime, etc.) and technological barriers (high cost, safety, reliability, etc.), limiting their widespread adoption. Given these facts, this review sets the extensive market penetration of LIB-powered EVs as an ultimate objective and then discusses recent advances and challenges of electric automobiles, mainly focusing on critical element resources, present and future EV markets, and the cost and performance of LIBs. Finally, novel battery chemistries and technologies including high-energy electrode materials and all-solid-state batteries are also evaluated for their potential capabilities in next-generation long-range EVs.","Springer Nature","","Argonne National Lab.

Accuracy of the model is evaluated by benchmarking it with micro-scale tomographic observations of liquid water in DM at different inlet pressures. Application of the model to nano-scale morphology of the micro porous layer (MPL) shows that cracks in MPL facilitate water management by keeping nano-pores dry. Simulations in macro-scale morphology of DM indicate that liquid water saturation is approximately two-times higher in DM without an MPL. This is shown to be a consequence of water accumulation in the middle-lower height of the DM in the absence of an MPL which is demonstrated to limit the water intrusion into DM. Simulation of the land-channel configuration shows water accumulation predominantly under the land of DM with an MPL whereas considerable amount of water is also observed under the channel without an MPL. Additionally, we performed direct reactant transport simulations showing that MPL facilitates significantly better O<sub>2</sub> transport in wet DM (~ two-times higher formation factor in land-channel configuration) but it induces slightly less facile O<sub>2</sub> transport in dry DM (12% lower formation factor).","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

In this Communication, the lithiation and delithiation in the Si and Gr particles in a 15 wt% Si composite electrode is quantified for each component using energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. This quantification is important as the components cycle in different potential regimes, and interpretation of cycling behavior is complicated by the potential hysteresis displayed by Si. The lithiation begins with Li alloying with Si; lithiation of Gr occurs at later stages when the potential dips below 0.2 V (all potentials are given vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). In the 0.2 – 0.01 V range, the relative lithiation of Si and Gr is ~58% and 42%, respectively. During delithiation, Li<sup>+</sup> ion extraction occurs preferentially from Gr in the 0.01 – 0.23 V range and from Si in the 0.23 – 1.0 V range; that is, the delithiation current is carried sequentially, first by graphite and then by silicon. Furthermore, these trends can be used for rational selection of electrochemical cycling windows that limits volumetric expansion in Si particles, thereby extending cell life.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

C.; Kalaga, Kaushik; Shkrob, Ilya A.; Abraham, Daniel P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; fast charge; graphite; lithium plating; Raman spectroscopy; SERS","Rapid charging of lithium-ion batteries being developed for electric vehicles is a formidable challenge. Electrochemical polarization of cells during fast charging favors deposition of metallic Li onto the surface of the graphite electrode, and this Li plating compromises safety and accelerates performance degradation. Observing the onset of Li nucleation is essential for elucidation of mechanisms and defining conditions favoring this Li plating, but presently available methods are not sufficiently sensitive and selective while also allowing satisfactory spatial resolution. We demonstrate the use of Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive means to identify Li nucleation and map Li deposition. Metallic Li is detected indirectly by probing the vibrations in an acetylide species (represented as Li—C≡C—X) that is formed on the exposed surface of Li nuclei in contact with the solid electrolyte interphase on graphite. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) involving this species on Li nuclei appears to dramatically increase sensitivity and selectivity of this detection, making our method an excellent complement to the existing spectroscopy and microscopy approaches for determining Li deposition.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Quantification of their electrochemical stability is important for choosing between different battery chemistries. Ad hoc performance metrics such as cycle numbers have been used to guide materials discovery, but it is unclear whether such metrics are suitable for the intended use. Here, we suggest a kinetic model allowing a narrower definition of cyclability by interpreting it through intrinsic parameters. Using this model, we examine systematic data on cycling and calendar stabilities for dialkoxyarene ROMs in stationary cells. Even for these closely related ROMs, the cycling numbers strongly depend on minor changes in test protocols and structure, which argue against the universality and transferability of these commonly used metrics. Recommendations regarding the standardization of testing protocols are suggested in light of these findings.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The presence of native vacancies endows this material with attractive properties including high structural flexibility and stability upon Na-ion extraction and insertion and high reversibility of oxygen redox reaction. Synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the charge compensation is dominated by the oxygen redox reaction and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox reaction separately.

Work presented here applies Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscopy with Energy Loss Spectroscopy and diffraction method to investigate the cathode electrolyte interface for a spinel MgCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> material electrochemically cycled in the presence of a non-aqueous, low water content Mg electrolyte.

Accelerating the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur cathode and suppressing the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle are crucial for the high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we prepared the catalytic palladium nano-particles (Pd NPs) imbedded in hollow carbon spheres (Pd@HCS) as sulfur host by a sacrificial template method. Benefitting from the hollow nanostructure and strong chemisorption ability of Pd NPs, Pd@HCS can effectively mitigate the LiPS shuttling via physical and chemical pathways. Furthermore, the Pd NPs as one electrocatalyst can accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of LiPS. The theoretical calculation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate that the moderate Pd-S bonding between Pd NPs and sulfur species are beneficial to LiPS conversion.

Current challenges for achieving high-performance all-solid-state batteries with long cycle life include shorting resulting predominantly from Li dendrite formation and infiltration through the solid electrolyte (SE) and increases in cell impedance induced by SE decomposition at the SE/electrode interface. In this work, we evaluate the electrochemical properties of two interlayer materials, Si and Li<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>(2-x/3)</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (LiAlO), at the Li<sub>7</sub>P<sub>3</sub>S<sub>11</sub> (LPS)/Li interface. Compared to the Li/LPS/Li symmetric cells in absence of interlayers, the presence of Si and LiAlO both significantly enhance the cycle number and total charge passing through the interface before failures resulting from cell shorting. In both cases, the noted improvements were accompanied by cell impedances that had increased substantially. The data reveal that both interlayers prevent the direct exposure of LPS to the metallic Li and therefore eliminate the intrinsic LPS decomposition that occurs at Li surfaces before electrochemical cycling. After cycling, a reduction of LPS to Li<sub>2</sub>S occurs at the interface when a Si interlayer is present; LiAlO, which functions to drop the potential between Li and LPS, suppresses LPS decomposition processes. The relative propensities toward SE decomposition follows from the electrochemical potentials at the interface, which are dictated by the identities of the interlayer materials. As a result, this work provides new insights into the phase dynamics associated with specific choices for SE/electrode interlayer materials and the requirements they impose for realizing high efficiency, long lasting all-solid-state batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

Herein, a quasi-solid-state flexible fiber-shaped Li–CO<sub>2</sub> battery with low overpotential and high energy efficiency, by employing ultrafine Mo<sub>2</sub>C nanoparticles anchored on a carbon nanotube (CNT) cloth freestanding hybrid film as the cathode, is demonstrated. Due to the synergistic effects of the CNT substrate and Mo<sub>2</sub>C catalyst, it achieves a low charge potential below 3.4 V, a high energy efficiency of approximate to 80%, and can be reversibly discharged and charged for 40 cycles. Experimental results and theoretical simulation show that the intermediate discharge product Li<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> stabilized by Mo<sub>2</sub>C via coordinative electrons transfer should be responsible for the reduction of overpotential. Here, the as-fabricated quasi-solid-state flexible fiber-shaped Li–CO<sub>2</sub> battery can also keep working normally even under various deformation conditions, giving it great potential of becoming an advanced energy accessory for wearable electronics.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Hierarchical micro/nano construction with preferred orientation growth can shorten ion diffusion pathway and facilitate electron transportation without inducing side reactions. FeF<sub>3</sub>·0.33H<sub>2</sub>O hierarchical microspheres self-assembled by octagonal single crystal slices are prepared. Benefiting from the artful structure, SAED and XRD characterizations confirm that the octagonal single crystal slices provides more lithium ions intercalation positions (4c sites). Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the well designed FeF<sub>3</sub>·0.33H<sub>2</sub>O single crystal (FFH-S) delivers 30 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> higher capacity (172 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1C) than the common FeF<sub>3</sub>·0.33H<sub>2</sub>O polycrystal (FFH-P). In-situ XRD combined with theoretic calculation elucidate the difference in lithium storage capacity. Instructive argument that single crystal octagon slices with [110] oriented growth provide more active sites for lithium ions intercalation contributes to the preparation of high performance iron fluoride cathode materials for rechargeable battery.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

However, problematic dendrite formation and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) greatly limit its practical application. Carbonate electrolyte solvents are still indispensable for the operation of LMBs using a transition metal oxide cathode. We determined the impact of different cyclic carbonates, which actively participate in the formation of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI), on the stable cycling of LMBs using a nickel-rich layered cathode LiN<sub>i0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC622). The substitution of fluorine atoms in the cyclic carbonate profoundly enhances the stability of the lithium metal anode while fluoroalkyl and alkoxy substituents are detrimental. Cyclic carbonate trans-difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) was identified as a novel SEI enabler on the lithium metal anode, facilitating the formation of a protective SEI with relatively high lithium fluoride content. A Li/NMC622 cell utilizing DFEC electrolyte solvent as SEI enabler displayed a capacity retention larger than 82% after 400 cycles and an average CE of 99.95%. In contrast, the cycling retention after 400 cycles for a Li/NMC622 cell using monofluoroethylene carbonate was only 31% with an average CE of 99.73 %. Other fluoroalkyl or alkoxy cyclic carbonates do not provide improved stabilization of the lithium metal anode over ethylene carbonate. The fundamental studies in this work provide critical insight for the further development of advanced electrolytes in LMBs","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Considerable effort has been put in the understanding of its formation and electrochemistry under realistic battery conditions, but mechanistic insights have been inferred mostly indirectly. Here we show the formation of the SEI between a graphite anode and a carbonate electrolyte using combined atomic scale microscopy and in-situ and operando techniques. In particular, we weigh the graphitic anode during its initial lithiation process with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, which unequivocally identifies lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium alkylcarbonates as the main chemical components at different potentials. In-situ gas analysis confirmed the preferential reduction of cyclic over acyclic carbonate molecules, making its reduction product the major component in SEI. We find that SEI formation starts at graphite edge-sites with dimerization of solvated Li<sup>+</sup>-intercalation between graphite-layers.

Very recently, a layered sodium cathode Na<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (or Na<sub>4/7</sub>Mn<sub>6/7</sub><sub>1/7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is vacancy) was reported to have reversible lattice oxygen redox with much suppressed voltage hysteresis. However, the structural and electronic structural origin of this small voltage hysteresis has not been well understood. In this article, through systematic studies using ex situ/in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate that the exceptional small voltage hysteresis (< 50mV) between charge and discharge curves is rooted in the well-maintained oxygen stacking sequence in the absence of irreversible gliding of oxygen layers and cation migration from the transition metal (TM) layers. In addition, we further identify that the 4.2 V charge/discharge plateau is associated with a zero-strain (de)intercalation process of Na<sup>+</sup> ions from distorted octahedral sites, while the 4.5 V plateau is linked to a reversible shrink/expansion process of the manganese-site vacancy during (de)intercalation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions at distorted prismatic sites. As a result, it is expected these findings will inspire further exploration of new cathode materials that can achieve both high energy density and efficiency by using lattice anionic redox.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Oak Ridge National Lab.

However, the cycling stability and rate ca-pability at high voltages (> 4.0V) of these materials remains an issue. In this work, we successfully synthesized a Li-substituted layered-tunneled (O3-spinel) intergrowth cathode (LS-NFM) to address these issues. The remarkable structural compatibility and connectivity of the two phases were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), selected area electron diffrac-tion (SAED) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). LS-NFM electrode reached a discharge capaci-ty of 96 mAh g-1 with a capacity retention of 86% after 100 cycles at a current rate of 100 mA g-1 in a voltage window of 2.0 - 4.2 V. Moreover, the LS-NFM cathode exhibited an enhanced rate capability in comparison to the un-doped layered cath-ode (NFM). The enhanced rate capability of LS-NFM can be explained by the significantly increased effective Na+ diffusivity measured by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) compared to the un-doped control NFM cathode, which can be ascribed to the improved charge transport kinetics through shortened diffusion path by direct connection between the 3D channels in the spinel phase and 2D channels in the layered phase. The results from ex situ hard/soft X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) suggest that the capacity of LS-NFM cathode is mainly associated with the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple, and slightly from the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple. The voltage profile of the LS-NFM cathode exhibited a reversible plateau above 4.0 V, indicating great stability at high voltages and structural stabilization by the spinel phase. In addition to the substitution of various transition metals, or the modification of the stoichiometry of each transition metal, this study provides a new strategy to improve electrochemical performance of layered cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Polysulfide crossover through networks into a bulk electrolyte can be reduced by absorption into the polymer gel, steric rejection, and electrostatic rejection, with the predominance of these mechanisms dictated by polymer composition and structure. The best network composition allowed an initial Mg–S cell discharge capacity of 522 mAh/g compared to a discharge capacity of 365 mAh/g using a literature standard glass fiber separator.

A variation of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, LiAlO<sub>2</sub>, and other lithium-bearing species with different phases and morphologies are formed as an interphase on top of NMC532, controlled by the polarity of solvent systems, the corrosivity of aluminum salts, the initial alumina loading, and the annealing temperature. The nature of these initial surface interphases shows great influence on electrode impedance, initial capacities, and capacity retention rates in electrochemical tests. Post-electrochemistry characterizations on cycled cathodes show that surface LiAlO<sub>2</sub> phases are relatively stable against the potential HF etching, whereas Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is reacted and consumed. Both half-cell and full-cell testing results of cathodes treated by optimized protocols demonstrate remarkable improvements in the capacity retention compared with the baseline.

Although impressive storage capacities have been demonstrated for several materials, particularly at cryogenic temperatures, materials meeting all of the targets established by the U.S. Department of Energy have yet to be identified. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the major known and proposed strategies for hydrogen adsorbents, with the aim of guiding ongoing research as well as future new storage concepts. The discussion of each strategy includes current relevant literature, strengths and weaknesses, and outstanding challenges that preclude implementation. We consider in particular metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), including surface area/volume tailoring, open metal sites, and the binding of multiple H<sub>2</sub> molecules to a single metal site. Two related classes of porous framework materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), are also discussed, as are graphene and graphene oxide and doped porous carbons. We additionally introduce criteria for evaluating the merits of a particular materials design strategy. Computation has become an important tool in the discovery of new storage materials, and a brief introduction to the benefits and limitations of computational predictions of H<sub>2</sub> physisorption is therefore presented.

However, our understanding of Li-S battery is still largely unknown at the level of the nanoscale. The structural properties of Li-S materials were investigated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the ReaxFF force field. Several Li-S nanoparticles with different Li/S composition ratios (2:1 and 2:8) and various structures are studied. Our MD simulations show that among the four structures we constructed for Li2S8 nanoparticles, the core-shell structure is the most thermodynamically stable one during the charging (delithiation) process. In contrast to bulk crystal Li2S, we find the presence of mixed lithium sulfide and polysulfide species are common features for these Li-S (Li2S, Li2S8) nanoparticles. The complex distribution of these sulfide and polysulfide speciation are dictated by both stoichiometry and local atomic structures in the nanoparticle. These findings will provide insight into further development of functionalized lithium-sulfur cathodes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Microstructural analyses including nanotomography demonstrate that the filler material in both the additive-containing MPLs provide preferential transport pathways for liquid water, which correlate with ex situ measurements.

The pack level energy density, specific energy, and battery cost are calculated using the spreadsheet tool BatPaC. The tool used experimental data for some cathode materials such as the lithiated oxides of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA), layered lithium- and manganese-rich nickel manganese cobalt (LMRNMC). The half-cell data were obtained at UCVs between 4.2 and 4.7 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>. The experimental data showed LMRNMC with the highest lithiation capacity gain, increasing from 176 mAh·g<sup>–1</sup> at 4.2 V to 260 mAh·g<sup>–1</sup> at 4.7 V; this advantage is partly offset by its lower average voltage. Assuming optimized cell materials/design and an area-specific impedance of 12 Ω•cm<sup>2</sup> for all the materials, the BatPaC results indicate that the specific energies or energy densities of the battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) battery packs with the LMRNMC and NMC cathodes can exceed 180 (BEV) and 160 (PHEV) Wh·kg<sup>–1</sup> at UCV>4.6 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>.

When coupled with a ferrocene-derived catholyte, the flow cells with the diquat anolyte demonstrate long galvanic cycling with high capacity retention. Notably, the mechanistic underpinnings of this remarkable stability are attributed to the improved π-conjugation originated from the near-planar molecular conformations of the spatially constrained 2,2’-bipyridyl rings, suggesting a viable structural engineering strategy for designing stable organic materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Through the comparison of results independently obtained from neutron and synchrotron powder diffraction, improved approaches capable of detecting occupancy defects with an exceptional sensitivity of 0.1% (absolute) in the class of layered NMC Li-ion battery cathode materials have been developed. A new method of visualizing the diffraction parameter space associated with crystallographic site scattering power through the use of f* diagrams is described and this method is broadly applicable to ternary compounds. The f* diagrams allow the global minimum fit to be easily identified and also permit a robust determination of the number and type of occupancy defects within a structure. Through a comparison of neutron and X-ray diffraction results, a systematic error in the synchrotron results was identified using f* diagrams for a series of NMC compounds. Using neutron diffraction data as a reference, this error was shown to specifically result from problems associated with the neutral oxygen X-ray atomic form factor and could be eliminated by using the ionic O<sup>2-</sup> form factor for this anion while retaining the neutral form factors for cationic species. The f* diagram method offers a new opportunity to experimentally assess the quality of atomic form factors through powder diffraction studies on chemically related multi-component compounds.","American Institute of Physics (AIP)","","Pacific Northwest National Lab.

"Probing Electrochemically Induced Structural Evolution and Oxygen Redox Reactions in Layered Lithium Iridate","Li, Liang; Castro, Fernando C.; Park, Joong Sun; Li, Haifeng; Lee, Eungje; Boyko, Teak D.; Freeland, John W.; Yao, Zhenpeng; Fister, Timothy T.; Vinson, John; Shirley, Eric L.; Wolverton, Christopher; Cabana, Jordi; Dravid, Vinayak P.; Thackeray, Michael M.; Chan, Maria K. Y.","36 MATERIALS SCIENCE; 25 ENERGY STORAGE","In order to exploit electrochemical capacity beyond the traditionally-utilized transition metal redox reactions in lithium-metal-oxide cathode materials, it is necessary to understand the role that oxygen ions play in the charge compensation mech-anisms, i.e., to know the conditions triggering electron transfer on the oxygen ions and whether this transfer is correlated with battery capacity. Theoretical and experimental investigations of a model cathode material, Li-rich layered Li<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>3</sub>, have been performed to study the structural and electronic changes induced by electrochemical delithiation in a lithium-ion cell. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to compute the voltage profile of a Li/Li<sub>2-x</sub>IrO<sub>3</sub> cell at various states of charge, and the results were in good agreement with electrochemical data. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), resonant/non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), and first principles core-level spectra simulations using the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach were used to probe the change in oxygen electronic states over the $x$ = 0 to 1.5 range. The correlated Ir M<sub>3</sub>-edge XANES and O K-edge XANES data provided evidence that oxygen hole states form during the early stage of delithiation at ~3.5 V due to the interaction between O $p$ and Ir $d$ states, with Ir oxidation being the dominant source of electrochemical capacity. At higher potentials, the charge capacity was predominantly attributed to oxidation of the O<sup>2-</sup> ions. It is argued that the emergence of oxygen holes alone is not necessarily indicative of electrochemical capacity beyond transition metal oxidation, since oxygen hole states can appear as a result of enhanced mixing of O $p$ and Ir $d$ states. Prevailing mechanisms accounting for the oxygen redox mechanism in Li-rich materials were examined by theoretical and experimental X-ray spectroscopy; however, no unambiguous spectroscopic signatures of oxygen dimer interaction or non-bonding oxygen states were identified.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

We develop a cobalt nanoparticle-encapsulated carbon nanowire arrays on carbon cloth (CC@Co-CNAs) to enable the fast redox reaction kinetics of the lithium sulfur batteries. The nanowire array-decorated carbon cloth as conductive matrix for sulfur active material could provide highly exposed cobalt nanoparticle active sites, owing to the high length-diameter ratio of the prepared CC@Co-CNAs. The binding affinity between the cobalt nanoparticle-incorporated materials and polysulfide intermediates is enhanced by Co-S bonds, which facilitates the redox reaction of active materials and consequently results in a high sulfur utilization for cathode especially with high sulfur loading. The lithium sulfur battery with CC@Co-CNAs as electrode materials delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1228 mAh g(-1) at 0.25 C, and a high initial discharge capacity of 807 mAh g(-1) at 1C with a low capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle during 300 cycles.

"Impact of External Pressure and Electrolyte Transport Properties on Lithium Dendrite Growth","Barai, Pallab; Higa, Kenneth; Srinivasan, Venkat","25 ENERGY STORAGE; dendrite growth; lithium metal anode; mechanical stress; conductivity; diffusivity and transference number","Practical implementation of metal anodes in commercial lithium-ion batteries has been limited by the growth of dendritic protrusions, which can cause short-circuits and adversely affect battery safety. The impacts of the physical (such as external pressure and electrolyte shear modulus) and electrochemical (for example, conductivity, diffusivity and transference number) properties of a solid electrolyte on the propensity of lithium dendrite growth are investigated here. It is found that over a range of conditions, there are critical pressures above which growth of lithium dendritic protrusions can be prevented. The magnitude of this critical pressure depends on the elastic modulus of the electrolyte. Plastic deformation of lithium at high pressure results in reduced protrusion growth, which helps in obtaining stable deposition. For the first time, phase maps have been developed based on mechanical and transport properties of electrolytes, indicating conditions under which stable deposition of lithium is possible during long-term operation. Suppression of dendrites by individually altering conductivity, or diffusivity, or transference number, or elastic modulus of the electrolyte appears to be a relatively difficult task. Finally, minor tailoring of the transference number and elastic modulus of present-day polymer electrolytes, in a combined fashion, can lead to dendrite-free deposition of lithium.","IOP Publishing - The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

To reach the optimum energy and power density for thick electrodes, the effective chemical diffusion coefficient of Li<sup>+</sup> (D<sub>Li</sub>) must be maximized.

Fundamental understandings are needed on the rate-limiting process that governs the diffusion kinetics of Li<sup>+</sup> to minimize the negative impact of the large electrode thickness on their electrochemical performance. In this study, lithium Ni–Mn–Co oxide (NMC) cathodes of various thicknesses ranging from 100 to 300 μm were used as a model system to study the rate-limiting diffusion process during charge/discharge. The rate-limiting diffusion coefficient of Li<sup>+</sup> was investigated and quantified, which was correlated to the electrochemical performance degradation of thick electrodes. Lastly, it is revealed here that the under-utilization of the active material was caused by the limited diffusion of Li<sup>+</sup> inside the porous electrode, leading to a critical electrode thickness, beyond which the specific capacity was significantly reduced.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Achieving complete stability requires fundamental understanding of the role of the shell in providing passivation without compromising carrier transport, by tuning surface chemistry and structural features in a highly conformal barrier layer. Here, individual LiCoO<sub>2</sub> nanoplates were employed as the core, and passivating shells were grown at a tailored thickness and composition, through different Al loadings and annealing temperatures. Depending on the annealing conditions, the sub-5 nm shells were shown to vary from amorphous aluminum oxide layers to LiAl<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>1–x</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gradients, resulting in an Al-rich outer layer on a Co-rich core. This control revealed the differing balance between effective minimization of redox-active Co<sup>3+</sup> at the surface and transport properties of the two types of shell. Based on correlations with electrode performance, the requirements in thickness of the layers were proposed to critically depend on their chemical composition, with epitaxial shells based on surface substitution being favored. As a result, the outcomes of the study simultaneously advance the ability to assemble complex oxides into heterostructures and refine the rules of design for tunable passivation through a barrier layer, so as to maximize electrode properties in practical batteries.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Here we demonstrate that by tuning the electrolyte structure, the challenges at both electrodes can be tackled simultaneously. The sulfur speciation pathway transforms from a dissolution-precipitation route to a quasi-solid-state conversion in the presence of lowered solvent activity and an extended electrolyte network structure as revealed by ab initio calculations, curtailing the need for high electrolyte volumes.

The hypothesis behind the approach is that epitaxial alignment of hydrophobic blocks of surfactant templates induces a consistent, accessible mesophase orientation across a multilayer film, ultimately leading to continuous, vertically aligned pore channels. Characterization using grazing incidence X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy indicates that the pores are oriented vertically even in relatively thick films (up to 1 µm). These films contain a combination of amorphous and nanocrystalline anatase titania of value for electrochemical energy storage. When applied as negative electrodes in lithium-ion batteries, a capacity of 254 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> is obtained after 200 cycles for a single-layer TiO<sub>2</sub> film prepared on modified substrate, higher than on unmodified substrate or nonporous TiO<sub>2</sub> film, due to the high accessibility of the vertically oriented channels in the films. Thicker films on modified substrate have increased absolute capacity because of higher mass loading but a reduced specific capacity because of transport limitations. These results suggest that the multilayer epitaxial approach is a viable way to prepare high capacity TiO<sub>2</sub> films with vertically oriented continuous nanopores.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

In this work, we demonstrate rational, combined experimental-computational design of a new carba- closo-dodecaborate-based salt with enhanced anodic stability for Mg energy storage applications. We first establish, through a careful examination using a range of solvents, the anodic oxidation of a parent anion, the carba- closo-dodecaborate anion at 4.6 V vs Mg<sup>0/2+</sup> (2.0 vs Fc<sup>0/+</sup>), a value lower than that projected for this anion in organic solvent-based electrolytes and lower than weakly associating bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and tetrafluoroborate anions. Solvents such as acetonitrile, 3-methylsulfolane, and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol are shown to enable the direct measurement of carba-<em>closo</em>-dodecaborate oxidation, where the resultant neutral radical drives passive film formation on the electrode. Second, we employ computational screening to evaluate the impact of functionalization of the parent anion on its stability and find that replacement of the carbon-vertex proton with a more electronegative fluorine or trifluoromethyl ligand increases the oxidative stability and decreases the contact-ion pair formation energy while maintaining reductive stability. This predicted expansion of the electrochemical window for fluorocarba-<em>closo</em>-dodecaborate is experimentally validated. Future work includes evaluation of the viability of these derivative anions as efficient and stable carriers for energy storage as a function of the ionic transport through the resulting surface films formed on candidate cathodes.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Sandia National Lab.

"Niobium tungsten oxides for high-rate lithium-ion energy storage","Griffith, Kent J.; Wiaderek, Kamila M.; Cibin, Giannantonio; Marbella, Lauren E.; Grey, Clare P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; battery; bronze structure; fast charging; niobium oxide","Here, the maximum power output and minimum charging time of a lithium-ion battery – key parameters for its use in, for example, transportation applications – depend on mixed ionic– electronic diffusion. While the discharge/charge rate and capacity can be tuned by varying the composite electrode structure, ionic transport within the active particles represents a fundamental limitation. Thus, to achieve high rates, particles are frequently reduced to nanosize dimensions despite this being disadvantageous in terms of volumetric packing density as well as cost, stability, and sustainability considerations. As an alternative to nanoscaling, we show that complex niobium tungsten oxides with topologically frustrated polyhedral arrangements and dense µm-scale particle morphologies can rapidly and reversibly intercalate large quantities of lithium. Multielectron redox, buffered volume expansion, and extremely fast lithium transport approaching that of a liquid lead to extremely high volumetric capacities and rate performance for both crystallographic shear structure and bronze-like niobium tungsten oxides. The active materials Nb<sub>16</sub>W<sub>5</sub>O<sub>55</sub> and Nb<sub>18</sub>W<sub>16</sub>O<sub>93</sub> offer new strategies toward designing electrodes with advantages in energy density, scalability, electrode architecture/complexity and cost as alternatives to the state-ofthe art high-rate anode material Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. The direct measurement of solid-state lithium diffusion coefficients (DLi) with pulsed field gradient NMR demonstrates room temperature DLi values of 10–12–10–13 m<sup>2</sup> × s<sup>-1</sup> in the niobium tungsten oxides, which is several orders-ofmagnitude faster than typical electrode materials and corresponds to a characteristic diffusion length of ~10 µm for a 1 minute discharge. Materials and mechanisms that enable lithiation of µm particles in minutes have implications for high power applications, fast charging devices, all-solid-state batteries, and general approaches to electrode design and material discovery.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

Due to the anisotropic structure and unique photoelectric properties, they have potential applications for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations on pristine 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results indicated that the Gibbs free energy of the 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> edge site for HER could be as small as 0.01 eV, superior to other reported TMDs. Experimentally, we developed a strategy to fabricate sub-5 nm sized 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> nanoflakes on carbon nanotubes. Such a small size for the nanoflakes brought abundant edge exposure, which boosted the catalytic activity in the HER. Specifically, the 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> nanoflakes needed only 23 and 60 mV overpotentials to achieve –1 and –10 mA cm<sup>–2</sup> current densities, along with a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec<sup>–1</sup> and a high exchange current density of 0.3 mA cm<sup>–2</sup>. The edge-rich and layered 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> was also explored as an anode for sodium ion battery. The in operando X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique was applied to investigate the TMD behavior in real-time during the sodiation/desodiation process. Furthermore, the <em>in situ</em> results revealed that the nanosized 1T'-ReSe<sub>2</sub> is electrchemically reversible during discharge/charge cycles.

In the meantime, it was recently demonstrated, via a series of electrochemical cycling experiments, the in situ preparation of manganese-based mixed-anion cathode materials based on decomposition of electrolyte salt LiPF6 in the presence of MnO. To take a step forward, we herein report a routine protocol to prepare 220 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>-class composite cathodes. In addition, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the in situ fluorination and locally reversible phase transitions using complementary analytical techniques. The charged phase, with an average Mn oxidation state of ca. +2.8, consists of a highly disordered O-rich cubic-spinel-like core and an F-rich amorphous shell. Upon discharge, lithiation induces further phase transition, forming LiF, MnO, and a lithiated rocksalt-like phase. Furthermore this work, which we also extended to the iron-based system, offers insights into modification of chemical and electronic properties of electrode materials by in situ fluorination.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

However, undesirable dendritic lithium growth and corresponding instability of the solid electrolyte interphase prevent safe and long-term use of lithium metal anodes. Here, this paper presents a simple electrolyte approach to enhance the performance of lithium metal batteries by tuning the dielectric constant of the liquid electrolyte. Electrolyte formulations are designed by changing the concentration of ethylene carbonate to have various dielectric constants. This study confirms that high ethylene carbonate content in a liquid electrolyte enhances the cycling performance of lithium metal batteries because the electric field intensity applied to the electrolyte is reduced in relation to the polarization of the electrolyte and thus allows smooth lithium plating and formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase. Lastly, we believe that this approach provides an important concept for electrolyte system design suitable to lithium metal batteries.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Despite excellent prospects, voltage fade has prevented effective use of the excess capacity, and a major challenge has been a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the voltage fade. Here, using operando three-dimensional Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, we directly observe the nucleation of a mobile dislocation network in LRLO nanoparticles. The dislocations form more readily in LRLO as compared with a classical layered oxide, suggesting a link between the defects and voltage fade. We show microscopically how the formation of partial dislocations contributes to the voltage fade. The insights allow us to design and demonstrate an effective method to recover the original high-voltage functionality. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the voltage fade in LRLO is reversible and call for new paradigms for improved design of oxygen-redox active materials.","Nature Publishing Group","","Univ. of California, San Diego, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

The present simulations reveal two known polarization behaviors, namely the memory effect and path dependence. Notably, a hitherto unknown polarization behavior, the so-called relaxation-induced polarization (RIP), was also identified. The memory effect requires, at a minimum, a sequential four-step operation. By comparison, RIP is triggered only by a one-step operation, namely a long rest. In effect, the polarization associated with the memory effect and RIP was caused by a reduction of the active particles in the two-phase region via relaxation during a rest. The path-dependence mechanism was attributed to kinetically inhomogeneous reactions for each particle. We further found that narrowing the particle size distribution was an effective means to reduce polarization viz. the memory effect and path dependence of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrodes. However, RIP could not be suppressed by narrowing the particle size distribution. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of these polarization behaviors with our model provides a more accurate way to estimate the state of charge in Li-ion batteries with LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrodes.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Sodium layered cathode materials are usually multicomponent transition metal (TM) oxides and each TM plays a unique role in the operating cathode chemistry, e.g., redox activity, structural stabilization. Engineering the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of TM cations in individual cathode particles can take advantage of a depth-dependent charging mechanism and enable a path towards tuning local TM–O chemical environments and building resilience against cathode–electrolyte interfacial reactions that are responsible for capacity fading, voltage decay and safety hazards. In this study, we create 3D compositional heterogeneity in a ternary and biphasic (O3–P3) sodium layered cathode material (Na<sub>0.9</sub>Cu<sub>0.2</sub>Fe<sub>0.28</sub>Mn<sub>0.52</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The cells containing this material deliver stable voltage profiles, and discharge capacities of 125 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at C/10 with almost no capacity fading after 100 cycles and 75 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 1C with negligible capacity fading after 200 cycles. The direct performance comparison shows that this material outperforms other materials with similar global compositions but different mesoscale chemical distributions. Synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy/imaging and density functional theory studies reveal depth-dependent chemical environments due to changes to factors such as charge compensation and strength of orbital hybridization. Finally, 3D spectroscopic tomography illuminates the path towards optimizing multicomponent sodium layered cathode materials, to prevent the migration of TMs upon prolonged cycling. Furthermore, the study reports an inaugural effort of multifaceted and counterintuitive investigation of sodium layered cathode materials and strongly implies that there is plenty of room at the bottom by tuning nano/meso scale chemical distributions for stable cathode chemistry.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

Rietveld refinement of XRD data for Mg<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> electrodes at various states of charge, , coupled with EDX analysis, demonstrates that Mg<sup>2+</sup> can be inserted into Zr<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> at 60 °C up to x = 0.7 at a C/10 rate (up to x = 0.9 at very slow rates) and cycled with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.75%. HAADF-STEM studies provide clear visual evidence of Mg-ion occupation in the lattice, whereas XAS studies show that Zr<sup>4+</sup> was reduced upon Mg<sup>2+</sup> intercalation. Operando and synchrotron XRD studies reveal the creation of two phases during the latter stages of discharge (x > 0.5) as the lattice fills and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions begin occupying tetrahedral (8a) sites in addition to octahedral (16c) interstitial sites. Compared to the isostructural Ti<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> thiospinel, Zr<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> presents a slightly larger cell volume and hence an almost ideal zero-strain lattice on Mg<sup>2+</sup> insertion. Nonetheless, its 4-fold lower electronic conductivity results in a diffusion coefficient for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (D<sub>Mg</sub>; 1 × 10<sup>–10</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>–9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s) that is more than a factor of 10 lower than in Ti<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>. Finally, this shows that delocalization of the electron charge carriers in the framework is a very important factor in governing multivalent ion diffusivity in the thiospinel framework and, by extension, in other materials.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Identifying solid electrolytes with high electrochemical stability and high Na+-ion conductivity at room temperature is critically important to enable high energy densities with enhanced rate capabilities. We evaluated sodium sulfide silicon sulfide, xNa<sub>2</sub>S + (1 - x)SiS<sub>2</sub>, glasses as potential glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We employed ab initio MD to determine ion conduction mechanisms, to calculate energy barriers for ion hops, and to correlate these to the local short-range structure of 0.50Na<sub>2</sub>S + 0.50SiS<sub>2</sub> glass. To simulate much larger systems for accurately calculating the ionic conductivity, we parameterized empirical Buckingham-type potential and performed classical MD simulations. After validating these calculations by comparing the structure obtained from MD to that from X-ray scattering data, we calculated the ionic conductivity of these glasses for the range of 0.33 ≤ x ≤ 0.67 compositions. The calculated ionic conductivities at room temperature were in the range of similar to 10<sup>-5</sup> S/cm for the x = 0.50 composition and increased significantly with sodium sulfide (x) content.

From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progressed and the materials of interest changed, different emphasis on the different sub-disciplines of material science were placed. Early works on LIBs focused more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century with nanotechnology on the rise, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those were chosen. We hope to clearly draw for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. In conclusion, this review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Toluene was utilized as the internal reference for <sup>1</sup>H-DOSY analysis due to its exceptionally low donor number and reasonable solubility in various electrolytes. With the introduction of the internal reference, the solvent coordination ratio of different species in the electrolytes can be easily determined by <sup>1</sup>H-DOSY or <sup>7</sup>Li-DOSY. This new technique was applied to different carbonate electrolytes, and the results were consistent with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Compared to conventional vibrational spectroscopy, this IR-DOSY technique avoids the complicated deconvolution of the spectrum and allows determination of the solvent coordination ratio of different species in electrolyte systems with two or more organic solvents.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

However, cycling LiCoO<sub>2</sub>-based batteries to voltages greater than 4.35 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup> causes significant structural instability and severe capacity fade. Consequently, commercial LiCoO<sub>2</sub> exhibits a maximum capacity of only ~165 mAh/g.

"Quantifying gas generation from slurries used in fabrication of Si-containing electrodes for lithium-ion cells","Rodrigues, Marco-Tulio F.; Trask, Stephen E.; Shkrob, Ilya A.; Abraham, Daniel P.","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Archimedes; electrochemistry; hydrogen; polyacrylate binders; silicon","The high capacity of silicon motivates its use as anode material for Li-ion batteries. While such Si-based electrodes are typically processed from aqueous slurries, elemental silicon is highly susceptible to hydrolysis, yielding flammable hydrogen gas as a byproduct. This gassing can present numerous safety and quality concerns for scaling up of the production. In this study we describe a method to quantify the volume of gases generated using the Archimedes principle. We show that the gas volumes are affected by various factors, which include the characteristics of the electrode slurry and attributes (particle size, surface coatings) of the silicon powders. A catalytic effect on gas evolution is observed when a lithiated polycarboxylate binder is present in the solution. On the other hand, negligible gas generation is observed in electrode slurries containing the <em>N</em>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent, which could be considered as an alternative to the water-based processes presently under consideration. Lastly, our study can be used as a guide for the development of slurry mixtures that can mitigate the safety concerns associated with the silicon-electrode fabrication process.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here we report that pairing of these cathodes with lithium titanate (Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, LTO) negative electrodes (anodes) accelerates this impedance rise when compared to pairing with graphite (Gr) electrodes, during potentiostatic holds (calendar-aging) at sufficiently high (> 4.2 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) layered-oxide potentials. Our results suggest that gases generated in the cell play an important role in this impedance rise. In the graphite cells, these gases are gradually depleted by reactions at the Gr electrode, but such reactions do not occur at the LTO electrode. The generation and buildup of gases degrades the electron conduction network within the cathode, and also leads to modifications at the oxide-electrolyte interfaces, causing the observed impedance rise. The calendar-aging also alters cell capacity, with losses observed in the Gr cells and gains observed in the LTO cells. Possible causes and consequences of these changes in the lithium-ion inventory of the cells are discussed.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Alloying induced electrode microstructural evolution was probed using X-ray microtomography. The rapid capacity fading was found to be caused by mechanical degradation of the electrode. Driving the electrode to a lower potential (E ≈ 0.2 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>) induced Li-Sn alloy formation and provided the characteristic large capacity; however, this led to a large volume expansion and active particle cracking and disintegration.

Two archetypical semiconducting donor (p-type) polymers, P3HT and PTB7, and semiconducting donor small-molecule, p-DTS(FBTTh<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are studied using three neat solvents (chloroform, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene) and four processing additives (1-chloronaphthalene, diphenyl ether, 1,8-diiodooctane, and 1,6-diiodohexane). In situ GIWAXS identifies several trends: 1) for neat solvents, rapid crystallization occurs that risks kinetically locking the material into multiple crystal structures or crystalline orientations; and 2) for solvent + additive processed films, morphology evolution involves sequential transformations on timescales ranging from seconds to hours, with key divergences dependent on additive/semiconductor molecular interactions. When π-planes dominate the additive/semiconductor interactions, both polymers and small molecule films follow similar evolutions, completing in 1–5 min. When side chains dominate the additive/semiconductor interactions, polymer film maturation times are up to 9 h, while initial crystallization times <10 s are observed for small-molecule films. In conclusion, this study offers guiding information on OSC donor intermediate morphologies, evolution timescales, and divergent evolutions that can inform OSC manufacture.","Wiley","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

While experimental and theoretical efforts have been critical in understanding the role of oxygen nonbonding states in the redox activity of oxygen ions, a clear picture of the redox chemistry of the oxygen species formed upon this oxidation process is still missing. This can be, in part, explained by the complexity in stabilizing and studying these species once electrochemically formed. Here in this work, we alleviate this difficulty by studying the phase Ba<sub>5</sub>Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, which contains peroxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> groups, as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst and Li-ion battery material. Combining physical characterization and electrochemical measurements, we demonstrate that peroxide groups can easily be oxidized at relatively low potential, leading to the formation of gaseous dioxygen and to the instability of the oxide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, owing to the stabilization at high energy of peroxide, the high-lying energy of the empty sigma* antibonding O-O states limits the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions when the O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>/O<sup>2-</sup> redox couple is used as redox center for Li-ion battery materials or as OER redox active sites. Overall, this work suggests that the formation of true peroxide O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup> states are detrimental for transition metal oxides used as OER catalysts and Li-ion battery materials. Rather, oxygen species with O-O bond order lower than 1 would be preferred for these applications.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The technique, which has a sub-mm in-plane spatial resolution, simultaneously determines the local temperature, the local state of charge of both electrodes (as opposed to the global average state of charge determined electrochemically), and the local in-plane elastic strain in the current collectors, all without embedding any intrusive sensors that alter battery behavior. As both thermal strain and mechanical strain develop during the charge-discharge cycling of the pouch cell, a novel approach developed herein makes it possible to separate them, allowing for measurement of the local temperature inside the battery. The operando experiment reveals that the temperature inside the cell is substantially higher than the external temperature. We propose that mechanical strain is due primarily to load transfer from the electrode to the current collector during lithiation, allowing determination of the local binder. Detailed local SOC mapping illustrates non-uniform degradation of the battery pouch cell. The possibility for 3D measurements is proposed. We believe that this new approach can provide critically needed data for validation of detailed models of processes inside commercial pouch cells.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The conventional strategy to tackle this issue is to design host materials for trapping polysulfides via weak physical confinement and interfacial chemical interactions. Even though beneficial, their capability for the polysulfide immobilization is still limited. Herein, the unique sulfiphilic nature of metallic Cu is revisited. Upon the exposure to polysulfide in aqueous or aprotic solution, the surface sulfidization rapidly takes place, resulting in the formation of Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanoflake arrays with tunable texture. When the sulfidized Cu current collector is directly used as the sulfur–equivalent cathode, it enables high–performance Li/Na–S batteries at room temperature with reasonable high sulfur loading.

However, volume changes in the Si particles that occur during cycling causes deterioration of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the particles resulting in further electrolyte reduction that immobilizes Li+ ions and, therefore, capacity fade. Because the volume changes are not expected to occur during a potentiostatic hold (referred to as calendar-life aging), by comparison of cycle-life and calendar-life aged cells one can expect to assess the role of volume changes in the deterioration of cell performance. To this end, cells with Si-Gr and Gr negative electrodes (and Li<sub>1.03</sub>(Ni<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.3</sub>)<sub>0.97</sub>O<sub>2</sub> containing positive electrodes) were assembled, tested, and compared using cycle-life and calendar-life aging protocols. As expected, the capacity loss of the cycle-life aged cells was higher than that of the calendar-life aged cells.

"Interplay of cation and anion redox in Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> cathode material and prediction of improved Li<sub>4</sub>(Mn,M)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> electrodes for Li-ion batteries","Yao, Zhenpeng; Kim, Soo; He, Jiangang; Hegde, Vinay I.; Wolverton, Chris","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Science & Technology; Other Topics","Significant research effort has focused on improving the specific energy of lithium-ion batteries for emerging applications, such as electric vehicles. Recently, a rock salt–type Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> cathode material with a large discharge capacity (~350 mA·hour g<sup>–1</sup>) was discovered. However, a full structural model of Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and its corresponding phase transformations, as well as the atomistic origins of the high capacity, warrants further investigation. We use first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate both the disordered rock salt–type Li<sub>4</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> structure and the ordered ground-state structure. The ionic ordering in the ground-state structure is determined via a DFT-based enumeration method. We use both the ordered and disordered structures to interrogate the delithiation process and find that it occurs via a three-step reaction pathway involving the complex interplay of cation and anion redox reactions: (i) an initial metal oxidation, Mn<sup>3+</sup>→Mn<sup>4+</sup> (Li<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 4 > x > 2); (ii) followed by anion oxidation, O<sup>2–</sup> → O<sup>1–</sup> (2 > x > 1); and (iii) finally, further metal oxidation, Mn<sup>4+</sup> → Mn<sup>5+</sup> (1 > x > 0). This final step is concomitant with the Mn migration from the original octahedral site to the adjacent tetrahedral site, introducing a kinetic barrier to reversible charge/discharge cycles. Armed with this knowledge of the charging process, we use high-throughput DFT calculations to study metal mixing in this compound, screening potential new materials for stability and kinetic reversibility. We predict that mixing with M = V and Cr in Li<sub>4</sub>(Mn,M)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> will produce new stable compounds with substantially improved electrochemical properties.","AAAS","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

However, a major challenge is their lower energy density. In this work, we report a novel multi–electron cathode material, KVOPO4, for sodium ion batteries. Due to the unique polyhedral framework, the V<sup>3+</sup> ↔ V<sup>4+</sup> ↔ V<sup>5+</sup> redox couple was for the first time fully activated by sodium ions in a vanadyl phosphate phase. The KVOPO<sub>4</sub> based cathode delivered reversible multiple sodium (i.e. maximum 1.66 Na<sup>+</sup> per formula unit) storage capability, which leads to a high specific capacity of 235 Ah kg<sup>–1</sup>. Combining an average voltage of 2.56 V vs. Na/Na+, a high practical energy density of over 600 Wh kg<sup>–1</sup> was achieved, the highest yet reported for any sodium cathode material. The cathode exhibits a very small volume change upon cycling (1.4% for 0.64 sodium and 8.0% for 1.66 sodium ions). In conclusion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the KVOPO4 framework is a 3D ionic conductor with a reasonably, low Na<sup>+</sup> migration energy barrier of ≈450 meV, in line with the good rate capability obtained.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

The approach allows probing catalysts inside operating fuel cells with atomic-level precision (~ 0.02 Å) and element specificity (~ 2–3 at%) in both time (~ 1 min) and space (~ μm) resolved manner. The approach is demonstrated on exemplary Pd-Sn and Pt-Ni-Cu nanoalloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) deposited on the cathode of an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell. In operando x-ray data show that under operating conditions, the catalyst particles can undergo specific structural changes, ranging from sub-Å atomic fluctuations and sharp nanophase transitions to a gradual strain relaxation and growth, which inflict significant losses in their ORR activity. Though triggered electrochemically, the changes are not driven solely by differences in the reduction potential and surface energy of the metallic species constituting the nanoalloys but also by the formation energy of competing nanophases, mismatch between the size of individual atomic species and their ability to interdiffuse fast in search of energetically favorable configurations. Given their complexity, the changes are difficult to predict and so the resulting ORR losses remain difficult to limit. We show that in operando knowledge of the structural evolution of nanoalloy catalysts helps create strategies for improving their activity and stability. In particular, we show that shaping Pd-Sn nanoalloys rich in Pd as cubes reduces the interdiffusion of atoms at their surface and so makes them better catalysts for ORR in fuel cells in comparison to other Pd-Sn nanoalloys. In addition, we demonstrate that the approach introduced here can provide knowledge of other major factors affecting the performance of fuel cells such as operating temperature and the overall catalyst utilization, in particular the evolution of elemental and mass distribution of catalyst particles over the cells’ cathode. Last but not least, we discuss how in operando x-ray spectroscopy and total x-ray scattering can bridge the knowledge gap between the widely used in situ SAXS, EXAFS and monocrystal surface XRD techniques for structural characterization of nanoalloy catalysts explored for energy related applications.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

To replace the nickel and cobalt, which are limited resources and are associated with safety problems, in current lithium-ion batteries, high-capacity cathodes based on manganese would be particularly desirable owing to the low cost and high abundance of the metal, and the intrinsic stability of the Mn<sup>4+</sup> oxidation state. Here we present a strategy of combining high-valent cations and the partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen in a disordered-rocksalt structure to incorporate the reversible Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>4+</sup> double redox couple into lithium-excess cathode materials. The lithium-rich cathodes thus produced have high capacity and energy density.

However, to date, fundamental understanding of the formation of LiF as one of the main solid electrolyte interphase components in hexafluorophosphate-based electrolytes remains elusive. In this paper, we present experimental and theoretical evidence that LiF formation is an electrocatalytic process that is controlled by the electrochemical transformation of HF impurity to LiF and H<sub>2</sub>. Although the kinetics of HF dissociation and the concomitant production of LiF and H<sub>2</sub> is dependent on the structure and nature of surface atoms, the underlying electrochemistry is the same. The morphology, and thus the role, of the LiF formed is strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate and HF inventory, leading to either complete or partial passivation of the interface.

However, sodium storage in P anodes is facing significant technical challenges in terms of poor conductivity, large volume swelling, and an unstable solid-electrolyte interphase. These challenges need to be well mitigated before P material can be deployed in full batteries. In this Perspective, we summarize the latest research progress in the development of P anodes. Here, we focus on the design principle and criteria of efficient P anodes and materials strategies that mainly leverage the knowledge accumulated for the lithium anode of silicon.

"Solution Properties and Practical Limits of Concentrated Electrolytes for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries","Zhang, Jingjing; Corman, R. E.; Schuh, Jonathon K.; Ewoldt, Randy H.; Shkrob, Ilya A.; Zhang, Lu","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NRFBs) use energized organic fluids that contain redox active organic molecules (ROMs) and supporting electrolyte. Such all-organic electrolytes have wider electrochemical stability windows than the more familiar aqueous electrolytes, potentially allowing a higher energy density in the solutions of charged ROMs. As this energy density increases linearly with the concentration of the charge carriers, physicochemical properties of concentrated ROM solutions in both states of charge present considerable practical interest. For NRFBs to become competitive with other types of flow cells, the current techno-economic analyses favor highly concentrated solutions (>1 M) with high ionic conductivity (>5 mS/cm). It is not presently clear that such solutions can have the required dynamic properties. In this paper, we show that ion diffusivities and conductivities of ROM-containing electrolytes reach maxima around 0.5 M and decrease significantly at higher concentrations; realistic limits are established for variations of these parameters. Furthermore, using closed-shell analogues for open-shell charged ROMs, we show that reconstitution of highly concentrated fluids during electrochemical charging will have strong adverse effects on their properties, including an increase in viscosity and decrease in conductivity and ion diffusivity. Finally, given our results, it appears that the target concentrations of NRFB fluids need to be reconsidered in terms of concentration-dependent conductivity and viscosity.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

"Elucidating Factors Controlling Long-Term Stability of Radical Anions for Negative Charge Storage in Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries","Zhang, Jingjing; Huang, Jinhua; Robertson, Lily A.; Assary, Rajeev S.; Shkrob, Ilya A.; Zhang, Lu","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Radical anions of electrochemically reduced compounds (anolytes) have been suggested for storage of negative charge in nonaqueous redox flow batteries. The lower the redox potential of the anolyte molecule, the higher is the stored energy density. However, the stability of the radical ions frequently suffers as their redox potentials become extreme, and there is a compromise between the energy density and the chemical stability in the active form. In this paper, we scrutinize this trade-off using one such “extreme,” the heterocyclic anolyte 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, BzNSN, by adjusting the redox potential of BzNSN via installed electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. We show that the stability of the radical anion strongly depends on the degree of ion pairing in solution, with the worst being for the contact lithium ion pairs. For BzNSN derivatives, there is a strong correlation between the lifetime of the radical anion and the redox potential. The root cause appears to be the proton transfer from the solvent (acetonitrile) to the radical anion, which is concerted with the dimerization of the solvent molecules. These interactions cause the radical anion to become unstable even though the redox couple falls well within the electrochemical stability window of the solvent. Steering this redox potential toward the middle of this window using electron-withdrawing groups did not pay off as it opened additional decomposition pathways. Finally, our study, therefore, suggests that there can be natural limitations to the energy density that is realistically achieved using neutral, closed-shell anolyte molecules for charge storage in the redox flow cells.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

From pair distribution function analysis, we observe that sodium ions are inserted into titanium vacancies at the early stage of the discharge process. This is supported by density functional theory calculations, which predict that sodium insertion is more favourable at vacancies than at interstitial sites.

"Structural Dynamics of Strongly Segregated Block Copolymer Electrolytes","Oparaji, Onyekachi; Narayanan, Suresh; Sandy, Alec; Ramakrishnan, Subramanian; Hallinan, Daniel","25 ENERGY STORAGE; 36 MATERIALS SCIENCE","Polymer electrolytes are promising materials for high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, they have low ion transport rates and gradually lose electrode adhesion during cycling. These effects are dependent on polymer structure and dynamics. This motivates an investigation of diblock copolymer electrolyte dynamics. Structural and stress relaxations have been measured with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and rheology, respectively, as a function of salt concentration and temperature. The polymer electrolyte studied in this work is a mixture of poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide), SEO, and lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI). Results from XPCS experiments showed hyperdiffusive motion for various lithium salt concentrations and at varying temperatures, which is indicative of soft glassy materials. This behavior is attributed to cooperative dynamics. The decay time was a weak, nonmonotonic function of salt concentration and decreased with increasing temperature, in an Arrhenius fashion. In contrast, the shear modulus decreased with increasing salt concentration and increasing temperature. The entanglement relaxation from rheological measurements followed Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann behavior. The structural decay time was slower than the entanglement relaxation time at temperatures above the glass transition temperature, but they were approximately equal at T<sub>g</sub> regardless of salt concentration. This may indicate a fundamental connection between cooperative structural motion and polymer chain motion in this material.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

In the presence of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, these side reactions can become even more complex. Moreover, because of the need to store oxygen, the volumetric energy densities of lithium-oxygen systems may be too small for practical applications. Here we report a system comprising a lithium carbonate-based protected anode, a molybdenum disulfide cathode and an ionic liquid/di methyl sulfoxide electrolyte that operates as a lithium-air battery in a simulated air atmosphere with a long cycle life of up to 700 cycles. We perform computational studies to provide insight into the operation of the system in this environment. Furthermore this demonstration of a lithium-oxygen battery with a long cycle life in an air-like atmosphere is an important step towards the development of this field beyond lithium-ion technology, with a possibility to obtain much higher specific energy densities than for conventional lithium ion batteries.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

In this paper, oxalic acid is selected as a leaching reagent to recover lithium as a resource and remove phosphorus from LiFePO <sub>4</sub> batteries, benefiting from its low natural effects. The physical properties of spent cathode materials (before leaching) and residues (after leaching) are identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The total amounts of Li and Fe are analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The process occurs under conditions of a 0.3 mol·L <sup>-1</sup> oxalic acid concentration, a temperature of 80°C, a reaction time of 60 min and a solid/liquid ratio of 60 g· L <sup>-1</sup> .

With high nickel content, the cathodes are of great interest for delivering the desired specific energy and energy density. However, the cells still suffer from fast capacity decay and low thermal-abuse tolerance to high voltage. At the highly delithiated state, the damage in the cell is mainly from severe parasitic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode and oxidization of the organic electrolyte. These side reactions rapidly weaken the system's rate capacity and cyclability. Solutions are being sought to provide safe operation and practical application. Three strategies have proven to be encouraging choices: surface coating, a core-shell structure, and a concentration gradient structure. For each strategy, the material architecture, fabrication procedure, operation principle, advances, and challenges are discussed in this review.

Herein, we report a unique method to control the morphologies of β-MnO<sub>2</sub> crystals with different occupancy of {100}/{111} facets through the effect of K<sup>+</sup> cations. Combining aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), ultramicrotomy, and dynamic functional theory (DFT) simulation, we clarified that the β-MnO<sub>2</sub> crystals were formed through a direct solid-state phase transition process. Increasing the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> cations in the precursor gradually changed the morphology of β-MnO<sub>2</sub> from bipyramid prism ({100}+{111} facets) to an octahedron structure ({111} facets). The K<sup>+</sup> cations controlled the morphology of β-MnO<sub>2</sub> by affecting the formation of α-K<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>4</sub>O<sub>8</sub> intermediate phase and the subsequent phase transition. Utilizing the β-MnO<sub>2</sub> crystals as the cathode for Li-ion batteries showed that highly exposed {111} facets offered β-MnO<sub>2</sub> crystal better rate performance, with ~70% capacity retention when the charge-discharge rate increased from 20 mA/g to 200 mA/g. Furthermore, our work revealed a new mechanism to tune the morphology of this earth-abundant metal oxide crystal, which could be used to adjust its electrochemical performance for different applications, such as supercapacitors and catalysts for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, a novel approach is developed to fabricate high-density graphene bulk materials with ink-bottle-like mesopores by phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) activation. These pores can effectively confine the polysulfides due to their unique structure with a wide body and narrow neck, which shows only a 0.05% capacity fade per cycle for 500 cycles (75% capacity retention) for accommodating polysulfides. With a density of 1.16 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, a hybrid cathode containing 54 wt% sulfur delivers a high volumetric capacity of 653 mA h cm<sup>-3</sup>. As a result, a device-level volumetric energy density as high as 408 W h L<sup>-1</sup> is achieved with a cathode thickness of 100 mu m. This is a periodic yet practical advance to improve the volumetric performance of Li-S batteries from a device perspective. Furthermore, this work suggests a design principle for the real use Li-S batteries although there is a long way ahead to bridge the gap between Li-S batteries and Li-ion batteries in volumetric performance.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

In this study, carbon corrosion was quantified in situ by measurement of carbon dioxide in the fuel cell exhaust gases through non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy during simulated drive cycle operations consisting of potential cycling with varying upper and lower potential limits. These studies were conducted for three different types of carbon supports. A reduction in the catalyst layer thickness was observed during a simulated drive cycle operation with a concomitant decrease in catalyst layer porosity, which led to performance losses due to increased mass transport limitations. The observed thickness reduction was primarily due to compaction of the catalyst layer, with the actual mass of carbon oxidation (loss) contributing only a small fraction (< 20%). The dynamics of carbon corrosion are presented along with a model that simulates the transient and dynamic corrosion rates observed in our experiments. Accelerated carbon corrosion stress tests are presented and their effects are compared to those observed for the drive cycle test.","The Electrochemical Society","","Los Alamos National Lab.

It is found that the cell degradation can be mitigated by controlling the voltage cycle, acid washing the MEA to remove Ni contaminants that enter the electrode and membrane during fabrication, and monitoring the operating conditions. For example, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) loss is <25% after 30,000 triangle cycles with 0.925 V upper potential limit if the MEA is acid washed and extensive diagnostics are avoided. The parameters that exacerbate the cell degradation also accelerate the rate at which Ni leaches out from the catalyst. A mechanistic model is presented for the degradation in performance of d-PtNi/C electrodes. The model correlates a) the degradation in ORR mass and specific activities with ECSA and Ni losses, b) the decrease in limiting current density (<i>i<sub>L</sub></i>), which is inversely proportional to the O<sub>2</sub> mass transport resistance, with the degradation in catalyst roughness factor, and c) the increase in mass transfer overpotentials with the reduced current density, <i>i/i<sub>L</sub></i> .","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

Finally, while the calendar life of energized fluids can be tuned in a predictable fashion over a wide range, the improvements in the calendar life do not automatically translate into the enhanced cycling performance, indicating that in addition to the slow reactions of charged species in the solvent bulk, there are other parasitic reactions that occur only during the electrochemical cycling of the cell and can dramatically affect the cycling lifetime.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical methods to study ionic and molecular mobility through the alkylphosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for different alkyl chain compositions, in order to better understand their impact on the lithium-ion electrochemistry, are utilized. Electrochemical trends for different chains correlate to trends observed in contact angle measurements and solvation energies obtained from computational methods, indicating that attributes of the microscopic wettability of these interfaces with the battery electrolyte have an important impact on ionic mobility. The effects of surface modification on Mn dissolution are also reported. The alkylphosphonate layer provides an important mode of chemical stabilization to the LMO, suppressing Mn dissolution by 90% during extended immersion in electrolytes. A more modest reduction in dissolution is found upon galvanostatic cycling, in comparison to pristine LMO cathodes. Finally, taken together, the data suggest that alkylphosphonates provide a versatile means for the surface modification of lithium-ion battery cathode materials allowing the design of specific interfaces through modification of organic chain functionalities.","Wiley-VCH","","Argonne National Lab.

With fully aromatic cores, TPB and TPSe have pi-orbitals spread continuously over the whole aromatic conjugated backbone, unlike TPC and TPSi, which contain isolated PDI units due to the use of a tetrahedron carbon or silicon linker. Density functional theory calculations of the projected density of states showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for TPB are localized in separate regions of space. Further, the LUMO of TPB shows a greater contribution from the orbitals belonging to the connective core of the molecules than that of TPC. Overall, the properties of the HOMO and LUMO point at increased intra-molecular delocalization of negative charge carriers for TPB and TPSe than for TPC and TPSi and hence at a more facile intra-molecular charge transfer for the former. The film absorption and emission spectra showed evidences for the inter -molecular electron delocalization in TPB and TPSe, which is consistent with the network structure revealed by X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of TPB. These features benefit the formation of charge transfer states and/or facilitate charge transport. Thus, higher electron mobility and higher charge dissociation probabilities under J<sub>sc</sub> condition were observed in blend films of TPB:PTB7-Th and TPSe:PTB7-Th than those in TPC:PTB7Th and TPSi:PTB7-Th blend films. As a result, the J<sub>sc</sub> and fill factor values of 15.02 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.58 and 14.36 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.55 for TPB- and TPSe-based solar cell are observed, whereas those for TPC and TPSi are 11.55 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.47 and 10.35 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.42, respectively.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Sodium manganese-rich layered oxides (P-type and O-type) are thus one of the promising cathode materials for rechargeable batteries because of the relatively low cost of manganese and sodium. The O-type cathodes are more promising for practical application owing to their high sodium-ion stoichiometry. However, most of these materials suffer from rapid capacity decay during high-voltage cycling. We used synchrotron X-ray probes coupled with electrochemical techniques to disclose the structural evolution of α-NaMnO<sub>2</sub> during solid-state synthesis and electrochemical cycling. During high-voltage cycling, a substantial increase of interfacial microstrain from both stacking faults and Mn cation migration was found to pin down this material’s layered structures and simultaneously block the diffusion pathways of Na<sup>+</sup>, thus leading to the performance degradation.

However, the divalent charge of zinc ions, which restricts the choice of host material due to hindered solid-state diffusion, can also pose a problem for interfacial charge transfer. We report our findings on reversible intercalation of up to two Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in layered V<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O. This material exhibits very high capacity and power (375 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at a 1C rate, and 275 mA h g<sup>-1</sup> at an 8C rate) in an aqueous electrolyte compared to a very low capacity and slow rate capabilities in a nonaqueous medium. <em>Operando</em> XRD studies, together with impedance analysis, reveal solid solution behavior associated with Zn<sup>2+</sup>-ion diffusion within a water monolayer in the interlayer gap in both systems, but very sluggish interfacial charge transfer in the nonaqueous electrolyte. This points to desolvation at the interface as a major factor in dictating the kinetics. Temperature dependent impedance studies show high activation energies associated with the nonaqueous charge transfer process, identifying the origin of poor electrochemical performance.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Univ. of Waterloo, ON (Canada); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

The keto groups of anthraquinone play a critical role in forming strong Lewis acid-based chemical bonding. This mechanism leads to a long cycling stability of sulfur-based electrodes. With a high sulfur content of ~73%, a low capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle for 300 cycles and retention of 81.7% over 500 cycles at 0.5 C rate can be achieved.

The market success of FCEVs depends on standardization of key vehicle and infrastructure parameters, including the delivered hydrogen pressure (DHP). This paper developed and utilized the Hydrogen Optimal Pressure (HOP) model to systematically identify the optimal DHP among 350, 500, and 700 bar toward the lowest total consumer cost and analyze how the optimal DHP may be affected by attributes of drivers, vehicles, and hydrogen refueling stations.

A DHP of 300 or 500 bar can the winner in Cluster Strategy if combined with certain assumptions of driving patterns and time value. the optimal pressure is found to be very sensitive to fuel availability, fuel economy, driving pattern and time value. The appeal of a higher DHP such as 700 bar (or even higher) is more obvious during the early market stages, when the number of hydrogen stations is limited and early FCEV consumers likely have higher time value, and thus may be willing to pay more for the increased range with higher DHP.

An on-line inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer, capable of real-time measurements, is used to resolve the anodic and cathodic dissolution of Pt and Co during square-wave and triangle-wave potential cycles. We observe Co dissolution at all potentials, distinct peaks in anodic and cathodic Pt dissolution rates above 0.9 V, and potential-dependent Pt and Co dissolution rates. The amount of Pt that dissolves cathodically is smaller than the amount that dissolves anodically if the upper potential limit (UPL) is lower than 0.9 V. At the highest UPL investigated, 1.0 V, the cathodic dissolution greatly exceeds the anodic dissolution. A non-ideal solid solution model indicates that the anodic dissolution can be associated with the electrochemical oxidation of Pt and PtOH to Pt<sup>2+</sup>, and the cathodic dissolution to electrochemical reduction of a higher Pt oxide, PtO<sub>x</sub> (x > 1), to Pt<sup>2+</sup>. Pt also dissolves oxidatively during the cathodic scans but in smaller amounts than due to the reductive dissolution of PtO<sub>x</sub>. The relative amounts Pt dissolving oxidatively as Pt and PtOH depend on the potential cycle and UPL.","The Electrochemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

"Effect of nanopatterning on mechanical properties of Lithium anode","Campbell, Colin; Lee, Yong Min; Cho, Kuk Young; Lee, Young-Gi; Lee, Byeongdu; Phatak, Charudatta; Hong, Seungbum","25 ENERGY STORAGE; Li anode; Lithium ion batteries; Nanopatterning; mechanical properties","One of the challenges in developing Lithium anodes for Lithium ion batteries (LIB) is controlling the formation of Li dendrites during cycling of the battery. Nanostructuring and nanopatterning of electrodes shows a promising way to suppress the growth of Li dendrites. However, in order to control this behavior, a fundamental understanding of the effect of nanopatterning on the electromechanical properties of Li metal is necessary. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanical and wear properties of Li metal using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in an airtight cell. By using different load regimes, we determined the mechanical properties of Li metal. Here, we show that as a result of nanopatterning, Li metal surface underwent work hardening due to residual compressive stress. The presence of such stresses can help to improve cycle lifetime of LIBs with Li anodes and obtain very high energy densities.","Nature Publishing Group","","Argonne National Lab.

This compound adopts a rhombohedral structure, space group $R\overline{3}c$, with O and F sharing one site, and was synthesized by high-energy ball-milling. The thermal stability of VO<sub>2</sub>F, which is related to the battery safety, is studied by in situ XRD upon heating and by thermal gravimetric analysis. VO<sub>2</sub>F is found to be stable up to 160 °C under inert atmosphere; above this temperature, it converts into vanadium oxide with fluorine loss. The structure evolution upon lithium cycling was studied by ex situ X-ray diffraction and absorption techniques. The results show that lithiation of VO<sub>2</sub>F goes through a solid-solution reaction, and the rhombohedral structure is preserved if no more than one lithium ion is intercalated. Upon a second Li insertion, an irreversible transition to a rock-salt structure occurs. We show using first-principles calculations that this irreversible transformation can be explained by an asymmetric energetic preference between the rhombohedral and rock-salt forms of Li<sub><i>x</i></sub>VO<sub>2</sub>F, which result in large thermodynamic driving forces to convert to the rock-salt structure at <i>x</i> > 1 and relatively small thermodynamic driving forces to convert back to the rhombohedral structure when delithiating to <i>x</i> < 1.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

However, during routine charging and discharging, Li dendrites grow on the Li metal electrode, which can lead to capacity loss by the consumption of Li salt at the surface of the Li dendrites, and be a safety hazard resulting from the potential for short-circuits. Although past efforts have provided useful information about the morphology and surface area of Li dendrite formation at the microscale, a nanoscale understanding of nucleation and growth of Li nanoparticle electrodeposition is still elusive. In this study, using a new electrochemical cell for transmission mode grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering, we obtained, for the first time, the primary nucleus size of Li nanoparticles, their size evolution and their fractal structures at various current densities and in real-time. The measured average radius of gyration, R<sub>g</sub>, at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, and 2.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> is 5.4 ± 0.4, 4.5 ± 0.3, and 3.5 ± 0.3 nm, respectively. This variation in size with current density is noteworthy when recognizing that the surface area-to-volume ratio of the Li nanoparticles is 3.7 times higher at 2.0 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> than at 0.1 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. We also compared a hierarchical fractal structure of Li particles from the nanometer to micrometer scale. Our findings illuminate the role of overpotential in the reactive surface area of Li dendrites at the nanoscale, and provide a novel research platform for suppressing Li dendrite formation in Li metal battery systems.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

The optimization of the pore architecture design facilitates electrolyte penetration and provides a rapid diffusion path for lithium ions, which becomes even more crucial for thick porous electrodes. In this work, NaCl microsize particles are used as a templating agent for the fabrication of 1 mm thick porous LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> composite electrodes using spark plasma sintering technique. These sintered binder-free electrodes are self-supported and present a large porosity (40%) with relatively uniform pores. The electrochemical performances of half and full batteries reveal a remarkable specific areal capacity (20 mA h cm<sup>-2</sup>), which is 4 times higher than those of 100 µm thick electrodes present in conventional tape-casted Li–ion batteries (5 mA h cm<sup>-2</sup>). The 3D morphological study is carried out using full field transmission X-ray microscopy in microcomputed tomography mode to obtain tortuosity values and pore size distributions leading to a strong correlation with their electrochemical properties. These results also demonstrate that the coupling between the salt templating method and the spark plasma sintering technique turns out to be a promising way to fabricate thick electrodes with high energy density.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Chemical substitution of Na in transition metal layers is a promising solution to utilize both the cationic and anionic redox activities for boosting energy storage. Unfortunately, different from the classic Li-rich Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>, a pure prototype with anionic redox activity has not been found among the typical Na-rich cathodes. In this paper, we originally design a Na-rich layered oxide prototype, namely Na<sub>3</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> (Ru<sup>5+</sup>), which delivers a partial reversible capacity solely via the participation of oxygen anions. More importantly, the anionic redox activity is validated by the in situ Raman observation of reversible peroxo-based O–O (de)bonding upon cycling. Finally, our findings not only highlight the multiple electron-transfer strategy for capacity extension, but also broaden the horizon in designing Na-rich electrode materials for high-energy sodium-ion batteries.","Royal Society of Chemistry","","Argonne National Lab.

The variability in the results is often assumed to arise from differences in cell design, electrode structure, handling and cell preparation at different times. An accurate theoretical framework turns out to be needed to get a better insight into the mechanisms underneath and to interpreting experimental results. Here, we develop and use a pore network model to simulate the electrochemical performance of three-dimensionally resolved lithium-oxygen cathode mesostructures obtained from TXM nano-computed tomography images. Here, we apply this model to the 3D reconstructed object of a Super P carbon electrode and calculate discharge curves, using identical conditions, for four different zones in the electrode and their reversed configurations. The resulting galvanostatic discharge curves show some dispersion, (both in terms of capacity and overpotential) which we attribute to the way pores are connected with each other. Based on these results, we propose that the stochastic nature of pores interconnectivity and the microscopic arrangement of pores can lead, at least partially, to the variations in electrochemical results observed experimentally.","American Chemical Society","","Argonne National Lab.

The results indicate that the crystalline structural deterioration of the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode and the graphite anode is unlikely to happen before capacity fades below 80% of the initial capacity. Rather, the loss of the active lithium source is the primary cause for the capacity fade, which leads to the appearance of inactive FePO<sub>4</sub> that is proportional to the absence of the lithium source. Our in situ HESXRD studies further show that the lithium-ion insertion and deinsertion behavior of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> continuously changed with cycling. For a fresh cell, the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> experienced a dual-phase solid-solution behavior, whereas with increasing cycle numbers, the dynamic change, which is characteristic of the continuous decay of solid solution behavior, is obvious. Finally, the unpredicted dynamic change may result from the morphology evolution of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> particles and the loss of the lithium source, which may be the cause of the decreased rate capability of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cells after long-term cycling.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

"Operando Synchrotron Measurement of Strain Evolution in Individual Alloying Anode Particles within Lithium Batteries","Cortes, Francisco Javier Quintero; Boebinger, Matthew G.; Xu, Michael; Ulvestad, Andrew; McDowell, Matthew T.","25 ENERGY STORAGE","Alloying anode materials offer high capacity for next-generation batteries, but the performance of these materials often decays rapidly with cycling because of volume changes and associated mechanical degradation or fracture. The direct measurement of crystallographic strain evolution in individual particles has not been reported, however, and this level of insight is critical for designing mechanically resilient materials. Here, we use operando X-ray diffraction to investigate strain evolution in individual germanium microparticles during electrochemical reaction with lithium. The diffraction peak was observed to shift in position and diminish in intensity during reaction because of the disappearance of the crystalline Ge phase. The compressive strain along the [111] direction was found to increase monotonically to a value of -0.21%.

"Boosting Sodium Storage in TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanotube Arrays through Surface Phosphorylation","Ni, Jiangfeng; Fu, Shidong; Yuan, Yifei; Ma, Lu; Jiang, Yu; Li, Liang; Lu, Jun","25 ENERGY STORAGE; sodium storage; sodium-ion batteries; surface functionalization; titanium dioxide","In this paper, sodium–ion batteries (SIBs) offer a promise of a scalable, low–cost, and environmentally benign means of renewable energy storage. However, the low capacity and poor rate capability of anode materials present an unavoidable challenge. In this work, it is demonstrated that surface phosphorylated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube arrays grown on Ti substrate can be efficient anode materials for SIBs. Fabrication of the phosphorylated nanoarray film is based on the electrochemical anodization of Ti metal in NH<sub>4</sub>F solution and subsequent phosphorylation using sodium hypophosphite. The phosphorylated TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube arrays afford a reversible capacity of 334 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 67 mA g<sup>–1</sup>, a superior rate capability of 147 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 3350 mA g<sup>–1</sup>, and a stable cycle performance up to 1000 cycles. In situ X–ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy reveal the near–zero strain response and robust mechanical behavior of the TiO<sub>2</sub> host upon (de)sodiation, suggesting its excellent structural stability in the Na+ storage application.","Wiley","","Argonne National Lab.

Of the relevant properties, the tortuosity factor of the electrolyte transport paths through microstructure pores is important as it limits battery maximum charge/discharge rate, particularly for energy-dense thick electrodes. Tortuosity factor however, is difficult to precisely measure, and thus its estimation has been debated frequently in the literature. Herein, three independent approaches have been applied to quantify the tortuosity factor of lithium-ion battery electrodes. The first approach is a microstructure model based on three-dimensional geometries from X-ray computed tomography (CT) and stochastic reconstructions enhanced with computationally generated carbon/binder domain (CBD), as CT is often unable to resolve the CBD. The second approach uses a macro-homogeneous model to fit electrochemical data at several rates, providing a separate estimation of the tortuosity factor. The third approach experimentally measures tortuosity factor via symmetric cells employing a blocking electrolyte. Comparisons have been made across the three approaches for 14 graphite and nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide electrodes. Analysis suggests that if the tortuosity factor were characterized based on the active material skeleton only, the actual tortuosities would be 1.35-1.81 times higher for calendered electrodes. Correlations are provided for varying porosity, CBD phase interfacial arrangement and solid particle morphology. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Typically used in commercial supercapacitors, porous carbons, although they provide a stable and reliable performance, lack volumetric performance because of their inherently low density and moderate capacitances. Here we report a high-performing electrode based on conductive hexaaminobenzene (HAB)-derived two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In addition to possessing a high packing density and hierarchical porous structure, these MOFs also exhibit excellent chemical stability in both acidic and basic aqueous solutions, which is in sharp contrast to conventional MOFs. Submillimetre-thick pellets of HAB MOFs showed high volumetric capacitances up to 760 F cm(-3) and high areal capacitances over 20 F cm(-2). Furthermore, the HAB MOF electrodes exhibited highly reversible redox behaviours and good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 90% after 12,000 cycles. These promising results demonstrate the potential of using redox-active conductive MOFs in energy-storage applications.","Nature Publishing Group","","SLAC National Accelerator Lab., Menlo Park, CA (United States); Argonne National Lab.

The LSCO layer was used as an electrically conducting buffer layer for electrochemical testing. The LMO and LSCO layers were both epitaxial, with sub-nano flat LMO/LSCO interfaces as seen by X-ray diffraction, synchrotron X-ray scattering, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), but with a large LMO surface roughness due to the relatively large lattice mismatch with LSCO. Three-dimensional islands and depressions were formed on the strain-relaxed LMO layer, and misfit dislocations at the LMO/LSCO interface were discerned through HRTEM imaging, suggesting a Stranski–Krastanov (SK) mode thin-film growth. A crystalline structural change from cubic spinel at the LMO surface and interior to tetragonal oxygen-deficient LMO at the LMO/LSCO interface was examined. Furthermore, electrochemical tests along with <em>in situ</em> synchrotron X-ray scattering measurements on the epitaxial LMO/LSCO bilayers showed a significant loss of capacity after the first cycle, which was attributed to an electrical conductivity loss of the LSCO buffer layer due to irreversible lattice oxygen loss.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

Electrochemical characterization of the 20 nm thick thin silicon film revealed a very low first cycle Coulombic efficiency, which can be attributed to the silicon oxide layer formed on both the surface of the as-deposited Si thin film and the interface between the Si and the substrate. Among the investigated films, the 100 nm Si thin film demonstrated the best performance in terms of first cycle efficiency and cycle life. Observations from scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the generation of cracks was inevitable in the cycled Si thin films, even as the thickness of the film was as little as 20 nm, which was not predicted by previous modeling work. However, the cycling performance of the 20 and 100 nm silicon thin films was not detrimentally affected by these cracks. Lastly, the poor capacity retention of the 1 mu m silicon thin film was attributed to the delamination.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.

The high capital costs of HRSs and the consequent high investment risk are deterring growth of the infrastructure needed to promote the deployment of FCEVs. Stations supplied by gaseous hydrogen will be necessary for FCEV deployment in both the near and long term. Here, the two-tier pressure consolidation method enhances gaseous HRSs in the following ways: (1) reduces the capital cost compared with conventional stations, as well as those operating according to the original pressure consolidation approach described by Elgowainy et al. (2014) [1], (2) minimizes pressure cycling of HRS supply storage relative to the original pressure consolidation approach; and (3) increases use of the station’s supply storage (or delivered tube-trailers) while maintaining higher state-of-charge vehicle fills.","Elsevier","","Argonne National Lab.

Here, <em>operando</em> X-ray reflectivity (low- and high-angle) is used to study the structure and morphology of epitaxial LMO (111) thin film cathodes undergoing lithium insertion and extraction to understand the inter-relationships between biaxial strain and Mn-dissolution. The initially strain-relieved LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> films generate in-plane tensile and compressive strains for delithiated (x < 1) and overlithiated (x > 1) charge states, respectively. The results reveal reversible Li insertion into LMO with no measurable Mn-loss for 0 < x < 1, as expected. In contrast, deeper discharge (x > 1) reveals Mn loss from LMO along with dramatic changes in the intensity of the (111) Bragg peak that cannot be explained by Li stoichiometry. These results reveal a partially reversible site reorganization of Mn ions ithin the LMO film that is not seen in bulk reactions and indicates a transition in Mn-layer toichiometry from 3:1 to 2:2 in alternating cation planes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that compressive strains (at x = 2) stabilize LMO structures with 2:2 Mn site distributions, therefore providing new insights into the role of lattice strain in the stability of LMO.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRC) (United States).

However, the structural relation between lepidocrocite and the underneath substrate is not fully resolved, which is essential to understand its growth mechanism. Here, we observed the formation of iron oxyhydroxide layers having distinct morphologies during the dissolution of calcite in acidic Fe(II)-rich solutions. A pseudomorphic lepidocrocite shell together with multiple iron oxyhydroxide layers encapsulated within the shell was imaged by optical and transmission X-ray microscopy. The presence of several nm thick ordered lepidocrocite films was resolved by X-ray reflectivity, with the lepidocrocite (100) plane oriented parallel to the calcite (104) surface normal direction. Lath-shaped lepidocrocite aggregates formed during the initial precipitation, and these eventually grew into clusters of parallel platy crystals. The formation of nanometer thick well-ordered lepidocrocite films on pristine calcite surfaces appears critical for the subsequent pseudomorphic growth. As a result, this growth mechanism yields the potential of using carbonate minerals as templates for pseudomorphic synthesis of iron oxyhydroxides in complex morphologies.","American Chemical Society (ACS)","","Argonne National Lab.
